 HUNGARY
 Hungary is governed by a Communist political apparatus which
 has measurably evolved from that imposed by the Soviet Union
 following World War II. Over the past year, this metamorphosis
 has proceeded at stepped-up pace. While the apparatus is
 seeking to maintain ultimate political power for the Communist
 party, the degree of the party's control has eroded, and there
 was some movement toward a greater degree of openness. The
 Hungarian Socialist Workers' (Communist) Party (HSWP) is
 headed by General Secretary Karoly Grosz, who succeeded Janos
 Kadar in May. Grosz was concurrently Chairman of the Council
 of Ministers (head of the national government) until November
 when he was succeeded in this position by Miklos Nemeth. The
 Hungarian Parliament, a single chamber legislature, has been a
 site for limited public debate. However, Hungary has not yet
 evolved public institutions which have proved capable of
 overruling specific actions or proposals of the party or
 government.
 The secret police and other coercive institutions are active
 and powerful, but their obtrusive deployment has become
 infrequent in recent years. The police, however, intervened
 vigorously in a show of force in an attempt to break up the
 democratic opposition's June 16 public commemoration of the
 1958 hanging of former Prime Minister Imre Nagy. In addition,
 police prevented the demonstration planned for October 23 to
 mark the beginning of the 1956 Hungarian revolution, as well
 as a November 15 demonstration at the Romanian Embassy
 expressing solidarity with the Romanian people and concern
 over the situation of Romania's Hungarian minority. The
 Soviet Union has over 60,000 troops stationed in Hungary.
 Hungarian economic problems include a substantial foreign debt
 of $18 billion (for a population of 10.6 million), trade and
 budget deficits, and inflation of between 20 and 25 percent
 compared with wage increases of about 3 percent in state
 industries. The Government, still committed to tolerance and
 innovation in its internal economic and political arrangements
 used to maintain control, faces conflicting demands within
 Hungarian society. Initial steps towards a more open market
 economy, such as closing down unprofitable enterprises, have
 already caused some unemployment, and the first officially
 publicized strikes took place with the endorsement of the
 official unions.
 There was significant progress in 1988 in Hungary's human
 rights record. Unofficial groups organized the largest
 peaceful demonstrations in more than 30 years. An independent
 scientific and technical workers' union was formed which is
 effectively negotiating on behalf of its members. An
 independent youth organization was founded, as were several
 new opposition groupings. Opposition meetings and samizdat
 (self-publishing) activities continued, for the most part,
 without official disruption. The new passport law, which came
 into effect in 1988, made it possible for 2.5 million
 Hungarians, as of September 30, to obtain new passports valid
 for worldwide travel. Nevertheless, some of the human rights
 gains registered in 1988 are tentative and easily reversible
 by the regime, which has held back from key decisions
 regarding the future role of the Communist party and the
 degree of representative democracy to be allowed in Hungary.

 HUNGARY
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no evidence that killing for political reasons
 occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 No known instances of torture have occurred in recent years.
 Citizens, in principle, may bring complaints against the
 police.
 There are three levels of punitive incarceration in Hungary:
 "workhouse," which allows some privileges, such as visiting,
 outside work, and leave; "jail," which is more punitive; and
 "prison", which means a maximum-security penitentiary. With
 varying degrees of frequency, depending on levels of
 imprisonment, prisoners have rights to visitation by family
 members, other relatives, and friends. While there does not
 appear to be systematic mistreatment of prisoners, there are
 possible exceptions. There have been continuing reports that
 Zsolt Keszthelyi, who was sentenced in April 1987 to 36
 months' imprisonment (reduced on appeal to 30 months) for
 refusing compulsory military service on political grounds, was
 beaten while in custody.
 The Hungarian authorities have rarely engaged in abuse of
 psychiatry, i.e., the commitment of sane persons to
 institutions for the mentally ill as a form of punishment.
 Laszlo Rusai, a 32-year old former teacher from the town of
 Hatvan with a record of dissident activity, was arrested in
 November 1987, apparently on suspicion of having defaced a
 Soviet memorial. He was held in solitary confinement for 2
 weeks in Eger and then detained involuntarily, following a
 psychiatric examination, in the psychiatric wing of Budapest
 prison. There, Rusai was reportedly placed under care of a
 doctor whom Rusai had denounced during a previous involuntary
 psychiatric confinement, which included electric shock
 treatment, in 1986. In the spring of 1988, following Amnesty
 International's adoption of the case and an informal approach
 by the Embassy, Rusai was transferred to a Budapest
 psychiatric clinic where conditions appear to be medically
 satisfactory.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Citizens are generally not subject to arbitrary arrest. Upon
 arrest, a detainee must be informed in writing of the offense
 he or she is suspected of having committed and may be held at
 a police station for a maximum of 72 hours before charges must
 be filed. There is no right of bail or provisional pretrial
 liberty. One case of police violation of arrest procedures
 came to public attention during 1988.
 On March 14, police appeared at the apartment of dissident
 Miklos Haraszti to call him in for questioning. He declined
 
 
 1085
 HUNGARY
 on grounds that there was no warrant or summons. The police
 then reappeared with a summons convoking Haraszti in relation
 to a crime. He declined, pointing out that no crime had been
 committed and that police had earlier said their chief just
 wanted to talk to him. Haraszti was then handcuffed, beaten
 with truncheons, and shoved into a police car. He was
 questioned at the police station about his attendance at the
 Social Democratic Party conference in Bonn and about an
 interview he had given on Radio Free Europe March 11, in which
 he discussed the Hungarian opposition's planned March 15
 demonstrations.
 The Hungarian penal code contains a law on incitement which
 permits officials to prosecute for a wide range of utterances
 or statements. It is not clear how many cases of incitement
 involve political matters. Gyula Kristaly, a 61-year-old
 retired steelworker from the industrial city of Ozd, in
 northeast Hungary, was convicted under this statute and
 sentenced in April to 3 years' imprisonment for distributing
 some 200 typed leaflets in ozd and Miskolc which criticized
 the Government's economic policies. Kristaly was released
 pending appeal. On August 30, an appeal court confirmed his
 conviction but suspended his sentence to 4 years' probation.
 The appeal hearing was attended by Amnesty International
 observers from Austria and Yugoslavia as well as opposition
 activists from Budapest. Kristaly attracted the sympathetic
 attention of the national press, which ran a detailed, factual
 account of the case and disclosed that it was 1 of 39
 proceedings for anti-State activities initiated in 1987. The
 press did not reveal any information about the other 38.
 There is no evidence that exile is used as a means for
 political control. With regard to forced or compulsory labor,
 see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are few closed trials in Hungary. The Constitution
 stipulates that all court proceedings are open, except for
 cases specifically exempted by law. Those which are closed
 usually involve "national security," which is not otherwise
 defined. In general, judicial procedures are investigatory
 rather than adversarial in nature. There is no trial by
 jury. Defendants have the right to choose their own counsel.
 Despite some modest progress, the Hungarian judiciary remains
 subject to party control; the Supreme Court has limited
 authority to direct the Government to refrain from all acts
 against persons. In mid-1988 the Justice Minister, tasked
 with preparing a new draft constitution, was devising plans to
 overhaul the legal system to enhance the independence of the
 judiciary. Within the regular court system, there are courts
 of "first instance" with rights of appeal to courts of "second
 instance." A dwindling number of what are, by Western
 standards, political offenses are cause for prosecution in
 Hungary. No one in 1988 was sentenced for longer than 3 years
 for political offenses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for citizens' personal freedom and
 inviolability, the secrecy of correspondence, and the privacy
 of the home, but these provisions are violated when the State
 believes it is in its interest to do so. Search warrants are
 
 
 1086
 HUNGARY
 generally obtained. House searches are conducted by a court
 order and must be carried out in the presence of two
 witnesses. A written inventory of items removed from the
 premises must be prepared. These procedures were adhered to
 in the course of the police raids against samizdat publishers
 which occurred in the first half of 1988 (see Section 2.a.).
 Since the 1960's, Hungarian authorities have become more
 tolerant with respect to a person's private activities.
 Formal systems for gathering personal information, such as the
 widespread use of informers and block wardens and overt
 intrusions of the police into daily life, have been
 substantially curtailed. It is widely assumed, however, that
 the authorities tap private telephone lines and open
 correspondence when they wish to do so.
 Hungarians may subscribe to Western publications although such
 subscriptions are relatively expensive. Parents who provide
 religious instruction to their children at home are not
 harassed. Pressure to join the Communist party or party youth
 and other organizations abated markedly in 1988, though the
 absence of membership may still have an adverse impact upon
 career possibilities in some fields. Nonetheless, membership
 in the official youth organization, KISZ, has declined
 substantially, particularly among university students.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for free speech and a free press,
 but these provisions are qualified by the need to conform to
 the "interests of socialism and the people." The Government
 permitted more latitude in freedom of expression during 1988.
 The 1956 events were the subject of three feature films and a
 documentary at the February 1988 Budapest Film Festival and
 played an important part in two other feature films. While
 these productions were somewhat equivocal, some, like the Pal
 Schiffer/Balint Magyar documentary "Dunanal" contained
 substantial, painful doses of truth. This film was shown on
 primetime Hungarian television in December.
 The Hungarian opposition's public commemoration of the June 16
 hanging of Imre Nagy triggered massive police deployment and
 confrontation. The authorities, however, sanctioned a
 ceremony at Nagy's unmarked gravesite and a church service.
 They also sanctioned, on unspecified conditions, the
 exhumation of Nagy's body and its reburial in a marked grave,
 another step toward his eventual rehabilitation. As of year's
 end, although the authorities had apparently initiated the
 process of identifying gravesites and bodies, the exhumation
 and reburial had not yet occurred. During the second half of
 1988, as part of the selective rehabilitation of Nagy, the
 recollections of Andras Hegedus--who preceded Nagy as Prime
 Minister and signed the document "requesting" Soviet
 intervention in 1956--were published serially and as a book.
 On the anniversary of the Hungarian revolution of March 15,
 1848, the official media for the first time gave attention to
 an opposition event, although their reports were distorted.
 At year's end, however, straightforward official press
 reporting of opposition meetings and issues had become
 routine.
 
 
 1087
 HUNGARY
 During the year, the regime appeared to chanye its policy on
 discouraging samizdat publishing. In early March, police
 raided seven dissidents' apartments, ostensibly seeking
 "inflammatory" leaflets on the eve of the opposition's planned
 March 15 demonstrations. Police seized 10 typewriters, a word
 processor, large quantities of samizdat books, and an entire
 press run of the samizdat journal "magyar Zsido" (Hungarian
 Jew). The leaflets, headed "What Do We Want?", were based on
 the 12 points proclaimed during the Revolution of 1948. Inter
 alia, the leaflets called for Soviet troop withdrawal from
 Hungary "taking into account the Soviet Union's rightful
 interest of self-defense," independent and democratic labor
 unions, and alternative service for conscientious objectors.
 In May police returned the typewriters and word processor,
 which had been legally imported into Hungary. Later in the
 year, there was no recurrence of police raids against samizdat
 publishers. Several Hungarian officials said they did not
 perceive most of the country's established samizdat journals
 as a problem. Some prominent figures in the regime advocated
 the formal legalization of samizdat. In late 1988 along with
 the proliferation of clubs and proto parties, a number of
 independent or quasi-independent publications, e.g., Reform,
 Kapu (Gate), and Hitel (Credit), were allowed to appear.
 Party and government authorities continued to monitor the
 press, radio, and television, all of which are government
 owned. However, the official Hungarian media have expanded
 their coverage, including limited television coverage, of
 controversial subjects, reporting meetings of the Hungarian
 Democratic Forum, popular demonstrations about the status of
 Romania's Hungarian minority, and opposition to the Bos-
 Nagymaros dam project on the Danube, the trial of retired
 steelworker Gyula Kristaly cited above, and Central Committee
 (CC) meetings.
 In terms of media access, the May 20-22 National Party
 Conference, at which Karoly Grosz replaced Janos Kadar as HWSP
 General Secretary, was notably open. There was extensive
 national television coverage; the entire plenary proceedings
 were viewed by journalists on closed-circuit television, and
 leading political figures made themselves available for
 informal press conferences. In September, the first edition
 of the independent journal Reform carried the first detailed
 Hungarian media account of the Conrad spy case which involved
 transmission of NATO military secrets via two ethnic Hungarians
 living in Sweden. Further, the official press reported the
 position of the Independent Scientific and Technical Workers'
 Union on inflation and economic management, although the
 Union's existence had not been legalized. Similarly, the
 wide-circulation weekly HVG in September reported the views of
 the independent youtr group FIDESZ, although the organization's
 legality had not yet been officially established.
 Film enjoys the greatest degree of freedom of political
 expression. Significantly, Hungarian films are produced before
 undergoing governmental review for public showing. This means
 that the making of controversial films is not prohibited;
 however, one film--a documentary interview on politics in the
 1950's--is currently banned from public viewing.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 the right to form associations, government approval or tacit
 acceptance is required for the exercise of such rights. Legal
 
 
 1088
 HUNGARY
 norms came under public scrutiny when the Government on August
 27 unveiled its draft laws on assembly and association.
 During the autumn and early winter, however, the drafts
 underwent substantial unpublicized revision.
 As initially publicized, the draft laws contain similar legal
 tests for assemblies and associations, disallowing those
 "which may violate the security of the State, public order,
 public morals, or may result in the violation of public health
 or the rights and freedom of others." The drafts further
 define activities violating the security of the State, public
 security, and public order to include "activities which may
 endanger the independence, territory, and alliance system of
 the Hungarian People's Republic." An opposition document
 which circulated in September criticized the catchall nature
 of these tests, which have apparently been revised.
 The draft law on assembly provides that 5 days' notice be
 given for public gatherings, which the police may ban. This
 procedure was followed in the major Budapest demonstrations of
 March 15, June 27, and September 12. The latest available
 version of the draft law calls for only 3 days' advance
 notice, a procedure followed prior to the October 23
 demonstration. However, the Government's actions in banning
 the November 15 demonstration near the Romanian Embassy did
 not conform to the draft law on assembly, and, in defending
 the Government's decision in Parliament, Interior Minister
 Horvath cited hitherto unknown statutes.
 During 1988 the regime's posture on public assemblies was
 mixed. On March 15, the anniversary of the 1848 Revolution,
 8,000 people demonstrated in the streets at several sites with
 official foreknowledge. The police detained eight opposition
 figures during the day but otherwise displayed restraint. The
 authorities used loudspeakers blaring patriotic music to
 interfere with speechmaking, but dissident Gaspar Miklos Tamas
 delivered a speech in front of the National Assembly calling
 for freedom of speech and the press, the resignation of the
 Communist Government, and free elections.
 For the opposition's June 16 commemoration of Imre Nagy's
 hanging, the authorities permitted a gravesite ceremony and a
 church service, but deployed overwhelming police forces and
 used confrontational tactics against a public demonstration in
 Budapest by some 500 opposition activists. As in March,
 police briefly detained opposition leaders. In dealing with
 the demonstrators, police arrested about 10 persons, charged
 the crowd with motorcycles after it had begun to disperse, and
 employed excessive force against some demonstrators. Samizdat
 publisher Gabor Demszky and his wife Roza Hodosan were beaten
 after being taken into custody, and police kicked Gabor
 Bouquet, a worker, in the back and briefly detained him.
 After banning a planned silent demonstration to mark the start
 of the 1956 revolution on October 23, authorities deployed
 large numbers of police, substantially outnumbering the
 demonstrators, to prevent and break up activities. No
 violence was reported. One person was briefly detained for
 singing the national anthem and refusing to leave. Hungarian
 police harassed and detained 19 young men after they
 demonstrated in Budapest's Vorosmarty Square against the
 celebration in Hungary of the Soviet November 7 anniversary.
 One of the demonstrators, Tamas Kiss, required medical
 attention after being hit in the head by a police truncheon at
 the demonstration, but 1 week later he appeared fully
 
 
 1089
 HUNGARY
 recovered. The banned demonstration near the Romanian Embassy
 on November 15, resulted in 3 demonstrators requiring medical
 attention and another requiring several days' hospitalization
 for head injuries. One of the founders of the organization of
 Romanian refugees in Hungary, Virgil Parvu, was shortly
 afterwards expelled from Hungary to the West.
 Other demonstrations in 1988 fell within the bounds of
 official tolerance. On September 12, 15,000 people in
 Budapest demanded that construction of the Bos-Nagymaros dam
 project on the Danube be halted because of its probable
 environmental damage and questionable economic rationale. On
 June 27, up to 50,000 people, with official permission,
 marched past the Romanian Embassy to protest planned Romanian
 demolition of Transylvanian villages in which members of the
 Hungarian minority live. Two other minor demonstrations in
 1988 were also directed at the Romanian Government's treatment
 of Transylvanian Magyars. None of these demonstrations would
 have been tolerated 2 years ago.
 It is not yet clear how the new law on associations may affect
 the formation and functioning of independent groupings.
 Justice Minister Kulcsar disclosed November 10 that, under the
 draft law on association, "private persons and legal entities
 may set up political parties, trade unions, interest
 representations, and other social organizations." At the same
 time, Kulcsar indicated that legal establishment of new
 parties would have to await the adoption of a new law on
 parties, as well as the adoption of a new Hungarian
 constitution in the spring of 1990 to replace the Stalin-era
 Constitution of 1949.
 Under the regime's attitude of forbearance, numerous
 unofficial groupings were launched in 1988. The Hungarian
 Democratic Forum, representing various opposition tendencies,
 was tolerated early in 1988 and gradually institutionalized
 itself. Although four prominent persons were expelled from
 the party in April for participating in the Democratic Forum,
 official journalists later in the year reported on Democratic
 Forum meetings in the official media. An independent youth
 organization (FIDESZ) and the Independent Union of Scientific
 and Technical Workers (TDDSZ) were bfficially launched despite
 initial official discouragement and the standard ideological
 views that KISZ, the ailing official youth organization, and
 SZOT, the official trade union federation, are the exclusive
 representatives of youth and workers respectively. Another
 opposition group, the Network of Free Initiatives, attracted
 over 2,000 associates although it broke into two parts in
 November, the main group continuing as the Association of Free
 Democrats.
 Party and government officials met privately with the new
 independent organizations and developed a cautious dialog with
 them.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although freedom of conscience and freedom of religious
 practice are affirmed in the Constitution, they are subject to
 restrictions. The State in principle opposes but does not
 rigorously impede the practice of religion. The authorities
 profess the acceptability of believers and nonbelievers
 
 
 1090
 HUNGARY
 working together in the interest of "Socialist society."
 Virtually all major denominations--the Mormon Church most
 recently--are now officially recognized. The Government has
 generally maintained good relations with the hierarchies of
 the major religious denominations, many of which have
 representatives in Parliament. The profession of religious
 beliefs, however, can limit a person's advancement in
 government, industry, and the professions. Party members and
 those in the teaching professions are not allowed to be active
 believers.
 There have been reports of official discrimination against the
 Faith Church, a charismatic Christian group known until 1985
 as the Assembly of God. The Faith Church, which has some
 1,000 adherents in Hungary, has been denied official
 registration, while church activists have reportedly been
 subject to occasional police harassment and job sanctions.
 Religious denominations in Hungary have generally good access
 to religious materials, including Bibles and prayer books. In
 many cases, they print their own. They also publish
 periodicals and newspapers. An International Bible Society
 Conference took place in Hungary during the summer. The State
 sets numerical limits and imposes censorship on books, but for
 some smaller denominations the main limiting factor is money.
 Various reformed churches became a focal point for public
 collection and distribution of assistance to refugees from
 Romania during 1988.
 Churches do not act as organizing centers for dissent.
 However, a growing number of primarily young believers have
 formed loosely affiliated, grass-roots organizations called
 "basic communities," which function outside or on the
 periphery of official church structures. The authorities have
 not detained or arrested clergy. Officially, 159 young men
 are serving prison terms ranging up to 3 years for refusing
 obligatory military service for religious reasons. According
 to official press reports, this group consists of 146
 Jehovah's Witnesses, 1 Nazarene, 6 Catholics, 2 Adventists, 2
 who gave no reason, and 2 who cited political considerations.
 The right of conscientious objection to military service is
 broadly recognized for two denominations, the Nazarenes and
 the Seventh-Day Adventists, because conscientious objection is
 a precept of these religions. The issue, which has been
 actively pushed by the democratic opposition, has also been
 debated within the regime. At midyear the authorities
 disclosed that, in the future, forms of alternative service
 would be made more broadly available. However, the official
 statement did not address the situation of the 159 young men
 presently incarcerated, or affect young men currently up for
 induction into the armed forces.
 During 1988 the State Office of Religious Affairs and the
 principal Hungarian denominations continued an active dialogue
 with Western religious groups and leaders. The Government
 worked constructively with an American Jewish organization
 charged with preserving Jewish cemeteries, and planning began
 for another Billy Graham crusade in Hungary. The authorities
 invited Pope John Paul II to visit Hungary, and an estimated
 50,000 Hungarian Catholics traveled to Austria to participate
 in the Pope's June 23-24 visit to the village of Darazsfalva.
 Notable events for the Hungarian Jewish community included
 Israeli Prime Minister Shamir's September 13-15 visit to
 Budapest, and the Emanuel Foundation's July 2 dedication of a
 
 
 1091
 HUNGARY
 holocaust memorial in the courtyard of Budapest's main
 synagogue.
 The major religions have theological training institutes,
 though limits are imposed on the number of seminarians. The
 State permits construction of some new places of worship. In
 the last 20 years, approximately 50 new Baptist churches have
 been built in Hungary. The Baptist construction, partially
 funded by overseas contributions, also points to close
 connections Hungarians maintain with their coreligionists and
 hierarchies in other countries. Religious leaders may
 generally travel abroad so long as they have adequate hard
 currency resources for the purpose.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All adult citizens are issued an identity booklet which they
 must carry at all times. They must register with local police
 when moving from one locality to another. However, no
 permission is required for moving within Hungary. except to
 Budapest, where overcrowding has led the Government to
 restrict the number of new inhabitants.
 The new passport law, which came into effect January 1, 1988,
 considerably eased international travel for almost all
 Hungarians. For the first time in a Communist country,
 passports valid for worldwide travel became available on
 demand for nearly all citizens. Some 2.5 million new
 passports were issued in the first 9 months of 1988. Through
 the end of September, Hungarians made 7,677,328 trips abroad,
 including 1,715,513 departures through or to Austria for a
 threefold increase over the previous year. Under the new law,
 the principal impediment to foreign travel became legal
 possession of the equivalent of $60 in hard currency. Through
 September, Hungarian tourists in Austria spent the equivalent
 of $413 million, and some $40 million over the November 7
 holiday weekend.
 According to official statistics, 5,891 passport applications
 were denied through September 30 for various reasons. During
 July 19-27, five persons who had been denied passports, plus
 three sympathizers, went on a hunger strike in a Budapest
 apartment timed to coincide with General Secretary Grosz'
 visit to the United States. Four of the hunger strikers had
 been denied passports for "severely violating the laws of the
 Hungarian People's Republic" while on previous trips abroad.
 These "severe violations" included articles published in U.S.
 newspapers and interviews given to Radio Free Europe. The
 fifth hunger striker was one of 500 people officially estimated
 to be barred from obtaining passports on grounds of "illegal
 acts' committed in 1956. In August passports were issued to
 all five hunger strikers, and the Justice Ministry announced
 proposals to eliminate the passport disability for 1956
 offenders through case by case litigation or a general
 amnesty. The Government's official daily, Magyar Hirlap, ran
 an accurate and even sympathetic account of the hunger strike
 on August 2.
 The rules for legal emigration have also been substantially
 relaxed, although they still do not permit completely free
 emigration. A Hungarian can claim a right to emigrate only
 for family reunification, to join a family member (including a
 grandparent), as well as to join a first degree family member
 or spouse. It is required that the prospective emigrant:
 
 
 1092
 HUNGARY
 have no debts; have a guarantee of support or other financial
 arrangements in the new country; be exempted from or have
 fulfilled any military service obligation; and not be a
 criminal. It is also required that his or her emigration
 present no security risks to Hungary. Technically, permission
 to join a relative abroad may be refused, if the relative is
 abroad without permission from the Government, until 5 years
 have passed since that person's departure. The law provides
 for exceptions to all restrictions in individual cases, and
 persons who are refused permission to emigrate may appeal and
 reapply. Reapplications are often successful, especially if
 there are special humanitarian considerations. There have
 been no pending cases of family reunification since 1986.
 Emigration permission is virtually guaranteed to any Hungarian
 over 55 years of age.
 Those who do not receive permission to emigrate normally
 suffer no official sanctions, such as loss of employment or
 housing. Emigrants are allowed to take a modest amount of
 personal property with them. Persons who have emigrated
 legally from Hungary may apply to return for resettlement, but
 the right to return is not guaranteed. They must establish
 that there is housing and employment or other income available
 to them. Persons who have left Hungary illegally or who have
 defected may be subject to criminal penalties. Under the law,
 such persons may be tried in absentia and sentenced to the
 confiscation of their property and a suspended jail term of up
 to 3 years. In practice, these provisions appear not to have
 been applied for some years. Those charged with minor
 travel-related infractions may be denied permission to travel
 abroad for up to 5 years.
 Since late 1987, Hungary has offered refuge to over 20,000
 persons from Romania. The flow continues; most of them are
 ethnic Hungarians citing overall bleak economic conditions,
 professional and job-related discrimination against
 Hungarians, the repressive and ultranationalistic political
 climate in that country, and a related decline in
 opportunities for Hungarian-language education and cultural
 expression in Romania. A limited number of them--less than 10
 percent--are ethnic Romanians. Assistance efforts have been
 organized through local government bodies, the Hungarian Red
 Cross, and churches. The Hungarian Government has repeatedly
 come under domestic criticism--most seriously in January--for
 forcibly repatriating Romanians. A limited number of
 involuntary repatriations continues. Officials say the
 repatriations are with cause, including criminal records;
 opposition groups and some refugees say that ethnic Romanians
 and Gypsies are most liable to involuntary repatriation.
 People thus returned are reportedly subject, in Romania, to
 beatings, jail sentences, work without pay, and forfeiture of
 property.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Hungarian political system is dominated by the leadership
 of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. Citizens are not
 free, under the law, to change their political leaders or the
 system of government. In practice, debate within the
 leadership has become more open and subject to a measure of
 spontaneity. Party leaders remain preoccupied by the need to
 redefine the leading role of the Party. Many of them believe
 the Party should have dominant but not absolute authority and
 should withdraw from operational functions of the system.

 HUNGARY
 Parliamentary elections occur every 5 years. In the last
 election, in 1985, most parliamentary candidacies were
 contested, and 12 out of 386 were elected independently of the
 HWSP and party-controlled Patriotic People's Front. Election
 is ostensibly by secret ballot, although there are substantial
 questions about counting and mechanics. In the past year,
 parliamentary debates have become somewhat more active, and
 some procedural scope has been given to members who disagree
 with or seek to modify government proposals.
 The role of women in political life is limited. Currently, 18
 members of the 108-member Central Committee are women; also,
 2 of the 11 Politburo members, 81 of the 386 members of
 Parliament, and 1 of Hungary's 19 county party first
 secretaries are women. Men substantially outnumber women in
 opposition councils as well, although in September feminists
 staged a demonstration against the Bos-Nagymaros dam.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government shows continued sensitivity concerning outside
 charges or investigations of alleged human rights violations.
 In practice, it has taken steps to accommodate Western
 concerns in some cases (as with Laszlo Rusai's psychiatric
 detention and the trial of Gyula Kristaly, at which Amnesty
 International (AI) observers were allowed). The authorities
 have, however, rebuffed Western interest in the situation of
 jailed conscientious objectors like Zsolt Keszthely. They
 agreed to the September 6 Budapest rock concert for human
 righls, which was sponsored by AI and included performances by
 Bruce Springsteen and Sting.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Both in theory and in practice, Hungary is sensitive and
 responsive to the cultural aspirations of its recognized
 ethnic minorities. Schools providing instruction in the
 mother tongue and varieties of ethnic expression are
 encouraged on a nondiscriminatory basis. A major reason for
 this policy is the hope of creating a "demonstration effect"
 which will indirectly benefit the millions of Hungarians
 living as minorities in adjacent countries. Although national
 minority groups are encouraged to form their own associations,
 nonnational groups do not enjoy the same degree of freedom.
 A large number of Gypsies (estimates range up to 5 percent of
 the population) live in Hungary. Although they are not
 recognized as an official minority, the Government engages in
 many programs specifically designed to raise their standard of
 living and to help them to be absorbed into the mainstream of
 Hungarian life. However, Gypsies are, on the average,
 considerably less well educated and poorer than the majority
 Magyar population or the recognized ethnic minorities. Candid
 discussion continues to appear in the press and specialized
 lfterature about the social and economic difficulties
 experienced by Gypsies, including the fact that considerable
 popular prejudice against them exists.
 Women account for one-eighth of the management positions in
 industry and agriculture. Approximately half of them attained
 these positions in the past 5 years. Women's share of senior
 positions, such as general director at state industrial
 
 
 1094
 HUNGARY
 complexes, is considerably lower. Women's share of
 professional positions has been increasing. About 8 percent
 of women are professionals, compared to nearly 9 percent of
 men.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Legal norms and actual practice in the organization of trade
 unions are in flux. The official trade union organization,
 SZOT, is under substantial pressure from several directions.
 SZOT membership in 1988 fell off by some 400,000, or nearly 10
 percent, as workers were given the option of declining to
 allow automatic withholding of union dues from their pay. In
 theory, SZOT remains the exclusive legal representative of
 workers in Hungary, and some 90 percent of Hungary's 4.5
 million employed persons are members of SZOT's 19 affiliated
 unions. SZOT remains subject to party and government control
 through a variety of channels. Sandor Nagy and the new SZOT
 leadership, which took over in late May, are taking steps,
 including selective endorsement of strikes, to shore up SZOT's
 standing among its membership. SZOT is affiliated with the
 World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Hungary's first independent union, a grouping of scientific
 and technical workers (TDDSZ), was launched in the spring of
 1988 and has succeeded in establishing itself as an
 institutional force. TDDSZ officials have dealt with senior
 government figures. There is evidence of employers dealing
 with both SZOT-affiliated unions and TDDSZ in negotiating
 labor contracts. TDDSZ policy positions have been reported in
 the national press. More recently two additional white-collar
 independent'unions have been formed (teachers and motion
 picture employees, with prospective groupings of lawyers and
 journalists). Despite official tolerance of the independent
 white-collar unions, it is clear from episodes like the
 conviction (with suspended sentence) of retired steelworker
 Gyula Kristaly for "incitement" (i.e., circulating pamphlets
 advertising worker grievances) that the authorities remain
 apprehensive about formation of independent labor organizations
 among industrial workers and will continue to discourage their
 formation.
 SZOT and government leaders have been addressing the issue of
 conditions under which strikes are appropriate. Until August
 1988, no strikes were officially reported, although local work
 stoppages have occurred over issues like wages and work
 schedules.
 During August 23-24, about 1,700 Pecs coalminers participated
 in Hungary's first officially publicized, nationally televised
 work stoppage. The issue was income tax liability for
 bonuses. The strike was endorsed by the official miners'
 union. Along with two subsequent strikes, it suggested a
 pattern of authorized work stoppages which allow workers to
 let off steam, secure concessions, and strengthen the posture
 of the official unions in representing workers. Perhaps the
 most significant aspect of these publicized strikes was in
 beginning the process of educating workers and enterprise
 managers that strikes, under certain conditions, are a normal
 development.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In most of the Hungarian economy, wages are still centrally
 mandated and not subject to collective bargaining. Managers
 have some flexibility in- job categorization and in payment of
 allowances, which gives potential importance to worker-
 management discussions in individual enterprises. A 1988
 documentary film on industrial relations in a northeastern
 steel mill suggested that managers in some unprofitable, heavy
 industrial enterprises are able to use fear of unemployment
 among unskilled workers as a means of tightening labor
 discipline.
 Labor legislation and practice are uniform throughout the
 country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Criminal Code provides that persons having no visible
 means of support, who are convicted for the second-time within
 2 years of refusing to work, may be sentenced to 1 year's
 imprisonment, reformatory work, or a fine--or the judge can
 elect to expel the convicted person to another part of the
 country. More than 2,000 persons were reportedly convicted
 under this law in 1987; the vast majority of these persons
 were allegedly addicted to drugs, alcohol, gambling, or other
 dangerous lifestyles. Gypsies have been prosecuted under this
 law, but there is no evidence of its use against political
 dissidents.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 15 years. 'There are nor
 reports of significant abuses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Hungarian workplaces are obligated under law to provide
 workers with safe working conditions, a hot meal at heavily
 subsidized prices, and such pay-related benefits as overtime.
 The Government guarantees all Hungarians the right to 15 days
 of paid vacation per year and 1 additional day for each 3
 years of service. The minimum wage is equivalent to $57 per
 month at the official exchange rate, which is not sufficient
 to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and his
 family. The Government provides all workers with free health
 care and pensions. The average official workweek is
 approximately 45 hours, though most Hungarians supplement
 their incomes by working after hours in cooperatives and
 private second jobs. Many must do so in order to provide a
 decent standard of living for their families. Safety
 conditions in Hungarian firms are not up to U.S. standards,
 but the Government and employers work to ensure that work
 conditions meet international norms.
 Institutionalized unemployment has occurred as a result of
 efforts to restructure inefficient industry and rationalize
 labor resources. Workers who lose their jobs because of
 restructuring currently receive 100 percent of their wages for
 6 months, 75 percent for the next 3 months, and 60 percent for
 a further 6 months. Since April 1, these benefits have been
 paid out to redundant unemployed workers regardless of how
 many workers were fired in a single job action; previously, at
 least 10 workers had to be fired in a single job action in
 order to meet the definition of job loss due to restructuring.
