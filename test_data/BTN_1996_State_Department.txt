 BHUTAN
 Bhutan is a monarchy without a constitution or a bill of rights. The Wangchuk
 Dynasty of hereditary monarchs has ruled the country since 1907. King Jigme
 Sighye Wangchuk, on the throne since 1972, has continued efforts toward social
 any political modernization begun by his father. In recent years, there has been
 rapid progress in education, health sanitation, and communications, and an in-
 crease in elected representatives and their role in decisionmaking. The judiciary is
 not independent of the King.
 Three quarters of the population of 600,000 is composed of Buddhists with cul-
 tural traditions akin to those of Tibet. The remaining quarter of the population are
 mostly Hindus of Nepalese origin inhabiting the country's southern districts. The
 rapid growth of this ethnic Nepalese segment of the population led the Buddhist
 majority to fear for the survival of their culture. Government efforts to tighten citi-
 zenship requirements and control illegal immigration resulted in political protests
 and led to ethnic conflict and repression of ethnic Nepalese in southern districts
 during the late 1980's and early 1990's. Tens of thousands of ethnic Nepalese left
 Bhutan in 1991-92, many forcibly expelled. Approximately 91,000 ethnic Nepalese
 remain in refugee camps in Nepal an  upwards of 15,000 reside outside the camps
 in the Indian states of Assam and West Ben gal.
 The Royal Bhutan Police, assisted by the Royal Bhutan Army, including those as-
 signed to the Royal Body Guard, and a national militia, maintain internal security.
 Some members of these forces committed human rights abuses against ethnic Nepa-
 lese.
 The economy is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the main liveli-
 hood for 90 percent of the population and account for about half of the gross domes-
 tic product. Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal hus-
 bandry. Cardamon, citrus fruit, and spices are the leading agricultural exports. Ce-
 ment and electricity are the other important exports. Strong trade and monetary
 links align the economy closely to that of India. Hydroelectric power production po-
 tential and tourism are key resources, although the Government limits foreign tour-
 ist arrivals by means of pricing policies. The gross national product per capita is
 estimated to be $470. Bhutan remains among the poorest and least developed coun-
 tries in the world.
 The Government significantly restricts the rights of the Kingdom's citizens. The
 King exercises strong and active, although indirect, influence over the Government.
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. The Government discour-
 ages political parties, and none operates legally. Judges serve at the King's pleas-
 ure. There are no written criminal and civil procedure codes; judicial processes are
 based on traditional practices. Programs to build a body of written law and train
 lawyers are progressing. The Government restricts freedom of speech, the press, as-
 sembly, association, ani worker rights. There are significant limitations on the right
 to a fair trial, freedom of religion, and citizens' privacy. Private television reception
 has been banned since 1989. The Government has failed to reach agreement with
 the Government of Nepal on procedures for screening and repatriation of ethnic
 Nepalese in refugee camps. The Government claims that it has prosecuted govern-
 ment personnel for unspecified abuses committed in the early 1990's; however, pub-
 lic indications are that it has done little to investigate and prosecute security force
 officials responsible for torture and other abuses committed against ethnic Nepalese
 residents.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 According to the Center for the Treatment of Victims of Torture, numerous ethnic
 Nepalese refugees attempting to return to Bhutan were captured by security forces,
 tortured, and sent back across the border.
 Refugee groups credibly claim that persons detained as suspected dissidents in
 the early 1990s were tortured by security forces, who also committed acts of rape.
 During those years, the Government's ethnic policies and the crackdown on ethnic
 Nepalese political agitation created a climate of impunity in which the Government
 tacitly condoned the physical abuse of ethnic Nepalese. The Government denies
 these abuses but also claims it has investigated and prosecuted three government
 personnel for unspecified abuses of authority during that period. Details of these
 
 
 1430
 cases have not been made public and there is little indication that the Government
 has adequately investigated or punished any security force officials involved in the
 widespread abuses of 1989-92.
 Prison conditions are reportedly adequate if austere. A prison visit program begun
 in 1993 by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and opening of a
 new prison in Chemgang in 1994 contributed to substantial improvement in condi-
 tions of detention over the primitive conditions that existed until a few years ago.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Police Act of 1979, police may
 not arrest a person without a warrant and must produce an arrested person before
 a court within 24 hours of arrest, exclusive of travel time from place of arrest. Legal
 protections are incomplete, however, due to the lack of a fully elaborated criminal
 procedure code and deficiencies in police training and practice. Arbitrary arrest and
 detention remain a problem but are not routinely used as a form of harassment.
 There sometimes have been delays in informing family members of an arrest. In-
 communicado detention of auspected militants was a serious problem in 1991 and
 1992, but the initiation of ICR~C prison visits and estabishment of an ICRC mail
 service between detainees and family members has helped allay this problem. Of
 those detained in connection with political dissidence and violence in southern Bhu-
 tan in 1991-92, 1,685 were ultimately amnestied, 9 acquitted, and 46 released after
 serving their sentences, and 88 are serving prison sentences. As of October, charges
 were pending against two persons arrested for "anti-National activities" in southern
 Bhutan in 1996.
 Although the Government does not formally use exile as a form of punishment,
 many accused political dissidents freed under government amnesties say that they
 were released on the condition that they depart the country. Many of them subse-
 quently registered at refugee camps in Nepal.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There is no written constitution, and the judiciary
 is not independent of the King.
 The judicial system consists of district courts and a High Court in Thimphu.
 Judges are appointed by the King on the recommendation of the Chief Justice and
 may be removed by him. Minor offenses and administrative matters are adjudicated
 by village headmen.
 Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated under a legal code
 established in the 17th century and revised in 1965. For offenses against the State,
 state-appointed prosecutors file charges and prosecute cases. In other cases, the rel-
 evant organizations and departments of government file charges and conduct the
 prosecution. Defendants are supposed to be presented with written charges in lan-
 guages that they understand and given time to prepare their own defense. This
 practice is not always followed, however, according to some political dissidents. In
 cases where defendants cannot write their own defense, courts assign judicial offi-
 cers to assist defendants. A legal education program is gradually building a body
 of persons who have received formal training in the law abroad.
 Defendants have the right to appeal to the High Court and may make a final ap-
 peal to the King, who traditionally delegates the decision to the Royal Advisory
 Council. Trials are supposed to be conducted in open hearings, however, political
 dissidents claim that this is not always the case in practice.
 Questions of family law, such as marriage, divorce, and adoption, are resolved ac-
 cording to a citizen's religion: Buddhist tradition for the majority of the population
 and Hindu tradition, which predominates in areas inhabited by ethnic Nepalese, for
 the minority.
 Some or all of the 88 prisoners serving sentences for offenses related to political
 dissidence or violence, primarily by ethmc Nepalese during 1991-92, may be politi-
 cal prisoners.
 Tek-Nath Rizal, an ethnic Nepalese and internationally recognized political pris-
 oner, remained in prison following his 1993 conviction under the National Security
 Act for writing and distributing political pamphlets and attending political meet-
 ings. Nevertheless, a United Nations Human Rights Commission working group on
 arbitrary detention that visited Bhutan in 1994 at the Government's invitation de-
 termined that Rizal had received a fair trial and declared his detention "not to be
 arbitrary."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 are no laws providing for these rights. The Government requires all citizens, includ-
 ing minorities, to wear the traditional dress of the Drukpa majority when visiting
 Buddhist religious buildings, monasteries, government offices, and in schools and
 when attending official functions and public ceremonies. According to human rights
 groups police regularly conduct house to house searches for suspected dissidents
 without explanati n or legal justification.
 
 
 1431
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government restricts freedom of speech
 and the press.
 The country's only regular publication is Kuensel, a weekly newspaper with a cir-
 culation of 10,000 published by an independent corporation that receives govern-
 ment subsidies. Kuensel, which publishes simultaneous editions in the English,
 Dzongkha, and Nepali languages, supports the Government but does occasionally re-
 port criticism of the King and government policies in the National Assembly. Indian
 and other foreign newspapers are available.
 The Government bans all private television reception in the country. Since 1989
 all television antennas and satellite receiving dishes have been ordered dismantled.
 The Government radio station broadcasts each day in the four major languages
 (Dzongka, Nepali, English, and Sharchop).
 Engl    is the medium of instruction in schools and the national language,
 Dzongkha, is taught as second language. The teaching of Nepali as a second lan-
 guage was discontinued in 1990.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associaton.-The Goverment restricts free-
 dom of assembly and association. Citizens may engage in peaceful assembly and as-
 sociation only for purposes approved by the Government. Although the Government
 allows civic and business organizations, there are no legal political parties. The Gov-
 ernment regards parties organized by ethnic Nepalese exiles-the Bhutan People's
 Party (BPP), the Bhutan National Democratic Party (BNDP), and the Druk Na-
 tional Congress (DNC)-as "terrorist and anti-national" organizations and has de-
 clared them illegal. These parties do not conduct activities inside the country. They
 seek the repatriation of refugees and democratic reform.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Buddhism is the state religion. The Government sub-
 sidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about a third of the kingdom's
 12,000 monks. The monastic establishment enjoys statutory representation in the
 National Assembly and Royal Advisory Council and is an influential voice on public
 policy. Citizens of other faiths, mostly Hindus, enjoy freedom of worship but may
 not proselytize. Under the law, conversions are illegal.
 The King has declared major Hindu festivals to be national holidays, and the
 royal family participates in them. Foreign missionaries are not permitted to pros-
 elytize, but international Christian relief organizations and Jesuit priests are active
 in education and humanitarian activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens traveling in border regions are required to show their citizen-
 ship identity cards at immigration check points, which in some cases are located at
 a considerable distance from what is in effect an open border with India. By treaty,
 citizens may reside and work in India.
 See Section 5 regarding the ethnic Nepalese refugee situation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Bhutan is a monarchy
 with sovereign power vested in the King. There are, however, elected or partially
 elected assemblies at the local, district, and national levels, and the Government
 purports to encourage decentralization and citizen participation. Since 1969, the Na-
 tional Assembly has had the power to remove ministers, who are appointed by the
 King, but has never done so. Political authority resides ultimately in the King and
 decisionmaking involves only a small number of officials; however, major decisions
 are routinely made by officials subject to questioning by the National Assembly.
 Political parties do not legally exist, and their formation is discouraged by the
 Government as unnecessarily divisive. The Government prohibits parties estab-
 lished abroad by ethnic Nepalese (see Section 2.b.).
 The National Assembly established in 1953, has 150 members. Of these, 105 are
 elected by the people, 10 are selected by the Buddhist clergy, and the remaining 35
 are appointed by the King to represent the Government. Elections to the National
 Assembly are contested, with candidates filing their own nominations. The Assem-
 bly enacts laws, approves senior government appointments, and advises the King on
 matters of national importance. Voting is by secret ballot, with a simple majority
 needed to pass a measure. The King may not formally veto legislation, but may re-
 turn bills for further consideration. The Assembly occasionally rejects the King's rec-
 ommendations or delays implementing them, but in general, the King has enough
 influence to persuade the Assembly to approve legislation that he considers essen-
 tial or to withdraw proposals he opposes. The Assembly may question government
 officials and force them to resign by a two-thirds vote of no confidence.
 
 
 1432
 
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics, although they have
 made small but visible gains. Three women hold seats in the National Assembly.
 All major ethnic groups, including ethnic Nepalese, are represented in the Na-
 tional Assembly. There are 17 "southern Bhutanese" in the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no legal human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) in Bhu-
 tan. The Government regards human rights groups established by ethnic Nepalese
 exiles-the Human Rights Organization of Bhutan, the People's Forum for Human
 Rights in Bhutan, and the Association of Human Rights Activists-Bhutan-as po-
 litical organizations and does not permit them to operate in Bhutan. Amnesty Inter-
 national visited Bhutan in 1992 to investigate and report on the alleged a use of
 ethnic Nepalese. It has not been permitted to return in the years since.
 ICRC representatives continue their periodic prison visits, and the Government
 has allowed them access to detention facilities, including those in southern districts
 inhabited by ethnic Nepalese. The chairman and members of the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission Working Group on Arbitrary Detention made a second
 visit to Bhutan in May as a follow-up to an October 1994 visit. In addition to meet-
 ings with government officials, members of the working group visited prisons and
 interviewed prisoners in Thimphu, Phuntsoling, and Samtse.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Ongoing Government efforts to cultivate a national identity rooted in the lan-
 guage, rehgion, and culture of the Drukpa ethnic group constrain cultural expres-
 sion by other ethnic groups. In the 1980's and early 1990's, concern over rapid popu-
 lation growth and political agitation by ethnic Nepalese resulted in policies ani au-
 sive practices that led to the departure of tens of thousands of members of this
 group, many forcibly expelled.
 The Government claims that ethnic and gender discrimination in employment is
 not a problem. It claims that ethnic Nepalese fill 28 percent of Government jobs,
 which slightly exceeds their share of the current total population. Women are ac-
 corded respect in the traditions of most ethnic groups; however, persistence of tradi-
 tional gender role apparently accounts for the low proportion of women in Govern-
 ment employment. Exile groups claim that ethnic and gender discrimination is a
 problem.
 Women.-There is no evidence of extensive rape or spousal abuse. Kuensel re-
 parted that charges of rape or attempted rape were brought in several cases. How-
 ever, convictions and sentences were not reported.
 There are credible reports by refugees and human rights groups that security
 forces raped large numbers of ethnic Nepalese women in southern Bhutan in 1991
 and 1992. According to Amnesty International, some women were said to have died
 as a result. In one independent survey of 1,779 refugee families, 26 percent of the
 respondents cited rape, fear of rape, or threat of rape as a prime reason for their
 departure from Bhutan. The Government has denied these reports.
 Rape was made a criminal offense in 1953, but that law had weak penalties and
 was poorly enforced. In 1993 the National Assembly adopted a revised rape act with
 clear definitions of criminal sexual assault and stronger penalties. In cases of rape
 involving minors, sentences range from 5 to 17 years. In extreme cases, a rapist
 may be imprisoned for life.
 Women comprise 48 percent of the population and participate freely in the social
 and economic life of the country. Forty-three percent of enrollment in school is fe-
 male, and women account for 16 percent of civil service employment. Inheritance
 law provides for equal inheritance among all sons and daughters, but traditional in-
 heritance practices, which vary among ethnic groups, may be observed if the heirs
 choose to fore go legal challenges. Dowry is not practiced, even among ethnic Nepa-
 lese Hindus. nheritance practies favoring daughters among some groups are said
 to account for large numbers of women among owners of shops and businesses and
 an accompanying tendency of women to drop out of higher education to go into busi-
 ness. On the other hand, female school enrollment has been growing in response to
 government policies. Women are increasingly found among senior officials and pri-
 vate sector entrepreneurs, espcially in the tourism industry. Women in unskilled
 jobs are generaly paid slightly less than men.
 Polygyny is sanctioned provided the first wife gives her permission. Marriages
 may be aanged by partners themselves as wll as by their parents. Divorce is com-
 mon. Recent legislation requires that all marriages must be registered and favors
 women in matters of alimony.
 
 
 1433
 Children.The Government has demonstrated its commitment to child welfare by
 its rapid expansion of primary schools, health-care facilities, and immunization pro-
 grams. The mortality rates for both infants and children under 5-years have
 dropped dramatically since 1989, and primary school enrollment has increased at
 9 percent a year since 1991, with enrollment of girls increasing at a yet higher rate.
 In 1995 the participation rate for boys and girls in primary schools was estimated
 at 72 percent, with the rate of completion of 7 years of schooling at 60 percent for
 girls and 59 percent for boys. Children enjoy a privileged position in society and
 benefit from international development programs focused on maternal and child
 welfare.
 A study by UNICEF found that boys and girls receive equal treatment regarding
 nutrition and health care and that there is little difference in child mortality rates
 between the sexes. Government policies aimed at increasing enrollment of girls have
 increased the proportion of girls in primary schools from 39 percent in 1990 to 43
 percent in 1995.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence of official discrimination toward
 people with disabilities but the Government has not passed legislation mandating
 accessibility for the disabled.
 National /RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Ethnic Nepalese have lived in southern
 Bhutan for centuries, and the early phases of economic development at the turn of
 the century brought a large influx of additional ethnic Nepalese. In the late 1980's,
 concern over the increase of population and political agitation among ethnic Nepa-
 lese prompted aggressive government efforts to assert a national culture, tighten
 control over southern regions, control illegal immigration, expel ethnic Nepalese,
 and promote national integration. Early efforts at national integration focused on
 assimilation, including financial incentives for intermarriage, education for some
 students in regions other than their own, and an increase in development funds in
 the south.
 Beginning in 1989, more discriminatory measures were introduced, aimed at
 shaping a new national identity, known as Drukpa, based on the customs of the
 non-Nepalese Ngalong ethnic group predominant in central Bhutan. Measures in-
 cluded a requirement that national dress be worn for official occasions and as a
 school uniform, the teaching of Dzongkha as a second language in all schools, and
 an end to instruction in Nepali as a second language (English is the language of
 instruction in all schools). Also, beginning in 1988, the Government refused to
 renew the contracts of tens of thousands ofNepalese guest workers. Many of these
 workers had resided in Bhutan for years, in some cases with their families.
 Citizenship became a highly contentious issue. Requirements for citizenship were
 first formalized in the Citizenship Law of 1958, which granted citizenship to all
 adults who owned land and had lived in Bhutan for at least 10 years. In 1985, how-
 ever a new citizenship law significantly tightened requirements for citizenship and
 resulted in the denaturalization of many ethnic Nepalese. While previously citizen-
 ship was conferred upon children whose father was a citizen under the 1958 law,
 the 1985 law raised this standard by requiring that both parents be citizens to con-
 fer citizenship on offspring. The law permits residents who lost citizenship under
 the 1985 law to apply for naturalization if they can prove residence during the pre-
 vious 15 years. The Government declared as illegal immigrants all residents who
 could not meet the new requirements.
 The 1985 Citizenship Act also stipulates the revocation of citizenship of any natu-
 ralized citizen who "has shown by act or speech to be disloyal in any manner what-
 soever to the King, country, and people of Bhutan." The Home Ministry, in a cir-
 cular notification in 1990, advised that "any Bhutanese nationals leaving the coun-
 try to assist and help the anti-nationals shall no longer be considered as Bhutanese
 citizens      such peoples family members living in the same household will also
 be held fully responsible and forfeit their citizenship." Human rights groups allege
 that these provisions were widely used to revoke the citizenship of ethnic Nepalese
 who were subsequently expelled or otherwise departed from Bhutan. Beginning in
 1988, the Government expelled numbers of ethnic Nepalese through enforcement of
 the citizenship laws.
 Outraged by what they saw as a campaign of repression, ethnic Nepalese mounted
 a series of demonstrations, sometimes violent, in September 1990. The protests were
 spearheaded by the newly-formed Bhutan People's Party (BPP) which demanded full
 citizenship rights for ethnic Nepalese, the reintroduction of Nepali as a medium of
 education in the south, and democratic reforms. Characterizing the BPP as a "ter-
 rrist" movement backed by Indian symhathizers, the authorities cracked down on
 its activities and ordered the closure of local Nepalese schools, clinics, and develop-
 ment programs after several were raided or bombed by dissidents. Many schools
 
 
 1434
 were reportedly turned into Army barracks. There were credible reports that many
 ethnic Nepalese activists were beaten and tortured while in custody, and that secu-
 rity forces committed acts of rape. There were also credible reports that militants,
 including BPP members, attacked and murdered census officers and other officials,
 and engaged in bombings. Local officials took advantage of the climate of repression
 to coerce ethnic Nepalese to sell their land below its fair value and emigrate.
 Beginning in 1991, ethnic Nepalese began to leave southern Bhutan in large num-
 bers and take refuge in Nepal. Many were forcibly expelled. According to Amnesty
 International, entire villages were sometimes evicted en masse in retaliation for an
 attack on a local government official. Many ethnic Nepalese were forced to sign "vol-
 untary migration forms" wherein they agreed to leave Bhutan, after local officials
 threatened to fmne or imprison them for failing to comply. By August 1991, according
 to NGO reports, 2,500 refugees were already cam ed llegally in Nepal, with a
 steady stream still coming from Bhutan. The U    CR began providing food and
 shelter in September of that year, and by year's end, there were 6,000 refugees in
 Nepal. The number of regstered refugees grew to approximately 62,000 by August
 1992, and to approximately 80,000 by June 1993, when the    CR began individ-
 ual screening of refugees. The flow slowedly considerably thereafter and is now less
 than a dozen persons a month. At the close of 1996, there were approximately
 91,000 refugees registered in camps in Nepal, with much of the increase since 1993
 the result of natural inci'eas. An additional 15,000 refugees, according to UNHOR
 estimates, are living outside the camps in Nepal and India.
 Ethnic Nepalese political groups in exile complain that the revision of Ehutan's
 citizenship laws in 1985 denaturalized tens of thousands of former residents of Bhu-
 tan. They also complain that the new laws have been selectively applied and make
 unfair demands for documentation on a largely illiterate people in a country that
 has only reently adopted basic administrative procedures. They claim that many
 ethnic Nepales whose familes have been in Bhutan for gen     wera s re expelled
 in the early 1990's because they were unable to document their claims to residence.
 The Government denies this and assrts that a three-member village committee-
 typically ethnic Nepalese in southern Bhutan--certifies in writing that a resident
 is a Bhutanese citizen in cases where documents cannot be produced.
 The Government maintains that many of those who departed Bhutan in 1991-92
 were Nepalese or Indian citizens who came to Bhutan after the enactment of the
 1958 Citizenship law but were not detected until a census in 1988. The Government
 also claims that many person registered in the camps as refugees may never have
 resided in Bhutan. A royal decree in 1991 made forcible expulsion of a citizen a
 criminal offense. In a January 1992 edict, the King noted reports that officials had
 been forcing Ehutanes nationals to leave the country but stressed that this was
 a serious and punishable violation of law. Nevertheless, only three officials were
 ever punished for abusing their authority during this period. According to the
 UNHCR, the overwhelming majority of refugees who have entered the camps since
 screening began in June 1993 have documentary proof of ehutanese nationality.
 Random checks and surveys of camp residents-including both pre- and post-June
 1993 ariivals-bear this out.
 A Nepal-Bhutan ministerial committee met seven times in 1994-96 in efforts to
 resolve the Bhutanese refugee problem. These discussions have made little progress.
 At the end of the year, no date has been set for another round of talks. in March
 refugees began a series of "peace marches" from Nepal to Bhutan to assert their
 right to return to Bhutan. Marchers who crossed into Bhutan in August, November,
 and December were immediately detained and deported by hutanese police. In the
 December incident, police reportedly used force against the marchers.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unionism is not permitted, and there are no
 labor unions. Workers do not have the right to strike, and the Government is not
 a member of the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no collective bargain-
 ing in industry, which accounts for about 25 percent of the gross domestic pouc,
 but it employs only a minute fraction of the total work force. The Government af-
 fects wages in the manufacturing sector through its control over wages in state-
 owned industries.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulso"y Labor.-The Government abolished its sys-
 tem of compulsory labor taxes in December 1995. Laborers in rural development
 achemes previously paid through this system wil now be paid regular wages.There
 is no evidence to suggest that domestics or children are suject to coerced or bonded
 labor.
 
 
 1435
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law set the minimum age for
 employment at 18 years for citizens and 20 years for noncitizens. A UNICEF study
 suggested that children as young as 11 years are sometimes employed with road-
 building teams.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A circular effective February 1, 1994, estab-
 lished wage rates, rules and regulations for labor recruiting agencies, and regula-
 tions for payment of workmen's compensation. Wage rates are periodically revised,
 and range upward from a minimum of roughly $1.50 (50 ngultrums) per day for un-
 skilled and skilled laborers, with various allowances paid in cash or kind in addi-
 tion. This minimum wage does provide a decent standard of living for a worker and
 family in the local context. The workday is defined as 8 hours with a I hour lunch
 break. Work in excess of this must be paid at one and a half times normal rates.
 Workers paid on a monthly basis are entitled to 1 day's paid leave for 6 days of
 work and 15 days of leave annually. The largest salaried work force is the govern-
 ment service, which has an administered wage structure last revised in 1988 but
 supplemented by special allowances and increasessince then, including a 25 percent
 increase on July 1. Only about 30 industrial plants employ more than 50 workers.
 Smaller industrial units include 69 plants of medium size, 197 small units, 692
 "mini units, and 651 cottage industry units. Bhutan's rugged geography and land
 laws that prohibit a farmer from selling his last five acres result in a predominantly
 self-employed agricultural work force. Existing labor regulations do not grant work-
 ers the right to remove themselves from work situations which endanger health and
 safety without jeopardizing their continued employment.
