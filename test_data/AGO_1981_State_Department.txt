 ANGOLA*
 During 1981 the human rights situation in Angola was affected
 by the government's continuing unwillingness to reach a recon-
 ciliation with the National Union for the Total Independence
 of Angola (UNITA), resulting in continued restrictions on
 political freedom, civil war and severe economic disruption.
 When the Portuguese granted independence to Angola on
 November 11, 1975, the three major liberation groups which
 had fought Portuguese rule were engaged in a bloody civil war,
 marked by the intervention of both Cuban and South African
 forces. With Cuban and Soviet assistance the marxist Popular
 Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) succeeded, by
 early 1976, in ousting the two rival movements from Luanda,
 the capital, and from power. Both groups, the National Front
 for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), and the National Union
 for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), reverted to
 guerrilla warfare. The FNLA, though still active in northern
 Angola, does not pose a major threat to the regime. UNITA,
 however has the allegiance of a substantial portion of the
 population and continues to pose a serious challenge to the
 government's control of large areas of the southern, eastern,
 and central portions of the country. Since taking power in
 1975 the KPLA has refused reconciliation with and a role in
 the government to UNITA, which has stated that it wants to
 begin discussions to achieve a political settlement. The
 MPLA has established an autocratic one-party state with con-
 comitant restrictions on freedom of expression and suppress-
 ion of political opposition.
 Cuban combat forces support the Angolan armed forces in
 their operations against UNITA and Are stationed at strategic
 locations in central and southern Angola. South African forces
 regularly conduct "hot pursuit' operations in southern Angola
 against the guerrilla bases of the Southwest Africa People's
 Organization (SWAPO).
 The continuing civil war and a prolonged drought have resulted
 in large numbers of displaced persons in central and southern
 Angola and have severely disrupted the economy. The declining
 prices of oil and diamonds, the two principal sources of
 Angola's revenue, and decline in food production as a result
 of the civil war have exacerbated this serious economic
 situation. Moreover, the continuing civil war has forced
 the government to devote a substantial portion of its
 financial resources to the military.
 * There is little reliable information on human rights
 practices in Angola. The United States does not maintain
 diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Angola,
 and thus has no diplomatic personnel on the spot to monitor
 human rights conditions or to evaluate allegations of abuses.
 Of the major human rights organizations, only Amnesty Interna-
 tional and Freedom House have reported on human rights in
 Angola since independence.

 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Although the constitution charges the state with responsibil-
 ity to guarantee the integrity of the person, allegations of
 torture in Angolan prisons have been made in the past. One*
 prisoner was held for several months in 1980 in an Angolan
 minimum security prison. He reported that no one held in
 that prison alleged that torture was currently employed by
 prison authorities. Some of his fellow prisoners did bear
 evidence of possible torture and allege that it had
 occurred frequently three or more years ago during interroga-
 tions.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The MPLA has at times reportedly executed UNITA prisoners --
 both with and without trial -- and UNITA has retaliated by
 executing MPLA prisoners. There have also been unconfirmed
 reports that UNITA practices urban terrorism in MPLA-controll-
 ed areas. UNITA holds MPLA prisoners.
 The prisons are overcrowded, with substandard diet and
 sanitation, but these conditions probably reflect the poor
 state of the economy rather than deliberate maltreatment.
 Some reports have alleged that foreigners are not well treated
 but the three Americans imprisoned in Angola reportedly
 receive better than average treatment, including available
 medical care. Consular access to them by western diplomatic
 personnel in Luanda has been severely limited, and mail
 delivery to and from them has been erratic. No family
 visits have been permitted.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no information to indicate that abductions, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detentions are practiced by the
 Angolan security agencies.
 The government has, however, not cooperated in US government
 efforts to locate an American pilot who disappeared in
 September 1980 while flying over Angola.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Two of the most persistently and frequently reported charges
 of human rights violations in Angola have been arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment without due process. Numerous
 reports allege that individuals are arrested and imprisoned
 on suspicion or denunciation by others and, in some cases,
 held for several years without being notified of the charges,
 if any, against them. One American citizen who was released
 in 1980 had been held for nearly three years without being
 charged or tried. An American pilot who made an emergency
 landing in Angola in 1980 was held for six months while authori-
 ties investigated his case. Yet another American pilot who made
 an emergency landing in Angola in early 1981 was arrested and
 has been held since that time without being charged.
 It is not known how many persons have been arbitrarily
 arrested and held without trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of the accused to legal counsel and defense
 is guaranteed in the constitution, but there is insufficient
 
 
 17
 information to assess adequately the observance of this
 right.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the domicile and confidentiality of
 correspondence are guaranteed in the constitution, but it is
 .not known to what extent these rights are respected in
 practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of expression, assembly,
 conscience, and belief, as well as separation of church and
 state, but qualifies the exercise of these freedoms by
 requirements that activities must fall within "the area of
 realizing the fundamental objectives of the People's Republic
 of Angola," that they must be "in the national interest," or
 that they "conform to public order." Freedom of assembly
 is denied to any political movement other than the MPLA, and
 all other political movements have been banned. There are
 numerous reports of arrests of people who voice support of
 opposition movements or alternative political systems.
 Censorship of political expression exists and the government
 controls or owns the media. Although opposition views are
 not aired, the press frequently contains articles criticiz-
 ing government failings in economic areas. The government
 is especially sensitive to criticism in the foreign press,
 and has occasionally expelled foreign correspondents for
 writing articles critical of its policies, or describing
 activities of opposition movements. Entry of foreign corres-
 pondents into Angola is tightly restricted as is the circula-
 tion of western journals and periodicals.
 There is a government-sponsored trade movement, the National
 Union of Angolan Workers (UNTA). Traditional labor union
 activities and rights are tightly restricted by the government.
 Strikes are prohibited by law as a crime against the security
 of the state.
 Although, as noted, the constitution guarantees freedom of
 religion, the MPLA has publicly emphasized the importance
 of propagating "atheism", and has criticized religious
 activities.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 As a result of the continuing civil war, the Angolan govern-
 ment is acutely security conscious and has restricted travel.
 There is a pass system within Angola, and foreigners are
 generally prohibited from traveling outside the principal
 cities. Travel abroad is carefully controlled by restrictions
 on passport issuance and exit visas, and by currency restric-
 tions. Emigration is tightly restricted. The Angolan govern-
 ment limits travel to Angola through a selective and stringent
 visa policy.
 In August Angola became a signatory to the UN "Convention
 Relating to the Status of Refugees." Angola has welcomed
 refugees from other countries. There are approximately
 50,000 Namibian, 18,000 Zairian, and 5,000 South African
 refugees in Angola.
 
 
 18
 The right of voluntary repatriation for those who continue
 to support movements opposed to the MPLA does not, however,
 exist in practice. As a result of fear of persecution,
 approximately 250,000 Angolans have taken refuge in Zaire
 and thousands of other Angolans who have settled in Zaire
 are no longer considered refugees. There are 18,000 Angolan
 refugees in Zambia and an undetermined number in Portugal.
 Of the approximately 400,000 Angolans who left the country
 since independence, the Angolan government claims that some
 180,000 have returned, but this claim cannot be verified.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The People's Republic of Angola is a one-party state, with
 the communist-style MPLA-Labor Party the only legal political
 party. The government has banned all political activities by
 opposition groups, and denies them access to the state-
 controlled media. According to Freedom House, in 1981 power
 was exercised arbitrarily, particularly in the countryside.
 The constitution guarantees the exercise of political power
 to the "masses, through organized forms of popular power."
 In effect, this restricts political expression to participa-
 tion in the MPLA-Labor Party or to one of its controlled and
 sanctioned organizations such as its youth wing, the Angolan
 Women's Organization, or the trade union movement (UNTA).
 The MPLA government has established political institutions
 consistent with its ideology, with political power centered
 in the party's politburo and central committee. Popularly-
 elected "people's assemblies" were recently established. The
 MPLA-Labor Party has also sought to expand its membership,
 but it remains tightly restricted. Although the party claims
 that these steps were taken to increase popular participation
 in government, political rights do not appear to have been
 expanded.
 All Angolan citizens over 18 not legally deprived of political
 rights may participate in the political process, as described
 above. Angolan citizenship is denied to those individuals
 with claims to another nationality, who have committed homicide,
 opposed the liberation struggle, or joined clandestine
 organizations opposed to the "decolonization process."
 Voting rights of those citizens who are known supporters
 of opposition groups are restricted.
 The constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens and
 proscribes discrimination because of color, race, ethnicity,
 sex, birthplace, religion, education, or economic or social
 conditions. Women participate in the MPLA, not only in the
 Angolan Women's Organization, but also in the higher levels
 of the party. Women in the higher party organs, however,
 have not been numerous. Only three of the MPLA's 65 central
 committee members are women, while none of the government
 ministers are female. Social, cultural and traditional
 factors limit the participation of women at the highest
 levels of the party and government.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International has expressed concern about the
 imprisonment of members of political opposition groups, and
 about allegations of ill-treatment-of prisoners, but has not
 been able to obtain precise information. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which operates a large
 relief program for displaced persons in Angola, has not been
 able to obtain the authorization of either the government or
 UNITA to visit prisoners.
 
 
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Although Angola is potentially one of the richest countries
 in Africa, its economy has been severely damaged as a result
 of the continuing civil war, the decline in the prices of oil
 and diamonds, its two principal sources of revenue, and by
 the exodus of skilled manpower. Of the approximately 500,000
 Portuguese residents prior to independence, only 30,000
 remain. The continuing civil strife and South African
 incursions have damaged the country's infrastructure and
 forced the diversion of assets to the military. The presence
 of thousands of Cuban combat troops has burdened the economy.
 Althoagh thousands of civilian Cuban and East European
 advisors are working in technical and professional positions,
 the requirements for skilled manpower have not been met.
 These economic problems have had a disastrous affect on
 the population. The distribution system for foodstuffs
 has been disrupted, and deteriorating security in central
 Angola due to MPLA-UNITA hostilities has forced the ICRC to
 curtail some of its food relief and medical programs. The
 over 100,000 persons in central and southern Angola who have
 been displaced from their homes as a result of the combina-
 tion of civil strife and a prolonged drought are suffering-
 from severe malnutrition. Many rural inhabitants have
 abandoned the countryside to seek food and safety in urban
 areas. As a result of this rural exodus, crops are not being
 planted.
 While the government is not indifferent to the plight
 of these displaced persons, it does not have the capability
 to respond. At the government's request, the United Nations
 Disaster Relief Organizations (UNDRO) recently evaluated
 relief needs and reported that assistance in the form of
 food, and supplies such as medicines, blankets, and tents, is
 required for over half a million persons.
 The United States has for the past several years provided
 humanitarian food assistance under the Food for Peace program
 through shipments of grain under the auspices of UNICEF and.
 the World Food Program. Other western countries are also
 providing economic and technical assistance.
 Although the consitution states that it is the duty of
 the state to provide conditions for social development,
 work, health care, and education, continuing internal
 hostilities and the exodus of trained personnel have severely
 hampered the government's efforts to provide basic economic
 needs to Angolans. For example, although physicians from
 several countries are serving in Angola under assistance
 programs, the number is insufficient to supply minimum health
 care to more than a small fraction of the total population.
 Data on the system of education are unavailable. The
 government has been concentrating efforts on improving
 the educational system and has had some success in expanding
 its basic literacy program, but the current literacy rate is
 estimated at 15-20 percent.
 There have been reports of corruption by some officials
 and by foreigners working in the government. The government
 has acknowledged this to be a problem and has replaced some
 officials in an effort to combat it. A thriving and expensive
 black market is known to exist. Despite government controls
 on prices, the scarcity of nearly all goods has caused the
 inflation rate to skyrocket.
 The MPLA has established as its goal the transformation
 of Angola into a "socialist" economy and the major sectors of
 the economy, oil, diamonds, and banking, have been national-
 ized. The right to private property is, however, guaranteed
 by the constitution, and a portion of the economy still
 operates under private ownership.
