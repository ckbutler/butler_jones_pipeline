 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia has a parliamentary system of government based on
 free and generally fair multiparty elections. Malaysia is a
 multiethnic society, with Malays comprising a little more than
 half of the population, and the remainder consisting of
 Chinese (about 33 percent), Indians (about 10 percent), and
 several other minorities. In general elections held in
 October, the ruling National Front coalition maintained its
 two-thirds majority dn the federal Parliament, which it has
 held since 1957. Opposition parties however, actively
 contested the October elections at the federal and state level
 and currently control two state governments. Malaysia is a
 federation of 13 states, with state governments retaining
 power over several important areas, including land use and
 religion.
 Traditionally a small, British-trained counterinsurgency
 force, the Malaysian armed forces are slowly restructuring to
 respond to conventional external threats. .The Communist-led
 insurgency, active in the post-World War II period through the
 1960's, has virtually ended with the signing of a December
 1989 peace agreement between the Government and the Communist
 Party of Malaya. However, the Government cites the
 insurgency, as well as racial tensions and serious narcotics
 problems, as justification for laws allowing preventive
 detention and for arrests under these laws. There are
 credible allegations of mistreatment of prisoners and
 detainees by the police and prison officials. The Royal
 Malaysian Police have the lead in internal security matters.
 The police are under the command of the Inspector Genera.l of
 Police, who is responsible to the Ministry of Home Affairs.
 Prime Minister Mahathir holds the Home Affairs portfolio.
 Members of the Malaysian Armed Forces have no significant
 political role.
 A free market economy, abundant natural resources, and a
 relatively small population have helped Malaysia become one of
 the most prosperous of the developing countries. Strong
 economic performance since 1988 has led to a rising standard
 of living, reduction in the incidence of poverty, and better
 income distribution, thus lessening political tension between
 the races.
 Detention without trial and restrictions on judicial
 independence, as well as restrictions on freedom of
 association and the press remain the principal human rights
 concerns in Malaysia. Opposition politicians and some
 election observers expressed concern about unfair campaign
 practices in the October general elections, including unequal
 access to the media, misuse of government facilities, and
 problems with the integrity of voter rolls. According to the
 Government, 155 individuals are detained under the Internal
 Security Act (ISA).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings by the Government or by any other political
 
 
 953
 MALAYSIA
 organization. In 1989 the death of several prisoners in
 police custody was attributed by a coroner's inquest to "foul
 play."
 b. Disappearance
 There wzre no incidents of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine  detention attributable to the Government or to
 nongovernmental or opposition forces. There have been reports
 that, in a number of cases, security authorities waited days
 after a detention before informing the detainee's family.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There continue to be.allegations of cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment. Several ISA detainees from
 October 1987 claim that they were mistreated by security
 authorities and, in its 1990 report (covering 1989), Amnesty
 International said reports of police brutality against
 prisoners continued. At least two former detainees have
 published accounts of their mistreatment in detention,
 including solitary confinement, sleep deprivation, threats and
 verbal abuse and, in at least one case, beating. In 1989 a
 coroner returned an open verdict after an inquest into the
 death of a detainee in police custody. The coroner criticized
 prison officials' handling of the case, but found no one
 criminally liable for the detainee's death. During the
 inquest, a forensic consultant testified that unhygenic cell
 conditions and, in a small number of cases, "foul play"
 contributed to the 'deaths of some prisoners. Policemen and
 prison guards have been charged with abuse of prisoners,
 convicted and sentenced to prison or fined.
 Malaysian criminal law prescribes whipping as an additional
 punishment to imprisonment for those convicted of narcotics
 possession. Judges routinely include whipping in sentencing
 those convicted of such crimes as kidnaping, rape, and
 robbery. The whipping, which is normally carried out with a
 one-half inch thick wooden cane, commonly causes welts and
 scarring.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government can detain suspects without judicial review or
 filing formal charges under three laws: the 1960 Internal
 Security At (ISA), the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance
 of 19b9, and the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1985. Long-term
 detentions without trial continue to be used by the Government
 in alleged national security and other cases.
 The 1960 ISA, according to the Government, is aimed at
 controlling internal subversion. It empowers the police to
 hold for up to 60 days any person who may act "in a manner
 prejudicial to the security of Malaysia." Security
 authorities sometimes wait several days after a detention
 before informing the detainee's family. Further detention for
 periods up to 2,years must be authorized in writing by the
 Minister of Home Affairs. Although there are no formal
 charges, the authorities must inform the detainees of the
 accusations against them and give them the opportunity to
 appeal their case to an advisory board for review every 6
 months. Advisory board decisions and recommendations are not
 binding on the Minister, are never publicized, and are often
 not shown to the detainee. A number of the ISA detainees have
 
 
 954
 MALAYSIA
 refused to participate in the review process under these
 circumstances.
 The Government generally does not publish statistics or make
 available authoritative information on the number of ISA
 detainees. On December 11, however, the Deputy Home Affairs
 Minister told Parliament there were 142 detainees. While the
 Deputy Minister did not-provide details on these detentions,
 the number represents an increase of 63 over the previously
 acknowledged figure of 92 ISA detainees. The Deputy Minister
 categorized the original 92 detainees as: 44 Communist
 subversives; 24 extremists; 12 forgers; 7 held for espionage;
 and 5 from the East Malaysian State of Sabah.
 Although the Government has provided no additional information
 on the 44 "Communist" detainees, human rights groups
 understand that they are former members of the Communist Party
 of Malaya who have surrendered to the authorities and are
 undergoing "rehabilitation."
 It is generally accepted that the 24 "extremists" refer to
 persons, largely from the opposition Islamic party, who were
 detained in 1988 for suspicion of involvement in politically
 motivated cases of arson. In an August statement, the Deputy
 Home Minister identified the alleged forgers as immigration
 officials and other civil servants suspected of forging
 passports and nationality documents. The espionage detainees
 are presumed to be those detained in December 1989 on
 suspicion of spying for a neighboring country.
 The five persons from Sabah include one "economic threat"
 detainee who was detained in November 1989 in connection with
 an anticorruption case against a prominent Sabah politician.
 The other four Sabahans were detained in mid-1990 as suspects
 in a secessionist plot to withdraw Sabah from the Federation
 of Malaysia. The four remain in detention under 2-year
 detention orders. In addition, five persons, including one
 opposition Member of Parliament, were detained briefly in
 September under the ISA in connection with a violent public
 protest against a government-imposed road toll. A police
 official said the ISA was used because demonstrations against
 the toll, which was levied on a road used predominantly by
 ethnic Chinese, were taking on racial overtones, thus
 "threatening the security of the nation."
 In 1988 and 1989, Parliament amended the ISA, as well as the
 other acts authorizing preventive detention, to place severe
 limitations on judicial review of detentions. The Government
 argued that the amendments were necessary to prevent the
 courts from usurping the authority of the executive branch in
 making decisions on national security matters. Opposition
 leaders and the Bar Council publicly protested these
 amendments as a negation of recognized due process.
 The Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance of 1969 stemmed
 from that year's intercommunal riots. The state of emergency
 declared at that time has never been rescinded, although
 Parliament regained its legislative power in 1971. According
 to the police, as of December 1990, 189 persons were in
 detention under the Emergency Ordinance. This number
 represents a drop from previous years, since drug suspects are
 now detained under the Dangerous Drugs Act. Several credible
 
 
 MALAYSIA
 sources state that these detainees are suspected members of
 organized crime, secret societies, and the like.
 4
 The Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) Act of 1985
 gives the Government specific power to detain suspected drug
 traffickers. Suspects can be held under this law for
 successive 2-year intervals with periodic review by an
 advisory board. The opinion of the advisory board in
 narcotics cases is binding on the Minister. As of December,
 1990, there were about 1,200 drug suspects in detention under
 this statute. There have been some cases of suspected
 narcotics traffickers and firearms offenders being rearrested
 under the Preventive Measures clauses of the Dangerous Drugs
 Act and Internal Security Act after an acquittal in court on
 formal charges under separate provisions of those Acts.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial is restricted in criminal cases
 where the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975 are
 invoked-by the Attorney General. These regulations governing
 trial-procedure are normally applied only in firearms' cases.
 In cases tried under the Essential (Security Cases)
 Regulations, the -tandards for accepting self-incriminating
 statements by defendants-as evidence are less stringent than
 in normal criminal cases. In addition, the authorities may
 hold the accused for unspecified periods of time prior to
 formal charging. The Attorney General also has the authority
 to invoke-these regulations in other criminal cases if the
 Government determines the crime to involve national security
 considerations, but such cases are rare.
 Ordinary civil and criminal cases are tried under a fair and
 open judicial system derived from British jurisprudence. The
 accused must be brought before a judge within 24 hours of
 arrest and charges must be levied within 14 days. Defendants
 have the right to counsel, bail is available, and strict rules
 of evidence apply in court. Defendants may appeal court
 decisions to higher courts and, in criminal cases, may also
 appeal for clemency to the King or local state rulers as
 appropriate. Criminal trials are heard by a single judge
 without a jury, except in murder trials where juries are the
 norm. Finally, the defense in both ordinary criminal cases
 and the special security cases described above is not entitled
 to a statement of evidence priorto the trial.
 The Malaysian judiciary traditionally was regarded by the
 public and the legal community as committed to the rule of
 law. The judicial system had exhibited over the years a high
 degree of independence, not hesitating to rule against the
 Government in criminal, civil, or occasionally even major
 cases with political ramifications. An example of the latter
 was the. High Court ruling in February 1988 that the dominant
 party in the Government coalition was illegally constituted.
 However, the 1988.dismissal of the Supreme Court Lord
 President and two other justices, along with the
 constitutional amendment and legislative changes restricting
 judicial review, have since 1988 resulted in a marked
 strengthening of executive control over the judiciary and
 lessening of judicial independence. These developments have
 also had a detrimental effect on the willingness of the courts
 to challenge the Government's legal interpretations in
 politically sensitive cases.
 
 
 956
 MALAYSIA
 The 1988 Supreme Court dismissal continues to have
 ramifications. In March 1989, the Malaysian Bar Coincil filed
 a contempt of court motion against the current Lord President
 for his role in the dismissal of his predecessor. In April
 1989, the Supreme Court dismissed the Bar Council's contempt
 motion, and then in June agreed to consider the Attorney
 General's counter-motion against Manjeet Singh Dhillon, then
 Bar Council Secretary (now Vice President). In November a
 divided Supreme Court found Singh guilty of contempt of court
 for "unwarranted and defamatory" criticism of the Lord
 President and fined him $1,850. The dissenting Justice argued
 that even defamatory abuse of a judge is not contempt, but the
 majority ruled that by undermining the authority of the Lord
 President and lowering the dignity of the court, Manjeet was
 guilty of contempt.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are respected and protected by law with the
 exception of provisions contained in the security legislation
 described in Section l.d., which allow the police to enter and
 search without warrant the homes of persons suspected of
 threatening national security and to confiscate evidence.
 Under these Acts, police have searched homes and offices,
 seized books and papers, monitored conversations, and taken
 people into custody without a warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Despite constitutional provisions for freedom of speech and
 press, there are some important limitations. For example, the
 Constitution provides that freedom of speech can be restricted
 by legislation "in the interest of security...(or) public
 order." Thus the Sedition Act Amendments of 1970 prohibit
 publid comment on issues defined as sensitive, such as
 citizenship rights for non-Malays and the special position of
 Malays in society. The Government has not charged anyone
 under the Sedition Act since 1986 when the defendant, a former
 president of the Bar Council, was acquitted.
 Press freedom is subject to important limitations under the
 Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984, under which
 domestic and foreign publications must apply annually to the
 Government for a permit. Amendments to the Act in 1987 make
 the publication of "malicious news" a punishable offense,
 expand the Government's power to ban or restrict publications,
 and prohibit court challenges to suspension or revocation of
 publication permits. In January the Supreme Court affirmed
 the Government's 1987 denial of a publishing permit for the
 social action group, Aliran, to print a Malay-language version
 of its current English-language monthly. The Government
 subsequently approved a Malay-language publishing permit for
 Aliran. The Government also eased restrictions on the
 publication of the Malay-language newspaper of the Islamic
 opposition party.
 An important restriction on press freedom is the fact that the
 Government or companies controlled by the leading political
 parties in the ruling coalition own all the major circulation
 newspapers and all radio and television stations. The
 government-linked mass media gives only limited and selective
 coverage to opposition views; according to a C9mmonwealth
 
 
 1 957
 
 MALAYSIA
 election observer team, opposition parties were denied equal
 access to the media during the 1990 general election
 campaign. The Prime Minister responded that the observers'
 comments may have been influenced by their ability to cover
 only the English-language press and not the vernacular
 newspapers. Small circulation publications of opposition
 parties, social action groups, unions and other private groups
 cover opposition political activities in all four local
 languages and print viewpoints strongly critical of the ruling
 coalition and its policies.
 In June Parliament enacted legislation making the Malaysian
 News Agency (Bernama) the sole distributor of foreign news in
 Malaysia, formalizing previous practice. While some
 opposition-parliamentarians opposed the bill, charging it
 would increase government control over foreign news, the bill
 has not restricted foreign news coverage or availability in
 the country. The major international and regional news
 publications continue to circulate freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the rights of freedom of
 peaceful assembly and association, but there are significant
 restrictions. Those rights can be limited in the interest of
 security and public order, and the 1967 Police Act requires
 police permits for all public assemblies. In the aftermath of
 the intercommunal riots in 1969, the Government banned
 political rallies altogether. While the ban on political
 rallies has not been rescinded, both government and opposition
 parties have held large indoor political gatherings dubbed
 "discussion sessions."
 Government and opposition candidates campaigned actively
 during national elections in October as well as in a series of
 special elections during the year. There are, however, some
 restrictions on freedom of assembly during campaigns. During
 the actual campaign period, the political parties submit lists
 of times and places for their "discussion groups;"-no police
 permit is required. Outside of the campaign period a permit
 is required and in hundreds of cases is routinely approved.
 Nevertheless, in at least three.cases in 1990 opposition
 parties were forced to cancel planned "discussion group"
 meetings due to lack of a police permit.
 Other statutes limit the right of association, such as the
 Societies Act of 1966, under which any association of seven or
 more members must register with the Government as a society.
 The Government can refuse to register a new society, and has
 the power, rarely employed, to revoke the registration of an
 existing society. 'The specter of possible deregistration
 under the Societies Act, however, may inhibit political
 activism by public or special interest ,organizations. Another
 law affecting freedom of association is the Universities and
 University Colleges Act; it mandates government approval for
 student associations and prohibits student associations, as
 well as faculty members, from engaging in political activity.
 Nevertheless, campus demonstrations do occur.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The official religion of Malaysia is Islam. Ethnic Malays are
 legally bound in some civil matters, e.g., family relations
 and diet, by Islamic religious laws administered by state
 authorities through Islamic courts. An Islamic religious
 
 
 MALAYSIA
 establishment is supported with government funds, and it is
 official policy to "infuse Islamic values" into the
 administration of Malaysia. At the same time, the
 Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government has refused to accede to pressures for the
 imposition of Islamic religious law beyond the Muslim
 community. Religious minorities, which include large Hindu,
 Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian communities, are permitted to
 worship freely.
 There are persistent allegations that some state governments
 are slow in approving building permits for non-Muslim places
 of worship. The Government has limited the circulation of a
 popular Malay-language translation of the Bible, and some
 states restrict the use of Christian terms in the Malay
 language.
 Conversion to religions other than Islam is permitted but not
 encouraged; proselytizing of Muslims is, and has long been,
 proscribed by law in some states and strongly discouraged in
 other parts of the country. In March a woman was sentenced to
 6 months in jail for "injuring the feelings" of Buddhists by
 passing out pamphlets at a Buddhist temple likening idols to
 false gods.
 In a March decision, the Supreme Court upheld the primacy of
 the Constitution by ruling that parents had the right to
 determine the religion of their minor children under the age
 of 18. The-decision has eased fears of the non-Muslim
 community over state laws which in religious conversion cases
 set the age of majority at puberty based on Islamic law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government restricts in only a few circumstances the right
 of people to travel within the country and live and work where
 they please. For instance, after their release from detention
 some ISA detainees in 1987 were subject to restrictions on
 their movement, all of which were rescinded by June 1989.
 There are no Government restrictions on emigration. There
 have been some cases of the Government denying passport for
 security considerations, but Malaysians are generally free to
 travel abroad except to Israel and South Africa.. Former
 restrictions on travel to several Communist countries,
 including China, were eliminated in September.
 In accordance with an international agreement concluded in
 1989, Malaysia began to screen Vietnamese boat people on
 August 28, 1989. Screening is done by Malaysian military
 officers with legal consultants from the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) present throughout each
 interview. The GOM screeners and UNHCR consultants make every
 effort to develop the asylum seekers' claims to refugee
 status. The Government discusses all disputed cases with the
 UNHCR before announcing a decision. An administrative appeal
 is available to denied cases. Through October 31, 1990, 4,477
 persons have been interviewed and determinations have been
 announced in 3,046 cases. Of those 3,046 cases, 1,098 were
 held to be refugees. Appeals have yet to be processed.
 Despite its 1989 commitments under the international agreement
 on Indochinese refugees and asylum seekers and despite its
 history of providing first asylum to more than 250,000
 Vietnamese refugees since 1975, the Government began to deny
 
 
 MAtIAYSIA
 first -asyluarin May 1989. According to the UNHCR, during 1989
 a total of 3,232 persons were denied first asylum. Five of
 them died attempting to reach a neighboring country by sea.
 UNHCR figures through November-15 show 6,983 persons were
 denied first asylum in 1990. In the first 6 months of the
 year, 1,294 boat people were granted asylum, but all arrivals
 since June 21, except one boat of-11 persons, have been put
 back to sea. Theie have been no reports of deaths resulting
 from the denial of-first asylum in 1990. Malaysian
 auth6rities, after permitting temporary safe landings in at
 least some cases, normally provide asylum seekers with life
 jackets, seaworthy boats, .and essential supplies and then
 redirect them, usually to Indonesia. THe UNHCR does not gain
 access to such cases until their arrival in Indonesia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 By law and in practice Malaysians have the right to change
 their government through periodic elections, although
 occasional electoral irregularities and campaign restrictions
 have detracted from the overall fairness of the process.
 Malaysia has a parliamentary system of government based on the
 British model. National elections, which the Constitution
 requires at least every 5 years, have been held regularly
 since independence, in 1957 and have included opposition
 candidates actively contesting federal and state seats.
 Through the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), Malays
 dominate the ruling National Front coalition of ethnic-based
 parties which has controlled Parliament since independence.
 The Government coalition currently controls 11 of 13 states.
 Non-Malays fill a large number of cabinet posts, and at
 present ethnic Chinese leaders of a member party of the
 Government coalition hold executive power in the State of
 Penang. In Sabah, a party controlled by Sabah's predominant
 indigenous ethnic group and headed by a Christian is in power.
 A new Malay political party called Semangat 46 (Spirit of 46)
 was registered in July 1989. This party is dominated by
 'former UMNO leaders who challenged Prime Minister Mahathir for
 the party leadership in 1987 and lost. In June the Registrar
 of Societies approved the application to register a political
 umbrella organization intended to. join together Semangat 46,
 the Parti Islam Semalaysia (PAS), and two small Malay
 opposition parties. On October 10, the Chinese-based
 opposition Democratic Action Party and several small
 opposition parties formed a separate electoral pact with
 Semangat 46, called the "People's Front." As a result, in
 national elections in October the Government coalition faced
 the unprecedented prospect of a multiethnic, multiparty
 opposition linked into two groupings and fielding, for
 virtually every seat, single opposition candidates. In the
 October-elections, the opposition increased its parliamentary
 representation from 38 to 53 seats and gained control of two
 state governments.
 Malaysian elections are procedurally free and fair, with votes
 cast secretly and recorded accurately. General elections in
 October were subject to intense scrutiny by both international
 and domestic observers. In response to charges that the
 Election Commission, established by the Constitution to
 conduct elections, was biased in favor of. the government
 coalition, Prime Minister Mahathir invited the Commonwealth to
 send election observers to monitor the campaign and polling.
 
 
 960
 MALAYSIA
 The initial observation of the Commonwealth group was that the
 Malaysian elections were "properly and impartially" carried
 out. The Commonwealth observers did, however, point to
 unequal media access for the opposition and irregularities in
 the electoral rolls as "imperfections" in the campaign.
 In addition, six prominent Malaysians, who formed an election
 monitoring group called "Election Watch" in February, issued a
 report on the elections. This report acknowledged that the
 election was free but criticized unequal opposition access to
 the media, problems with the electoral rolls, and subtle
 intimidation of voters by reference to 1969 race riots in
 Malaysia. The Election Watch report also recommended
 scrapping a March 1990 amendment to the election law which
 mandated ballot counting at the local polling place, rather
 than at a central counting location.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In August 1989, a group of prominent Malaysians, including two
 former prime ministers (both now deceased), formally applied
 to the Registrar of Societies to establish a national human
 rights society. The-registrar has not yet ruled on the
 application. A number of organizations, including the Bar
 Council and various public interest groups, devote attention
 to human rights activities. The Government tolerates their
 activities but rarely responds to their inquiries or
 occasional press statements. The Government has not acceded
 to any of the international covenants on human rights,
 generally maintaining that such issues are internal matters.
 The Government rejects criticism of its human rights record by
 international human rights organizations and foreign
 governments. Malaysian officials criticize local groups for
 collaborating with international human rights organizations in
 their studies of the human rights situation, charging that
 these organizations apply a Western standard of judgment not
 in keeping with Malaysian norms. Representatives of
 international human rights organizations have visited and
 traveled in Malaysia but often without access to government
 officials.
 In 1990 representatives of the American Bar Association (ABA)
 and the International Council of Jurists attended the trial of
 the Bar Council Vice President mentioned in Section l.e. The
 ABA representative met privately with the Attorney General to
 discuss the case. Foreign government officials have met in
 Malaysia with their Malaysian counterparts to discuss human
 rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Government implements on an extensive scale programs
 designed to boost the economic position of the ethnic Malay
 majority, which remains poorer, on average, than other
 Malaysians despite its political dominance. These government
 programs and policies, by favoring one segment of society,
 limit, in varying degrees, opportunities for non-Malays in
 higher education, government employment, business permits and
 licenses, and ownership of newly developed agricultural lands.
 
 
 961
 MALAYSIA
 Indigenous peoples in the East Malaysian State of Sarawak
 continue to protest that logging activities are infringing
 their rights. Between November 1988 and September 1989; 245
 members of-the seminomadic Pehan group in Sarawak were
 arrested and charged with illegally blockading logging roads
 and bridges. TAll those antilogging protesters brought to
 trial in 1990 were acquitted for lack of evidence. In March
 another indigenous group filed a suit to stop logging on its
 traditional* lands. The court ruled against the indigenous
 group., which announced plans to appeal.
 There are no laws or regulations restricting the political and
 economic rights of women. Government policy supports women"s
 full'iand equal participation in government, education, and the
 work force. Women hold high level politicalpositions and
 judgeships. They-are well represented in the professions, and
 the corporate sector includes women in leadership roles.
 Literacy rates for women are lower than for men, with a female
 literacy rate of 55.percent compared to a rate of 76 percent
 for the'total adult population.
 The condition of women in Malaysian society is conditioned by
 the cultural and religious traditions of-the country's major
 ethnic groups.* Muslim women are subject to Islamic law in
 family and religious matters.. Polygamy is allowed and
 practiced, and inheritance law favors male offspring and
 relatives. Islamic family law was revised in 1989 to provide
 better protection for the property rights of married Muslim
 women and make more equitable a Muslim woman's right to
 divorce. Non-Muslim women are subject to civil law. Changes
 in the-civil Marriage and Divorce Act in the early 1980's have
 increased protection of married women's rights, especially
 those married under customary rites. A national women's
 policy was adopted by the Cabinet in late 1989 to upgrade the
 status of the government department responsible for women's
 affairs and monitor the implementation of national policies to
 insure that women's rights are protected.
 There is a growing realization of the need.for separate
 legislation to deal with domestic violence, including wife
 beating. While statistics on the extent of the problem are
 sketchy, both the Government and women's organizations agree
 that the problem is growing. There are currently no specific
 laws on domestic violence. Cases of wife beating or child
 abuse are currently tried under normal assault provisions of
 the Penal- Code, which carry penalties of 3 months to I year in
 prison and fines up to $750. The Deputy Minister responsible
 for women's affairs in the Prime Minister's.Department stated
 in July that an interagency group considering legislation on
 domestic violence is having problems concerning the definition
 of domestic violence and how Muslim women, whose family and
 marital status is covered by- Islamic law, should be treated in
 the proposed civil legislation. A women's aid organization
 runs shelters for battered wives, and several women's groups
 led a successful effort in April 1989 to toughen the laws.
 against rape.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 By law workers have the right to engage in trade union
 activity. Unions may organize workplaces,- bargain
 collectively with employers, form federations, and join
 international organizations. The Industrial Relations Act
 
 
 962
 MALAYSIA
 specifically prohibits interfering with, restraining, or
 coercing a worker in the exercise of the right to form or
 participate in the lawful trade union activities. The Trade
 Unions Act, administered by the Direction General of Trade
 Unions (DGTU), sets rules for organization of unions, union
 recognition at the workplace, the content of union
 constitutions, election of officers, and financial reporting
 requirements. The Act's definition of a trade union restricts
 it to representing workers in a "particular establishment,
 trade, occupation, or industry or within any similar trades,
 occupations, or industries," contrary to International Labor
 Organization (ILO) guidelines.
 The DGTU may refuse to register a trade union. He also has
 the power, in some circumstances, to withdraw registration of
 a trade union. When registration has been refused, withdrawn,
 or canceled, a trade union is considered an unlawful
 association.
 Malaysia's electronic components industry, dominated by
 American and Japanese firms, has been the focus of
 unsuccessful union organizing efforts since the late 1970's.
 The Government has used its various powers to prevent other
 than strictly "in-house" unions in the industry. In August
 1989, the DGTU refused to register the National Electronics
 Woikers Union on the grounds that the formation of the union
 as proposed conflicts with the definition of "trade union" as
 provided in the Trade Unions Act because its members are those
 working in the electrical and the electronics industries,
 which are different industries. The Government requires
 electrical worker unions to be distinct and separate from
 electronic workers unions. Union leaders have stated that
 they sought to represent only workers in the electronics
 industry. The ILO's Committee on Freedom 6f Association in
 mid-1990 expressed profound disquiet that workers in this
 industry are denied the right to establish and join unions of
 their choosing, and it has asked the Government to amend its
 laws to bring them into accord with the principles of freedom
 of association. The Government has given no indication of
 intent to do so.
 Five in-house unions have been registered in the electronics
 industry. All the members of one of these unions were fired
 following reorganization of the company's structure. The
 union has charged union-busting and wrongful dismissal and a
 decision is pending in the Industrial Court. In mid-1990
 workers at another plant tried to form a union affiliated with
 the Electrical Industry Workers Union. The DGTU ruled that
 the company was in the electronic not the electrical industry
 and that only an in-house union would be permitted. Aflor
 this ruling the workers struck at the plant. The company
 dismissed all the workers after the Government ruled the
 strike illegal. After the Human Resources Minister advised
 the company to rehire its employees, the company rehired all
 of the employees except the union organizers. The
 International Metalworkers Federation has filed a complaint
 with the ILO about this case.
 The electronics industry is not the only sector in which
 industry-wide national unions are not permitted. There has
 been a longstanding, de facto bar on a national textile and
 garment workers' union. State-based textile and garment
 worker unions (as opposed to strictly in-house unions) are
 permitted. This is a significant distinction between the
 electronics industry and the textile and garment industry.

 Federations of trade unions may cover only a single trade or
 industry~or similar'trades or industries. There are only
 three-national labor federations currently registered: one for
 public servants, one -for teachers, and one consisting of
 state-based textile and garment workers' unions.
 The Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC), the main labor
 body in the country, is registered as a society under the
 Societies Act (rather than the Trade Unions Act).- The
 Malaysian Labor Organization (MLO), recently set up as a rival
 labor center to the MTUC, is also registered as a society.
 Previous MTUC efforts to register as a trade union federation
 under the Trade Unions Act were turned down because of it.2.
 broad membership. In November 1988, however, Parliament
 approved legislation which grants both societies of .trade
 unions and societies of employers the status and -rights
 accorded trade unions despite their status as societies. This
 legislation is intended to give the MTUC "standing" to be able
 to represent union interests in the High Court.
 Unions are independent both of-the Government and of the
 political parties. While union officers are not permitted to
 hold principal offices in political parties, individual trade
 union leaders have served and are serving in Parliament, and
 individual union members belong to political parties.
 Malaysian trade unions are free to associate with the
 international labor bodies, and Malaysian labor leaders play
 major roles in international labor affairs. The MTUC is
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions -(ICFTU).. The General Secretary of the National Union
 of Plantation Workers is President of the ICFTU, and the MTUC
 Secretary General-has participated actively in the ILO
 Governing Body.
 While strikes are- legal and occasionally occur, this right in
 practice is severely restricted. Malaysian law contains a
 list of "essential services" in which unions must give longer
 advance notice of any industrial action; the list includes
 sectors which do not normally qualify as essential under ILO
 rules. The Industrial Relations Act of 1967 requires the
 parties to notify the Ministry of Human Resources that a
 dispute exists before any industrial action (strike or
 lockout) may be taken. The Ministry's Industrial Relations
 Department can then become actively involved in conciliation
 efforts. If conciliation fails to achieve a settlement, the
 Minister has the power (which had been broadened by a 1989
 amendment) to refer the dispute to the Industrial Court, which
 effectively becomes compulsory arbitration. A strike or
 lockout ds prohibited while the "dispute" is before the
 Industrial Court, and its decision cannot be appealed.
 In January, 65,000 members of the National Union of Plantation
 Workers struck for a guaranteed minimum monthly wage. The
 strike was ended when it was referred to the Industrial Court,
 which ruled in favor of the union.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Malaysian workers have the legal right to organize and bargain
 collectively. Collective bargaining is widespread in thbse
 sectors where labor is organized. The 1980 amendments to
 Malaysia's Labor Law designed to curb disruptive strikes
 contain provisions, however, which the MTUC believes erode the
 basic rights of workers, restrict union activities, and result
 in government and employer interference.in the internal

 MALAYSIA
 administration of unions. The ILO in 1983 urged the
 Government to amend these laws to bring them into conformity
 with ILO Convention 98 on the right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. Despite subsequent amendments, the MTUC still
 believes the labor law to be deficient by ILO standards.
 Many union leaders also believe that creation of the
 Industrial Court further weakened their collective bargaining
 rights. In 1990 the ILO Committee of Experts asked the
 Government to remove legal restrictions pertaining to
 personnel actions such as promotion, job assignments, and
 dismissal without notice; "pioneer" enterprises; and public
 sector employees other than civil servants.
 Labor standards in free trade zones are the same as those in
 the rest of Malaysia. Workers at many companies located in
 the free trade zones are unionized, especially in the textile
 and electrical products plants. Enterprises granted pioneer
 status (regardless of location) are protected from union
 demands for terms of employment exceeding those specified in
 the Employment Act of 1955 during the period of their "pioneer
 status" (normally 5 years). The restriction does not apply to
 wages or benefits not covered by the Employment Act (see
 Section 6.e. below).
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The ILO has criticized provisions of Malaysian legislation
 which give the authorities power to punish persons expressing
 views opposed to the established order or taking part in
 strikes with imprisonment involving an obligation to perform
 labor. The Government has pointed out that the legislation is
 unconstitutional and cannot be enforced. The ILO Conference
 Committee in June notea the Government's statements that there
 is no actual forced labor, but continued to press Malaysia to
 amend the legislation in question to remove any possibility it
 could be applied in the future. The ILO also noted that
 Malaysia in 1989 had abolished judicial review of government
 decisions under the ISA which fall within the scope of ILO
 Convention 105 on forced labor. Rather than continue to
 debate with the ILO or amend laws it contends have no
 practical force, Malaysia in 1990 renounced Convention 105, to
 take effect in January 1991. It continues to support
 Convention 29 prohibiting forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children is covered by the Children and Young
 Persons (Employment) Act of 1966, which stipulates that no
 child under the age of 14 may be engaged in any employment
 except light work in a family enterprise, in public
 entertainment, in work performed by the Government in a school
 or training institution, or in employment as an approved
 apprentice. Children may not work more than 6 hours daily,
 more than 6 days weekly, or at night. The law is effectively
 enforced through periodic inspections by the Ministry of Human
 Resources.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 While there is no national minimum wage legislation, retail
 clerks, hotel and restaurant employees, cinema workers, and a
 few others, totaling approximAtely 140,000 workers, are
 covered by minimum wage laws. Malaysian wages are relatively
 high for its level of industrialization and provide for an
 adequate standard of living for workers and their families.

 The prevailing minimum wage for unskilled labor in the urban
 areas is ,about.$100 per month.
 Plantation work is increasingly being done by contract
 workers, including numerous illegal immigrants from
 Indonesia. Working conditions for these workers often are
 significantly below those of direct hire plantation workers,
 many of whom belong to the National Union of Plantation
 Workers. Additionally, many of the immigrant workers,
 particularly illegal ones, may not have access to Malaysia's
 system of labor adjudication. The Government has investigated
 this problem and has taken a number of steps to eliminate the
 abuse of contract labor.
 The Employment Act of 1955 sets working hours not to exceed 8
 hours daily or 44 hours weekly (5 1/2 days), sets overtime
 rates for hours in excess-of those, and mandates public
 holidays, annual leave, sick leave, and maternity allowances.
 Minimum standards of occupational health and safety are
 patterned after the British Factory Act and enforced by a unit
 of tie Ministry of-Human Resources. All factories are
 supposed to be inspected at least once every 15 months but
 lack of adequate personnel precludes widespread enforcement.
