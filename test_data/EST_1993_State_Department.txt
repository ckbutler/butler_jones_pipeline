 ESTONIA
 Estonia is a parliamentary democracy that regained its independence in 1991
 after more than 50 years of Soviet occupation. The Constitution, adopted by referen-
 dum on June 28, 1992, established a 101-member unicameral legislature (State As-
 sembly) a Prime Minister as Head of Government, and a President as Head of
 State. Free and fair elections were held in 1992 for the State Assembly and the
 President.
 Estonia maintained that all Russian and Commonwealth of Independent States
 military forces should have left the country by the end of 1993. Estonia and the
 Russian Federation negotiated on this issue during 1993 but had not reached agree-
 ment on a timetable for the withdrawal of these troops by year's end. While the offi-
 cial conversion of the Soviet militia into the Estonian police preceded the reestab-
 lishment of the country's independence by about 6 months, its conversion into a
 Western-type police force committed in word and deed to procedures and safeguards
 appropriate to a democratic society is proceeding very slowly. Allegations of exces-
 sive use of police force are primarily handled administratively and, when brought
 to their attention, investigated by the Human Rights Institute.
 Estonia is substantially transforming the centrally planned economy it inherited
 into a market-oriented system. Small and medium-scale privatization is moving to-
 
 
 861
 ward copetion; large-sale privatization began in 1993. The collapse of the trading
 wrk t        existed in the Soviet Union necessitated finding new sources of fuel
 and new markets. Approximately two-thirds of exports are now directed to Western
 markets. There has also been rising unemployment-a matter of concern to employ-
 ees of state-owned enterprises and to the ethnic Russian community-although
 overall the level has remained manageable.
 The treatment of the substantial ethnic Russian community continued to be a
 major issue both domestically and in bilateral relations with Russia. Parliament's
 passage in  June of an Alien Registration     Law, officially  designating all
 noncitizens--about 500,000 mostly Russian speakers-as aliens, led to renewed crit-
 icism from the Russian Federation. It again accused Estonia of "ethnic cleansing"
 and massive violations of the human rights of the Russian-speaking population
 (about 38 percent of the total), primarily because they were not automatically grant-
 ed Estonian citizenship.
 The Council of Europe (CE) and the High Commissioner on National Minorities
 of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) commented on the
 law, suggesting a number of changes. Parliament adopted almost all of these pro-
 posed amendments, thereby substantially improving the original version. While wel-
 coming approval of the amendments, the High Commissioner noted that many dif-
 ficult problems remained to be solved. A local government election law, permitting
 noncitizens to vote but not to run for office (see Section 3), proved controversial, as
 did questions about the implementation of the law on language (see Sections 3 and
 5). In answer to the need for increased dialog with the Russian-speakingcommu-
 nity, the President organized a roundtable composed of representatives of the Union
 of Estoman Nationalities, political parties, and the Representative Assembly elected
 by the Russian-speaking community. At the beginning of 1993, a CSCE long-term
 mission began operations in Estonia and has been carrying out successfully its man-
 date of promoting stability, dialog, and understanding between the communities in
 Estonia.
 Another area of concern involved the physical and psychological abuse of pris-
 oners--a set of conditions remaining from the era of Soviet rule that the Govern-
 ment has been slow to rectify.
 In May Estonia was admitted to full membership in the Council of Europe.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known instances of
 such killing in 1993. There were, however, reports of the death of persons in custody
 from the use of force by other prisoners.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known instances of abductions or disappear-
 ances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such practices are prohibited by law, but the harsh treatment of prisoners, physical
 and psychological abuse, overcrowding and detention under extremely unhealthful
 conditions that were the rule during the Soviet period continued. There have been
 unsubstantiated reports of excessive use of force and police brutality during the ar-
 rest and questioning of suspects. The conditions of severe overcrowding and idle-
 ness, particularly at the Tallinn pretrial detention prison built in 1765, did not
 change. A Danish Helsinki Watcl report issued in early 1993 strongly criticized
 n   nditions, as well as the severity of sentences received by young offenders.
 AIkeugust jurisdiction over the prison system was transferred to the Minist  o
 Justice from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. At the request of the Ministry of us-
 tice, CE experts studied Estonian prison conditions in September in order to make
 recommendations on steps to bring them into accord with CE standards.
 At the end of November, the Estonian police were criticized by several par-
 liamentarians and the media for public endangerment and excessive use of force
 during and after the arrest of the leader of a voluntary paramilitary unit alleged
 to have information about a businessman missing since September. An official gov-
 ernment commission was established to investigate the incident.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and laws forbid arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile. There were no known instances of Estonian authori-
 ties' engaging in such activities. Under the Constitution, warrants issued by a court
 are required to make arrests. Detainees must be informed promptly of the grounds
 for the arrest and given immediate access to legal counsel. If a person cannot afford
 counsel, the State will provide one. A person may be held for 48 hours without for-
 mally being charged; further detention requires a court order. A person may be held
 in pretrial detention for 2 months; this may be extended up to a total of 9 months
 
 
 862
 
 by a court order. Police on rare occasions violate these limits. Pretrial detainees ac-
 count for about 20 percent of the total prison population.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution establishes a three-tiered court
 system for the independent judiciary: rural and city courts, district courts, and the
 state court. The district and state courts are also courts for "constitutional super-
 vision." At the rural and city level, court decisions are based on majority rule, with
 a judge and two lay judges sitting in judgment. The judicial reform law went into
 effect on January 1, 1993, but implementation was delayed until September 15 be-
 cause of the difficulty in filling vacant judgeships.
 The Constitution provides that court hearings shall be public but may be closed
 by the court for specific reasons, such as protection of state or business secrets or
 of the interests of juveniles. It further provides that defendants may present wit-
 nesses and evidence as well as confront and cross-examine government witnesses.
 Defendants have access to government evidence and enjoy a presumption of inno-
 cence.
 Estonia continued to overhaul its criminal and civil procedural codes. An interim
 criminal code that went into effect in June 1992 basically revised the Soviet crimi-
 nal code, eliminating, for example, political and economic crimes. New draft codes
 were not completed before the end of 1993.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Esto-
 nian law requires a search warrant for search and seizure of property. During the
 investigative stage, warrants are issued by the procurator upon a showing of prob-
 able cause. Once a case has gone to court, warrants are issued by the court. The
 Constitution guarantees secrecy of the mail, telegrams, telephones, and other means
 of communication. Police must obtain a court order to intercept a person's commu-
 nications, and illegally obtained evidence is not admissible in court.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Nress.--Constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech
 and press are generally respected, but the media are relatively restrained in prac-
 tice. While the press and broadcast media criticize the Government, they rarely sin-
 gle out individual officials because of harsh libel laws that put the burden of proof
 on the media. There is no evidence of punishment or threat of punishment for ex-
 pressing antigovernment sentiment.
 The most widely read papers are Rahva Haal, Postimees, and Molodyozh Estonii.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines are readily available but are very expensive for
 most people. The Government still provides most newsprint and printing and dis-
 tribution facilities. There is no indication that it used this control to influence the
 print media, although there may be an inherent risk of a chilling effect. The Govern-
 ment is trying to privatize the last remaining government-owned papers. There are
 two major national Russian-language dailies, Molodyozh Estonii and Estoniya, in
 addition to several local Russian-language newspapers in northeast and southeast
 Estonia. The two major dailies receive the same indirect government support that
 major Estonian language dailies receive: below-market rent on a government-owned
 press building and cheap printing through a government-controlled printing com-
 pany.
 State broadcast media continue to receive large subsidies, but there are several
 independent television and radio stations throughout the country. There is one na-
 tionwide state television channel. The state television com any has reduced its
 funding of the retransmission of Russian-language channeIs from Moscow from
 three to one. There is a state-funded Russian language radio channel on AM, FM,
 and Russian bands, as well as an independent Russian-language FM station in
 Tallinn which reaches an estimated 100,000 listeners. No decision on the ultimate
 fate of the state-funded Russian channel had been made by year's end.
 There is complete academic freedom in Estonia. Research is conducted in Esto-
 nian, Russian, English, and German. Advanced degree study is almost always in Es-
 tonian.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble freely. Noncitizens are prohibited by the Constitution from
 joining political parties but may form social groups. Permits for r.11 public gatherings
 must be obtained 3 weeks prior to the date of the gathering. The authorities have
 wide discretion to prohibit such gatherings on public safety grounds but seldom ex-
 ercise it. Numerous mass gatherings and political rallies took place peacefully in
 1993 without government interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of conscience and of religious proselytism is pro-
 vided for by law and honored in practice. There were no known instances of dis-
 crimination based on religious belief. There is no state church.
 
 
 863
 In May Parliament passed the Law on Churches and Religious Organizations
 which requires all religious organizations to have at least 12 members and register
 with the lnterior Ministry and the Board of Religion. Leaders of religious organiza-
 tions must be Estonian citizens with at least 5 years' residence in Estonia, but this
 requirement has not led to any complaints.
 d.Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law permits free movement within the country, and it is honored
 in practice. It also guarantees the right of foreign travel, emigration, and repatri-
 ation for Estonian citizens.
 In July Parliament adopted an Alien Registration Law that defines the status of
 aliens. It provides for the registration of aliens who came to reside in Estonia under
 Soviet rule and the phasing out of Soviet external and internal passports over a 2-
 year period. Retired career military officers can obtain residence permits provided
 they were born prior to January 1, 1930, or their spouses or minor children are Es-
 tonian citizens residing in Estonia who are in possession of a permanent residence
 permit or whose sojourn in Estonia is deemed necessary for the State. The Govern-
 ment maintains, however, that applicants do not have to prove that they cannot ob-
 tain Russian citizenship in order to receive aliens' passports. Six retired officers of
 the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB) and the State Military Administra-
 tion (GRU) reportedly faced deportation at the end of 1993 when their residence
 permits were not extended by a district administrator in Vilandi. They were issued
 temporary 6-month residence permits on the understanding that they would depart
 Estonia in the spring of 1993. By the end of 1993, they were still in Estonia, al-
 though their status continued to remain unclear.
 No restrictions are placed on the right of resident aliens to foreign travel, emigra-
 tion, or repatriation, and they face no difficulties in returning to Estonia after a trip
 abroad. Noncitizens, however, may have difficulty in acquiring the necessary docu-
 mentation to travel abroad. The Russian Government no longer supplies blank ordi-
 nary foreign passports of the former Soviet Union to enable the Estonian Govern-
 ment to issue non-Estonian citizens travel documents. Due to their short supply,
 passports of this type are issued only to those departing Estonia permanently. Ordi-
 nary Soviet foreign passports are valid for non-Estonian citizens to return to Esto-
 nia only if they bear a stamp from the Citizenship Department, indicating that the
 holder is authorized to return to the Republic of Estonia until July 12, 1995, or until
 the expiration date of the residence permit. By July 1995, all resident aliens must
 possess either passports issued by their country of citizenship or aliens' passports
 issued by the Estonian Government into which their residence and work permits
 will be placed. The Government expects to issue aliens' passports in the first half
 of 1994 to noncitizens resident in Estonia who cannot obtain a passport from their
 country of citizenship, as well as to stateless people.
 Claiming lack of resources, the Government does not accord refugee status or asy-
 lum, but there were no reports of any persons seeking asylum in Estonia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. In September 1992, they
 elected their first post-Soviet Parliament in accordance with the Constitution adopt-
 ed by referendum in June 1992. The 101-member Parliament (Riigikogu or State As-
 sembly) elected by secret ballot in multiparty elections, confirmed the Prime Min-
 ister, who put together a coalition Government based on a slim parliamentary ma-
 jority. The next regularparliamentary elections are scheduled for March 1995.
 The Law on Local Elections, passed on May 19, permits noncitizens to vote in
 local elections but not to run for office. Noncitizen officeholders were not allowed
 to seek reelection or run in local elections, although in a substantial number of
 cases the Government made arrangements for accelerated naturalization so that
 these noncitizen candidates could become citizens before the local elections took
 place, allowing them to run for office.
 In the wake of the political controversy and tension over the Alien Registration
 Law, the city councils of Narva and Sillamae decided without government approval
 to conduct referendums on July 17 on whether the cities shouldbecome autonomous
 units within Estonia in which all inhabitants would enjoy equal rights. About 60
 percent of the local population voted, and almost all voted for autonomy. The Gov-
 ernment did not try to stop the referendums from taking place. Estonia's legal chan-
 cellor ruled the referendums unconstitutional and without legal effect, and the State
 Court subsequently upheld these rulings, which local officials in Narva and Sillamae
 announced they would respect.
 On October 17, new local government councils were elected in cities and parishes
 by secret ballot in multiparty elections. About 170,000 noncitizens registered to vote
 
 
 864
 nationwide. There are, however, no nationwide statistics on how many noncitizens
 actually voted, but turnout was apparently higher than among Estonian citizens.
 The issue of citizenship continued to be a central political issue in 1993. Political
 debate moved from who is to be automatically considered a citizen to naturalization
 requirements and, specifically, the requirement to know the Estonian language. Par-
 liament spelled out the content of the lanuae requirement and authorized the
 Government to relax it for persons born before 1930 and those with certain disabil-
 ities. The Parliament also waived the language requirement for any applicants
 among the resident aliens who had registered as citizenship applicants with the Es-
 tonian Congress in February 1990. In March Parliament amended the law to apply
 retroactively so that citizenship is transmitted at birth through either citizen par-
 ent; the 1938 law only allowed fathers to pass on citizenship to children.
 The Citizenship Law, adopted in February 1992, implemented the 1939 Citizen-
 ship Law and a     coverec naturalization requirements, including, among other
 things, a 2-year residency requirement to be followed  a a 1-year waiting period
 as well as knowledge of the Estonian language. The implementation law provided
 that the 2-year residency requirement could be met by residency starting on March
 30, 1990. Thus, any noncitizen who had resided in Estonia since that date was eligi-
 ble to apply for Estonian citizenship as of March 30, 1992. The 1-year waiting period
 would make them eligible for naturalization on March 30, 1993. The law allows the
 Government to waive requirements for applicants who are ethnic Estonians or who
 have performed valuable service to Estonia. As of October 15, only 19,316 aliens had
 applied for and received Estonian citizenship. Some observers attribute the rel-
 atively low number thus far to the fact that people need more time to decide what
 citizenship they wish to pursue.
 It is possible that the language requirement was one reason for the low number
 of ethnic Russians applying for naturalization. The pamphlet outlining the language
 requirements for citizenship was initially published only in Estonian but has since
 been made available in Russian. Furthermore, while some enterprises organized
 free language courses for employees and unemployment offices provided some in-
 struction to those out of wor , many people had to finance their own instruction,
 and some ethnic Russians cited cost as a precluding factor. After an applicant has
 submitted his citizenship application, he must pass the language examination with-
 in 9 months. The applicant is allowed one attempt to pass the examination; retired
 people generally are allowed two attempts. The applicant who fails must reapply for
 citizenship, tri g  the 1-ear waiting period again.
 Article 16 o the  itizens ip Law Implementation Act provides that applications
 for naturalization shall not be accepted from "(I) foreign military personnel on ac-
 tive service; (2) persons who have been in the employment of the security and intel-
 ligence organizations of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; (3) persons who
 have been convicted of serious criminal offenses against persons or who have a
 criminal record of repeated convictions for felonies; and (4) persons lacking a legal
 steady income."
 The Alien Registration Law, which went into effect in July, excludes the same cat-
 egories for residency permits as does the Law on Citizenship for citizenship. The
 Alien Registration Law, however, provides for a review of those excluded for resi-
 dency permits, while those excluded from naturalization under the Citizenship Law
 have no appeal rights.
 In July 1992, aLer they realized that noncitizens would not be permitted to par-
 ticipate in the parliamentary or presidential elections, a dozen moderate Russian
 politicians formed an organization to "protect the interests and rights of
 noncitizens." On January 30, 1993, the Russian speakers' Representative Assembly
 held a congress attended by over 300 delegates and elected a presidium. During de-
 bate over the Alien Registration Law, the Government officially registered the As-
 sembly on July 6. The Assembly played an active role in the President's roundtable
 (see Section 4), and a number of its candidates were voted into local office in the
 October 17 local elections.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government and poli-
 tics; 12 of 101 members of Parliament and 2 of 14 government ministers are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not restrict the formation or functioning of human rights
 organizations. In response to criticism about the treatment of ethnic minorities, the
 President established a Human Rights Institute that convened for the first time cn
 December 10, 1992. The purpose of the Institute is to monitor human rights in Esto-
 nia and to provide information to the international community. It investigates re-
 ports of human rights violations, such as allegations of police abuse. In addition, be-
 
 
 865
 cause of tensions surrounding the adoption of the Elections Law and the Alien Reg-
 istration Law in July, the President established a roundtable composed of represent-
 atives of the Union of Estonian Nationalities, political parties, and the Russian-
 speaking population's Representative Assembly.
 Because of the Russian Federation's continued allegations of the 'massive viola-
 tion of the human rights" of the Russian-speakingpopulation, Estonia requested the
 CSCE to establish a mission of long duration in Estonia. The mission, which began
 operations in February, had not found a pattern of human rights violations or
 abuses by year's end. It has been actively engaged in helping to alleviate political
 and social tensions. The mission is approved on a 6-month basis and has already
 been extended once.
 Numerous international and nongovernmental human rights groups visited Esto-
 nia in 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, nationality, religion, skin color, extrac-
 tion, political or other beliefs, as well as economic or social status or for any other
 reason, is prohibited by the Constitution.
 Women.-Women possess the same legal rights as men and are legally entitled
 to eual pay for equal work. In practice men and women tend to get equal pay for
 equal work, although there are female- and male-dominated professions. Most
 women carry major household responsibilities in addition to their employment bur-
 den. Women make up slightly over one-half of the work force. There has been no
 organized effort by women's groups or others to make this an issue of public policy.
 There is little public discussion of violence against women. Women's rights groups
 have not been notably active or effective in asserting women's rights.
 Children.-Estonia has demonstrated a strong commitment to the rights and wel-
 fare of children. Estonia became a party to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of
 the Child in November 1991, shortly after it was admitted to U.N. membership and
 adopted its own domestic child protection law, patterned on the U.N. Convention,
 in June 1992.
 During 1993, the welfare of children received increased public attention as eco-
 nomic dislocation tended increasingly to disrupt family life. Social welfare workers
 at their own initiative established several small safe havens for children. Non-
 governmental child welfare societies received and distributed international humani-
 tarian aid to children. In addition, all children under the age of 14 receive monthly
 government support payments of about $6 (90 Estonian crowns) paid to the parents
 on behalf of children.
 There is no pattern of societal child abuse.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-In July the President established a round-
 table to promote constructive dialog among Estonia's ethnic groups and political par-
 ties representing them. A cultural autonomy law for minority grups was adopted
 by theParliament on October 26 and declared into law by the President on Novem-
 ber 11.
 Relationships between Estonians and the large ethnic Russian community remain
 tense. During the years of Estonia's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union,
 large numbers of non-Estonians, predominantly Russians, were brought to Estonia
 both on a permanent and temporary basis to work as laborers and administrators.
 These people and their descendants now make up approximately one-third of the
 total population. About 8 percent of the population of the pre-1940 republic was
 Russian.
 Non-Estonians, especially Russians, continued to allege job, salary, and housing
 discrimination because of Estonian-language requirements for certain jobs. They are
 fearful that laws discriminating against them may be adopted. Estonian law makes
 no distinction on citizenship or other such grounds as to who may enter into busi-
 ness or own property (other than land). All residents of Estonia may participate
 equally in the privatization of state-owned housing.
 Estonian-langu age training is accessible. Estonian-language requirements of the
 1989 language law for those employed in government offices and in the service sec-
 tor went into effect on February 1, 1993. The language office is authorized to grant
 extensions--and has done so liberally-to persons who can explain their failure to
 meet their requisite competence level in 4 years. A separate law covering the lan-
 guage requirement for citizenship was passed in February. It established the pro-
 ficiency level required. Russian representatives charge that the language require-
 ment was too difficult. The examination fee for either language test-for employ-
 ment or citizenship-is 15 percent of the monthly minimum wage, although it is
 waived for the unemployed.
 
 
 866
 In districts where the language of more than one-half of the population is a lan-
 guage other than Estonian, the inhabitants are entitled to receive official informa-
 tion in that language, and the local government may conduct business in that lan-
 guage. (See also Sections 2.d. and 3 for a discussion of laws on citizenship and
 aliens.)
 People with Disabilities.-There are constitutional protections against discrimina-
 tion of people with disabilities. While there is no legal discrimination against dis-
 abled individuals, little has been done on a societal or governmental level to enable
 disabled people to participate normally in public life. There is no public access law,
 and very little has been done voluntarily.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution guarantees the right to form and
 join freely a union or employee association. The Central Organization of Estonian
 Trade Unions (EAKL) came into being as a wholly voluntary and purely Estonian
 organization in 1990 to replace the Estonian branch of the official Soviet labor con-
 federation, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTU). Workers
 were given a choice as to whether or not they wanted to join the EAKL. While in
 1990 the AUCCTU claimed to represent 800,000 members in Estonia, in 1992 the
 EAKL claimed to represent about 500,000 members, organized in 30 unions. In 1993
 EAKL's membership dropped to some 330,000, organized in 27 unions. The EAKL
 explains the drop in membership by the breakup of large government-owned enter-
 prises and privatization. A new Public Service Workers Union was organized in late
 1993; it has a membership of some 40,000, most of whom are also EAKL members.
 The right to strike is legal, and unions are independent of the Government and
 political parties. There were no strikes in 1993. There are constitutional and statu-
 tory prohibitions against retribution against strikers. Unions may join federations
 freely and affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While Estonian workers now
 have the legally acquired right to bargain collectively, collective bargaining is still
 in its infancy. The Government remains by far the biggest employer, with about 70
 percent of the work force. According to EAKL leaders, the distinction between man-
 agement and labor is not widely understood, and few collective bargaining agree-
 ments have been concluded between the management and workers of a specific en-
 terprise. The EAKL has, however, concluded framework agreements with producer
 associations which it hopes will provide the basis for specific labor agreements. The
 EAKL was also involved with developing Estonia's new Labor Code covering employ-
 ment contracts, vacation, and occupational safety. The Labor Code prohibits
 antiunion discrimination, and employees have the right to go to court to enforce
 their rights. In 1993 a collective bargaining law, a collective dispute resolution law,
 and a shop steward law were adopted.
 No export processing zones have been established.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the Constitution and is not known to occur. It is effectively enforced by
 the Labor Inspections Office.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to labor law, the statu-
 tory minimum age for employment is 16. Minors aged 13 to 15 may work with writ-
 ten permission of a parent or guardian and the local labor inspector, if working is
 not dangerous to the minor's health, considered immoral, or interferes with studies,
 and provided that the type of work is included on a list the Government has pre-
 pared. State authorities effectively enforce minimum age laws through inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government, after consultations with the
 EAKL and the Central Producers Union, sets the minimum wage and reviews it
 monthly. In late 1993, the minimum wage was $23 (300 Estonian crowns) per
 month. The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide a worker and family a decent
 standard of living. It has not been increased since October 1992. About 3 percent
 of the work force receive the minimum wage. The average wage is about three times
 the minimum.
 Under a law adopted by Parliament at the end of the year, the standard work-
 week was reduced to 40 hours. There is a mandatory 24-hour rest period in the
 workweek.
 According to EAKL sources, legal occupational health and safety standards are
 satisfactory, but they are extremely difficult to achieve in practice. They are sup-
 posed to be enforced by the Labor Inspections Office, the effectiveness of whuch may
 improve with experience.
 The overriding concern of workers during the period of transition to a market
 economy is to hold on to their jobs and receive adequate pay. Workers have the
 
 
 867
 right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to con-
 tinued employment.
