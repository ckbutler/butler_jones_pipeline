 FRANCE
 France is a democratic republic with constitutional provisions
 for human rights, freely functioning political parties, and
 regular elections. Voter participation (with universal
 suffrage) is high. Elections at the local as well as national
 level are occasions for ideological and topical debate.
 France has a highly developed industrial economy comprising a
 mixture of public and private enterprises. The present
 Government has been denationalizing key industries, banks, and
 certain services.
 French authorities normally respect human rights and civil
 liberties and have taken steps to protect the rights of
 minority groups. A firm counterterrorist policy has helped to
 reduce, but has not eliminated, violent incidents perpetrated
 by small extremist groups.
 The promotion of human rights is a principal tenet of French
 foreign policy. French leaders speak out frequently on
 worldwide abuses of human rights and often refer to the
 protection of these rights within France. Since 1986 a
 Secretary of State for Human Rights has overseen human rights
 issues relating to both domestic policies and foreign affairs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Indigenous terrorist groups, primarily the Basque and Corsican
 separatist organizations, took responsibility for a number of
 violent, politically motivated incidents on French soil in
 1987. The most lethal of these attacks was the machinegunning
 of a police patrol in Corsica in which two officers died.
 Counterterrorist successes of the French internal security
 services, however, led to a sharp decrease in terrorism of
 Middle Eastern origin for the first time since the early
 1970's. The French leftist terrorist group Action Directe
 also appeared quiescent for the first time in a decade,
 following the arrest of its four leaders in February.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence that French security services have
 engaged in abduction or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 France does not condone or practice torture or cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 French law guarantees freedom from arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus
 in the French legal system, but there is a limit of 2 days--4
 for drug and terrorist cases--before a suspect must be
 transferred to a magistrate for investigation.
 The French judiciary plays a determining role in the detention
 process. Government authority to hold a person beyond the
 
 
 909
 FRANCE
 prescribed periods is severely restricted, and such detention
 must be ordered by the competent court.
 The Government in 1987 pursued its policy, initiated in 1986,
 of expelling to Spain certain Basque separatist activists
 suspected of participating in or providing logistical support
 for the Spanish Basque terrorist organization Basque Fatherland
 and Freedom. The Government expelled over 100 additional
 Basques in 1987 under this policy, which is allowed by a 1945
 legal procedure called "absolute emergency," under which the
 Government can expel without legal proceedings foreigners
 suspected of posing a threat to the security of the State.
 As part of its firm counterterrorist policy, the French
 Government also applied this legal expulsion procedure to
 several dozen foreigners suspected of participating in or
 aiding Middle Eastern terrorist groups. Those expelled
 included persons of Iranian, Lebanese, Algerian, and Tunisian
 nationality.
 In general, the Government still sets great store by France's
 tradition as a refuge for victims of political and religious
 persecution.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in France.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Suspects have the right to legal
 counsel as soon as their cases are transferred from the police
 to the magistrate. For misdemeanors, pretrial confinement is
 limited normally to 4 months, with extensions in special
 circumstances of approximately 8 to 12 months. However, in
 drug cases (all of which are handled by the courts as
 misdemeanors), pretrial confinement may be unlimited. For
 felonies, pretrial confinement is not limited. French law
 provides for the right of appeal, except in jury trials of
 felony cases. An appeal to the Cour de Cassation is possible
 in felony cases, but this Court rules only on procedure. No
 appeal that involves review of the facts of the case is
 possible.
 Trials in France are normally open and public, but provisions
 exist for the defense to request a closed proceeding. The
 press has free access to records of court proceedings,
 although under French law the prosecutor may not disclose
 information about cases being tried or investigated. There is
 no evidence that the authorities detain any person for
 political reasons.
 Pending completion of legislative reforms, legal proceedings
 have been suspended against persons whose requests for
 conscientious objector status were rejected. There are still
 some persons, however, serving prison terms imposed prior to
 1983 by the now defunct Permanent Tribunals of the Armed
 Forces because they did not present such requests and refused
 military service.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from invasion of privacy is guaranteed by French law,
 and this freedom is respected in practice. The search of a
 private residence requires a search warrant and must take
 
 
 910
 FRANCE
 place between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. except in special
 circumstances, such as drug cases, when the search may be
 undertaken at any time. Telephone conversations may be
 monitored in conjunction with criminal proceedings with a
 court order and in national security cases with administrative
 approval from the agency conducting the investigation. The
 authorities have occasionally opened correspondence to enforce
 currency regulations, though this is not a widespread practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and.Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Newspapers and magazines are free from government
 control and present views ranging across the political
 spectrum. In 1987 the Government carried out a promise to
 transfer to the private sector the influential, most-watched
 first TV channel (TF-I). There are three other private
 networks, including the well-financed, potentially very
 competitive La Cinq, as well as two state-owned networks,
 Antenne-2 and the regional network Fr3. Private radio
 stations have operated in France since 1983. Frequencies in
 Paris were reallocated in August 1987; similar reallocations
 will be carried out in other parts of the country. With these
 steps, the freedom and political independence of the broadcast
 media have been reaffirmed and strengthened.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is
 constitutionally guaranteed and usually respected.
 Labor unions have the right to organize free from government
 control. Although only one-fifth of labor is unionized, trade
 unions exercise significant economic and political influence.
 They participate actively in numerous tripartite (government,
 employer, and labor) bodies dealing with social matters,
 including labor courts and the Economic and Social Council, a
 constitutionally mandated consultative body. All unions are
 technically independent of the political parties, but many of
 the leaders of France's largest union, the General
 Confederation of Labor, belong to the Communist Party. (The
 General Secretary traditionally is a member of the Communist
 Party Political Bureau.) Leaders of most other unions are
 members of one or another faction of the Socialist Party,
 although members of other parties are also active in the labor
 movement. All unions and employer associations are very
 active in the International Labor Organization and other
 international organizations, including all three world trade
 union confederations. A Frenchman is President of the World
 Employers Association. French workers are free to strike,
 with a few minor exceptions in cases where strikes are
 determined to be a threat to public safety.
 c. Preedom of Religion
 Roman Catholics comprise by far the largest religious group in
 France. Separation of church and state is guaranteed by law.
 All religious groups function freely without persecution.
 Despite strong initial public opposition to proposed
 legislation regarding private (largely Catholic) schools, the
 Government in 1984-85 succeeded in passing compromise
 educational reform measures which allow public authorities
 
 
 911
 FRANCE
 some influence in private school personnel practices. Private
 and parochial schools receive substantial subsidies from the
 Ministry of Public Education.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 French law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. Arriving refugees,
 intending emigrants, and intending repatriates can undertake
 foreign travel and, in most instances, return to France.
 Although proposed new measures to control immigration could
 sharply restrict the right of some aliens to settle their
 families in France and would narrow the eligibility rules for
 those seeking French nationality, France has an extensive
 record of refugee aid and resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens
 before the law, without regard to origin, race, or religion.
 All French citizens of both sexes who have reached majority
 may vote. These provisions are fully respected in practice.
 A wide variety of political parties compete freely in
 elections. In addition to national, presidential, and
 legislative elections, there are regularly scheduled local
 elections. For several years, the Government has been
 transferring selected powers from the executive branch to
 locally elected assemblies. Many special interest groups--
 business, labor, veterans, consumer advocates, ecologists, and
 others--organize freely and regularly support candidates for
 elective office. A referendum on the future status of New
 Caledonia took place as promised on September 13, 1987, in New
 Caledonia, and an overwhelming majority of voters chose the
 option of having the island remain French.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 France has traditionally been a leader in the human rights
 area. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty
 International and the International Federation for Human
 Rights, operate freely in France.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The authorities do not condone discrimination based on race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. While
 isolated incidents of racial, religious, or political
 discrimination occur, particularly against the large immigrant
 community of Arabs and Africans, authorities consistently
 condemn such incidents. Food, shelter, health care, and
 education are available to all inhabitants.
 Women have equal status under the law but are engaged in
 continuing efforts to maintain and strengthen their rights. A
 women's bureau in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment
 is charged with promoting women's rights. The Government has
 taken steps to close loopholes in French legislation on sex
 discrimination in the workplace and. to eliminate sexist
 advertising. In 1985 it passed legislation to ensure more
 
 
 912
 FRANCE
 equality in marriage rights. Local programs to integrate
 women into the labor market have been implemented. Women's
 average wage rates in nonagricultural employment in 1985
 amounted to 81.4 percent of those'of men.
 The rights of linguistic and ethnic minorities are protected,
 whether in metropolitan France or in overseas territories
 subject to French authority. The right of immigrants legally
 admitted to France to coexist peacefully without assimilating
 completely into French culture is recognized. Legislation has
 been passed simplifying the expulsion of illegal immigrants and
 tightening immigration procedures. In metropolitan France,
 authorities have vigorously sought to apprehend extreme
 rightwing gangs that perpetrated several assaults against
 membert of minority groups, mainly Arabs, in 1987. In New
 Caledonia, deep-rooted antagonisms between ethnic communities
 exist, leaving a potential for violence. Exceptional measures
 by the Government could be required to quell"violence, if it
 were to erupt. Similarly, there is a potential for renewed
 violence in the overseas department of Guadeloupe.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 With a few minor exceptions for those enrolled in recognized
 apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may not
 be employed. Certain categories of work considered to be
 arduous and night work (10 p.m. to 5 a.m.) may not be performed
 by persons under the age of 18 or by women in manufacturing,
 mining, the public sector, unions, and nonprofit organizations,
 with the exception of women with managerial responsibilities.
 This prohibition does not apply to women in commercial
 establishments, entertainment, or the health sector where no
 manual work is involved.
 France has a minimum wage of about $4.60 an hour. The standard
 workweek is 39 hours, and overtime is controlled. In general
 terms, French labor legislation and practice, including that
 pertaining to occupational safety and health, are fully
 comparable to those in other industrialized market-economy
 countries. The minimum wage is somewhat less in the overseas
 departments, and not all social legislation applies in the
 overseas territories.
