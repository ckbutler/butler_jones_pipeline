 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Guinea-Bissau is a single-party state whose Constitution
 guarantees rights in accordance with the principles of
 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Government
 of Guinea-Bissau appears to be committed to upholding the
 human rights guarantees outlined in the Constitution. The
 Government has sufficient self-confidence in its adherence to
 the principles of human rights reportedly to have extended.an
 invitation to Amnesty International to visit the country.
 The origin of the Government -- a clandestine movement
 operating as an army of liberation whose principal goal was
 expulsion of the Portuguese administration -- is still
 reflected in occasional overzealous actions by the state
 security apparatus. Respect for human rights is made
 simpler by the absence of internal or external political
 threats to the government.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture.
 There are no reports of torture in Guinea-Bissau.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although not specifically prohibited by law, such actions
 are not countenanced in Guinea-Bissau.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Constitution guarantees the right not to be detained,
 arrested, or condemned other than according to the law
 in force. However, the Constitution also contains a provi-
 sion which can be used to deny rights and liberties to those
 who "encourage colonialism, imperialism, racism, or tribalism."
 While the number of persons serving sentences for political
 offenses is not known, the Department of State believes the
 number to be small. The largest number were detained as
 a result of the November 1978 attempted coup. Those involved
 have been tried by a court of law but not yet sentenced.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trail
 The right of defense is recognized and guaranteed to the
 defendant by the Constitution. There are no private attorneys
 in Guinea-Bissau, but the state provides "people's lawyers" for
 those who require legal representation. In the early days
 after independence a number of individuals arrested for
 political offenses did not receive public trials. In recent
 years, however, there have been no reported instances where
 defendants were denied fair public trials.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution guarantees the inviolability of domicile,
 and this guarantee is reportedly respected in practice.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The population of Guinea-Bissau is essentially rural.
 The economy is mixed, socialist/capitalist, but the State
 exercises the dominant role in virtually all sectors. The
 effect of 13 years of warfare and the accompanying disloca-
 tion of the population severely damaged the economy. The
 plan for decentralized development, which is a guiding
 principle of the Government, is unrealized as yet. There is
 little infrastructure and development projects have been kept
 close to the capital. Guinea-Bissau is a small, underdeveloped
 agricultural society that suffers from all the classic ills
 of such societies. A high illiteracy rate and widespread
 public health problems are being attacked by the Government
 through programs to provide free basic educational and health
 facilities in the countryside.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberites, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Criticism of and opposition to the current government and
 party, are not permitted. Guinea-Bissau's media are controlled
 by the government.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Foreign travel is limited, except to neighboring countries,
 because of difficulties in obtaining hard currency. Exit
 visas for foreign residents are required. The Department of
 State knows of no bars to emigration.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Guinea-Bissau is a single-party state and the ruling party
 for both Guinea-Bisau and Cape Verde is the African Party
 for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC).
 Opposition parties are not permitted. Any citizen over
 15 years of age has the right to vote. Non-party members are
 eligible for elected or appointed office. In parctice,
 office holders have usually joined the Party after election
 or appointment to government positions. Intra-party debate
 has so far been controlled by internal discipline. The
 overwhelming weight of the organizational structure has
 prevented disagreements which arise from becoming public.
 The popular National Assembly of Guinea-Bissau does not
 appear to have an active role in the Guinea-Bissau political
 system, although it does have the power to propose laws
 and make recommendations to the Government. Its essential
 functions are apparently that of a ratifying body and communica-
 tion channel back to the general population. Assembly
 Deputies are not popularly elected, although the Constitution
 
 
 91
 provides for eventual direct election. At present, they are
 selected by the directly elected Regional Councils and must
 be approved by the ruling party. The government and official
 party have encouraged full female participation in the
 society. PAIGC ideology and the Constitution recognize
 the full equality of all citizens.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Guinea-Bissau's response to such requests in the future
 would likely depend on the nature of the allegations and the
 reputation of the organization requesting the investigation.
 As stated earlier, the Attorney General of Guinea-Bissau
 has reportedly extended an invitation to Amnesty International
 to visit the country.
 The Attorney General's Office has received a $10,000 grant
 from the State Department's Human rights Fund for its new
 law school. The school, to train legal practioners and
 judges, will expand legal services and increase awareness of
 and respect for human rights in the country.
