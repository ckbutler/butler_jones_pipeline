 ANGOLA*
 The People's Republic of Angola is ruled by a small group of
 officials within a single political party, the Marxist Popular
 Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). President Jose
 Eduardo dos Santos is both head of state and chief of the
 party. The MPLA has established a one-party state with
 restrictions on freedom of expression and political
 opposition. All major policy decisions are made by the party
 Central Committee and Political Bureau. The intensification
 and expansion of fighting between the MPLA and the opposition
 National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to
 most areas of Angola accelerated the deterioration in respect
 for human rights through increased civilian casualties and
 disruption of the society in 1984.
 At independence on November 11, 1975, the three major
 opposition groups which had fought Portuguese rule were
 engaged in a bloody civil war, marked by the intervention of
 both Cuban and South African forces. With Cuban and Soviet
 assistance, the MPLA succeeded by early 1976 in ousting the
 two rival movements from Luanda, the capital, and took power.
 Both rival groups, the National Front for the Liberation of
 Angola (FNLA) and especially UNITA, have continued to wage
 guerrilla warfare against the MPLA. UNITA apparently has the
 allegiance of a substantial portion of the population, has
 steadily expanded the scope and level of its military
 operations (it controls approximately one-third of Angola's
 territory), and has extended guerrilla operations from the
 southeast into northern and western Angola. UNITA has
 publicly stated that it favors a government of national unity
 and has not sought to establish an alternate government.
 In addition to UNITA and the FNLA, the separatist Front for
 the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) continued
 during 1984 to conduct sporadic guerrilla operations in
 Cabinda.
 An estimated 30,000 Cuban combat troops support the MPLA
 forces in their operations against UNITA, including at
 strategic locations in central and southern Angola. The MPLA
 and UNITA, which have different ethnic bases of support,
 compete for the allegiance of civilian populations through
 both persuasion and intimidation and have accused one another
 of atrocities against civilians. Civilians are also caught in
 the middle of hostilities between the Southwest Africa
 People's Organization (SWAPO--a Namibian resistance movement
 with bases in Angola) and South Africa, which controls the
 territory of Namibia on Angola's southern border. SWAPO and
 South African forces have conducted military operations
 against each other in southern Angola. During 1984 South
 Africa occupied a salient in Cunene province in southern
 Angola, but has since agreed to a process of withdrawal.
 The intensified civil war has resulted in large numbers of
 displaced persons in central and southern Angola and has
 severely disrupted the economy and government administration.
 The low prices of oil and diamonds, the two principal sources
 of Angola's revenue, and disruption in food production and

 the People's Republic of Angola and thus has no diplomatic
 personnel on the spot to monitor human rights conditions or to
 evaluate allegations of abuses.
 
 
 ANGOLA
 transportation infrastructure caused by the hostilities, have
 exacerbated this serious economic situation. The intensified
 civil war has forced the Government to devote an even larger
 portion of its financial resources to the military. Both the
 MPLA and UNITA have made efforts to provide humanitarian
 assistance to the displaced persons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The intensified civil war in Angola has resulted in numerous
 allegations that MPLA, UNITA, and South African forces have
 killed civilians and that the MPLA and UNITA have executed
 political prisoners. While there is little specific
 substantiation of the various claims and counter-claims,
 circumstantial evidence indicates that all the parties have on
 some occasions arbitrarily executed prisoners.
 The fighting has also resulted in hundreds of civilian
 deaths. Some of these deaths were inadvertently caused by
 military operations, but others have been deliberately
 perpetrated by the opposing forces in order to intimidate
 civilian populations. Roads are mined in many places, and
 civilians have died as a result of guerrilla actions, such as
 attacks on trains. There are no reliable casualty figures.
 UNITA and the MPLA have both publicly and repeatedly accused
 each other of practicing terrorism against their respective
 supporters, including killing or maiming civilians. UNITA has
 charged that Cuban and Angolan forces have attacked
 civilians. No conclusive evidence exists to substantiate
 these claims and counter-claims.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no information to confirm that abductions, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detentions are practiced by the MPLA
 security agencies, or by UNITA, although both sides have
 accused each other of such practices. Amnesty International
 reported in its 1984 report that it was continuing to
 investigate the disappearance of political prisoners arrested
 in 1977 and 1978 by the MPLA authorities.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been persistent allegations of torture and
 mistreatment in Angolan prisons, but information is
 insufficient to determine the extent to which torture is
 practiced by the police, security services, and armed forces.
 The prisons are overcrowded, with substandard diet and
 sanitation, but these conditions seem to reflect the poor
 state of the economy rather than deliberate maltreatment.
 Some reports have alleged that foreigners are not well
 treated, but Americans who have been imprisoned in Angola have
 been relatively well treated and have had access to available
 medical care.
 Prison authorities reportedly have wide latitude in the
 treatment of prisoners. Treatment of political prisoners at
 
 
 13
 ANGOLA
 the prisons controlled by the Ministry of State Security
 reportedly is harsher than treatment in the regular prisons.
 Mistreatment reportedly includes solitary confinement,
 confiscation of personal effects, physical intimidation,
 including beatings and threats, and prolonged interrogation
 with the use of force. Prison visits appear to be arbitrarily
 restricted in many instances. Foreign advisers, including
 Cubans and East Germans, are involved in assisting the MPLA
 security services and may be involved in helping to run state
 security prisons. State security detention centers are
 scattered throughout the country, and very little information
 is available on conditions at these facilities. Captured
 UNITA supporters have been put on public display by the MPLA.
 There is very limited information available on the situation
 and administrative structure within the UNITA-held areas.
 Hence it is not possible to comment on UNITA practices in much
 of this report. It is known, however, that UNITA holds a
 number of foreign and MPLA prisoners, captured in the course
 of military operations, in makeshift facilities in its areas
 of control in southeastern Angola. There are no reports that
 UNITA has mistreated foreign or MPLA prisoners. During 1984
 UNITA cooperated with the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) in releasing foreign prisoners it held. None of
 those released alleged that they had been mistreated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Two of the most persistently and frequently reported charges
 of human rights violations have been arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment without due process. Numerous reports allege
 that individuals are arrested and imprisoned on suspicion or
 denunciation by others and, in some cases, held for years
 without being notified of the charges against them.
 Under Angolan law, persons suspected of committing serious
 acts against the security of the state may be held by the
 Ministry of State Security without charge for an initial
 period of three months, renewable for a further period of
 three months. Such detainees need not be presented to a judge
 within 48 hours of their arrest, as otherwise stipulated in
 the code of criminal procedure, and apparently have no right
 to challenge the grounds of their detention by invoking
 provisions of the code concerning habeas corpus. After six
 months' detention without charge, the detainee is supposed to
 be informed of the accusations against him, with the state
 security service either informing the public prosecutor of the
 case against the suspect or releasing him. Once the case is
 presented to the public prosecutor, there does not appear to
 be a specific time limit within which the suspect must be
 brought to trial. Many political prisoners have reportedly
 been held for years without being tried. The exact number of
 political prisoners is not known.
 The deterioration of the security situation has contributed to
 abrogation of judicial safeguards and due process. In 1983,
 the MPLA established regional military councils throughout
 much of Angola. The councils, responsible directly to
 President dos Santos, have the authority to restrict the
 movement of people and goods, as well as to requisition people
 and goods without compensation, and to try crimes against the
 security of the state. This was followed by creation of
 "people's vigilance brigades" for urban areas. The powers of
 the vigilance brigades are not clear, but they are tasked with
 
 
 ANGOLA
 general administration and "protecting the people and ensuring
 public order and stability."
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution states that no citizen shall be arrested and
 brought to trial except under the terms of the law and
 guarantees the right of the accused to defense, but there is
 insufficient evidence to determine to what extent these rights
 exist in practice. Amnesty International has expressed
 concern that defendants may not have been given adequate
 opportunities to defend themselves and often appeared to have
 received little real assistance from legal counsel during
 their trials. The right of appeal exists in some cases, but
 it is not known whether this provides a practical safeguard
 for the accused. Judicial lines of authority are unclear,
 especially since the new regional military councils have been
 given responsibility for the trial of offenses against the
 security of the state, including "economic crimes." It is not
 known which trials are public and under what rules of
 procedure the various military and civilian courts operate.
 The Constitution provides for a People's Supreme Court, but
 its jurisdiction is not known.
 In October a number of sentences were handed down in a case
 involving diamond smuggling and espionage which had received
 wide public attention both inside Angola and internationally.
 In the instance of the one death sentence (later commuted to
 six years imprisonment), the Government's case was based, at
 least partly, on highly questionable evidence and the
 defendant was apparently not given adequate opportunity to
 defend himself.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the
 home and privacy of correspondence, arbitrary searches of
 homes have been alleged, and there is some interference with
 private correspondence, either through censorship or
 interruption of delivery of mail.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of expression "in the
 context of the achievement of the basic objectives of the
 People's Republic of Angola." Censorship exists and the
 Government runs the media. Opposition views are not aired.
 The prominent Angolan writer Fernando Costa de Andrade
 Ndunduma was arrested in late 1982 and is still being detained
 for "improper use of the right of criticism" because he wrote
 and had performed a play critical of the President.
 The Government is especially sensitive to criticism in the
 foreign press. Angola has since independence in 1975
 restricted the travel of foreign correspondents to Angola and
 has occasionally expelled foreign reporters, e.g., an Agence
 France Presse reporter was expelled in mid-1983. Angola,
 together with the other "Front Line" States, endorsed the
 Kadoma Declaration in July 1983, banning the travel of South
 Africa-based correspondents to the Front Line States. The
 
 
 ANGOLA
 circulation of Western journals and periodicals in Angola is
 tightly restricted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is denied to any political group or
 movement other than the MPLA. All other political movements
 have been banned. The Angolan media frequently announce the
 arrest of UNITA sympathizers. There are numerous unconfirmed
 reports of arrests of people who voice support of opposition
 movements or alternative political systems. The recently
 established people's vigilance brigades and martial-law
 climate throughout the country tend further to restrict
 freedom of assembly and association.
 The only trade union movement in Angola is the National Union
 of Angolan Workers, which is controlled by the party and is a
 member of the continent-wide, Ghana-based, Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity. Traditional labor union activities
 and rights are tightly controlled by the Government. Strikes
 are prohibited by law as a crime against the security of the
 state. In 1984, the Angolan Government was cited by the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) in Geneva for being in
 violation of ILO Convention 105, which prohibits forced
 labor. The basis of this citation is Angolan legislation,
 still in force, which provides for the imposition of penal
 sanctions involving compulsory labor for breaches of labor
 discipline and participation in strikes.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution guarantees the inviolability of
 freedom of conscience and belief and provides for separation
 of church and state, the MPLA publicly emphasizes the
 importance of propagating *atheism' and has been critical of
 religious activities. The overwhelming majority of the
 Angolan population is Christian, however, and the MPLA has not
 moved to close down churches. Church services are regularly
 held and there is widespread attendance. Foreign and Angolan
 missionaries are allowed to carry out activities. Reportedly,
 UNITA allows religious liberty in the areas it controls and in
 which it operates, but obviously the ability of religious
 personnel to carry out activities in Angola has beerr
 circumscribed by the intensification of the civil war.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As a result of the intensification of the civil war, the
 Government is acutely security-conscious and has tightly
 restricted travel. Travel by road in most areas of Angola is
 dangerous. There is a pass system within Angola, and
 foreigners are generally prohibited from traveling outside the
 principal cities. The regional military councils are
 empowered to restrict the movement of people and goods. UNITA
 has publicly warned that it considers all of Angola to be a
 war zone and that it cannot guarantee the safety of persons
 traveling there.
 Angolan citizens are allowed to travel abroad, but this travel
 is carefully controlled by restrictions on passport issuance
 and exit visas, and by currency restrictions. Emigration is
 restricted. The Government limits travel to Angola through a
 selective and stringent visa policy.

 ANGOLA
 Angola is a signatory to the U.N. Protocol Relating to the
 Status of Refugees and has allowed refugees to enter Angola.
 There are approximately 70,000 Namibian, 20,000 Zairian, and
 6,000 South African refugees in Angola. Since mid-1980,
 between 120,000 and 150,000 former Zairian refugees in Angola
 returned home under the auspices of the U.N. High Commissioner
 for Refugees.
 The Government has offered amnesty to members of the
 opposition FNLA and claims that a large number of FNLA
 adherents and their families have surrendered to MPLA
 authorities, most recently at the end of September. It is not
 known how former FNLA leaders have been treated, but there
 have been some reports of the arrest and harassment of former
 FNLA sympathizers who have returned to Angola. Both as a
 result of fear of persecution and as a result of flight from
 hostilities, approximately 200,000 Angolans have taken refuge
 in Zaire since 1975, and an estimated 73,000 have taken refuge
 in Zambia. There have been indications in the past that the
 Government was pressing for the forcible repatriation of
 Angolan refugees in Zambia who are UNITA sympathizers, but
 this has not taken place; however, the Government cooperated
 in the repatriation of several planeloads of Angolans in early
 1984. Of the 400,000 Angolans who have left the country since
 independence, the Government claims that 180,000 have
 returned, but this claim cannot be verified.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Angola is ruled by a small group of officials within the party
 apparatus of the ruling Marxist-Leninist MPLA. The
 Constitution provides for popular participation in the
 political process, but the MPLA is the only legal party, and
 activities by all opposition groups have been banned.
 Citizens, therefore, do not have the right to change their
 government.
 In effect, political activity is limited to participation in
 the party or to one of its controlled and sanctioned
 organizations such as its youth wing, the Angolan Women's
 Organization, or %he trade union movement. The Government has
 established political institutions consistent with its
 ideology, with political power centered in the 11-member
 Politburo and 65-member Central Committee. Party membership
 is very restricted, with under 30,000 members out of a
 population of 7 million, according to the MPLA media. The
 Constitution provides that the popularly-elected national
 People's Assembly, established in 1981, is the supreme organ
 of state power. There are also people's assemblies at the
 provincial and local level. Only candidates chosen and
 endorsed by the party are elected to the people's assemblies,
 and key members of the party also hold leadership positions in
 the people's assemblies. The people's assemblies endorse
 measures proposed by the party at the national and local
 levels.
 Angolan citizenship is denied tO individuals who claim another
 nationality or who have committed homicide, opposed the
 "liberation struggle," or joined clandestine organizations
 opposed to the "decolonization process." Citizens 18 years of
 age or older are entitled to vote and hold office.

 ANGOLA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International stated in its 1984 report that it is
 concerned about the imprisonment of people for criticizing
 government policies or officials, long-term detention without
 trial, unfair political trials, and mistreatment of
 prisoners. Amnesty International has adopted the imprisoned
 writer Ndunduma as a prisoner of conscience, and claims to be
 aware of other long-term detainees accused of supporting
 opposition movements. Amnesty International has also appealed
 for commutation of death sentences imposed by the People's
 Revolutionary Tribunal and military courts, and has issued a
 report concerning its continuing concerns regarding
 extra-judicial executions and disappearances during 1977-1978.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has helped
 arrange the release of foreign nationals held by UNITA and has
 occasionally been allowed to visit prisoners held by UNITA.
 The MPLA has not allowed the ICRC to visit political
 prisoners. The MPLA has allowed the ICRC and United Nations
 International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) to operate in
 areas it controls, and UNITA allows the ICRC to operate in
 areas it controls or is contesting. Freedom House rates
 Angola "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The MPA has established as its goal the transformation of
 Angola into a "socialist" economy, and the.major sectors of
 the economy--oil, diamonds, and banking--have been
 nationalized. The right to private property is, however,
 guaranteed by the Constitution, and a small portion of the
 economy, mainly in the agricultural sector, still operates
 under private ownership.
 Although Angola is potentially one of the richest countries in
 Africa, its economy has been severely damaged as a result of
 this transformation in the midst of civil war, with attendant
 dependence on Communist-country support and disruption of
 agricultural production, plus the decline in the prices of oil
 and diamonds, its two principal sources of revenue, and by the
 exodus of skilled manpower. The intensification of the
 fighting has devastated the country's infrastructure and has
 forced the Government to divert most of its assets to the
 military. It has made virtually impossible further economic
 development, except the exploitation of offshore oil resources
 which UNITA has not attacked to date.
 Payments to the Eastern bloc for military equipment and for
 the Cuban combat troops have become a heavy burden on the
 economy. Although thousands of civilian Cuban and East
 European advisors are working in technical and professional
 positions, Angola still faces a critical shortage of skilled
 manpower. Of the approximately 500,000 Portuguese residents
 prior to independence, only-30,000 remain. UNITA's declared
 policy of targeting economic installations and its warning
 that foreigners working in Angola do so at their own risk have
 exacerbated the general economic problems.
 Some 200,000-500,000 persons in central, eastern, and southern
 Angola have been displaced from their homes as a result of the
 combination of civil strife and drought. They are suffering
 
 
 18
 ANGOLA
 from severe malnutrition and, in numerous cases, starvation.
 Many rural inhabitants have abandoned the countryside to seek
 food and safety in urban areas, such as Luanda, which have
 been overwhelmed by the influx. As a result of the rural
 exodus, crops are not being planted. There are severe food
 shortages in urban areas, and public services are severely
 taxed.
 In these circumstances, during 1984 the MPLA continued efforts
 to obtain food assistance from Western countries and various
 international organizations. A number of Western countries
 provide economic and technical assistance. ICRC and UNICEF
 are playing key roles in distribution of humanitarian food and
 medical assistance, including in UNITA-held areas.
 Available data highlight the poor quality of life. The
 population growth rate is 2.7 percent, with high infant
 mortality of 145.4 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy
 at birth of only 43 years. Health care is available to no
 more than a small fraction of the total population. Gross
 national product per capita in 1982 was approximately $939,
 but this reflects the oil revenues from the Cabinda field and
 has little meaning to the bulk of the population in the midst
 of civil war. The Government has concentrated efforts on
 improving the educational system, and there is a high level of
 enrollment in primary schools in non-combat areas. The
 current literacy rate is estimated at about 30 percent.
 Women participate in the MPLA, not only in the Angolan Women's
 Organization, but also in the higher levels of the party.
 Social, cultural, and traditional factors tend to limit the
 participation of women at the highest level of the party.
 Three members of the Central Committee are women.
 Both the MPLA and UNITA have primarily ethnic bases of
 support--the MPLA among the Kimbundu, and UNITA among the
 Ovimbundu. While they have worked with mixed success to
 broaden popular support, both groups show political favoritism
 towards their own ethnic group. There are no formal ethnic or
 racial restrictions on participation in the political process,
 and whites and mesticos occupy a number of high-level
 positions within the MPLA.
