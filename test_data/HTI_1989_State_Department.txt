 Haiti was ruled in 1989 by a military Government headed by Lt.
 Gen. Prosper Avril. Noncommissioned officers and soldiers of
 the Presidential Guard asked Avril to serve as transitional
 Head of State in September 1988 after they deposed General
 Henri Namphy, whose flagrant human rights violations had been
 widely condemned. Although the Government has its power base
 in the Army, all but one of the cabinet ministers appointed by
 Avril are civilians. Haiti had no legislative body in 1989.
 An independent electoral council began work in April to
 prepare for local, parliamentary, and presidential elections.
 Local elections were scheduled to begin in April 1990.
 The Haitian Army constitutes the state security apparatus. In
 urban reas, army units serve as police. In rural areas,
 Section Chiefs, who are approved by the Azmy but are
 responsible to the Ministry of Interior, serve as the rough
 equivalent of local sheriffs. There were credible reports
 that the army units serving as urban police were involved in a
 number of human rights violations during 1989; even more
 abuses took place in rural areas where Section Chiefs were
 often held responsible. Armed bands, some possibly linked to
 remnants of the Tonton Macoute militia (the security apparatus
 of the former Duvalier dictatorship), committed a number of
 murders.
 Haiti is the poorest and most densely populated country in the
 Western Hemisphere. Poverty, unemployment, and economic
 inequalities continue to plague all aspects of life for most
 Haitians. The embargo on most foreign government-to-
 government aid throughout most of 1989, imposed after
 disrupted elections in late 1937, further damaged the
 economy. Economic opportunities remain very limited for most
 Haitians.
 Human rights abuses perpetrated or directed by government
 leaders were the hallmark of previous Haitian regimes. The
 Avril Government avoided the egregious violations--massacres
 and politically motivated killings--characteristic of its
 predecessors. Also, despite some exceptions, the Avril
 Government in 1989 generally did not target political and
 human rights activists nor repress basic civil liberties, such
 as freedom of expression and freedom of the press. However,
 in late January, 1990, the Avril Government imposed a state of
 siege which suspended basic civil liberties, including freedom
 of the press, and arrested, beat, and deported a number of
 prominent opposition politicians. This action posed serious
 questions about the intent of the Avril Government to stand by
 its commitment to a transition to democracy.  Avril continued
 in 1989 an extensive housecleaning of the military and police,
 retiring or otherwise removing over 100 officers and enlisted
 men suspected of corruption or narcotics trafficking.
 Following an attempted coup d'etat in April, Avril dissolved
 the Dessalines Battalion, which was a source of numerous human
 rights violations in the past.
 Nonetheless, serious human rights violations persisted in
 1989. There were numerous reports of brutality and arbitrary
 arrest. In many cases, both in the capital and in the
 provinces, the inefficient and often corrupt judicial system
 failed to provide a speedy and fair trial to those accused of
 crimes. With the notable exception of former Macoute Augustin
 Majeure, who was sentenced in Gonaives in September to hard
 labor for life, perpetrators of past heinous crimes have not
 
 
 621
 HAITI
 been charged, arrested or tried. Few army personnel or
 Section Chiefs were punished for abuses committed in 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Politicel killings clearly sanctioned by high-ranking
 government officials, such as the massacres and assassinations
 of political activists that took place under the previous
 post-Duvalier governments in 1987 and 1988, did not occur in
 1989. In November unknown assailants murdered three political
 activists who were writing graffiti advocating the return of
 former President Manigat, but there was no substantiated
 evidence linking these apparently politically motivated
 killings to government forces. Nonetheless, as in previous
 years, individual soldiers and rural Section Chiefs committed
 a number of extrajudicial killings, either for personal
 reasons, at the behest of private patrons, or in clear abuse
 of their official powers. The Government announced
 disciplinary actions against several dozen soldiers and
 Section Chiefs charged with abuses; one, Lt. Antoine Metellus,
 was court-martialed and sentenced to a prison term, while
 others were transferred or relieved of their duties. However,
 Haitian human rights organizations report that the individuals
 implicated in the following incidents, chosen for their
 illustrative and not inclusive nature, have not been arrested
 or tried:
 On May 15, a group of soldiers from the St. Marc barracks
 accompanied a wealthy landowner, Chardieu Joseph, on a raid
 against a group of peasants in Grand-Bois, killing one,
 Registre Charlot. A group of peasants then took revenge by
 murdering Joseph's mother. The soldiers and Joseph responded
 with a further attack on the peasant village.
 On June 4, the Section Chief of Grande Saline killed two
 peasants and wounded five others who had been participants in
 a longstanding land dispute.
 On July 11, a group of soldiers from Petite-Riviere-
 de-l'Artibonite illegally entered the home of a peasant,
 Joannis Malvoisin, and killed him. Malvoisin had been
 involved in a land dispute with a wealthy landowner.
 On August 25, Port-au-Prince police officer Claudy Joachim
 shot and killed a man who was leaving the civil courthouse
 after responding to a lawsuit filed against him by a
 creditor. Joachim's motive is unknown.
 On November 17, three members of the party of former President
 Leslie Manigat were murdered, allegedly as they were putting
 up political posters. No perpetrators have been identified,
 although the Government has opened an investigation.
 The phenomenon of "popular justice" continued in 1989. Crowds
 summarily killed a number of individuals suspected of being
 criminals or former Macoutes.
 Many Haitians criticized the Government for failing to control
 a growing problem of common crime in Port-au-Prince, some of
 which involved murders and robberies. There were charges that
 
 
 622
 HAITI
 either military or rightwing elements were sponsoring criminal
 gangs for the purpose of creating a climate of fear and
 insecurity, thereby justifying continued military rule and
 repression of civil liberties. Although soldiers were
 suspected in some of these crimes, the perpetrators were
 usually unidentified. In an attempt to collect illegally held
 arms, the Government published lists of former civilian
 "attaches" of the Dessalines Battalion, many of whom were
 suspected of being henchmen of rightwing elements within the
 Army, and summoned them to Army headquarters to turn over
 their weapons. According to the Government, hundreds of
 illegal weapons had been collected by the end of the year.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no credible reports of disappearances in Haiti in
 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits physical brutality
 during interrogation and provides for the right of the accused
 to have a lawyer and witness present during questioning. In
 practice, however, beatings and other physical abuse of
 prisoners remain common in Haiti, despite official admonitions
 to soldiers and Section Chiefs. The following illustrative
 cases were well documented:
 On January 9, soldiers in the Carrefour barracks beat Ernst
 Louisdor, who had been accused by a sergeant of being a
 thief. Louisdor was subsequently hospitalized for internal
 bleeding.
 On June 17, Army officers ordered the beating of four members
 of the Popular Literacy Movement, fracturing the arm of one of
 them and damaging another's eye.
 On August 1, police in Cap Haitien tied up and beat National
 Popular Assembly (APN) activists Patrick Casimir and
 Jean-Robert Lalanne following a demonstration.
 In late August, police in Port-au-Prince severely beat Jacquet
 Douyon, a member of a church youth group.
 On November 2, three political activists were arrested and
 beaten. Jean-Auguste Mesyeux, Evans Paul, and Etienne
 Marineau were battered in appearance when they were paraded on
 a government broadcast. At year's end, the state prosecutor
 was preparing to try the trio for attempting to assassinate
 the President.
 None of the perpetrators of the above abuses were disciplined
 for these abuses, so far as is known.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Haitian law, a person may be arrested or detained if
 apprehended during the commission of a crime or pursuant to a
 judicial warrant based on evidence justifying the arrest. All
 detainees must be brought before a judge within 48 hours to
 determine the legality of continued detention, according to
 the law. If the judge determines that a legal basis for the
 arrest exists, the person may be held for further legal
 process; otherwise the'detainee must be released.
 
 
 623
 HAITI
 In practice, a poorly organized and sometimes corrupt legal
 system more often than not fails to adhere to the law's
 requirements. Arrests are frequently made without a judicial
 warrant, and most detainees are held for periods in excess of
 48 hours before being brought before a judge. Some detainees
 are never given the opportunity to challenge the legality of
 their imprisonment.
 Haitian law requires that a suspect be formally charged at
 least 2 weeks prior to trial,.and that the accused be
 permitted to meet with an attorney before trial. In fact, the
 absence of a public defender often deprives suspects of this
 right. There is no legal procedure for posting bail in
 Haiti. Judges, however, can and sometimes do grant
 provisional liberty to a prisoner.
 Numerous arbitrary arrests, i.e., illegal arrests without
 judicial warrant, were ordered by Section Chiefs or carried
 out by rural soldiers who became involved in personal quarrels
 or land disputes. In a few cases, illegal arrests appeared to
 be directed against individuals for political reasons, usually
 after being accused by local authorities of having
 participated in "Communist" or "disruptive" activities. In
 each of these cases, the detainees were released after periods
 ranging from 1 day to 3 weeks. The following cases were among
 the arbitrary arrests reported by human rights groups during
 1989:
 On February 6-7, Port-au-Prince police arrested, without
 judicial warrant, Rockefeller Guerre and Sylvan Jolibois, two
 opposition figures accused by the Government of participating
 in a bombing on February 5 during carnival.
 On August 14, the Section Chief of Jean-Rabel, Anovil St. Vil,
 arrested four members of the "Tet Kole" peasant group and
 incarcerated them in the prison at Port-de-Paix, allegedly for
 planning violence aimed at avenging the victims of a massacre
 at Jean-Rabel in 1987.
 On August 16-17, soldiers in Champagne arrested 23 members of
 a militant opposition group, the National Popular Assembly
 (APN), allegedly for "Communist activities."
 On August 20, soldiers in Labaret arrested three members of
 the Labadie Youth Movement (MJL) during a concert. On July
 10, the police had arrested four persons accused of being
 members of that organization.
 On November 22, the Army arrested 13 members of the League of
 Former Haitian Political Prisoners (LAPPH) in Anse-A-Pitres,
 allegedly for "disruptive activities" such as inciting the
 population to join a hunger strike in support of three
 imprisoned activists. Eleven were released about a week
 later; one was still held by the Army, and one was in the
 hospital due to injuries inflicted by army interrogators.
 Three other LAPPH members, including its Secretary-General,
 Gaston Jean-Baptiste, were also detained for several days in
 November.
 The Constitution prohibits deportation or forced exile of
 Haitian citizens. With regard to forced or compulsory labor,
 see Section 6.c.
 
 
 624
 HAITI
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution establishes an independent judicial branch of
 government and provides for the right to. a fair public trial,
 but chronic weaknesses in the judicial system, and sometimes
 interference by elements of the executive branch, can deny
 this right in practice. Many cases never reach the trial
 stage, and cases that do go to trial are often uifair because
 of corrupt or incompetent judges and the absence of defense
 attorneys. The Minister of Justice has been instructed to
 prepare an in-depth reform of the judicial system. In
 September he signed a contract with a private organization to
 provide education for the public and local judicial officials
 on their legal rights and responsibilities. The Government
 acknowledges that Haitian prisons have long held and continue
 to hold numerous detainees who were never publicly tried or
 convicted of any crime. The Minister of Justice ordered the
 release of 82 such prisoners from the National Penitentiary in
 May.
 Arraignments and trials are held in public and sometimes
 receive extensive media coverage. By law, defendants have the
 right to be represented by a lawyer. Lengthy delays and
 outside influence on judges and other judicial officials,
 however, often effectively limit the accused person's exercise
 of the right-to a fair trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 During 1989 there continued to be incidents in which police or
 Section Chiefs entered private homes without the required
 judicial warrant in search of suspects or illegal arms.
 Soldiers or members of the Presidential Guard searched homes
 without warrants looking for an ex-Sergeant allegedly involved
 in coup plotting. The home of Human Rights League president
 Joseph Maxi was searched on November 1 and 3 (Maxi himself
 went underground on the second occasion), and the home and
 offices of a peasant leader were searched on November 9.
 Although such searches continued despite legal sanction,
 systematic invasions of privacy, family, or correspondence did
 not occur in Haiti in 1989.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression for all citizens is provided for by the
 Constitution. There are several privately owned newspapers
 and radio stations, including influential stations owned and
 operated by the Protestant and Catholic Churches. A privately
 owned cable television system also operates independently.
 The Government operates a newspaper and a national radio and
 television station.
 Privately owned print and broadcast media in 1989 often
 expressed editorial views critical of the Government and
 freely reported the activities and declarations of government
 opponents. The Government imposed no censorship of the
 media. Several incidents of harassment of journalists by
 soldiers took place. There was no evidence that these
 incidents were part of any systematic effort to intimidate the
 free press; on the other hand, there was no known instance of
 soldiers being punished for such abuses.
 
 
 HAITI
 During the attempted coup d'etat in April, soldiers of the
 Presidential Guard were reported to have severely damaged four
 radio station transmitter facilities in Port-au-Prince.
 President Avril subsequently apologized to the owners of these
 radio stations but denied that the incident occurred under
 official orders.
 On February 15, soldiers from the Dessalines Battalion,
 apparently out of the control of their officers, struck
 several journalists who were covering a youth group
 demonstration in Port-au-Prince and confiscated some of their
 cameras and tape recorders.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association. Numerous political, human rights, and
 socioprofessional organizations were active in Haiti in 1989,
 and most operated without interference from the Government.
 Some rural military officials and Section Chiefs attempted to
 prevent peasant groups from holding meetings without obtaining
 advance permission from local authorities. In the village of
 Labadie, for example, local military officials insisted on
 being present at MJL meetings, citing security concerns as the
 justification for this policy. Human rights organizations
 contend that this practice represented an attempt by the local
 authorities to monitor and intimidate the group. Various
 human rights groups claim that the military or Section Chiefs
 continue to deter citizens from speaking out against the
 Government.
 Mass demonstrations were few in 1989. Several proposed
 demonstrations, such as an anti-imperialist march called by
 the APN in Port-au-Prince on July 28, failed to materialize
 due to poor attendance. Police dispersed some demonstrations,
 including those protesting anticontraband measures in January,
 but other rallies and meetings took place unhindered, such as
 an antigovernment rally of human rights and political groups
 in the National Theater on April 26.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religion is an integral part of Haitian life and culture and
 - is practiced widely without interference from the Government.
 Roman Catholicism is embraced in varying degrees by about 75
 percent of the population. Voodoo, a mixture of African
 animism and Christianity, is also practiced by a majority of
 Haitians. Various Protestant denominations and foreign
 missionary groups openly proselytize in Haiti. There are no
 government restrictions on missionary activities, affiliations
 with overseas coreligionists, or religious instruction and
 publishing.
 Attacks on churches, a series of which took place under the
 Namphy Government in 1988, did not recur in 1989.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Although the Government does not normally restrict domestic
 travel of citizens or foreigners, an irregular network of
 military checkpointsoperates across Haiti. On occasion,
 
 
 626
 additional vehicle checkpoints are established, generally to
 check for possession of weapons or 'for vehicle and driver
 documentation. There are no restrictions on persons changing
 their residences or places of emplbyment. Every Haitian
 citizen is eligible for a passport, and travel documents are
 neither issued nor denied on the basis of political
 considerations.
 Migrants continue to leave Haiti bound for destinations in
 more prosperous areas of the Caribbean or North America.
 Pursuant to a 1981 agreement with the Government of Haiti on
 the interdictioni of undocumented migrants, approximately 4,300
 would-be illegal migrants to the United States were
 repatriated to Haiti from international waters by the U.S.
 Coast Guard in 1989. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
 Service officers on board the Coast Guard vessels interviewed
 those interdicted to determine if any were potential
 applicants for political asylum. The overwhelming majority
 expressed only economic reasons for seeking to leave Haiti.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change
 their government through elections, but, in practice, Haitians
 did not, in 1989, enjoy this right. Following the 1986
 overthrow of the Duvalier dictatorship, violence and coups
 d'etat disrupted the electoral process in 1987 and 1988.
 President Avril has promised to restore elections and, as a
 first step, in February convened a forum, in which
 representatives of 28 political and labor groups participated,
 to determine the composition of an independent electoral
 council. The Council was subsequently created in accordance
 with the forum's recommendations. In September the
 Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), after consulting with
 groups and individuals across Haiti, announced an electoral
 calendar for local, legislative, and presidential elections
 during the period from April through November 1990. The Avril
 Government endorsed the schedule and has promised to abide by
 it:
 According to the 1987 Constitution, all male and female
 citizens 18 years of age or older have the right to vote.
 Voting is not mandatory but is noted in the Constitution as a
 citizen's duty. A secret ballot is not explicitly required.
 The Constitution provides for a 5-year presidential term as
 well as checks and balances between the executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches of government.
 In March President Avril restored 262 of the 298 articles of
 the Constitution. The entire Constitution had been
 effectively set aside by the previous military government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups operated in Haiti in 1989.
 The Government does not generally restrict their activities,
 which include monitoring of violations, providing legal
 assistance to victims, and holding seminars to educate the
 population on human rights. Two of these groups published and
 distributed monthly newsletters detailing human rights
 violations. However, the Army detained some 16 members of the
 LAPPH. One of them was hospitalized after being beaten during
 
 
 627
 HAITT
 an interrogation. The Army's action reportedly was to prevent
 the human rights group from opening an office in southeastern
 Haiti.
 During 1989 Haiti received visits from a U.N. Special
 Rapporteur on human rights, a representative of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross, and a delegation
 from Americas Watch and the National Coalition for Haitian
 Refugees. They met with government officials and numerous
 private sources.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Ninety-five percent of Haitians are descendants of African
 slaves who gained their independence from France through a
 revolution ending in 1804. Most of the rest are mulatto or of
 European or Middle Eastern descent. Under Haitian law, no
 distinctions are made with regard to race. Nonetheless, there
 are longstanding social, economic, and political tensions
 between blacks and mulattos which date back to Haiti's
 revolutionary period.
 Haiti has two official languages, French and Creole.
 Virtually all Haitians speak Creole. Approximately 20 percent
 of the population, mostly members of the educated class, speak
 French. There is no official discrimination on the basis of
 language, but some social class divisions are drawn along
 linguistic lines. Although most printed matter is in French,
 written media increasingly carryarticles in Creole. Creole
 is the dominant language in radio and television broadcasts.
 The Haitian Constitution makes no distinction between civil
 and political rights of men and women. The role of women in
 Haiti is limited by tradition, but there is no official
 discrimination between the sexes. Women enjoy legal rights in
 education, property, and voting.
 Violence against women occurs with some frequency although a
 lack of statistical data makes it impossible to determine its
 true extent. Such abuse is not sanctioned by the Government.
 Haitian law does not differentiate between domestic violence
 and general assault. Due to societal traditions, victims of
 such domestic violence as wife beating often are unwilling to
 press charges, thus leading to the likelihood that this abuse
 is significantly underreported. Human rights groups do not
 consider violence against women to be one of their primary
 concerns.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides workers, including civil servants
 and public sector employees, the right to form unions.
 Workers do not need government authorization to establish and
 join trade unions. A union, which must have a minimum of 10
 members, is required to register with the Ministry of Social
 Affairs within 60 days of its establishment. Unions are
 relatively free to organize but, according to Article 242 of
 the labor code, they may not engage in commercial activities
 or concern themselves with matters unconnected with the
 defense of worker rights. The Government would ultimately
 decide what constitutes worker rights. As far as is known, it
 has not challenged any unions or would-be unions on these
 
 
 628
 HAITI
 grounds. If it were to deny recognition to a union, the union
 would be 'denied access to labor courts.
 It is estimated that there are fewer than 10,000 full-time
 employed members who belong to local unions. In practice,
 attempts to form trade unions are generally frustrated by
 employers who prefer the status quo.
 There are four major labor federations in Haiti: the
 Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers (CATH), the Federation
 of Unionized Workers, the Confederation of Haitian Workers
 (CTH) (formerly CATH/CLAT), and the Independent General
 Organization of Haitian Workers. All have contact with
 international labor organizations. For example, FOS is
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions and its Latin American group, the Inter-American
 Regional Organization of Workers; and CTH with the World
 Confederation of Labor.
 Shortly after taking office, President Avril met with the
 leaders of three of the major labor federations'to revive the
 tripartite (labor, management, and government) negotiations on
 an amended labor code. In mid-1989 provisional agreement was
 reached on the various issues which divided labor and
 management. 'Labor representatives have since proposed
 additional changes, however, and then boycotted subsequent
 commission meetings pending resolution of another issue not
 directly connected to the revised code negotiations. At
 year's end the new code had not been issued.
 Chapter VI of the existing labor code recognizes the right to
 strike, although it restricts the duration of certain types of
 strikes. Strikes are not uncommon, but their legality is
 usually contested by the employer. Government employees in
 several cities staged protests, walkouts, and strikes,
 generally over arrears in pay. In almost all cases the
 workers eventually received their back pay, although some were
 subsequently dismissed because agencies' funds were not
 sufficient for their continued employment. The American
 Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations
 has alleged that workers fired in past years by their public
 and private sector employers for engaging in legitimate union
 activities still have not been accorded justice in the
 courts.
 Haiti's compliance with International Labor Organization (ILO)
 standards has been reviewed by a number of ILO supervisory
 bodies in recent years. In February 1989 the Committee on
 Freedom of Association (CFA), reviewing allegations of
 government and employer reprisals against the CATH after a
 2-day strike in 1987, noted that despite revoking the
 dissolution of the CATH and releasing detained trade unionists
 the Namphy Government did not compensate mistreated workers
 for their medical expenses or make full restitution of assets
 seized. The CFA also called on the Government to be more
 vigorous in seeking reinstatement of dismissed workers for
 their involvement in legitimate trade union activities. In
 1989 the ILO's Committee of Experts (COE) expressed hope that
 Haiti's new draft labor code would correct discrepancies
 between the present code and ILO Convention 87, which Haiti
 has ratified, regarding freedom of association.
 
 
 629
 HAT.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Haitian labor unions remain weak; forbidden under the
 Duvaliers until 1981, they were then allowed to operate only
 within strictly circumscribed limits. It was not until after
 Jean-Claude Duvalier's departure in February 1986 that unions
 were allowed to organize freely.
 Formal union contracts do not yet exist; rather, informal,
 unofficial, mostly unwritten agreements, and in some cases,
 tacit acceptance, allow the presence of unions in plants.
 Although unions have become relatively more active in
 grievance negotiations, formal management recognition of
 unions as bargaining agents is not yet the norm. Even with no
 government interference, the relatively new phenomenon of
 trade unionism has developed erratically in Haiti, where
 unemployment is estimated to affect 50 percent or more of the
 available work force, and where many employers still question
 the legitimacy of unions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The labor code prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and there
 were no charges of such practices in 1989.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for factory employment is 12 years. Fierce
 adult competition for jobs ensures that child labor is not a
 factor in the industrial sector. In both rural and urban
 areas, children often work at odd jobs to help supplement the
 family income.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor code (last revised in 1984 and now in the process of
 being liberalized) governs individual employment contracts,
 protects apprentices and women, and establishes minimum health
 and safety standards, particularly for hazardous occupations.
 The code sets the normal workday at 8 hours, and the workweek
 at 48 hours, with 24 hours' rest on Sunday. The code provides
 for paid annual leave of at least 15 consecutive working
 days. Workers may take up to 15 days' annual sick leave. The
 current daily minimum wage prescribed by law is $3.00 in
 Port-au-Prince and $2.64 in the rest of the country. The
 majority of the Haitian population subsists on much less than
 the minimum wage. According to a number of labor
 representatives from Haiti as well as from the United States,
 the Government has not systematically enforced labor laws
 regarding wages and minimum safety regulations, but the
 industrial sector generally adheres to at least minimum
 standards. The latter sector tends to be concentrated more
 heavily in the Port-au-Prince area and is more accessible to
 outside scrutiny. Economic factors in this sector render
 adherence to minimum standards relatively affordable as well.
