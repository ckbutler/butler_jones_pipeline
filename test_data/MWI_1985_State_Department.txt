 MALAWI
 The President of Malawi, Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, has maintained
 nearly undisputed control over political life and government
 since independence in 1964, and he was proclaimed "Life
 President" in 1970. Opposition to the Government is banned and
 challenges to the system are suppressed. Total loyalty, not
 merely passive acceptance of party and government policy, is
 demanded under penalty of suspicion, if not detention, by the
 authorities. Civil liberties exist at the sufferance of the
 authorities and are highly circumscribed. Political activity
 is limited to participation in the sole legal party, the Malawi
 Congress Party. Military, police, and party security organs
 form a pervasive network which monitors civilian activity
 throughout the land.
 Malawi inherited a parliamentary form of government from Great
 Britain. Elections are held every 5 years. Constitutional
 amendments and laws passed by the 101-member Parliament reflect
 decisions already taken by the President.
 Malawi is still a very poor country. However, since
 independence the Government has used good planning and wise
 investment of the limited available resources to promote
 economic development. An emphasis on agricultural production
 for food self-sufficiency and exports has gradually improved
 the standard of living.
 During 1985, two cases received outside attention from human
 rights groups. Appeals and inquiries were made on behalf of
 Orton and Vera, Chirwa, both serving life sentences for treason
 (commuted from death sentences in 1984). Amnesty International
 has also expressed concern for three journalists detained in
 March 1985, reportedly because of a misquote published in the
 local newspapers. At the end of 1985, the journalists were
 still being detained, although no charges had been made against
 them.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no allegations of politically motivated killings
 during 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 In the past, surreptitious detentions by the police, acting at
 the behest of the party, have been behind disappearances
 lasting from a few weeks to several months. There are no known
 instances in which such detentions have led to death. There
 were no known political disappearances in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Beatings by the police at the time of detention or arrest, or
 during interrogation, are not officially condoned but do
 occur. Prison terms of hard labor are the norm for common
 criminals, with political detainees normally receiving less
 harsh or degrading treatment. Prison conditions are generally
 poor.
 The Forfeiture Act permits the Government to revoke the
 property rights of those suspected of economic crimes. These
 
 
 196
 MALAWI
 actions sometimes have political overtones. When the
 Forfeiture Act is invoked, the individual--but not his
 family--loses all worldly possessions, including business,
 financial holdings, and personal possessions. Revocation of
 property rights constitutes an executive fiat with no judicial
 review. Notice of forfeiture must be published in the Official
 Gazette. There were no such cases published in 1985.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 At any given time a number of individuals are detained
 arbitrarily for real or perceived offenses against the party or
 Government. Malawi residents (including Africans and those of
 Asian extraction) may be picked up almost at the whim of the
 authorities, held without charge for varying lengths of time,
 beaten, and released after several weeks or months. The usual
 cause for such treatment is suspected disloyalty to the
 President or expression of views which differ even slightly
 from the accepted norm. An unknown number of political
 prisoners are said to be under a loose form of detention such
 as house arrest. Rarely are those so detained charged
 officially and brought before either traditional or modern
 courts. A suspect may also be held without charge for a long
 period of time while authorities develop a case. It is
 impossible to estimate the number of arbitrary detentions and
 arrests made in Malawi in 1985. Forced labor is not practiced
 in Malawi except as a form of criminal punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Those charged with criminal offenses are tried in either the
 traditional or modern court system, depending on the nature of
 the charge. Those charged under the military codes of justice
 are tried in military courts. Lawyers usually are not
 permitted to assist the defendant in traditional court cases,
 but legal counsel is permitted in the modern court system. In
 the latter case, the defendant has the right of access to
 counsel before and during the judicial proceedings. In
 practice, Government and party exert little control over the
 trial system in cases tried before the high court or magistrate
 courts; hence, the modern judiciary is almost totally
 independent of the executive branch, notwithstanding the fact
 that the President appoints the Chief Justice of the high court
 who, in turn, appoints other modern court justices. These
 courts are open to the public, and defendants are charged
 publicly.
 Traditional court justices are appointed directly by the
 President. The right of appeal exists in both the modern and
 traditional court systems. It is generally believed that there
 is little executive interference in traditional court cases
 dealing.in matters of customary law, and there is no evidence
 of indirect executive pressure on traditional courts
 adjudicating cases of a political nature. Although the
 decision is that of the Director ot Public Prosecution or the
 Attorney General, the recent trend indicates that political
 prisoner cases are likely to be tried before a traditional
 court, as in the Chirwa case. Amnesty International, in its
 1985 report, noted that Orton and Vera Chirwa, by being tried
 in a traditional court rather than a high court, were placed at
 a disadvantage: they were denied the right to legal
 representation and the rules of evidence observed in the high
 court did not apply.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In private life, most people are not unduly affected by
 governmentr authority. Malawian law calls for the issuance of
 individual search warrants before any home may be entered, but
 this is not always observed in practice. Police and
 quasi-military groups enter houses of suspects at will under
 special entry authority to conduct searches for people or
 incriminating evidence. Correspondence is monitored by the
 authorities, and those violating -prescribed norms are punished.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 .a. Freedom-of Speech and Press
 Criticism of the Government and its policies is not tolerated.
 This proscription extends even to the Parliament, where the
 expression of total loyalty to the President and his Government
 is both expected and enforced under threat of expulsion or
 worse. All media are under direct or indirect government
 control. The two newspapers and sole radio station disseminate
 news directly authorized by the Government Information Agency
 and operate under informal self-censorship guidelines.
 Recently, both media have exhibited increasing candor in
 coverage of international issues. In practice, the principal
 focus of government censorship is on. material-deemed critical
 of the Government. Some freedom of. inquiry into the natural
 and social sciences exists at the undversity level and may
 include some examination of-political-ideologies at radical
 variance with those of the Government,. provided this does not
 extend to explicit criticism of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals and organizations are generally-free to meet and
 associate as long as the purpose is. not to protest against
 government or party policy or practices. Professional,
 fraternal, and service organizations exist and are encouraged
 by the Government. No political meetings are permitted other
 than those of the party.
 Labor unions exist, but their activities are highly
 circumscribed and generally ineffective. Collective bargaining
 is allowed but its use is limited. Strikes are not legally
 prohibited but rarely occur. Labor- unions come under the
 Malawi Trade Union Congress, which, in turn, is subject to
 direction by the Ministry of Labor. With Government permission
 and supervision, the trade union organization associates with
 international organizations, and the Malawi Trade Union
 Congress is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. While the labor movement has yet to achieve
 significant gains for its constituents, the principal
 explanation for its failure is economic rather than political:
 the economy of Malawi can sustain only a small number of wage
 earners, most of whom occupy positions as unskilled laborers on
 large estate.farms.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is- relative freedom of religion in Malawi for all
 religions'whose particular religious tenets do not preclude
 recognition of the temporal authority of the state... Jehovah's
 
 
 198
 MALAWI
 Witnesses have been banned since 1967 because the Government
 considers the sect's activities to be disruptive of "the
 prevailing calm, law, and order." There is no state or
 preferred religion, and conversion from one religion to another
 is permitted. There are no restrictions on religious
 observances and ceremonies which do not impinge on government
 authority. Religious groups may establish places of worship
 and train clergy. There is no licensing of religious groups,
 but their publications, like all others, are subject to
 government censorship. Religious groups are free to establish
 and maintain links with coreligionists in other countries and
 are also free to travel abroad. Similarly, missionaries from
 abroad are permitted to enter Malawi and proselytize. There is
 no tie between any particular religion and the Malawi Congress
 Party.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Few restrictions are placed on movement within Malawi, but
 denial of passports on political grounds frequently extends to
 family members of persons in political disfavor and to those
 persons whom the Government suspects may criticize it if
 allowed to travel abroad. Legal provisions exist for
 restricting movement of those convicted of political or
 criminal offenses. Formal emigration is neither restricted nor
 encouraged. With the exception of a small group of political
 dissidents, there is no outward flow of Malawian refugees from
 the country. Expatriates born in Malawi may return.
 Citizenship may be revoked, but in practice this is not done.
 Malawi does not accord official refugee status but has given
 medical and other relief to displaced persons from neighboring
 countries and has pursued a policy of persuading rather than
 coercing them to return to their own lands. Asian residents
 and citizens are free to travel within the country but must
 reside and work in one of three urban areas (Lilongwe, Zomba,
 and Blantyre/Limbe). Within some of these urban centers,
 strict rules governing where Asians may own property result in
 limitations on where they may reside. Asian residents, whether
 Malawian citizens or not, have been compelled to transfer
 ownership of rural shops and trucking businesses to ethnic
 African Malawian citizens. Asians are free to expand into
 other areas of business, however, and industrial licenses for
 new Asian businesses are routinely granted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All political decisions are made either directly by the
 President or those few closely associated with him. No
 opposition political parties or movements are permitted.
 Membership in the only political party is not mandatory, but
 active membership is expected of those who aspire to government
 positions (including the civil service) or even professional
 success. Access to government services, and to some
 nongovernment services such as local markets, is frequently
 based upon party membership. Nearly half of the population has
 at least nominal party membership. The party's pervasiveness
 and broad-based structure provide for some choice among
 candidates for party, parliamentary, or other offices. For
 example, as was the case in the 1983 election, there are often
 three candidates for election to a parliamentary constituency.
 All nominees, however, are selected by the party and submitted
 to the President for vetting. Active campaigning is not
 
 
 199
 MALAWI
 permitted. The National Assembly (Parliament) consists of both
 elected and appointed members and is mainly concerned with
 ratifying government policy. Its powers are broadly based in
 law but highly circumscribed in practice. Women are entitled
 to party membership and voting rights, and hold 13 of 101
 elected seats in parliament. No women hold ministerial-level
 appointments.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit organizations such as the
 International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty
 International to conduct investigations in Malawi. No
 nongovernmental organizations devoted to the furtherance of
 human rights are permitted to exist. Expressions of interest
 in alleged human rights problems by outside groups or
 individuals are not welcomed and are usually ignored. Few
 government officials are even willing to discuss the subject of
 human rights. In its 1985 Report, Amnesty International
 continued to express concern about detentions without trial and
 the lack of effective safeguards against ill-treatment of
 political detainees. Freedom House considers Malawi "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Malawi is a small, densely-populated, landlocked country, whose
 principal assets are moderately fertile soil, good water
 resources, and a climate favorable to crop production. Despite
 the strides made since independence, Malawi remains one of the
 world's least developed countries. Per capita gross national
 product in 1984 measured only $200, reflecting the absence of
 any appreciable industrial base in the economy. Malawi's
 current population of 7.1 million people is growing at an
 estimated annual rate of 3.3 percent.
 Possessing no significant mineral resources, Malawi has since
 independence pursued a successful export-oriented agricultural
 growth strategy. The estate sector produces tea, tobacco, and
 sugar for export, while smallholders cultivate maize, and to a
 lesser extent, tobacco, cotton, groundnuts, and vegetables. In
 recent years, the country has been self-sufficient in food
 production and has exported surplus maize to its neighbors.
 Over 90 percent of the workforce is still engaged in
 subsistence agriculture.
 Beginning in the mid-1970's, the country experienced mounting
 balance of payments problems and a halt to economic growth, due
 to such factors as escalation in import prices of fuel and
 capital goods; cyclical swings in the prices of agricultural
 exports; and interruptions in and resulting higher costs of
 transport in traditional rail routes to the Indian Ocean. With
 assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World
 Bank, the Government embarked on an ambitious structural
 adjustment program aimed at restoring economic growth and
 achieving a sustainable balance of payments position. Economic
 growth has spurted in the last 2 years with gross domestic
 product increasing 4.5 percent and 6.8 percent in 1983 and 1984
 respectively.
 Life expectancy at birth is 45 years and the infant mortality
 rate is 159 per 1000 live births. About 37 percent of the
 rural population and 77 percent of the urban population have
 
 
 200
 MALAWI
 access to safe water supplies (1980). Calorie supply is 96
 percent of requirements (1977). Primary school enrollment has
 climbed dramatically since independence with the 1980
 enrollment ratio of school-age children estimated at 83 percent
 (male 95 percent, female 70 percent). The adult literacy rate
 is estimated to be 25 percent.
 The minimum working age is 14, though this applies only to the
 relatively small urban sector. Less than 15 percent of the
 work force is employed in the formal wage sector. For those
 fortunate enough to hold paid jobs, wages and working
 conditions are generally adequate, and paid holidays and safety
 standards in the workplace are required by law. However, wage
 levels are low, reflecting the abundance of .unskilled labor,
 and the Government's desire to limit the rural-urban income gap
 and hence the rate of internal migration.
 As mothers, women have enjoyed a high degree of access to the
 traditional health services and to extension programs geared
 toward improving women's homemaking abilities. Such programs,
 while beneficial, have failed to recognize the importance of
 women as agricultural producers in the rural sector (roughly 70
 percent of all smallholder farming and over 50 percent of
 subsistence holdings are headed by women) and the potential
 role women can have in the modern sector. Although males still
 have a comparative advantage in terms of educational and
 employment opportunities, the Government has initiated
 sufficiently broad-scale programs to begin to rectify the
 discrimination which exists. A third of the positions in the
 public education system have been reserved for women. Within
 Malawi's traditional and primarily matrilineal tribal
 leadership structures,.there are several small ethnic groups
 wherein women possess fewer rights and privileges and where
 female circumcision is occasionally practiced.
 Malawi enjoys a considerable degree of ethnolinguistic
 uniformity. The vast majority of the population speaks and/or
 understands Chichewa, which was declared the national language
 in 1968. English is the official language for government and
 business. Malawi's indigenous groups are sufficiently alike in
 culture and social organization to permit relatively easy
 interaction, including intermarriage, mixing in agricultural
 settlements, and mixed grouping for political purposes.
