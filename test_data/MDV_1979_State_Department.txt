 MALDIVES
 The Maldives is a far-flung country of 2,000 islands in
 the Indian Ocean, 400 miles from its nearest neighbor. It
 was governed as an hereditary sultanate for centuries. A
 British protectorate from 1887 to 1965, the Maldives in the
 past several decades has experimented with various forms of
 government, including an elected sultanate and republicanism.
 The present system provides for a strong executive president,
 assisted by a council of ministers, and an elected parliament,
 called Majlis, with legislative powers. In practice, the
 Maldive-shas been ruled in an authoritarian manner. However,
 an evolution to a less authoritarian system may have begun in
 November 1978, after there was a peaceful and constitutional
 transfer of power with the inauguration of a new President.
 The Maldives is a traditional Islamic society which has been
 experiencing rapid modernization in the past few years.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Under the Maldivian constitution, no person may be penalized
 except as convicted under Shariat Law (Islamic Code) or on
 conditions specified by law and "under no circumstance can an
 injury be inflicted". The Government does not condone
 torture. The former Minister of Public Safety is under in-
 vestigation for, among other things, the alleged ill treatment
 of several prisoners.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are currently no prisons in the Maldives; there is a
 detention center. Common forms of punishment are house arrest
 and banishment to uninhabited islands where the person must
 earn his own living but is otherwise unrestricted. The
 Shariat provides for corporal punishment but mutilation and
 execution have seldom if ever been used in the recent history
 of the Maldives. Crime is relatively rare among maldivians.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There is a long history in the Maldives of banishment of in-
 fluential persons for political reasons. Often such persons
 later return to positions of power. Under the present govern-
 ment, which has affirmed its commitment to the constitution's
 basic freedoms, the number of cases of house arrest or banish-
 ment for political offenses appears to have declined consider-
 ably, although no figures are available. A number of persons
 associated with the previous regime have been placed under
 house arrest for "contempt of the citizens' Majlis" in
 connection with its on-going investigation into excesses and
 unconstitutional actions by the former President and his
 administration.
 A suspect may be detained for two weeks in the detention
 center or under house arrest while a case is being investi-
 gated. By authority of the President, detention may be
 extended for another month.

 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system of the Maldives is derived from traditional
 Islamic law. The system is now administered by secular offi-
 cials, a chief justice and lesser judges on each of the 19
 atolls, who are appointed by the President and function under
 the Ministry of Justice. There is also an Attorney General.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 According to the Constitution, private premises and dwellings
 shall be respected and shall not be trespassed, save under
 conditions stipulated by law.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Fishing is the main source of individual income. Agriculture
 is minimal, and industry is practically non-existent. Basic
 food staples, including rice, have to be imported. With the
 assistance of international agencies, the government is under-
 taking programs to improve the economy, foster rural develop-
 ment and provide educational, health and social services to
 the people, particularly in the outer atolls. Past develop-
 ment has concentrated on the capital island of Male, where
 there is a good 48-bed hospital and the country's only second-
 ary schools. Current major schemes are the development of
 community health centers on the main island of each atoll, to
 be staffed by health workers trained in Male, and the con-
 struction of primary schools on the main islands. Outer
 island education traditionally has been provided by the
 mosques, some private schools and home education; literacy is
 said to be relatively high under the circumstances. In the
 tropical islands, provision of shelter does not appear to be
 a major problem, although in the capital of Male, whose
 population has burgeoned in the past decade, the leasing of
 house lots is at a premium and the Government is reclaiming
 land from the adjacent shallow sea to the maximum extent
 possible.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Maldivian constitution provides that every person has
 freedom of speech, press, assembly and association so long
 as the provisions of the Shariat and the Civil Law are not
 contravened. The new government of the Maldives has
 reiterated its commitment to these basic freedoms and is
 encouraging the development of a more democratic society. A
 much livelier press has developed in the country. There does
 not appear to be prior censorship, although all publications
 must be registered with the government. Newspapers appear
 to exercise a form of self censorship since journalists are
 subject to arrest and trial if articles are deemed to contravene
 a number of laws still on the books (such as one prohibiting the
 arousal of ill feelings against a lawfully formed government).
 One journalist is reported to have been banished for a
 brief period for an article offensive to the Government.
 The Republic of Maldives is an Islamic state. There are few
 if any Maldivians of other religions. Associations such as
 
 
 794
 societies, clubs, parties and companies, which do not contra-
 vene rules of behavior prescribed by the Shariat and the
 civil law, are permitted but must register with the Government.
 b. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no organized political parties in the Maldives.
 Candidates stand for election to the 48-member citizens
 Majlis, or Parliament, as individuals. Participation in
 the political system is open to all citizens. Women have
 the vote and may hold political office. The presidency is
 limited to men, and the President is chosen by the Majlis
 (in 1978, there were three candidates); selection is then
 confirmed or rejected in a referendum by secret ballot.
 Maldivian traditions limit women's role in society and in
 the political process, although women do share in the educa-
 tional and modernizing efforts of the country. There is no
 trade union movement in the Maldives.
 5.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 To the knowledge of the Department of State, there have been
 no requests for outside investigations of any alleged vio-
 lations of human rights in the Maldives.
