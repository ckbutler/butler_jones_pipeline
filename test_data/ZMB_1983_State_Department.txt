 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a one-party state with much of the decision-making
 power concentrated in the hands of the President, advised
 by a central committee of party leaders and governing through
 a cabinet and a parliament elected through controlled elections.
 The President possesses sweeping powers--conferred on him by
 emergency legislation which dates from 1964 and by his
 Presidency of the sole legal political party--to suspend
 observance of human rights in the "interest of state security."
 The Constitution also accords the power to the National
 Assembly to suspend basic constitutional guarantees.
 Candidates for political office at any level must be members
 of the United National Independence Party. A party conference
 meets every five years to choose a party candidate for the
 presidency. The candidate must then receive a positive vote
 of more than 50 percent of the electorate in order to become
 the national president. No opposition candidate was permitted
 to run in the October 1983 presidential election. Kenneth
 Kaunda received a "yes" vote of 93 percent and was reelected
 for his fifth consecutive five year term. Elections for the
 125 seats in the National Assembly were contested, however,
 in single member constituencies, with over 760 candidates
 running in 1983. The local interests of National Assembly
 members sometimes clash with the policy views of the party's
 central committee.
 In January 1983, the High Court convicted seven persons of con-
 spiring to overthrow the Government and handed down mandatory
 death sentences. The convictions are being appealed to Zambia's
 Supreme Court. During 1983, at least 20 presidential detainees
 were released. Internal security continues to be a sensitive
 issue, but there have been no detentions of prominent figures
 for over two years.
 Zambia's economy continues to be severely depressed due to such
 factors as low prices for the country's exports, a prolonged
 drought, statist policies which have led to inefficiencies, and
 a rapid rate of population growth which outstrips productivity.
 There has been a decline in citizens' standard of living, but in
 in recent months the Government has taken steps to improve the
 management of the economy and to remove some of the production
 disincentives, while maintaining delivery of a wide range of
 social services to the citizenry. The increasing incidence
 of urban crime and smuggling has taxed the limited capabilities
 of Zambia's police and military forces.
 Zambian institutions such as the judiciary, press, trade union
 movements, and churches have come under pressure from central
 authorities to be more responsive to the wishes of the Govern-
 ment, but have maintained to the best of their ability their
 objectivity, status, and influence. There has been no major
 change during 1983 in the status of human rights in Zambia.
 The country continues to serve as a place of first asylum
 for refugees in the region.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect For the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 No killing for political motives or unlawful or arbitrary depriva-
 tion of life by Government or any other group occurred in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 No case of politically motivated disappearance is known to have
 occurred during 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but there are credible alle-
 gations that police and military personnel have used cruel treat-
 ment when arresting persons and have resorted to torture when
 interrogating detainees. Charges of torture and mistreatment
 are reported freely in the press when victims register their com-
 plaints in court. The courts frequently order investigations to
 ascertain if confessions or statements were made After torture
 or physical and mental mistreatment. Courts have consistently
 rejected statements obtained under duress from arrested persons.
 Abuses of prisoners are reported to include beatings, pain in-
 flicted on various parts of the body, and long periods of soli-
 tary confinement. No known investigations or disciplinary
 actions have been taken against officials responsible in cases
 of alleged torture or mistreatment.
 Zambian prisons are overcrowded, understaffed, unsanitary, and
 lacking in rehabilitative facilities. Medical facilities are
 meager, but prisoners with serious medical problems are treated
 in public hospitals. Prisoners are generally segregated by sex,
 seriousness of the offense, and age group. There is no institu-
 tional differentiation in the treatment of different categories
 of prisoners charged or convicted under civil or criminal
 statutes, but presidential detainees receive better care in
 detention than that accorded common prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the state of emergency which has been in effect since inde-
 pendence in 1964, the President has broad discretion to detain or
 restrict the movements of individuals, a power which is exercised
 infrequently. Detention procedures have been revised to conform
 with provisions of the Constitution and have increased the
 President's authority.
 The President can incarcerate a detainee indefinitely and he
 is not legally bound to accept a court's acquittal if he still
 believes that the detainee is guilty. In practice, detainees
 are almost always released if the court finds in their favor;
 by law, presidential detainees are entitled to: formal receipt
 of the reasons for their detention; publication of their deten-
 tion in the Government Gazette; access to counsel; frequent
 visitation by family and colleagues; immediate representation to
 the detaining authority; and the right to seek judicial review
 
 
 423
 of the detention order after one year by an independent and
 impartial tribunal. Presidential detainees must have their
 cases heard by the High Court and have the right to appeal
 to the Supreme Court. While no exact figures are available,
 it is estimated that there are less than 20 presidential
 detainees currently held in Zambia.
 Habeas corpus is available to persons detained under presidential
 order, but the Government is not obliged to accept the recommen-
 dation of the review tribunal.
 Under the state of emergency, law officers and defense personnel
 have extraordinary powers. Police officers of assistant inspec-
 tor rank and above may arrest without a warrant and detain an
 individual for up to 28 days if the officer haS reason to believe
 grounds exist to justify a presidential detention order. However,
 police must within 14 days provide the detainee with reasons for
 his detention or the incarceration is void. This requirement is
 followed rigorously. Security officers have broad powers of
 search, and sometimes act without warrants when looking for
 smugglers or illegal aliens.
 There was no significant use of the President's detention
 authority in 1983. In most cases, detainees from past years
 have been been released or formally charged after their cases
 have been investigated--a slow process which can take from
 several months to more than a year. Detainees can sue the
 state for wrongful detention and false imprisonment; in the
 last year for which complete figures are available, 1981, the
 Government paid about $26,000 as compensation to 19 persons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Zambian judicial system consists of a Supreme Court with
 appellate powers and a series of lower courts--of which the
 High Court is the most important. Presidential detainees are not
 automatically guaranteed public trials, but the vast majority
 have been tried in public. The safeguards of English common
 law are provided in court cases not involving presidential
 detainees. Independent observation confirms the independence
 of the Zambian judiciary from executive branch influence. The
 President's power to appoint and transfer judges has sometimes
 been cited as having the potential to influence judicial deci-
 sions. However, there is no evidence that such power has swayed
 court actions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Zambian Government does not require membership in political
 organizations, and does not generally monitor correspondence or
 telephones, or otherwise interfere in family life. The sanctity
 of the home is generally respected, except in isolated incidents
 relating to the national emergency or to roundups and deporta-
 tions of illegal aliens. In these cases, security forces may not
 have search warrants. Such warrants can be issued by magistrates
 or police officers above the rank of sub-inspector.

 424
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are some restrictions on freedom of press and speech in
 Zambia. However, the press regularly reports criticism of some
 government activities expressed by sources ranging from elected
 officials to average citizens. The two national dailies are
 owned by the Government and party respectively, but some limited
 commentary critical of party and government performance is per-
 mitted, and the Times of Zambia, the party paper, is able to
 able to exercise some independence of outside direction. The
 papers can discuss certain types of topics, such as economic
 policy, corruption, and poor administration, but direct
 negative comments concerning the Head of State, the concept
 of the one-party state, national security issues, and the
 national philosophy, *Humanism," are prohibited. In 1983,
 the editor of the Times of Zambia was suspended for offensive
 reporting. Journalists and commentators know the limits of
 criticism, and are wary of reporting which could lead to
 charges of libel and slander. An independent bi-weekly paper
 sometimes critical of official policies is published by an
 association of churches, and two other independent papers focus
 on mining and financial subjects. Television and radio are owned
 and operated by the Government, but frequent panel discussion
 programs provide fora for a wide range of views on Zambian
 issues.
 While the possiblilty of censorship of foreign publications and
 news reports exists, it is not frequently invoked. The local pub-
 lishing industry turns out a steady stream of publications on
 various subjects within the government's guidelines, and political
 topics are among the best sellers. Academic freedom is highly
 respected in Zambian society, and Zambian educators are outspoken
 in their commitment to an educational system free of extraneous
 influence. There is little or no governmental interference in
 matters relating to curriculum, student selection, or faculty
 assignment.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Police permits are required for meetings and rallies or marches.
 These permits are issued routinely, unless the Government believes
 that the proceedings are likely to be directed against local au-
 thorities. While there is a ban on all political activity outside
 the one-party structure, Zambia has a profusion of trade associ-
 ations and professional groups which can serve as unofficial pres-
 sure groups on various economic, political, and social subjects.
 Zambia has a history of strong labor union organization, dating
 from the establishment of large copper mines during the 1930's.
 All of Zambia's eighteen national labor unions, which are organized
 by industry or profession, are members of the Zambia Congress
 of Trade Unions. Member unions attempt to defend workers
 interests and have the right of collective bargaining. Under
 
 
 425
 existing legislation, however, strikes are permitted only for
 specific reasons and only after all other methods have been
 exhausted. Virtually all strikes are illegal, since they almost
 inevitably must commence before the process of mediation has run
 its course. However, the Government has traditionally relied on
 persuasion and continued mediation to end strikes once begun.
 There were no major labor disturbances during 1983, and govern-
 ment leaders met frequently with the trade union congress
 officials in order to reach agreements on wage ceilings. Although
 the congress nominally operates under the supervision of Zambia's
 single party, it functions without party control. Union spokesmen
 frequently challenge government policy on such subjects as wages,
 conditions of service, overall economic policy, and labor repre-
 sentation in the legislative branch. Internally, the trade union
 congress is democratic and regularly conducts open elections to
 select its leadership.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and has been
 supported by President Kaunda. Zambia has no state religion
 and adherence to a particular faith does not confer either advan-
 tage or disadvantage. Christian missionaries from a wide variety
 of faiths operate freely in the country. While the Watchtower
 Sect (Jehovah's Witnesses) is prohibited from proselytizing, the
 sect functions openly and its freedom not to participate in
 various secular activities such as voting, singing the national
 anthem, and saluting the flag has been upheld in the courts and
 by senior party leaders. Lay associations and religious youth
 groups operate independently of party control or influence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The President may, under emergency powers, restrict the movement
 of individuals within Zambia. The Foreign Ministry requires that
 foreign diplomats apply for written permission to travel outside
 a 40 kilometer radius of Lusaka. The Government also reserves
 the right to refuse or to withdraw passports to prevent foreign
 travel by individuals whose activities are considered inimical
 to Zambian interests. However, strict currency regulations also
 serve to inhibit foreign travel or emigration.
 Acquisition, loss, and revocation of citizenship is governed
 by constitutional provisions and laws administered by the
 citizenship board. However, the President also has power to
 grant or revoke citizenship on an extraordinary basis.
 Zambia has long played host to a considerable refugee and
 asylum-seeking population that originates in several strife-torn
 southern African nations. Currently, total refugees numbers are
 as high as 90,000, with the largest group coming from Angola
 (approximately 65,000). There are also large groups from Zaire,
 Namibia, and South Africa. Smaller numbers are found from
 Mozambique and Malawi. The United Nations High Commission for
 Refugees has begun a refugee census and registration in
 order to obtain a more accurate picture of numbers and distri-
 bution, as well as to provide refugees with documentation as a
 means of protection. Many of the Angolans and Zaireans have
 spontaneously resettled in western and northwestern provinces
 
 
 426
 since the ethnic compositions on both sides of the border are
 similiar. The Zambian Government operates two large refugee
 resettlement camps and the South West Africa People's Organi-
 zation operates one other. Urban refugees number approximately
 700. Many experience difficulties in obtaining jobs and
 educational opportunities.
 Despite Zambia's reputation as a refugee haven, economic diffi-
 culties and political pressure from the refugees' countries of
 origin have resulted in several instances of forced repatriation
 in 1983. There are also formal deportation orders currently
 pending against some 100 refugees.
 Section 3  Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Zambia is a one-party state with power contrated in the hands of
 the President, advised by a central committee of party leaders,
 and who governs through a cabinet and parliament, the National
 Assembly. Under the 1973 Constitution, the United National
 Independence Party became the only legal party in Zambia. While
 exact figures on party membership are not available, it is esti-
 mated that less than ten percent of the adult population are
 party members. Standards for party membership are not exacting.
 Candidates for political office at any level must be members of
 the party and they are subject to close examination for suita-
 bility by senior party authorities. About five percent of the
 800 applicants who applied to contest the 1983 parlimentary
 elections were rejected by the party's central committee.
 There is considerable competition and multiple candidacy for
 parlimentary and lower level party positions.
 In 1983, some 760 candidates ran on single-member constituencies
 for the 125 elected National Assembly seats. Forty incumbents
 were defeated, including seven junior ministers (Ministers of
 State). The composition of the party's most powerful organ,
 the central commitee, is proclaimed once every five years at a
 national conference of party delegates selected from the party
 membership. In practice, the President plays a dominant role in
 determining central committee membership. The members of
 the cabinet are chosen by the President and serve at his
 pleasure.
 Expression of divergent political viewpoints generally decreases
 as one proceeds up the party hierarchy, but the National Assembly
 is reflective of constituent interests and sometimes thwarts or
 modifies executive branch policies and programs. Within the
 party framework, presidential and general elections are by
 universal suffrage, but the numbering of ballots (which could
 be cross-checked against voter registration numbers) could
 undermine the secrecy of the ballot. In practice, the Zambian
 political system is open to individuals of somewhat divergent
 opinions, provided they are willing to work within the one-party
 structure and not challenge the President's preeminent position.
 
 
 427
 In accordance with party and national constitutions, a party con-
 vention was held in August 1983, and the delegates nominated
 Kenneth Kaunda as the sole presidential candidate. In the
 October presidential election, President Kaunda was elected to a
 fifth term and received a positive, or "yes," vote from 93 per-
 cent of those casting ballots. Voters also had options of voting
 "no" or abstaining. A total of 63.5 percent of Zambia's 2.4
 million registered voters went to the polls in the October
 elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There is no record of the Zambian Government having been sub-
 ject to such investigations, queries, or messages during 1983.
 The Zambian Government generally does not encourage or hinder
 such investigations or visits by organizations such as Amnesty
 International. There are no local human rights groups operating
 in the country.
 In 1983, Amnesty International was concerned about the detention
 without trial of opponents of the Government and about reports of
 torture. Freedom House rates Zambia "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Zambia is presently in the midst of a prolonged economic re-
 cession, marked by high inflation, serious unemployment, and
 scarce financial resources. The application of various economic
 remedies since independence along socialist or centrally-managed
 lines has not lived up to expectations. Real per capita income
 has fallen below the level at independence, and due to recently
 depressed prices for Zambia's copper exports, even total real
 national income remains below the level reached in 1977. The
 expansion of social welfare programs has, as a result, had
 to be subordinated to overall economic needs.
 In the past year, however, Zambian Government leaders have
 taken several important measures designed to deal with their
 present economic plight. They have restricted public spending,
 reduced government subsidies, raised farm producer prices,
 devalued their currency, and come to terms with the International
 Monetary Fund for a one year standby program.
 The average income for rural inhabitants is estimated to be
 substantially less than one-third the average earnings of urban
 dwellers. This imbalance has generated heavy rural-to-urban
 migration (over 40 percent of the population is urban), exacer-
 bating already high unemployment in urban areas. Scarce foreign
 exchange, limited managerial skills, faulty planning,.and ineffec-
 tive government and party institutions continue to detract from
 the Government's ability to meet the economic needs of the people.
 Nationwide, unemployment is well over a third of the potential
 work force.
 
 
 428
 In addition, the gap between the rural and urban areas in
 terms of income, education, housing, nutrition, and the avail-
 ability of public services is considerable. Eighty-six percent
 of the urban population has access to safe water, for instance,
 as opposed to 16 percent of the rural dwellers. Within the
 population there are also significant inequalities. The top 20
 percent of households claims over 56 percent of the total income,
 the bottom 40 percent gets a mere 11 percent.
 Women participate increasingly in Zambia's social, economic, and
 political life. They hold some senior positions in the party,
 the Government, and the judiciary, and are gaining increasing
 representation in the professions and higher education. At the
 party's 1983 convention, a subcommittee for women's affairs was
 created. This action increased women's influence on the central
 committee by removing that area from the political and legal
 subcommittee and by giving women a subcommittee equal in stature
 to the other central committee components. The party also
 increased the number of women on the 25 member central
 committee from two to four. Nevertheless, the majority of
 Zambian women still occupy traditional roles in a society
 where urbanization and development have served to undermine
 such roles. Female participation in the wage labor force
 lags far behind that of males, and most of those women occupy
 the least remunerative jobs.
 Under statutory law, women generally enjoy full equality with
 men. Customary law and practice still compete on a de facto
 basis in some rural areas with Zambia's Constitution and
 codified laws. Some customary statutes which place women in
 a subordinate or unequal statutes include property inheri-
 tance and marriage. The Zambian Government and its Law
 Development Commission are seeking ways to remove anomalies
 in customary law which discriminate against women.
 Women are accorded an increasingly active role in the develop-
 ment process. According to recent primary school enrollment
 figures, about 89 percent (versus 101 percent for males) of
 Zambia's primary-age females are enrolled. Moreover, female
 students can be admitted to secondary school with lower passing
 marks than male students as part of Zambia's "affirmative action"
 program. However, because many women are burdened with heavy
 household duties, their opportunities for advancement lag behind
 those of men. within the context of Zambia's traditional
 society, their primary role is to have children. Zambia's
 population growth rate which stood at 2.8 percent in 1970
 is now 3.2 percent according to 1983 figures. From 1969 to
 1980 there was a 40 percent increase in population. The total
 fertility rate in 1979 was 6.1 live births per woman, one of
 the highest in the world. Life expectancy at birth is 46.7
 years for males, 50 years for females. Barring a dramatic
 turnaround in Zambia's economy, its ability to sustain even
 existing social services will be seriously strained in the
 future by its rapidly expanding population.
