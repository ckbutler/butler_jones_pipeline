 JORDAN
 Jordan is a hereditary monarchy with a constitution granting
 the King broad powers. The King forms and dissolves
 governments and is the ultimate arbiter of policy. The Prime
 Minister and the Council of Ministers (Cabinet), however,
 exercise considerable responsibility over many issues. The
 Constitution also provides for a bicameral parliament and an
 independent judiciary.
 Martial law has been in effect since the 1967 war which ended
 with Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Under martial law,
 some detained persons have been denied opportunity to
 communicate with concerned individuals for varying periods,
 usually not exceeding several months. Generally, however,
 martial law has not much affected the civil rights of
 Jordanians.
 Jordan has a mixed economy with government participation in
 certain sectors, largely in transportation and heavy
 industry. The Government of Prime Minister Zaid Rifa'i,
 formed in April 1985, has taken a number of steps to promote
 free enterprise. Declining foreign assistance, a weak
 regional economy, and other external economic factors have
 caused Jordan's healthy economic growth of the past decade to
 level off in recent years. While the economic adjustment has
 been difficult, Jordan's economic managers have sought to
 minimize its impact on the population.
 Riots at Yarmouk University and sporadic crackdowns on the
 press marred an otherwise unchanged human rights situation in
 1986. The absence of political parties, the continuance of
 martial law, and the scope of powers exercised by the police
 are areas of concern, but recent trends remain favorable. The
 increased opportunities for women in all areas of life, the
 continued importance given to the rule of law and an
 independent judiciary, and the gradual evolution of the
 Parliament (including recent byelections), have contributed to
 an improving human rights picture.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government dQes not sanction political killing. While
 there have been political killings by nongovernment groups in
 the past, there were none in 1986.
 There were no summary executions. Some Palestinians/West
 Bankers have been sentenced to death based on a Jordanian law
 permitting trials in absentia for selling West Bank land to
 Israelis, but these sentences have never been carried out.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no evidence that the Government condones or practices
 torture, although there have been reports of ill-treatment of
 detainees by police. Jordanian law provides for the decent
 
 
 1197
 JORDAN
 treatment of prisoners, and judicial authorities have been
 known to dismiss cases based on the apparent mistreatment of
 prisoners. In May 1985, the Director of Public Security
 established a special office to handle any public complaints
 of abuse by security officers and promised to punish offenders.
 A new prison (Juweideh prison) has been constructed and opened.
 Inmates of the old prison in Amman have been transferred to the
 new facility, and the Government plans to close the old prison.
 Prison conditions are Spartan by Western standards but not
 intentionally degrading. They are inspected by the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although Jordan has been under martial law since 1967, most
 persons are placed in custody by Jordanian authorities in
 accordance with the criminal code which requires imposition of
 charges within 48 hours. Persons may then be detained pending
 trial for 15 days, or longer if a court approves the
 prosecution's request for an extension. The criminal code is
 generally applied to persons arrested for designated martial
 law crimes, which include espionage, bribery of public
 officials, trafficking in narcotics or weapons, black
 marketeering, and security offenses. In the past, security
 forces have apparently detained incommunicado (or with limited
 outside access) some persons suspected of cross-border
 inflitration and security crimes. The General Intelligence
 Department (GID) can detain a person without trial for varying
 periods. However, under martial law provisions, such arrests
 should be confirmed within a maximum of 15 days by the Prime
 Minister or by local administrators serving as local military
 governors. Security detainees can be held without charges for
 indeterminate periods or can be formally charged and brought
 before the martial court for trial.
 Military prosecutors known to have conducted improper arrests
 and detentions have been disciplined and transferred to
 positions of lesser responsibility. A petition for judicial
 review of the legality of the arrest of any detained person
 may be brought before the High Court of Justice, but is
 unlikely to be granted for those accused of security offenses.
 On May 15, demonstrations at Yarmouk University, prompted by
 student dissatisfaction, developed into riots when security
 forces intervened. Three individuals were killed in the
 ensuing violence. Numerous arrests followed, including the
 arrest of all members of the Central Committee of the Jordanian
 Communist Party. Demonstrations in protest against the U.S.
 bombing of Libya also took place before the U.S. Embassy.
 Participants were subsequently arrested. Nevertheless, it does
 not appear that arrests for security reasons increased
 appreciably, if at all, in 1986.
 Compulsory labor is forbidden by the Constitution and is not
 practiced. There are no instances of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All criminal cases, except martial law crimes and crimes
 committed by military personnel, are tried in civilian courts.
 The legal code and the independent selection of judges help to
 assure a fair trial. Trials are held in open court, except in
 a few cases such as those involving sexual offenses.
 Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty and have
 the right to be represented by counsel, to prepare a defense,
 
 
 1198
 JORDAN
 to gross-examine witnesses, and to refrain from giving
 self-incriminating testimony. The court appoints a lawyer for
 those who cannot afford one if the potential sentence is
 execution or life imprisonment. An effective appeals process
 may be utilized by either the defendant or the prosecution.
 Death sentences are seldom imposed.
 Civilian judges must demonstrate legal competence in written
 and oral examinations before selection by a board composed of
 three judges, the Chief Attorney General, and the
 Undersecretary of the Justice Ministry. Judges may be removed
 from office only after serious transgressions of the law, i.e.,
 "bad conduct", and after a disciplinary board hearing. The
 disciplinary board is, in fact, the judicial council, composed
 of the first Chief, Court of Cassation, for all Jordan; second
 Chief, Court of Cassation for all Jordan; Chief, Court of
 Cassation for Amman; Chief, Court of Cassation for Irbid;
 Chief Prosecutor for Jordan; and a Judicial inspector
 (appointed by the Council itself). When a judge is brought
 before the Judicial council for alleged misconduct, the Council
 hears the matter, examines the defendant judge, and imposes a
 penalty--which can range from actual removal to the imposition
 of fines.
 The Government is reportedly establishing a judicial training
 institute. Apparently, very few people apply to become judges
 because of low pay and status, and the quality of the lower
 ranks of the judiciary is generally regarded as poor.
 Martial law crimes are adjudicated in a military court before
 a panel of three military officers trained in the law. In
 practice, the military court observes the law of criminal
 procedure, and defendants are given the same rights as in a
 civilian court. However, the very quick trials and subsequent
 sentencings of Communists in May suggest that there are
 exceptions to this norm. No right of appeal exists from
 decisions of the military court; however, sentences of the
 court for martial law offenses must be ratified by the Prime
 Minister in his capacity as Military Governor. He has
 authority to increase, reduce, or annul the sentences. The
 cases are reviewed for fairness by a legal advisor or the
 Justice Minister before the Prime Minister makes a decision.
 The military court also adjudicates all crimes committed by
 military personnel. In these cases, the Commander in Chief of
 the Armed Forces must ratify the sentences.
 Religious courts have jurisdiction over most family matters,
 such as marriage, divorce, child custody, or guardianship.
 The Shari'a (Muslim religious law) applies to Muslims in these
 areas, and a Shari'a court system handles disputes.
 Ecclesiastical courts handle similar matters for members of
 the main Christian sects. The civil courts administer the
 cases of other religious groups. Shari'a law, however, must
 be applied to questions of inheritance for all communities.
 There have been reports of the detention of persons for
 political reasons under the martial law regime, but there are
 no reliable estimates of the numbers.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is respected. Police searches of
 homes require warrants-except in rare cases involving security
 or the hot pursuit of fleeing suspects. It is believed that
 
 
 1199
 JORDAN
 security personnel sometimes monitor telephones and
 correspondence, but the practice is evidently not widespread.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution safeguards the freedoms of speech and press
 but permits limited media constraints under martial law.
 Jordanians freely express wide-ranging opinions, including
 criticism of the Government, in informal settings. Public
 debate is less pronounced but still notable in the state-owned
 radio and television networks, and the privately owned (but
 government-influenced) press, where a form of self-censorship
 persists. The Government provides editors with guidance
 occasionally on key foreign policy and security matters. On
 most other issues, government interference is minimal and
 critical commentary is tolerated. However, in mid-1986
 several journalists had their accreditation lifted for a brief
 period because of their criticism of the Government for its
 handling of the Yarmouk incident and Irbid byelections. At
 the time, there were reports that some 20 journalists of both
 local and foreign papers had been barred from writing and
 publishing. Western correspondents and resident Western
 writers have occasionally expressed concern over government
 interference with freedom of the press, and some local editors
 reportedly have complained that they are prevented from
 covering stories considered "sensitive" by the Government. In
 September and October, several journalists were barred from
 publishing after making political comments during a television
 interview outside Jordan, and a local cartoonist has been
 warned against continuing to publish cartoons critical of the
 Government or its policies. At present, government
 interference and censorship do not appear to impede the free
 flow of ideas and information. In the past, there have been
 reports that members of the press have been placed under house
 arrest or charged with membership in an illegal organization.
 Currently all journalists must register with the Information
 Ministry and join the Journalists Association.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely available, although
 they are subject to occasional censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public demonstrations require a permit, rarely granted, from
 the Interior Minister. All organizations require government
 approval and may not have political objectives. Government
 surveillance of public meetings, university activities, and
 organization gatherings is routine. Following the May 15
 riots at Yarmouk University, there were numerous arrests, a
 complete changeover in the University administration, and
 removal of the Interior Minister during an otherwise minor
 cabinet reshuffle.
 Jordanians are free to join labor unions and professional
 associations. These organizations require government licenses
 which are usually granted without difficulty. Unions and
 associations defend the interests of their members, and their
 officers are elected by the membership. Unions engage in
 collective bargaining. Strikes have been held iff the past, but
 none took place in 1986. Strikes are only permitted if the
 Ministry of Labor fails to act to arbitrate a labor dispute
 within 2 weeks after receiving a complaint from a union.
 
 
 1200
 JORDAN
 Strikes are not legal for government employees, who compose
 about half of the labor force.
 About 20 percent of the Jordanian work force is unionized.
 Seventeen unions comprise the Jordan Federation of Trade
 Unions (JFTU). Several other unions do not belong to the JFTU.
 Unions have virtually no political role and confine themselves
 to representing their membership in such areas as wages,
 working conditions, and workers' layoffs. Their effectiveness
 varies widely. The JFTU actively participates in international
 organizations such as the International Labor Organization.
 Professional associations for doctors, engineers, lawyers,
 pharmacists, and similar professional groups operate freely.
 They maintain influence with the Government in their respective
 areas of interest.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam, the state religion, is observed by well over 90 percent
 of Jordanians. However, the constitutional guarantee of
 freedom of worship is adhered to by the Government. There
 appears to be little discrimination against religious
 minorities, who are well represented at all levels in
 government, the military, and the business community. Laws
 making harassment of religious minorities a crime are enforced.
 A variety of Christian groups, including Catholic, Orthodox,
 Armenian, Protestant, and Seventh-Day Adventist, maintain
 churches, schools, hospitals, and other institutions. A small
 Baha'i community also exists. A few foreign clergymen reside
 in Jordan. Although proselytizing among Muslims is forbidden,
 conversion by Muslims is not a crime.
 All religious groups must register with the authorities in
 order to obtain official permission to operate in Jordan.
 However, there are instances wherein denominations failed to
 register but were nonetheless permitted to meet without
 harassment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within Jordan is unrestricted except in certain
 military zones. With a few exceptions (primarily military
 personnel and reservists who need permission for foreign
 travel), the Government does not restrict emigration or
 foreign travel. A woman must present the written consent of
 her husband, father, or male guardian to obtain an initial
 passport but thereafter may travel alone without restraint.
 Citizens who have left Jordan have the right to return. There
 are no reported cases of revocation of citizenship for
 political reasons. Jordanian courts hold that assuming a
 foreign nationality does not deprive a person of his Jordanian
 citizenship. Some citizens returning to Jordan, particularly
 those who have traveled to Communist countries, are questioned
 by the General Intelligence Department regarding security
 matters. The Ministry of the Interior formerly required
 permits for travel by Jordanians to Syria, but this provision
 was revoked in 1985-86. There are restrictions on travel to
 the West Bank, but the Government has recently taken steps to
 facilitate such travel.
 Jordan has faced a long-term refugee problem from the influx
 of Palestinians made homeless by the 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli
 wars. According to the most recent statistics, Palestinian
 
 
 1201
 JORDAN
 refugees and their descendants on the East Bank total about
 1 million, including approximately 203,000 living in refugee
 camps. The total includes refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli
 war and does not include a large but undetermined number of
 other persons from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Israel
 who have settled in the East Bank since 1948. Except for some
 refugees from Gaza, all have been granted Jordanian citizenship
 and have the unrestricted right to reside, work, and own
 property. While Gazans do not have citizenship, in 1986 they
 were granted for the first time the right to purchase land and
 own property in Jordan. Gazans enjoy the right to work as
 well. The Government now issues Jordanian passports to Gazans
 resident on the East Bank who can prove they were displaced
 prior to 1971. The Interior Minister routinely grants permits
 for travel between the East Bank and Israeli-occupied
 territories.
 Jordan has granted asylum even in cases which have strained
 relations with the neighboring states.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Executive and legislative powers are constitutionally vested in
 the King, who rules with the assistance of an appointed Council
 of Ministers. Parliament, reinstated by the King in 1984, is
 composed of an appointed senate and an elected lower house. It
 is overshadowed by the executive branch, but has the right to
 ratify royal decrees and laws proposed by the Council of
 Ministers. It is gaining in stature and functions with
 increasing effectiveness.
 The lower house still is composed largely of members elected
 in the last national election of 1967, although since then
 10 members for the East Bank have been elected directly and
 14 members for the West Bank have been elected indirectly. A
 full third of the 30 East Bank members were elected in
 byelections in 1984 and 1986. Since 1972 general elections
 have been deemed to be impossible because of continued Israeli
 occupation of the West Bank. Vacant East Bank seats have been
 filled through byelections which generally have been considered
 fair and open. A new Electoral Law passed in 1986 provides for
 expansion of lower house membership to 142 members and also
 establishes distinct electoral districts on the East Bank which
 will allot seats to refugee camps on the East Bank. Vacant
 West Bank seats are currently filled by the vote of the other
 members of Parliament. Parliament also has reserved seats for
 Christians and Circassians.
 Most municipal and town councils are elected by popular vote.
 The person receiving the highest number of votes is
 traditionally confirmed as mayor by the Minister for Municipal
 Affairs and then by the Prime Minister. However, the next
 session of Parliament is expected to consider legislation
 providing for the direct election of mayors. Women were
 enfranchised in 1973 and may also run for public office. King
 Hussein appointed the first female cabinet minister in 1979 and
 has continued to encourage the participation of women in the
 political process.
 Organized political parties are not permitted, although several
 informal political groups operate openly. The Communist Party
 is banned. All persons seek elected office as independents.
 
 
 1202
 JORDAN
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although in the past Jordan attracted little attention from
 either private or international human rights organizations,
 this is changing. In 1986 it received more attention and more
 criticism. The Jordanian lawyers' professional association,
 which has a human rights committee, continues to be relatively
 active in this area. Other local organizations and ad hoc
 groups also occasionally issue statements and petitions on
 such human rights concerns as Palestinian rights and the ban
 on political parties. The International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) maintains an office in Amman and its
 representative regularly visits prisons and detention
 facilities. He is allowed to meet all detainees in accordance
 with standard ICRC criteria. Members of the royal family have
 demonstrated interest in human rights. For example, Crown
 Prince Hassan is cofounder of the independent Commission on
 International Humanitarian Issues and chaired a 3-day seminar
 sponsored by the Commission in December on human rights and
 human welfare issues including refugees, famine, child abuse,
 and "mass expulsion of population groups from national
 homelands".
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women's role in society has been changing in recent years.
 Women now account for half the student body at the elite
 University of Jordan. At another educational level, a
 vocational training center in Amman teaches women to repair
 radios, televisions, and office machinery. Such changes in
 educational patterns are similarly reflected in the work force.
 Women today comprise about 20 percent of the labor force,
 compared to 4 percent in 1975. Women participate generally in
 subordinate positions and most heavily in clerical, teaching,
 and administrative jobs. There has been a significant
 increase in the number of women in such professions as
 medicine, engineering, and architecture. However,
 professional women and women's associations believe that more
 remains to be done to increase female participation in these
 areas. Women are also now officers in the police, and two
 female Jordanian pilots fly for Royal Jordanian Airlines.
 Women increasingly operate businesses. The Government
 encourages women workers by requiring maternity leave and
 child care centers at large establishments. However, these
 regulations are not enforced strictly. Women appear to be
 taking an increasingly active role in promoting their
 professional and employment rights. A recent controversy over
 a purported ban on the hiring of married teachers for rural
 areas provoked an effective response from women's associations.
 Equality between men and women is the legal norm. In practice,
 however, certain traditions can constrain women's freedoms, and
 the entry of women into professional and academic realms
 previously the traditional preserve of men can spark resentment
 and opposition.
 In matters of inheritance and divorce, women are treated
 differently. Under Islamic law, sons inherit twice as much as
 daughters. However, the son is required to use his inheritance
 for the maintenance of his mother and sisters, but a female is
 free to retain her inheritance for herself. Likewise, a man
 may obtain a divorce more easily than a woman, but he may be
 
 
 1203'
 JORDAN
 required to pay considerable compensation based on the marriage
 contract. A reformed divorce law increased compensation for
 women suffering from an arbitrary divorce. Women may also gain
 and retain custody of children until the children obtain their
 legal majority, but they may lose custody if they remarry.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Jordan's workers are protected by a comprehensive labor code
 enforced by inspectors of the Ministry of Labor. Children
 under age 13 are not permitted to work. Children age 13 to 15
 are allowed to work a maximum of 6 hours a day, but are
 forbidden to work at night (except with special permission)
 and in certain occupations regarded as dangerous. The
 Government prepares and adjusts periodically a minimum wage
 schedule for various trades based on recommendations of an
 advisory panel composed of representatives of workers,
 employers, and the Government. Maximum working hours are
 48 hours per week, with the exception of hotel, bar,
 restaurant, and movie theater employees who can work up to
 54 hours. Workers are entitled to a weekly day of rest, rest
 intervals during the work day, 2 weeks annual paid leave,
 2 weeks annual sick leave, and severance pay. The law
 specifies a number of health and safety requirements,
 including bathrooms, drinking water, safety equipment, and
 first aid equipment for workers. Jordan also has a worker's
 compensation law. The Government appears to administer and
 enforce its labor laws fairly.
