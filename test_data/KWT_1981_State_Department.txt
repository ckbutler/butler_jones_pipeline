 KUWAIT
 
 Upon independence in 1961 from British protectorate
 status, Kuwait continued to be ruled by amirs chosen from
 the Sabah family, but with the addition of a written
 constitution including a bill of rights, free
 elections to an active parliament and a vigorous press.
 Education abroad has exposed many Kuwaitis to Western
 attitudes.
 Kuwait's human rights situation improved during the past
 year with the restoration of the national assembly, which
 had been suspended since 1976.
 Kuwait has experienced rapid change in a single
 generation. Once poor, isolated, and underdeveloped,
 Kuwait has become a highly urbanized regional center for
 finance, commerce and the media, and a regional pioneer in
 political and social modernization. Kuwait's oil wealth
 has been distributed to its citizens in the form of
 education, medical care, housing and assured jobs.
 Employment opportunities have also brought an influx of
 foreign workers: some long-term (largely Palestinians),
 others temporary (mostly non-Arab Asians). Some of these
 expatriates have imported their own regional political
 tensions and rivalries. Non-Kuwaitis, over 50 percent of
 the population, enjoy fewer civil and political rights and
 social benefits than do citizens.
 In August 1976, however, when the national assembly
 reflected sharp partisan tendencies and some deputies
 began to criticize the Sabah regime directly, the late
 amir extraconstitutionally suspended the assembly and
 tightened the reins on the expression of dissent. At the
 same time, however, the government committed itself to the
 national assembly's eventual restoration. In February
 1981, a new national assembly was elected following hotly
 contested elections. During its first session, March-June
 1981, the national assembly appeared responsive to the
 concerns of its electorate and willing to press the
 government for action, most notably in regard to domestic
 problems of violent crime and unsatisfactory public
 services. Government programs have responded to the
 deputies' articulation of Kuwaiti popular concerns.
 I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by article 31 of the Kuwaiti
 constitution, which states: "NO person shall be subjected
 to torture or to degrading treatment." There have been no
 reports that the government of Kuwait engages in or
 encourages torture.
 It has been alleged that "third degree" methods are
 employed by the police on occasion, particularly with
 non-Kuwaiti suspects, to extract confessions to crimes.
 There is no "exclusionary rule" whereby evidence of a
 criminal's guilt is ruled inadmissible due to police error.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
 Summary executions are not practiced in Kuwait. Flogging
 has been practiced as a disciplinary measure in prisons,
 but with decreasing frequency.
 
 (1028)
 
 
 1024
 
 Prison conditions appear relatively humane and do not
 inflict intentionally degrading treatment. Prisoners
 receive necessary medical care. They are permitted to
 supplement prison fare with food purchased from outside
 the prison. Family visits and access by attorneys are
 permitted. Youthful offenders, few of whom are
 imprisoned, are not separated from hardened criminals.
 There is no policy of differential treatment on the basis
 of social class, race, or religion.
 c. Disappearances
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detentionin Kuwait by the Kuwaiti
 authorities, or with their cognizance. Reports have
 surfaced of a few persons being abducted from Kuwait and
 forcibly repatriated by foreign agents to their country of
 origin for political reasons. There is no evidence that
 the Kuwait government approves or condones such
 occurrences.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by
 article 31 of the constitution. With occasional
 exceptions, such practices are not sanctioned by the
 Kuwaiti government. Road blocks and spot checks of
 outdoor gatherings of expatriates, especially of South
 Asians, are used sporadically by the police searching for
 illegal immigrants. Persons without proper identification
 may be detained by the police. The authorities have
 considerable leeway in picking up individuals whom they
 suspect constitute security threats. However, no
 political prisoners are known to be in custody in Kuwait.
 Legally, police may hold a person for investigation
 without charge for no more than four days; a prosecutor's
 approval is required for periods over 24 hours.
 Thereafter the suspect either must be released or turned
 over to a public prosecutor, who may authorize detention
 for up to an additional 21 days. Further detention may be
 authorized by a judge pending trial. The lack of a
 specific charge against an expatriate considered a
 trouble-maker does not hinder the authorities from
 summarily expelling him.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait's legal system is independent and provides for
 public trial, the right of appeal and representation by an
 attorney of one's choice. Procedural rights are not
 always strictly observed, and failure of the police to
 protect a suspect's rights may not provide a defense in
 the courts. Charges are supposed to be stated formally
 when a suspect is brought before a public prosecutor, not
 more than four days after arrest. There are no reports of
 secret or unfair trials, nor of discrimination against
 defense counsel. However, the court-appointed attorney of
 a defendant unable or unwilling to engage his own lawyer
 is not always given adequate time to prepare a defense.
 Interpretation of court proceedings to ensure their
 understanding by non-Arabic speaking defendants is
 sometimes inadequate. The Kuwaiti judiciary is
 independent of the executive and the military. There are
 no special political or security courts. By article 164
 of the constitution, military courts have jurisdiction
 only over offences committed by members of the armed or
 security forces, except during periods of martial law.
 There has never been a state of martial law in Kuwait.
 
 
 1025
 .The amir has the power to pardon or to commute sentences
 passed by either civilian or military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is provided for in the Kuwaiti
 constitution (article 38). Warrants are required for
 searches, unless the police are in actual pursuit of a
 suspect fleeing the scene of a crime or where an outside
 odor indicates the presence of a distillery or illegal
 narcotics. Search warrants to enter residences or
 business premises are issued by a public prosecutor.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includings
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Both Kuwaiti citizens and expatriate residents are
 generally free to speak as they wish. Private opinions
 are not monitored or suppressed. The constitution
 (article 36) guarantees freedom of opinion and of
 scientific research.  While the constitution contains
 similar guarantees for many basic civil and political
 rights, these guarantees often are stated conditionally,
 modified by such phrases as "in accordance with the
 conditions and manner specified by law."
 The Kuwaiti press is widely read in the region. There is
 no official newspaper. The press is not subject to
 pre-publication censorship, but under Kuwait's press law
 newspapers may be suspended or closed permanently for
 violations of public morality, or to enforce restrictions
 on political content. Criticism of the ruling family is
 forbidden, and any but the mildest criticism of government
 policies and high-level officials is discouraged. Phrases
 such as "spread dissension" and "contradict the national
 interest" are used to describe the grounds for newspaper
 suspensions. No publication ever has been closed
 permanently. During the past year, two magazines were
 suspended, the longer suspension being for three weeks.
 One newspaper was suspended for three days. Editors are
 criminally liable for violating prohibitions against
 attacking leaders of friendly Arab states or stirring
 sectarian strife. There have been no prosecutions to
 date. Radio and television are government-controlled.
 On November 4, the government introduced to the national
 assembly a new press law to replace the one promulgated by
 amiri decree during the assembly's 1976-81 suspension.
 The proposed new law would expand restrictions on the
 press and would impose stiffer penalties than present law.
 In March 1981, one of Kuwait's two English language
 newspapers held a public symposium on "problems of
 expatriates in Kuwait." The symposium was organized and
 chaired by two expatriate journalists, both longtime
 residents of Kuwait. Following criticism of the symposium
 in the national assembly, the two journalists were
 deported.
 Kuwait's constitution (article 44) theoretically protects
 private assembly, public meetings, processions and
 gatherings which are peaceful and not contrary to public
 morals. Any group of more than three people desiring to
 meet for public discussion (or to meet privately but issue
 a public statement) must receive explicit, prior
 permission from the ministry of interior. The authorities
 may prevent such an assembly merely by ignoring the
 request. Such permission is not, however, required for
 "diwaniyyas," traditional gatherings presided over by
 
 
 1026
 community leaders or family elders, which anyone can
 attend and there speak freely. No group has been given
 permission to hold a public demonstration in Kuwait since
 September 1979. Refusals of such requests, from certain
 religious leaders and from Iranian or Iraqi sympathizers,
 have been made on "security grounds."
 Kuwait permits the establishment of trade unions. The
 petroleum and banking industries and government employees
 are unionized. Kuwaiti citizens and expatriates resident
 in Kuwait for five years are permitted to join unions,
 although only Kuwaitis may vote in union elections or hold
 union offices. The right to strike is recognized
 officially. Refinery workers of the state-owned oil
 company struck in April 1981, but returned to work after
 some union demands were met. There is no apparent
 harassment of professional groups, bar associations,
 scientific bodies, or labor unions.
 While article 35 of the constitution declares that
 "freedom of belief is absolute," it states further that
 its practice is not to "conflict with public policy or
 morals." Kuwait's state religion is Islam and the sharia
 is, by the constitution, "a main source of legislation."
 The ruling family and most prominent Kuwait families are
 Sunni Muslims. There is no policy of discrimination
 against Shi'ite Muslims, who constitute about one-third of
 Kuwait's citizenry. There are a number of expatriate
 Christian congregations in Kuwait. Practitioners of
 Eastern religions, e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists, are
 not allowed to establish places of worship in Kuwait.
 Proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is prohibited.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Kuwait citizens generally are free to travel inside and
 outside the country, to emigrate and to return. There is
 some restriction of foreign travel for young men who have
 not completed their military service or been exempted.
 Those serving in the military must receive permission from
 the ministry of defense before traveling abroad. While
 there are not different legal standards regarding the
 internal or foreign travel or emigration of Kuwaiti women,
 in practice husbands can prevent their wives and children
 from leaving the country.
 There have been occasional instances, all occurring before
 1980, in which citizens' passports were suspended
 temporarily, both for criminal offenses and for outspoken
 criticism of the regime, particularly if done while
 abroad. Since 1977, representatives of societies,
 associations, and trade unions wishing to travel to and
 participate in international meetings have had to receive
 prior permission from the authorities.
 While article 28 of the constitution says "no Kuwaiti may
 be deported from Kuwait or prevented from returning
 thereto," individuals have been stripped of Kuwait
 nationality and deported. This occurred in December 1980,
 when a local lawyer/politician attempted to re-enter
 Kuwait on an Iraqi passport. under Kuwait law, any
 Kuwaiti accepting a foreign nationality automatically
 loses his own.
 Non-Kuwaitis working in the country must have the
 sponsorship of a Kuwaiti citizen. Effectively, this gives
 Kuwaiti sponsors the power to restrict the job mobility
 and the continued residence of those expatriates who enter
 under their sponsorship. Those employed by government
 
 
 1027
 agencies are given residence visas which require an exit
 permit or "no objection' letter in order to leave the
 country. Non-Kuwaitis convicted of a crime routinely are
 deported after serving their sentences.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Traditionally, adult male Kuwaitis have had direct access
 to their tribal and religious leaders, the heads of the
 prominent merchant clans, and the amir through the system
 of "diwaniyyas," to which anyone could come and freely
 speak his mind. That custom has endured, as has the
 tradition that the amirs should govern in consultation
 with other community leaders. High-ranking officials also
 are approachable through "wasta," the use of influential
 family members or acquaintances as intermediaries in
 obtaining favors or a more favorable hearing for one's
 cause.
 Upon independence, Kuwait inaugurated a national assembly
 composed of 50 deputies (elected by direct male suffrage
 and secret ballot) plus cabinet members sitting ex
 officio. The national assembly was extraconstitutionally
 suspended in August 1976. The government committed
 itself, however, to parliament's eventual restoration.
 On February 23, 1981, a new assembly was elected in an
 orderly fashion following a hotly contested election
 campaign. Fifty deputies were elected from among 447
 candidates running in 25 constituencies. Over 80 percent
 of Kuwait's 42,000 registered voters (i.e., about 3
 percent of the total population) cast ballots.
 The elections appeared free and fair, with their major
 departures from Western norms being the lack of party
 labels, the restricted electorate, and the absence of
 women voters. The new deputies are a diverse group,
 including members of all major segments of Kuwaiti male
 society.
 During the national assembly's first session, March-June
 1981, the deputies appeared responsive to popular concerns
 and willing to press the government for action. Following
 assembly debate of the crime problem, the crown prince/
 prime minister addressed the assembly, promising
 government cooperation with the deputies in developing
 measures for improving public safety. Other government
 statements and increased police vigilance showed the
 executive branch's sensitivity to assembly concern. The
 assembly has the right to pass judgement on all
 legislation promulgated by amiri decree during the
 assembly's 1976-1981 suspension. The constitution
 specifies that if the assembly is not in session or is
 dissolved, the amir has the power to issue decrees
 regarding urgent matters. Such decrees, however, must be
 referred to the next assembly and if not confirmed cease
 to have the power of law. Much of the assembly's first
 session was devoted to discussion and approval of such
 decrees, most of them non-controversial.
 While Kuwaiti citizens have a measure of freedom for
 political participation, this is largely denied to
 expatriates, who now outnumber Kuwaitis 59 to 41 percent.
 This anomaly is particularly striking for the 300,000
 Palestinians, the second largest group in the population.
 Kuwait has denied citizenship to members of the
 Palestinian minority, pending resolution of the Palestine
 issue. While expatriates in Kuwait are permitted
 considerable freedom in conducting exile activities, they
 have little say in the internal affairs of Kuwait.
 
 
 1028
 Expatriates who violate sanctions against their
 involvement in Kuwait's affairs may be summarily
 deported. Kuwait has been sparing in extending
 citizenship to those of non-Kuwaiti origin, with the
 exception of certain stateless bedouin.
 There have been appeals for women's suffrage, including
 one from the wife of the crown prince/prime minister. The
 issue may be addressed by the next parliament. On the
 other hand, the momentum for women's increased political
 rights has slowed with the revival of Islamic conservatism
 in the region.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International (Al) prepared no report on Kuwait in
 1979, 1980 or 1981. There are no known current requests
 by Amnesty International or other non-governmental
 organizations to examine human rights in Kuwait.  Kuwait
 sent a delegation to the Second UNESCO Regional Human
 Rights Conference, held in Cairo in 1978. Kuwait's
 official declarations of support for international
 observation of basic human rights often have been combined
 with sharp criticism of the West for alleged indifference
 to the human rights of the Palestinians.
 In December 1980, the government of Kuwait sponsored a
 conference in Kuwait on "Human Rights in Islam," in
 cooperation with the International Commission of Jurists,
 the union of Arab Lawyers, and Kuwait University's faculty
 of law and sharia. The conference brought together
 jurists, scholars, and human rights activists from across
 the Islamic world and received considerable attention in
 Kuwaiti media.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The constitution of the state of Kuwait provides that the
 economic activities of the state shall be based on social
 justice. The government has a lavish social welfare
 program to spread the benefits of its $17,000 annual per
 capita GNP to all citizens. Programs are designed to
 provide Kuwaitis with jobs (there is little unemployment),
 housing, family allowances, retirement income, medical
 care, and education.
 Improved health care has resulted in a decrease in the
 infant mortality rate to 39 per 1,000 live births and an
 increase in life expectancy to 70 years. Better health
 care, a high fertility rate of 6.3 and heavy immigration
 resulted in a very high annual population growth rate of
 6 percent in the years 1970 to 1979. Adult literacy stood
 at 60 percent in 1976, but may be expected to increase
 rapidly with the present almost total enrollment in
 primary schools.
 The major social distinction in Kuwait is between Kuwaiti
 nationals, who comprise only 41 percent of the population,
 and the expatriate population. Commerce, real estate, and
 the local stock market--the principal sources of private
 wealth in this capitalist economy--are open only to
 Kuwaitis. Foreigners are not allowed to own real estate
 in Kuwait and usually are able to engage in business only
 in partnership with a Kuwaiti citizen.
 Expatriate workers are found in all sectors and levels of
 the economy, although they occupy'almost all of the lower
 paying positions. They often earn the same base pay as
 
 
 1029
 Kuwaitis, but receive less in fringe benefits. The
 benefits peculiar to Kuwaiti citizenship include higher
 government salaries, additional government stipends and
 social allowances, and retirement pensions. Resident
 expatriates are entitled to medical benefits and to
 elementary and secondary schooling (but not kindergarten)
 for their children in the public schools, but Kuwaitis
 gain preference for admission to the University of Kuwait.
 The non-Kuwaiti population can be divided roughly into
 those who consider themselves temporary "guest workers" in
 Kuwait, and those (primarily Palestinians), who, for all
 intents and purposes, are permanent residents. The
 temporary work force is comprised mainly of semi-skilled
 or unskilled workers in the construction field, common
 laborers, and domestic servants, whose families often
 remain at home and compile savings from remittances. Many
 of these laborers live in camps or crowded apartments
 under spartan, and at times unhealthy, conditions.
 Contract workers hired for fixed periods of time are
 increasingly favored by the government. These workers now
 come predominantly from South and East Asian countries and
 have little contact with the permanent population.
 Women in Kuwait (both Kuwaiti and expatriate) have
 comparative social and economic freedom considering the
 traditional role of women in Islamic societies. Although
 they have yet to join the workforce in significant numbers
 (the 1975 census showed that women comprised only
 12 percent of the total labor force), education is
 provided equally to both sexes and most professions are
 open to women. Women in Kuwait are permitted to drive
 automobiles and may appear in public unveiled.
