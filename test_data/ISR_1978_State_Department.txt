 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 
 Because of the sharply differing politico-social envi-
 ronments in Israel and in the Arab territories Israel
 has occupied since the 1967 war, discussion of this
 subject must be treated in separate but parallel
 fashion for the two areas. Therefore, for its first
 three sections, this report is divided into separate
 narratives for Israel and the occupied territories.
 Israel is a full-fledged parliamentary democracy with
 extremely high standards of justice and human rights.
 These standards are applied fully inside Israel proper.
 Under the military regime that governs the occupied
 territories, however, certain of the normal human
 rights guarantees that are taken for granted in Israel
 proper have been suspended on security grounds. This
 dichotomy poses a dilemma that will probably be re-
 solved only in the context of a final peace settlement
 with its neighbors.
 Israel
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includ-
 ing Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law in Israel, and is virtu-
 ally unheard of.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although there-may have been rare exceptions in
 the past, The Department of State knows of no in-
 stances in the last year of cruel, inhuman and de-
 grading treatment. Such treatment is not sanctioned
 (559)
 
 
 560
 in Israel, and law enforcement is carried out
 without the excessive use of force. Sami Esmail,
 an American citizen, has alleged that he was mis-
 treated while under interrogation soon after he
 was arrested on security charges in December 1977.
 We asked the Israelis to investigate these charges,
 looked into them ourselves, and could find no cor-
 roborating evidence to substantiate them.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In Israel proper, this is not practiced and there
 are strong guarantees against it. Writs of habeas
 corpus and other guarantees of due process of law
 are employed and defendants are considered innocent
 until proved guilty. Preventive detention is legal
 but is virtually never practiced.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair hearing by an impartial tri-
 bunal with representation by counsel is observed.
 With the exception of security cases, all trials
 are open. .In security cases, Israeli law provides
 that part or all of a trial may be closed, with the
 burden of justifying in camera proceedings falling
 on the prosecution. Counsel is always present dur-
 ing closed proceedings. In the last year, an
 American, Terre Fleener, was convicted of a secur-
 ity offense. All of Fleener's trial was closed to
 the public by order of a majority of a three judge
 court after a hearing. The United States Consul,
 however, was able to attend some of the trial sess-
 ions, and the Israel high court later opened the
 case in the course of her appeal.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbi-
 trary invasion of the home.
 
 
 561
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 I-srael is a welfare state whose economy is organized
 along the general lines of the Western European mixed
 economies. Income distribution in Israel is relatively
 egalitarian. All Israelis are guaranteed good health
 care, and housing for the poor is modestly subsidized.
 Since 1948, Israel has taken in well over one million
 largely impoverished Jewish refugees from Europe, thp
 Middle East, and North Africa, and has worked to inte-
 grate them fully into its society and economy. Inte-
 gration of smaller numbers of immigrants continues at
 the present time. Because of the wide disparity in
 educational and cultural backgrounds, there remains
 an economic and social gap between the Ashkenazi
 (European) and, Sephardi (Middle Eastern) Jewish com-
 munities, which the Government is committed to narrow-
 ing. All Israelis are guaranteed free public education
 through the eighth grade and more than half of all
 secondary students receive full scholarships. There
 are parallel educational systems for Jews and Arabs,
 conducted in Hebrew and Arabic respectively.
 While title to most of the land in Israel is held by
 the state or quasi-public organizations in trust for
 the Jewish people, Arabs may purchase privately-owned
 land through ordinary commercial transactions. There
 have been frequent complaints that expropriations of
 Arab land, although subject to legal review as to
 purpose and amount of compensation, have been used
 for promoting Jewish settlement in densely Arab-
 populated areas. The Government has said it plans
 no more expropriations in the foreseeable future.
 Corruption and crime in Israel are not widespread.
 In the fall of 1977 the Government appointed a com-
 mittee, headed by former Attorney General Erwin
 Shimron, to study organized crime in Israel. Its
 report received much publicity and the Government has
 taken various steps to combat organized crime.
 
 
 562
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Relig-
 ion and Assembly
 Israelis of all faiths and ethnic groups continue to
 enjoy freedom of religion, expression, and assembly.
 An anti-proselytizing measure adopted by the Knesset
 in late 1977, which outlaws the offering of bribes or
 material benefits as an inducement to religious conver-
 sions, continues to cause uneasiness among some
 Christian groups in Israel because of its vague word-
 ing, but thus far no legal action has been taken under
 the law.
 There is full freedom of speech in Israel. Both the
 Hebrew and Arabic press are free and express a wide
 variety of political opinions, although all media
 are subject to censorship on security and military
 matters.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 All Israeli citizens enjoy freedom of movement
 within the country and are free to travel abroad
 or emigrate.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, and Israelis
 enjoy the freedom fully to participate in the polit-
 ical process. The country underwent an orderly major
 transition with the elections of May 1977, when the
 party in power since the founding of the state was
 replaced by its traditional opposition.
 The organized labor movement functions without hin-
 drance and wields substantial political and economic
 power. The right to strike is exercised frequently
 and effectively. Most workers, Arab as well as Jewish,
 are members of the Histadrut, the general confedera-
 tion of workers.
 
 
 563
 Because of the explicitly"Jewish character of the
 state, and the isolation of Israel from most of its
 Arab neighbors, the Arab minority tends to feel
 powerless and largely alienated. Despite some lim-
 ited governmental and private efforts to bridge the
 gap, there is very little social interaction between
 Israeli Arabs and Jews. Nevertheless, the Arab minor-
 ity has equal rights under the law, and proven in-
 stances of discrimination in violation of the law are
 rare. Although subtler forms of discrimination do
 occur in such areas as employment and appointment to
 government positions, some Arabs have risen to respon-
 sible positions in the civil service, and at least one
 has served, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, in the
 position of deputy minister. Several Arabs are members
 of the Knesset, Israel's Parliament. Unlike Druze,
 Circassians and Jewish Israelis, Arabs are exempt from
 the military draft. However, they may serve volun-
 tarily in the defense establishment.
 Since early in the 20th century, Jewish women have
 played an active role in every sphere of life in
 Israel. The Equal Rights for Women Law (1951) for-
 malized women's rights in Israel, granting them the
 right to own and deal in property and the right to
 guardianship of their children, and abolishing uni-
 lateral divorce by a husband. Polygamy and child
 marriage were abolished. Also, girls were included
 in compulsory education laws. Under the Employment
 of Women Law (1954), women have the right to work,
 without discrimination at equal pay for equal value
 of work in the same jobs as men so long as they can
 do the job in accordance with their physical capacity
 without impairing their health.
 There are strong secularist and religious forces
 in contest over changes in the status of women in
 Israel. Israeli feminists feel that the laws de-
 scribed above, once deemed advanced, now discrim-
 inate against women. Many women consider a law
 passed by the Knesset in 1978 granting military
 exemption to any woman who claims to be Orthodox
 to be biased against secularist women. Since the
 establishment of the state, all matters relating
 
 
 to the family are handled by the religious courts.
 These courts, while operating within the confines of
 the law, base their decisions on religious law, which
 sometimes discriminates against women.
 Occupied Territogies
 The territories occupied in 1967 consist of the West
 Bank of the Jordan River, the Gaza Strip, most of the
 Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem.
 The complex human rights situation in the occupied
 territories, particularly in the West Bank and Gaza,
 where virtually all of the settled Arab population is
 located, is largely a result of the tensions between
 the occupying authorities and the indigenous popula-
 tion, mostly Palestinian Arabs. The Camp David
 accords envision a self-governing authority which
 would give the inhabitants of West Bank and Gaza a
 regime of full autonomy, and negotiations to deter-
 mine the final status of these territories.
 The occupied territories are under military govern-
 ment, and law enforcement and public security are in
 military rather than in civilian hands. Although
 Israel rejects the view of the United Nations (includ-
 ing the United States) that the stipulations of the
 Fourth Geneva Convention concerning the protection of
 civilian populations under military occupation apply
 to its governance of the occupied territories, Israel
 claims it voluntarily observes most of these stipula-
 tions. The major difference of opinion is with re-
 spect to those provisions prohibiting the introduction
 of civilian settlers from the occupying power into
 occupied territories. In contravention of the gener-
 ally accepted interpretation of the Convention's
 Article 49, Israel has established over 95 non-
 military settlements in the occupied territories,
 with a total population of about 14,500 people, ex-
 cluding Jerusalem.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 
 
 565
 a. Torture
 Allegations about the routine use of torture in-
 cluding psychological and physical pressures and
 instances of brutality by Israeli officials during
 interrogation of Arab security suspects have been
 publicized widely. The Sunday Times of London and
 Time magazine have reported such allegations, stem-
 ming from accounts given after their release by Arabs
 arrested for security offenses. Arabs in the occu-
 pied territories ,including some who were actually
 in custody and who have reported that they were sub-
 jected to mistreatment, continue to allege, both
 publicly and privately, that mistreatment of detain-
 ees is a systematic practice. The accumulation of
 reports, some from credible sources, makes it appear
 that instances of mistreatment have occurred. In
 repeated discussions with Israeli authorities, we
 have been assured that such practices are forbidden
 by Israeli law and that any violators are punished.
 Israel agreed in 1977 to allow representatives of
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 resident in Israel and the occupied territories to,
 inter alia, visit detainees without witnesses during
 the period of their interrogation no later than the
 fourteenth day after arrest to determine identity,
 state of health, and conditions of detention. In
 addition, ICRC delegates visit convicted Arab security
 prisoners in prisons in Israel and the occupied terri-
 tories. Whenever the ICRC feels it necessary, an ICRC
 physician may conduct medical examinations without
 witnesses; inquiries about specific cases may be
 submitted to the Israeli authorities.
 b.   Cruel,Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been instances in which Israeli troops
 and Border Police used excessive force in quelling
 demonstrations and restoring order. These actions
 clearly did not reflect the policy of the Govern-
 ment. In at least one case, individuals found guilty
 of such excesses have been sent to jail. In mid-
 1978, the West Bank Military Governor was dismissed
 
 
 566
 from his position and two high-ranking officers in the
 Bethlehem Regional Command were disciplined following
 the use of excessive force in a Beit Jala school and an
 attempt to cover up the incident.
 There have been reports of instances of degrading
 treatment of some suspects in connection with interro-
 gations in the first hours following arrests.
 In contravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention
 (on protection of civilian persons in time of war),
 occupation authorities in the past selectively expelled
 residents of the West Bank and Gaza strip suspected of,
 or known to have engaged in, terrorism or anti-Israeli
 political agitation. The Israeli military authorities
 state that they ceased involuntary deportation in 1976.
 Also in contravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention,
 however, individuals believed to have been involved in
 terrorism have had their homes demolished or sealed up
 and their families displaced. In the last year at least
 two homes were demolished and there have been at least
 six cases of sealing up of homes.
 Overcrowding in prisons continues to be a serious
 problem. There have been several hunger strikes led by
 security prisoners in recent years (though none this
 past year) but they appear to have been motivated at
 least in part by a desire to dramatize Palestinian
 political claims.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 As of August 1978 there were about 2,149 non-Israeli-
 citizen Arabs in prison for security offenses in Israel
 proper or in the territories. Of this number, twenty
 were under administrative detention; an additional 360
 suspected security offenders were awaiting trial.
 Administrative detention is authorized under both
 Israeli law and the Jordanian and British mandatory
 codes which were in force before 1967 in the West Bank
 and Gaza respectively, and which continue in force
 there. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, this
 
 
 567
 practice is-not permissible beyond one year from the
 "general close of military operations." Israel
 maintains that administrative detention is occasionally
 necessary to prevent terrorist operations when a
 court proceeding would compromise sensitive security
 information. Military commanders are authorized to
 order the administrative detention for up to six
 months. Such detention can be administratively extended
 indefinitely, but each case receives judicial review
 every six months. Administrative detainees have several
 forms of recourse from detention orders, but the right
 to appeal is rarely exercised and appeals are not known
 to have ever resulted in a reversal of the decision of
 the military authorities.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As required by the Geneva Convention, Jordanian law
 (with a few Israeli modifications) is still in force in
 the West Bank in civil and criminal matters, as is
 British Mandatory law in Gaza. Its adjudication has
 been left in the hands of the indigenous judiciary,
 which carries out its duties in an equitable manner.
 Residents of the occupied territories accused of
 non-security offenses receive fair public trials
 by local civilian courts. Alleged security offenders
 are, with the few exceptions cited in the above section,
 tried in Israeli military courts by military judges
 trained in law. Most of these trials are open to the
 public. Legal procedures at such trials appear gener-
 ally to meet the standards of a fair trial, although
 Arab prisoners charge that convictions are frequently
 based on confessions obtained through coercion. While
 military regulations require simultaneous translation
 of trial proceedings into the language of the accused,
 there are numerous complaints from Arab prisoners
 that insufficient steps have been taken to enable them
 to follow the proceedings. We are not in a position to
 verify these complaints.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Under standing emergency regulations, military author-
 ities may enter private homes and institutions in
 pursuit of security objectives as they see fit. While
 
 
 568
 pursuit of security objectives as they see fit. While
 this has sometimes resulted in damage to property and
 injury to inhabitants, the military authorities fre-
 quently make repairs or restitution on the basis of
 both formal claims and informal complaints.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Residents of the occupied territories have complained
 that Israel restricts economic development on both
 political and commercial grounds, thereby keeping the
 West Bank and Gaza as captive markets. However,
 unemployment has nearly disappeared and real per
 capita income has more than doubled under the Israeli
 occupation, largely because of the thousands of jobs
 now held by Palestinian Arab workers who commute to
 Israel proper. The gap between income levels in
 Israel and the territories has narrowed steadily since
 1967. At the same time, investment in economic infra-
 structure in the territories has been minimal. Many
 individuals, especially those with higher education,
 migrate to Arab countries where greater economic
 opportunities exist. However, efforts made this past
 year by the Israeli Minister of Defense and Military
 Governor to satisfy requests by West Bank mayors
 related to the supply of power and water have marked
 a new positive development in the attitude of the
 military government.
 Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories
 has adversely affected the livelihood of some Arab
 residents, particularly through expropriation of
 lands for individual settlements. Arab residents have
 found it difficult to challenge land expropriations,
 partly because most settlements are first established
 as paramilitary installations. Expropriation for such
 settlements is thus justified initially on military or
 security grounds, even though most have been transferred
 to civilians over time. Groups of Arab landowners have
 sought court orders preventing settlement activity, and
 in several still unresolved cases the Israeli High
 Court has ordered the Military Government to show cause
 
 
 569
 why it should not prevent civilian settlement activity
 at military installations.
 Many existing settlements continue to grow steadily,
 both in size--through further expropriations--and in
 population.
 Compensation for expropriated land is sometimes offer-
 ed, but, for political reasons, is rarely accepted by
 Arab residents. A further problem results from the
 exploitation of a part of the West Bank's limited
 water resources for the use of Israeli settlements,
 which has in some cases caused Arab wells to dry
 up and has had detrimental effects on Arab agriculture.
 There is no known large-scale element of corruption in
 the Occupied Territories. There have been a few
 reported cases of the taking of bribes by Israeli
 occupation officials, but offenders have been quickly
 punished. The relatively low level of organized crime
 in the Occupied Territories is due in large part to the
 presence of an occupying military power which makes any
 illegal activities dangerous.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion,
 and Assembly
 Freedom of religion in the occupied territories is un-
 qualified although there have been conflicts over the
 use of holy places venerated by both Muslims and Jews,
 as in Hebron. Freedom of expression and freedom of
 assembly are restricted by Israeli definitions of
 security requirements. Following the Camp David
 summit, the military government eased restrictions
 on public meetings somewhat to encourage public dis-
 cussion of the accords. The West Bank press is subject
 to censorship but is allowed to operate quite freely
 and is frequently outspoken in its criticism of Israeli
 policies. While membership in a proscribed organization
 (e.g., the Palestine Liberation Organization or one of
 its constituent elements) is grounds for arrest, it is
 
 
 570
 not the policy of the authorities to arrest individ-
 uals because of views privately or even publicly
 held. For instance, several of the Mayors elected
 in 1977 are known to be Palestine Liberation Organ-
 ization sympathizers.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement is generally unrestricted in the
 occupied territories and thousands of Arabs travel
 daily to Israel for work. Vehicles owned by inhab-
 itants of the occupied territories are frequently
 stopped for security inspection. Inhabitants of the
 territories, like Israelis, are required to carry
 identity cards. They are generally free to travel
 abroad and return, and many thousands cross the
 "open bridges" to Jordan every year. Inhabitants of
 the territories crossing from Jordan into the West
 Bank, as well as other Arabs or persons of Arab descent,
 are subject to searches for weapons and contraband.
 There have been complaints about crowding and poor
 facilities at the Allenby Bridge checkpoint, but these
 should be alleviated shortly when the Government of
 Israel completes construction of a large new air-
 conditioned terminal with restaurant facilities.
 There are also complaints that these searches are
 more rigorous than necessary on pure security grounds,
 and constitute harassment. Authorities may on occasion
 seek informally to discourage the external travel of
 some individuals for political and security reasons.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Israel has twice permitted election of mayors and city
 councils on the West Bank. Israel permitted Arab
 nationalists outspokenly hostile to Israel to run for
 office in the second West Bank election and honored the
 results of those elections. No political parties are
 permitted, and until the signing of the Camp David
 accords, no political activity other than campaigning
 for municipal elections was permitted. Following the
 accords, however, restrictions on meetings were eased
 somewhat to encourage public discussion of the peace
 
 
 571
 process. However, political rallies and protest
 assemblies continue to require a permit by military
 government authorities.
 The status of women in the Occupied Territories gener-
 ally reflects traditional Palestinian values and
 practices. Laws governing marriage, family and
 personal status discriminate against women. Changes
 are taking place, however. Exposure to education,
 to a basically egalitarian attitude toward women by
 Israelis, and to the transitional and migratory
 nature of society in the Occupied Territories is
 improving the status of women. Traditionally un-
 enfranchised, women have been permitted to vote in
 municipal elections.
 The average annual rate of growth of female enrollments
 in primary and secondary schools in the Occupied Terri-
 tories during 1968-77 has been 6.3 percent, and in 1977
 females comprised 43 percent of the total student body.
 Female participation is slightly higher in Gaza and North
 Sinai (44 percent) than in the West Bank (42 percent).
 The younger generation of women is growing up with differ-
 ent expectations about their status.
 Relatively few women participate in the labor force
 (West Bank, 12.8 percent and 4.2 percent in Gaza and
 North Sinai), although the percentages are a little
 higher for women from refugee camps than for the female
 population as a whole. Women who work in Israel proper
 or for Israeli firms receive the benefits of Israeli
 labor laws and practices.
 Israel and the Occupied Territories
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights.
 The ICRC regularly inspects prison conditions in
 the occupied territories and has made recommendations
 for improvement. In 1970, the Israeli Government
 authorized Amnesty International to conduct an in-
 vestigation into reports of ill-treatment of prisoners
 and detainees. Amnesty International issued a report
 
 
 which described accounts of several cases of mistreat-
 ment it had received. Its recommendation of a formal
 inquiry with international participation was rejected
 by Israel.
 In October 1976, Amnesty International renewed its
 request for an investigation. Since then, it has
 expressed its concern about the imprisonment or treat-
 ment of a number of individual prisoners, Israeli Jews
 as well as Arabs, in several letters to Israel's
 Attorney General.
 For several years, the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission and other United Nations bodies have adopted
 resolutions condemning alleged Israeli human rights
 violations in the occupied territories. The United
 States voted against most of these resolutions, which
 we regard as one-sided, politically motivated, and
 based on unsubstantiated allegations. Israel has been
 generally unresponsive to efforts by United Nations
 bodies to conduct investigations in territories under
 its jurisdiction, although it has made efforts to be
 forthcoming regarding visits by representatives of the
 World Health Organization, the International Labor
 Organization, and the United Nations Educational,
 Scientific, and Cultural Organization. Israel says it
 has not been disposed to respond favorably to requests
 for international investigations because its experience
 suggests that the reports of such investigations
 would reflect political bias rather than the facts. On
 the other hand, its decision to permit ICRC access to
 prisoners during the interrogation period indicates a
 willingness to cooperate with international bodies it
 regards as responsible.
