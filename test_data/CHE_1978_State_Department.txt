 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland, a neutral and democratic country, attaches
 essential importance to the observance and maintenance
 of human rights. The Swiss Confederation has an inter-
 nationally renowned human rights record. It is well
 known for its generous assistance to refugees. It is
 the headquarters site for important worldwide organi-
 zations concerned with humanitarian affairs, notably the
 International Labor Organization, the United Nations
 Economic and Social Council and the International Red
 Cross. The Swiss government recently presided over
 efforts to update the Geneva Convention at the Diplomatic
 Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of
 International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed
 Conflicts.

 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The high standard of living, high wages and the
 substantial sums spent on welfare by private industry
 in this society explain why public expenditures for
 social purposes are relatively low, in the European
 context. Education is free through the university
 level.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Switzerland is a party to the European Convention on
 Human Rights. Switzerland prides itself on being a
 country of absolute religious tolerance. Religious
 groups have a right to the protection of the State
 against the domination of any other religious com-
 munity. There are no restrictions on political
 expression or association except those placed on
 groups considered a potential threat to the Confederation.
 No such groups are currently designated.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of domestic and foreign travel and of
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy. Legislative
 power is vested in a bicameral legislature elected by
 
 
 497
 universal suffrage. Women were granted the federal
 franchise in 1971 and in almost all cantons they
 enjoy the same local voting privileges as men.
 Switzerland has ratified the European Human Rights
 Convention and has expressed again recently its intent
 to ratify the U.N. Human Rights Covenants. However,
 Swiss women in three small cantons have not yet been
 granted full voting rights for local issues.
 There is full freedom of labor to organize.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no requests during the postwar period
 for outside investigations of the human rights
 situation in Switzerland.
