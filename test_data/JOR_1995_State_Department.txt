 JORDAN
 King Hussein has been on the throne of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan since
 1952. The Constitution concentrates a high degree of executive and legislative au-
 thority in the King, who determines domestic and foreign policy. The Prime Minister
 and Cabinet manage the daily affairs of government. The Parliament consists of a
 40-member Senate appointed by the King and an 80-member Chamber of Deputies
 elected by the people. Since 1989 the lower house has increasingly asserted itself.
 Reflecting this trend, the Cabinet named in January 1996 included 22 deputies from
 the lower house.
 The General Intelligence Directorate and the Public Security Directorate share re-
 sponsibility for maintaining internal security and have broad authority to monitor
 the activities of persons believed to be security threats. The security forces continue
 to commit human rights abuses. The State Security Court and broad police powers
 remain as vestiges of martial law, which the Government revoked in 1991.
 Jordan has a mixed economy with significant government participation in indus-
 try, transportation, and communications. Jordan has few natural resources and is
 financially dependent on foreign assistance and remittances from Jordanian nation-
 als working a road Because of the Government's policies during the 1990-91 Gulf
 crisis, some Arab countries in the Gulf discontinued financial aid, expelled many
 Jordanian guest workers, and placed restrictions on imports of Jordanian goods. The
 domestic economy has been buffeted by high unemployment and inflation, and a
 sharp reduction of exports to Iraq due to United Nations sanctions against that
 country. Per capita gross domestic product was estimated at $1,459 for 1994.
 Since the revocation of martial law in 1991, there has been a steady improvement
 in the human rights situation. Nonetheless problems remain, including arbitrary
 arrest; mistreatment of detainees; prolonged detention without charge; lack of due
 process; harassment of opposition parties; restrictions on the freedoms of press, as-
 sembly, and association; official discrimination against adherents of the Baha'i faith;
 and restrictions on women's rights. Since the signing of the Jordanian-Israeli Peace
 Treaty in October 1994, opposition complaints about the Government's human
 rights record have increased Discrimination against the Bedouin, violence against
 women, and abuse of children are problems. Citizens do not have the right to
 change their form of government, although in recent years the King has taken steps
 to increase participation in the policalsysm, such as legalizing political parties.
 Nationwide municipal elections held in July were largely free and fair despite oppo-
 sition accusations of government misconduct.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Ridling.-There were no confirmed reports of
 political or other extrajudicial killings. However, opponents of the Government
 charged that security forces used excessive force in June when they killed Mahmud
 Khalifah and wounded his brother Bashir, after the pair used firearms to resist ar-
 rest. The two were wanted for shooting at police patrol car and sending faxes criti-
 cal of the Government and the King to prominent citizens. The Government insists
 that there is insufficient evidence of security force wrongdoing. The Attorney Gen-
 eral is reviewing the case.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Legal Code provides prisoners with the right to humane treatment,
 security and other police forces allegedly abuse detainees physically during interro-
 gation. Torture allegations are difficult to verify because security officials frequently
 deny detainees timely access to lawyers. The most frequent alleged methods of tor-
 ture are sleep deprivation, beatings, and extended solitary confinement.
 Local police detention facilities are spartan but generally clean. Prisons are be-
 lieved to meet minimal international standards. Prisoners detained on national se-
 curity grounds are often kept in sparate prisons maintained by the General Intel-
 li~nce Directorate or military intelligence.
 allegations of abusive treatment of prisoners, the rnment  r
 mitted members of a pariamentay committee to visit the               sou   of
 Amman in March. Committee memers indicated that they were satisfied with pris-
 on conditions. According to one deputy, none of the prisoners interviewed by the
 Committee had undergone torture, and that the authorities punish only violators of
 prison rules. However, lawyers for two men held in connection with the attack on
 a French diplomat (see Section i.e.) claim that their clients were subjected to men-
 
 
 1198
 tal and physical abuse during interrogation. Defendants in other state security cases
 also claim to have been beaten.
 The Government grants access to the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) to prisons and prisoners twice a month.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Citizens are subject to detention, trial
 and punishment for the defamation of heads of state, dissemination of 'false or ex-
 aggerated information outside the country which attacks state dignity," or defama-
 tion of public officials.
 The Criminal Code requires legal authorities to file formal charges within 10 days
 of arrest. The courts routinely grant requests from prosecutors for 15-day extensions
 as provided by law. This practice generally extends pretrial detention for lengthy
 periods of time. In cases involving state security, the authorities frequently hold de-
 fendants in lengthy pretrial detention, do not provide defendants with the written
 charesa aint them, and do not allow defendants to meet with their lawyers until
 sho      beore trial.
 Observers estimate that as many as 400 persons are detained each year for na-
 tional security reasons. All but a few are generally released after questioning.
 The Government does not exile persons with full citizenship rights (see Section
 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. Several court rulings against the Government in the past year, including two
 by the Court of Cessation involving national security cases, indicate that the judici-
 ary functions independently as provided for in the Constitution (see below).
 There are several types of courts. Most criminal cases are tried in the civilian
 courts, which include appeals courts the Court of Cassation, and the Supreme
 Court. Cases involving sedition, armed insurrection, financial crimes, and drug-traf-
 icking are tried in the State Security Court a remnant of the pre-1991 martial law
 periodL Islamic, or Shari'a, courts have jurisdiction over marriage and divorce among
 Muslims and inheritance cases involving both Muslims and non-Muslims (see Sec-
 tion 5).
 Most trials are open in the civilian courts. Defendants are entitled to legal coun-
 sel, may challenge witnesses, and have the right to appeal. Defendants facing the
 death penalty or life imprisonment must be represented by legal counsel.
 The State Security Court is comprised of panels of three judges, who may be ei-
 ther civilians or military officers. It frequently restricts public attendance at its
 trials. Defendants tried in the State Security Court are often held in extended pre-
 trial detention without access to lawy.ers although they are visited by representa-
 tives of the ICRC. In the State Security ourt, judges have inquired into allegations
 of torture and have permitted the testimony of physicians regarding these allega-
 tions; but to date the Court has not invalidated a confession obtained under duress.
 Defendants in the State Security Court have the right of appeal to the Court of Cas-
 sation, which is authorized to review the testimony, evidence, and judgment. Ap-
 peals are automatic for cases involving the death penalty.
 However, defense attorneys have challenged the appointment of military judges
 to the State Security Court to try civilian cases as contrary to the concept of an
 independent judiciary. The Government has countered that military judges receive
 adequate training in civil law and court procedure and that all court decisions are
 reviewed by the Court of Cessation. For the first time since the creation of the State
 Security Court, the Government appointed a panel of civilian judges to hear a case
 in December.
 In early 1995, the Court of Cessation overturned the verdicts of four members of
 the outlawed Islamic Liberation Party who were sentenced in 1994 to 3 years' im-
 prisonment for distributing leaflets slandering the King and for membership in an
 illegal organization. Two of the defendants were tried in absentia. The two who
 were in custody were denied access to lawyers until a month prior to their trial.
 In March the Court of Cessation overturned the convictions in the so-called Arab-
 Afghan case, in which a group of 25 Jordanians and other Arabs were charged with
 sedition, and sent the case back to the State Security Court for retrial. The defend-
 ants had been tried in 1994 before the State Security Court, which sentenced 11
 of them to death 7 to various prison terms, and acquitted the remaining 7. In order-
 ing the retrial, the Court of Cessation agreed with the defense's contention that the
 charges in the original indictment did not fall within the jurisdiction of the State
 Security Court. The defendants were retried on a revised indictment. In the retrial,
 the State Security Court acquitted 1 defendant and found 10 others guilty. Four
 were sentenced to death (2 in absentia); the others received prison terms of 7 to 20
 years. The Court of Cassation reviewed the retrial in January 1996. It upheld all
 of the verdicts but commuted the death sentences of the two defendants in custody
 to life imprisonment; two others sentenced to death are at large.
 
 
 1199
 The State Security Court also began the trials in several other cases: In one case,
 four men were charged with mounting an armed attack on a government office in
 the Baq'a Refugee Camp in January. In a second case, the Government arrested six
 members of the previously unknown "Islamic Renewal Movement" for possessing ex-
 plosives and automatic weapons and for membership in an illegal organization. In
 a third case, 13 persons be   ig to the previously unknown group called "Bay'at
 Al-ma2 ("Allegiance to the Imaum") were arrested for obtaining weapons for use
 in illegal activities. In a fourth case, two men were tried for at   a French dip-
 lomat and his wife in February. They were charged with plotting to carry out ex-
 tremist attacks, possessing illegal arms and explosives, and manufacturing explo-
 sives. The trials were ongoing at year's end.
 In December the State Security Court began trials in two cases involving the ex-
 ercise of free speech. 'Ata Abu Rishtah, spokesman for the Islamic Liberation Party,
 was put on trial for allegedly slandering the King i a newspaper interview. The
 editor of the weekly that published the interview also faces prsecution. Also Layth
 Shubaylat, a prominent i    en and president of Jordan's En   eers Association,
 was put on trial for slandering the King and Queen and for related charges stem-
 mingfrm his lectures which were critical of the peace treaty with Israel. Shubaylat
 has be en detained without bail. Both cases were pending at year's end.
 The Government considers the Shubaylat case to be a criminal matter, although
 international human righta .groujps have expressed their concern.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The au-
 thorities generslly respe~t the Constitutional prohibitions of such practices. In most
 cases, the police must obtain a warrant from the Prosecutor General or a judge be-
 fore conducting searches. However, in security cases, authorities sometimes--in vio-
 lation of the law-obtain warrants retroactively or obtain preapproved warrants. Se-
 curity officers reportedly monitor telephones, read correspondence and engage in
 surveillance of persons who allegedly pose a threat to the regime. W4hile these prac-
 tices are not believed to be widespread, the law permits them if the Government
 obtains a court order.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and citizens generally do not hesitate to openly criticize the Govern-
 ment. However, the Press and Publications Law of 1993 restricts coverage of 10 sub-
 jects, most notably the military services, the royal family, and monetary policy. In
 addition, journalists engage in self-censorship When reporting security issues and
 opposition to the Government.
 The Government exercises control over the indepennt t print media by requiring
 licenses for newspapers and periodicals. However, the 1993 law eased licensing re-
 qurements and does not prescribe penalties for publishing without a license. The
 Govenmnt may revoke a license only if a company fals to publish for an extended
 period of time. The Government has licensed nine new weeklies and dailies in 1995.
 The Government also requires licenses for journalists, editors, and publishers.
 Journalists have long complained about the requirement that they must join the
 government-sponsored Jordan Press Association (JPA). However, the Government
 has not taen legal action against journalists who refuse to join the Association. The
 press law offers limited :protection for the confidentiality of a journalist's sources.
 In September the Ministry of Information permitted the establishment of a for-
 eign press club. Foreign journalists and Jordanian working for foreign news agen-
 cies must also register with the Ministry of Information.
 The Penal Code authorizes the State to take legal action against any person who
 incites violence, defames heads of state, disseminates "false or exaggerated informa-
 tion outside the country which attacks state dignity" or defames public officials.
 Government prosecution of journalists for slander picked up following a November
 speech by Kin Hussein that sharply criticized the media for abusing its freedom.
 The Government also revived several cases against journalists which had been dor-
 mant for more than a year. The Government had promised to introduce amend-
 ments to the Press and Publications Law that would further tighten restrictions and
 increase monetary and other penalties, but no amendments had been introdced by
 year's end. Journalists accused of violating the law are tried in a special court for
 press and copyright cases. In 1995 the court heard approximately 20 cases related
 to freedom of the press; in two cases it issued guilty verdicts and fines of $143 (100
 Jordanian Dinars) each. Defendants in the other cases were found innocent. Amman
 correspondent for AI-Hayat Salamah Na'mat was detained in October for several
 days' questioning and later charged with slander, inaccurate reporting, and "damag-
 ing national unity" under the Press and Publications Law. The trial began in De-
 cember and was ongoing at year's end.
 
 
 1200
 The Government banned issues of two weekly newspapers in 1995. In January the
 Government accused these newspapers of distorting facts, fabricating stories, and
 publisbng ob scene photos. It suspended their publication licenses inFebraay be-
 cause their chief editors were not registered with the JPA. The suspensions were
 revoked 2 months later by court order.
 Radio and television news is more restricted than print media. Television news
 airs criticisms of the Government but rarely covers alleged human rights abuses.
 All political parties have access to broadcast facilities, but the cost of air time is
 pr__hibitivelyhigh. International tlevsion programs are available by satellite.
 The Government does not usually interfere with the importation of foreign news-
 papers and magazines. However, a weekly issue of the Paris-based AI-Muharir was
 banned in January for pubishn  an intrview in which Libyan leader Mu'ammar
 Al -Qadaa criticized Arab countries for making peace with Israel
 In the past, some leftist and Islamist university professors were dismissed for ad-
 vocating extremist  political views. Intellectuals believe that there are no safeguards
 to prevent future dismissals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens must obtain permits
 for public gatherings. Since 1989 the Government has granted permits for peaceful
 demonstrations. It routinely licenses political parties and has licensed 23 of them
 since 1992. Membership in an unlicensed party is illegal. The High Court of Justice
 may dissolve a party if-it violates the Constitution or the Political Parties' Law. The
 Government has no discretion to deny a license to a party that submits a complete
 application, including names of the founders, financial-information, and bylaws.
 The Government has become concerned aboutpublic dissent arising from the
 peace treaty signed with Israel in 1994. In 1995 it denied permits for publicprotests
 and rallies m opposition to the treaty. In May the Government rescinded a pre-
 viously issued permit for a conference sponsored by 11 political parties opposed to
 the normalization of relations with Israel
 The Government has also sought to limit the political activities of professional or-
 ganizations. In January the Interior Ministry denied a permit for the Al-Urdun Al-
 Jadid Political Research Center and the Business and Professional Women's Club
 to hold a workshop on the new draft election law. Senior government officials have
 warned these organizations to abide by legal requirements that they remain 'apo-
 litical." In August security forces closed the professional associations office building
 in Amman, preventing a union meeting against normalization with Israel. Despite
 its warnings against political activities, the Government had not introduced legisla-
 tion by year's end to tighten control over the professional associations.
 The Government also harassed the supporters of the Islamic Action Front (IAF),
 an Islamist political party, during the municipal elections held in July. According
 to the Public Freedoms and Citizens Rights Committee, government officials broke
 up several IAF meetings during the election campaign and warned shopkeepers in
 several towns not to display posters or banners for AP candidates. The Prime Min-
 ister denied that the Government interfered in the election campaign.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-According to the Constitution, Islam is the state religion.
 Sunni Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the population. The Government con-
 trols the mosques through the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Trusts, which ap-
 points imama and subsidizes activities sponsored by the mosques. In September the
 Government reaffirmed the year-old ban prohibiting 25 Islamist parliamentarians
 from preaching in the mosques. Islamic instruction is required for all Muslim stu-
 dents in public schools.
 The Government does not interfere with public worship by Jordan's Christian mi-
 nority. The Government does not recognize the Baha'i faith as a religion but does
 not prohibit the practice of the faith.
 The law prohibits non-Muslims from proselytizing. Muslims who convert to other
 faiths complain of social and government discrimination. The Government does not
 fully recognize the legality of such conversions. Under Islamic law, converts are re-
 garded as apostates and may, in principle, be legally denied their property and
 other rights, although this does not happen in practice. Converts from islam do not
 fall under the jurisdiction of their new religion s laws in matters of personal status
 and are still considered Muslims under Shari'a law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for the right of citizens to travel freely abroad and
 within Jordan except in and through military areas. The law reguires that Jor-
 danian women and foreign women married to Jordanians obtain written permission
 from a male guardian to travel abroad or apply for a passport. This requirement
 is normally enforced only when a married woman plans to travel abroad with chil-
 dren. Legal authorities enforce requests from fathers to prevent their children from
 departing the country, even when traveling with their mothers.
 
 
 1201
 Many Palestinian residents are Jordanian citizens, with the rights of citizenship.
 Jordanians with full citizenship receive passports valid for 5 years. Until 1995 the
 Government issued passports with 2-year validity to Palestinians who arrived after
 1967, as well as to Palestinians in areas under Israeli occupation who did not have
 other travel documentation. In October the King announcedthat virtually all appli-
 cants would be eligible for 6-year passports. The Government stresses that these
 passports are for travel only; they do not denote nationality. Palestinians must ob-
 tain permits from the Ministry of Interior for travel between Jordan and the Israeli-
 occupied territories and neighboring states. Such permits are routinely granted.
 Over 1.2 million Palestinian refugees are registered in Jordan with the United
 Nations Relief and Works Agency. The Agency counts another 800,000 Palestinians
 as displaced from the 1967 war, arrivals following the 1967 war, and returnees from
 the Gulf. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees in assisting refugees. In 1994 the Government conducted a regularly
 scheduled census, which included questions for Palestinians about their family ties
 to Jordan. The full results of the census have not yet been released. The Constitu-
 tion prohibits the deportation of citizens. The Government has deported non-Jor-
 danians for security reasons.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights. The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Executive and legislative powers are so concentrated in the hands of the King
 that citizens do not have any meaningful ability to change their system of govern-
 ment. The King has sole discretionary authority to form and dismiss the Cabinet,
 dissolve Parliament, and establish the broad outlines of public policy. Appointments
 made by the King to high government posts do not require legislative approval. The
 Prime Minister and the Cabinet have limited policymaking powers.
 The Parliament is composed of a Senate appointed by the King and a Chamber
 of Deputies elected by the people. Of the 80 seats in the Chamber, 9 are reserved
 for Christians, 6 for Bedouins, and 3 for the Circassian or Chechen ethnic minori-
 ties. The Parliament is empowered to approve, reject, or amend legislation proposed
 by the Cabinet. In practice, Members of Parliament ask the Government to submit
 specific legislation for consideration. The Parliament may amend such draft legisla-
 ion. The King may propose extraordinary sessions of Parliament and may postpone
 regular sessions up to 60 days. The King must approve by decree all laws passed
 by Parliament. If the Government amends or enacts a law when Parliament is not
 in session, it must submit the law to Parliament for consideration during the next
 session.
 Women have the right to vote and women's groups encouraged women to vote in
 the July municipal elections. In the Amman area, over 43 percent of those who
 voted were women. During 1995 there were two women in the Cabinet, one in the
 Chamber of Deputies, and two in the Senate. Eleven women were elected to munici-
 pal psts in 1995, including 1 as mayor.
 The Palestinian community, estimated to be slightly over one-half of the total pop-
 ulation, is not represented proportionately in the Government. Four of 30 ministers,
 7 of 40 senators, and 15 of 80 lower house deputies are of Palestinian origin. The
 electoral system gives greater representation to south Jordan, which has few inhab-
 itants of Palestinian origin.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups investigate allegations of human
 rights abuses and have published and disseminated findings critical of government
 policy. However, the Press and Publications Law restricts the publication of infor-
 mation about the military and security services, which, in effect, prevents the publi-
 cation of reports alleging torture and other abuses committed by the security serv-
 ices.
 The ICRC is granted permission to visit prisoners and assess the condition of se-
 curity detainees. Early in the year, the Government hampered the ICRC's regular
 biweekly visits to detainees held by the General Intelligence Directorate. However,
 the ICRC's regularly scheduled access resumed following a June meeting between
 the Crown Prince and ICRC officials.
 The Arab Organization for Human Rights and the Amman-based Peace Center for
 Humanitarian Studies are registered with the Government and have raised human
 rights cases with government officials. Both organizations have drawn public atten-
 tion to alleged human rights abuses and have pressed the Government to explain
 the status of some prisoners and to charge or release the prisoners promptly.
 
 
 1202
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Though Jordanian law does not distinguish between citizens on the basis of race,
 women and minorities are treated differently under the law and may face discrimi-
 nation in employment, housing, and other catagories.
 Women.-Violence against women over the age of 15 is common. Reported inci-
 dents of all crimes against women declined in 1995, although medical experts ac-
 knowledge that spousal violence against women occurs frequently. However, cul-
 tural norms constrain victims from seeking medical or legal help and frustrate a sci-
 entific assessment of the extent of the abuse.
 Abused women have the right to file a complaint in court against their spouses
 but in practice, familial and societal pressures discourage them from seeking le$a
 remedies. Nongovernmental organizations provide assistance such as the Jordanian
 Women's Union's hot-line to victims of domestic violence. Wie beating is technically
 grounds for divorce, but the husband may seek to demonstrate that he has authority
 from the Koran to correct an irreligious or disobedient wife by striking her.
 The Criminal Code allows for leniency for persons found guilty of committing a
 "crime of honor," the term commonly used for a violent assault against a female by
 a male relative for alleged sexual misconduct. The press reported 15 such cases in
 1995, down from 23 reports in 1994. However, these figures likely understate the
 actual number of cases, as most crimes of honor are not reported by the press. Ac-
 cording to the law, a "crime of honor defense may be invoked only by a defendant
 who 'surprises his wife or any close female relative committing adultery." Women
 may not invoke this defense for murdering a male relative under the same cir-
 cumstances. Even if the defense cannot meet the stringent requirements for a crime
 of honor defense-the defendant must have witnessed the female victim engaging
 in sexual intercourse-offenders rarely spend more than 2 years in prison. In con-
 trast to honor crimes, the maximum penalty for first-degree murder is death; the
 maximum penalty for second-degree murder is 15 years.
 Women experience legal discrimination in matters of pension and social security
 benefits, inheritance, divorce, and the value of testimony in court (see Section 1.e.).
 The Government provides men with more generous social security benefits than
 women. The Government continues pension payments of a deceased male civil serv-
 ant to his heirs but discontinues the payments of a deceased female civil servant.
 Under Shari'a or, Islamic law, female heirs receive half the amount of a male
 heir's inheritance while the non-Muslim widows of Muslim spouses have no inherit-
 ance rights. A sole female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes
 to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents' property.
 Male Muslim heirs have the duty to provide for all family members who need assist-
 ance. Shari'a law regards the testimony of two women to be equal to the testimony
 of one man. This technically a pplies only in religious courts but in the past has been
 imposed in civil courts as wet irrespective of religion. Men are able to obtain di-
 vorce more easily than women under-Islamic law. Marriage and divorce matters for
 Christians are adjudicated by special courts for each denomination. The Government
 bans married women from applying for diplomatic posts.
 The law requires a married woman to obtain her husband's permission to obtain
 a passport (see Section 2.d.). Married women do not have the legal right to confer
 citizenship on their children. However, they may obtain citizenship for their non-
 Jordanian husbands who then may confer citizenship for the children. Civil law
 grants women equal pay for equal work, but in practice this law is sometimes ig-
 nored.
 Social pressure against women pursuing a career is generally strong. Nonetheless,
 women have employment opportunities in many professions, including engineering,
 medicine, education, and law. Women's groups stress that the problem or discrinm-
 nation is not only one of law but also of women's lack of awareness of their rights
 or unwillingness to assert those rights. The United Nations Food and Agricultural
 Organization reported in 1995 that women in Jordan who work in agriculture aver-
 age 15-hour days and earn less than men. The Jordanian chapter of the Business
 and Professional Women's Club gives seminars on women's rights and assists
 women in establishing small businesses.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare in the
 areas of education and health. However, the Government's progress in these areas
 is constrained by limited financial resources.
 The Government guarantees some children's rights, especially regarding child
 labor. Although the law prohibits children under the age of 16 from working, child
 peddlers work the streets of Amman. The Ministry of Social Development has
 formed a committee to address the problem and in most cases removes the children
 from the streets, returns them to their families or to juvenile centers, and may pro-
 
 
 1203
 vide the families with a monthly stipend. However, the child usually returns to the
 streets soon afterwards. Corporal punishment in schools is prohibited.
 Although the problem is difficult to quantify social workers say there is a signifi-
 cant incidence of child abuse within fainilies. ;he law specifies punishment for spe-
 cific abuses against children. Rape and sodomy of a child under 15 years of age
 carry the death penalty. Four men were executed in July for the sodomy and mur-
 der of a 4-year-old boy, and another man was executed in December for the rape
 and murder of a 14-year-old girl In January 1996, the Court of Cassation upheld
 the death sentence of a man for repeatedly raping and threatening the life of a 10-
 year-old girl. The incidence of crimes especially sexual crimes, against children is
 sigifcantl higher than reported in tle   yress.
 3eople With Disabilities.-High unemployment in the general population restricts
 job opportunities for the disabled. The Government passed legislation in 1993 re-
 quiring future public buildings to accommodate the needs of the disabled and the
 retrofitting of existing public buildings, but implementation has been slow. The Spe-
 cial Education Department of the Mnistry of Social Development admitted 14 new
 disabled persons into their special centers andplaced 5 disabled persons in public
 and private sector jobs. The Ministry provided the employers with specialized facili-
 ties for the disabled and exempted the company from customs and taxes. Private
 organizations and members of the royal family actively promote programs to edu-
 cate and rehabilitate the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-The Bedouin population carry Jordanian passports ani are
 increasingly assimilated into society. However, they do face social, economic, and
 rfessional discrimination. The Government reserves 6 seats for the Bedouin in the
 amber of Deputies. The military and police forces have special units primarily
 composed of Bedouins.
 Religious Minorities.-The Government does not recognize the Baha'i faith as a
 religion. It does not record the religion on national identity cards issued to Baha'is,
 nor does it register property belonging to the community. Unlike Christian denomi-
 nations, the Bahai community does not have its own court to adjudicate personal
 status and family matters. Bahai personal status matters are heard in Islamic law
 courts.
 The Government does not officially recognize the Jehovah's Witnesses, the United
 Pentecostal Church, the Church of Christ, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
 Day Saints, but it allows them to conduct their activities without harassment.
 Established religions require official government recognition in order to register
 property in the name of the church, but members may practice their religion with-
 out government recognition. In general Christians do not suffer discrimination.
 Christians hold cabinet and other government positions and are represented in the
 media and academia approximately in proportion to their presence in the general
 population, which is estimated at 6 percent. Christian and Bahai children in public
 schools are not required to articipate in Islamic religious instruction.
 National/RaciaflEthnic M inorities.-The Government granted full citizenship to
 all Palestinians who fled to Jordan in the period after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War
 and to a large number of refugees who arrived after the 1967 war. However, refu-
 gees who fled Gaza after 1967 are not entitled to citizenship and until 1995 were
 issued only limited 2-year passports. As of October, most Palestinian refugees- be-
 came eligible to receive 5-year passports, but the Government has stressed that
 these passports are for travel only and do not connote nationality (see Section 2.d.).
 Palestinians suffer disproportionate scrutiny in taxation and discrimination in the
 award of university scholarships and appointments to senior positions in the Gov-
 ernment and the military.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers in the private sector and in some state-
 owned companies have the right to establish and join unions. Unions must be reg-
 istered to be considered legal. The law prohibits union membership for noncitizens.
 Over 30 percent of the work force is organized into 17 unions. Although union mem-
 bership n the General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions (GFJTU), the sole
 trade federation, is not mandatory, all unions belong to it. The Government sub-
 sidizes and audits the GFJTU's salaries and activities. Union officials are elected
 by secret ballot to 2-year terms. Although the Government cosponsors and approves
 the timing of these elections, it does not interfere in the choice of candidates.
 Labor laws mandate that workers must obtain permission from the Government
 in order to strike. Unions generally will not seek approval for a strike, but workers
 will use the threat of a strike or wildcat action as a negotiating tactic. Strikes are
 prohibited if a labor dispute is under mediation or arbitration.  a settlement is not
 reached through mediation, the Ministry of Labor may refer the dispute to an indus-

 trial tribunal by agreement of both parties. If only one party agrees, the Ministry
 of Labor refers the dispute to the Council of Ministers and then to Parliament. The
 tribunal is an independent arbitration panel of judges appointed by the Ministry of
 Labor. The decisions of the panel are legally binding. Labor law prohibits employers
 from dismissing a worker during a labor dispute. There were no reported strikes in
 1995.
 The GFJTU belongs to the Arab Labor Organization the International Confed-
 eration of Arab Trade Unions, and to the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have, and exercise,
 the right to bargain collectively. The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimina-
 tion, but the ICFTU claims that the Government does not adequately proec em-
 ployees from antiunion discrimination and that the Government has dismissed pub-
 lic-sector employees for political reasons. Workers may lodge complaints of
 antiunion diciiation with the Ministry of Labor, which is authorizedi to order
 the reinstatement of employees discharged for union activities. The Ministry did so
 in 3 out of8 cases in 1993-94.
 The national labor laws apply in the free trade zones in Aqaba and Zarqa. Private
 sector employees in these zones belong to one national union that covers both zones
 and have the right to bargain collectively.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids compul-
 sory labor, except in a state of emergency such as war or natural disaster. Compul-
 sory labor is not practiced.
 d.Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor law forbids children under
 the age of 16 from working except as apprentices, who at age 13 maybegin part-
 time training, for up to 6 hours a day and no night work. Ministry of  mbr ispec-
 tors attempt to enforce the law on child labor, but in practice enforcement often does
 not extend to some small family businesses which employ underage children. Edu-
 cation is compulsory to age 15. Families in remote areas frequently keep some
 school-age children at home to work. Child peddlers work on the streets of Amman
 (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. The Gov-
 ernment periodically adjusts a minimum wage schedule for various trades, based on
 recommendations of an advisory panel representing workers, employers, and the
 Government. The lowest minimum wage rate on the schedule is about $150 (80 di-
 nars) a month including allowances. Workers earning the lowest wage find it dif-
 ficult to stay abve the poverty level, which the Government estimates at a monthly
 wage of about $93 (65 dinars) per month for a family of three.
 The law prohibits most workers from working more than the customary 48 hours
 a week, and 54 hours for hotel, restaurant, and cinema employees. Workers may not
 work more than 16 hours in any continuous period or more than 60 hours' overtime
 per month. Employees are entitled to 1 day off each week. The law does not apply
 to domestic servants, who do not have a legal forum to address their labor griev-
 ances. Domestic servants, almost all of whom are foreigners, have no standing to
 sue in court for nonpayment of wages.
 The law specifies a number of health and safety requirements for workers, includ-
 ing the presence of bathrooms, drinking water, and first aid equipment at work
 sites. The Ministry of Labor makes an effort to enforce health and safety require-
 ments but is hampered by the lack of qualified inspectors. The inspectors do not
 have the power to order firms to comply with health and safety standards. The law
 does not require employers to report industrial accidents or occupational diseases
 to the Ministry of Labor. Workers do not have a statutory right to remove them-
 selves from hazardous conditions without risking loss of their job.
