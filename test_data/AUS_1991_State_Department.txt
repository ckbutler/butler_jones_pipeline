 AUSTRALIA
 Australia has a federal system of government and a long history
 as a multiparty parliamentary democracy. National elections
 were held on March. 24, 1990 and must take place again by July
 10, 1993.
 Federal, state, and local police carry out their functions in
 accordance with civil law, which respects and safeguards
 individual human rights. The law is observed in practice.
 Australia has a developed economy, largely based on mining and
 agriculture but with growing manufacturing and service sectors,
 which provides most Australians with a high per capita income.
 A wide-range of government programs offers assistance for the
 minority of relatively disadvantaged citizens, but fiscal
 constraints are affecting the amount of that assistance.
 Persons are tree to hold private property, pursue their
 economic and personal interests, associate with others, and
 organize trade unions.
 Basic human rights are assured by law and respected in practice
 in Australia, except in some external territories. The
 colonial legacy in some of the external territories has
 resulted in outdated and indecipherable laws which do not
 protect some basic human rights. This is particularly true of
 Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands, which have a combined
 population of about 3,600. Government efforts are under way to
 reform these laws to bring them in line with the rest of
 Australian law by July 1, 1992. The Government is firmly
 committed, both domestically and internationally, to the
 promotion of, and respect for, human rights.
 While Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) peoples
 remained the most economically and socially disadvantaged
 minorities, they now have the possibility of managing their own
 affairs through a nationwide framework of elected councillors
 and commissioners. -The final report of the Royal Commission
 into Aboriginal deaths in custody, released in April 1991,
 found that while ATSI deaths could not be considered genocide,
 the callous indifference and negligence of officials in charge
 of the prisoners contributed to the deaths. ATSI deaths in
 custody have decreased significantly as a result of increased
 public scrutiny and the adoption of some legislative and
 procedural measures suggested by the Commission's 1988 interim
 report. The imprisonment rate of ATSI peoples, however, is
 extraordinarily high-29 times that of the general community in
 Australia. The Australian federal and state governments have
 been either unable or unwilling to implement the necessary
 steps to curb this rate, which continues to grow in some states.
 Federal and state officials in August announced a plan for
 increasing cooperation and streamlining ATSI affairs programs
 to provide more efficient service. During 1991 several
 Aboriginal groups gained expanded land ownership and legal
 rights from state and local governments.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Killing for political motives by the Government or by political
 organizations does not occur.
 
 
 773
 AUSTRALIA
 The Royal Commission investigating ATSI deaths in custody found
 that although the deaths were not deliberately caused, police
 and prison officials showed callous indifference and remarkable
 insensitivity, which contributed significantly to the deaths.
 The Commission found that although ATSI peoples died at
 approximately the same rate as non-ATSI peoples in prison, ATSI
 peoples were arrested at a rate 29 times that of whites.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no instances of political disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Australian law prohibits all these practices, and this
 prohibition is generally respected. There is, however,
 credible evidence that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders
 in custody are frequently mistreated. According to human
 rights investigators, ATSI peoples in prison have been subject
 to solitary confinement, beatings, use of leg irons, and
 deprivation of light. Federal and state authorities continued
 efforts to address the problem of deaths and mistreatment of
 Aboriginals in custody. The.Royal Commission report on
 Aboriginal deaths in custody recommended several steps to
 reduce the number of arrests and improve the treatment of ATSI
 prisoners to avoid further deaths.
 A March 1991 report by the House of Representatives Standing
 Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs found that in
 Australia's external territories of Christmas Island and Cocos
 Islands, whipping is still a sentencing option, which the
 report held to be violation .of basic human rights. The report
 also stated that these territories lack an appropriate range of
 sentencing options and continue to apply a mandatory life
 imprisonment sentence for murder. The Federal Government
 announced in September 1991 plans to reform such laws in the
 external territories by July 1, 1992.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.
 This prohibition is respected in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although Australia in law and practice gives defendants rights
 to due process, including a presumption of innocence, a right
 to confront witnesses, and a right to appeal, the State is not
 required to pay for an indigent defendant's lawyer.
 In practice, all states except New South Wales oblige people
 involved in criminal cases to meet a merit test before
 qualifying for legal aid. The purpose of the merit test is to
 save the government from "wasting funds on unwinnable cases. "
 The local Legal Aid Commission evaluates a case and determines
 whether the case is worth pursuing. The Commission also weighs
 the chances of winning a case against the gravity of the likely
 penalty.
 Most, but not all, serious criminal cases merit legal counsel.
 If the case is deemed futile, the defendant is denied counsel
 at public expense. An unfavorable decision may be appealed to
 a panel of independent lawyers and social workers appointed by
 the Legal Aid Commission. .Defendants appearing before a
 
 
 774
 AUSTRALIA
 Defense Force Magistrate are exempt from the merit test. Also,
 ATSI peoples, who comprise about 1.5 percent of Australia's
 population, are able to receive legal aid without a merit test
 from special legal counsel offices set up specifically for them.
 Negative economic conditions are affecting the states' ability
 to provide legal aid. In the State of Victoria, the Legal Aid
 Commission announced in May that it would not grant aid in
 criminal cases likely to cost the state government more than
 $157,356 unless it received extra funding for such cases.
 Despite these problems, the Australian High Court is expected
 to decide in 1992 whether a legal right to counsel has been
 created under international law.
 According to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on
 Legal and Constitutional Affairs' report on the legal regimes
 of Australia's external territories, the laws of Australia's
 external territory of the Cocos Islands do not provide for a
 right to trial by jury. Christmas Island recently changed its
 laws to allow trial by jury and held its first such trial in
 October.
 The report also stated that, as no formal arrangement for legal
 aid exists in either the Cocos Islands or Christmas Island,
 residents of these islands are denied equality before the
 courts and equal protection of the law. The Government issued
 a response to the report in September and pledged to reform
 these laws by July 1, 1992.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Australian law and in practice, no search may be
 conducted without a judicially issued warrant. The Government
 does not interfere with the privacy of family, home, or
 correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The democratic political system, an effective judiciary, and
 diverse, vigorous, and independent news media combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press and full academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Australia does not have a bill of rights, but it is a party to
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which
 provides for freedom of assembly and expression. These
 freedoms are respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Australians have complete freedom of religion. A provision in
 the Constitution precludes the adoption of an official state
 religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Australia imposes no restrictions on movement within or outside
 of the country. The rights of emigration and repatriation are
 also protected. The legal status of some 350 Cambodian boat
 
 
 AUSTRALIA
 people who applied for refugee status remained unresolved. At
 least 29 have appealed the Immigration Department's initial
 decision in May to deny their asylum applications. If their
 appeals fail, they will be subject to deportation as illegal
 immigrants. In the meantime, all boat people remain in
 detention at various centers around the country,
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Australians elect representatives to a two-chamber Federal
 Parliament as well as to numerous state and local'bodies
 through free and open elections.
 Candidates are drawn from three major parties and a number of
 minor parties. Voting, by secret ballot, is compulsory in
 general elections for Australians 18 years of age and older;
 persons may abstain or invalidate their ballots, but eligible
 voters who do not at least collect ballots may be fined.
 Elections are held at varying intervals as prescribed by
 federal, state, and local laws.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A wide range of local nongovernmental organizations concerned
 with human rights operate freely and the Government permits
 unimpeded access to all international groups investigating
 alleged human rights violations. As a matter of policy, the
 Government responds to any communication from the United
 Nations alleging violations of human rights in Australia.
 Australia actively promotes human rights on the international
 level as a reelected member of the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission and as a member of the United Nations Working Group
 on Indigenous Populations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 By law Australians have equal access to government services
 without reference to race, sex, religion, language, or social
 status. Basic food, shelter, health care, education, and
 social security benefits are guaranteed for all. The Racial
 Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimination on grounds
 of race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin.
 However, Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders,'who comprise
 about 1.5 percent of the nation's population, continue to
 suffer widespread discrimination.
 Acknowledging that the Aboriginal population is the most
 disadvantaged group in terms of education, housing, health, and
 employment, the federal and state governments provide services,
 in addition to the broad range of programs available to all
 Australians, specifically aimed at improving Aboriginal
 socioeconomic conditions. Thus far, however, these services
 have not been able to reverse the deteriorating social
 conditions of ATSI peoples.
 The Federal Government's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
 Commission (ATSIC), established by Parliament in late 1989,
 replaced the department of Aboriginal Affairs and the
 Aboriginal Development Commission in March 1990. ATSIC was
 designed to give ATSI peoples greater control over many
 government programs intended for their benefit. In late 1990,
 
 
 776
 AUSTRALIA
 a special nationwide election filled 800 all-Aboriginal and
 Torres Strait Islanders positions on the 60 ATSIC regional
 councils. The newly elected councillors selected 17 national
 commissioners in March 1991 and'the Federal Minister for
 Aboriginal Affairs appointed the chairman and two other
 commissioners.
 In 1990, the Federal Government and the federal opposition both
 expressed interest in a more formal delineation of Aboriginal
 rights. The Government continued to include funds in its
 1991-1992 budget to pursue an as yet undefined instrument of
 reconciliation with -Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders
 with an informal deadline of the centennial of federation in
 200L. Toward this end, the Government passed legislation at
 midyear to establish a Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation.
 The Council is to coordinate a 10-year multimillion dollar
 program, which aims to promote better understanding between
 ATSI peoples and other Australians.
 On land rights issues, Aboriginal land councils gained control
 of four national parks in the state of New South Wales in April
 under state legislation calling for more "sympathetic
 management of ancient rock art sites." In addition,
 Aboriginals won a claim to 2,300 square kilometers in the
 Northern Territory in May.  However, they lost a 13-year legal
 battle for the Cox Peninsula in the Northern Territory--
 mainly because many of the traditional owners died while
 waiting for'the claim to be settled. In April Aboriginals made
 their first official claim for land rights in the state of
 Queensland. They have asked for freehold title to Aboriginal
 reserves, crown land, and national parks; limited access to
 pastoral lease; and veto power over licensing mining, tourism,
 and commercial fishing.
 The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody issued its
 final 11-volume report after spending 3 years investigating 99
 deaths. Although the Commission found that ATSI peoples died
 in custody at the same rate as non-ATSI peoples, ATSI peoples
 were incarcerated at a rate 29 times higher than that of
 non-ATSI peoples. The Commission found that the most
 significant factor in the higher incarceration rate was the
 disadvantaged and unequal position ATSI peoples hold in
 Australian society.
 The report's 339 recommendations fall into two categories-
 first, the relationship between ATSI people and the criminal
 justice system, and second, the underlying factors which lead
 to a higher rate of ATSI peoples in police custody. The first
 category recommends that states pass laws to ensure that prison
 is used only as a last resort, especially for public
 intoxication; that police take all possible steps to eliminate
 violent or rough treatment and use of racist language with ATSI
 peoples; that police review their use of paramilitary forces to
 avoid their unnecessary use in Aboriginal communities; and that
 a coroner investigate not only the cause and the circumstances
 of a death in custody but also the care, treatment, and
 supervision of the deceased before death.
 The second category's recommendations include: establishment
 of a national task force on alcohol abuse; a review of liquor
 licensing legislation to reduce the availability of alcohol
 while still meeting ATSI communities' needs; the promotion by
 all political leaders and parties of the process of
 reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
 communities; a national survey of the Aboriginal population and
 
 
 777
 AUSTRALIA
 infrastructure; and a requirement that governments and agencies
 devise strategies to reduce the number of Aboriginal juveniles
 involved in the welfare and criminal justice systems. The
 Federal Government called on all of its departments to issue
 plans in late 1991 for the implementation of many of the
 recommendations. Because of the structure of Australian
 federal and state politics, however, only the states can change
 many of the most crucial laws, particularly those which would
 reduce the high imprisonment rates of ATSI peoples.
 Overall domestic violence, mainly against females, may involve
 as many as one in three Australian families. The problem
 continues to attract government and public concern. The
 National Domestic Violence Education Program, which, according
 to government research and women's rights organizations,
 successfully raised overall awareness about the problem in
 1989, continued its emphasis in 1991 on changing attitudes in
 particular socioeconomic groups (e.g., Aboriginals, who have a
 higher incidence of domestic violence). Improving training for
 law enforcement and community workers and'expanding crisis
 support services were also emphasized.
 The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 prohibits discrimination on
 the basis of sex, marital status, or pregnancy. In 1986 the
 Government passed affirmative action legislation obliging
 employers to provide equal employment and promotion
 opportunities for female employees. Women's rights and welfare
 are promoted by a number of women's rights groups and the
 Federal Government's Office of the Status of Women.
 A March 1991 report of the House of Representatives Standing
 Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs concerning the
 legal regimes of Australia's external territories found family
 law in the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island is "outdated and
 discriminatory in many respects." The report recommended that
 the 1975 Australian Family Law Act be extended to these
 islands. In doing so, however, the report recommended that
 proper recognition be given to local customs and institutions
 insofar as they do not violate human rights.
 In 1991 the Federal Government continued its commitment to
 promote intercultural understanding and tG better address the
 needs of ethnic groups through a national multicultural agenda.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Australian law and practice provide workers, including public
 servants, full freedom to establish and join trade unions, to
 choose their union representatives, to formulate union
 programs, to associate directly with their'counterparts in
 other nations and to participate in international labor
 organizations. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the
 principal labor organization in Australia, is affiliated with
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. A few
 individual unions are also affiliated with the Communist-
 dominated World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Unions represent about 40.5 percent of the work force and are
 extremely active and influential. Union representatives
 constitute 60 percent of the delegates at national conferences
 of the governing Australian Labor Party (ALP). However, unions
 remain independent of both government and ALP control.
 
 
 778
 AUSTRALIA
 Australian workers enjoy the right to strike, which is well
 established in practice. However, a 1989 ruling of the
 Victoria State Supreme Court, which declared the airline pilots
 union liable for damages arising'from the pilots' dispute with
 the airlines, underscored that the right to strike is not
 protected under domestic law. In its review of this case, the
 Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA) of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO) expressed its concern "about the scope
 of the common law liabilities which appear to attach to
 industrial action in Australia."
 Strikes are frequent although generally of short duration. In
 general, industrial disputes are resolved either through direct.
 employer-union negotiations or under the auspices of the
 various state and federal industrial relations commissions
 whose mandate includes resolution of disputes through
 conciliation and arbitration.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Australian workers are granted the right, by law and in
 practice, to organize and bargain collectively, and to be
 represented in negotiating the prevention and settlement of
 disputes with employers. Workers are also protected by law and
 in practice from antiunion discrimination. A pattern of
 centralized wage negotiations with quasi-judicial arbitration
 and settlement, supplemented by industry-wide or company-
 by-company collective bargaining, has generally prevailed since
 the establishment of the Commonwealth Conciliation and
 Arbitration Commission in 1904. The Industrial Relations Act
 of 1988 made important technical changes in the basic system,
 creating a new Industrial Relations Commission with expanded
 scope for performing essentially the same tasks as its
 predecessor.
 According to an Australian Bureau of Immigration research
 report released in May, Chinese contract workers in the
 Northern Territory's Trade Development Zone (TDZ) were
 "extremely underpaid." Moreover, their right to join a trade
 union was restricted by their employers as a condition of
 employment. As a result, the Special Immigration Agreement for
 the zone was canceled. Except for these Chinese workers, there
 were no restrictions on freedom of association in the TDZ.
 Minimum wages in the zone are determined by the same system of
 federal awards described in Section 6.e. below. However,
 employers and unions are free to negotiate "over-award" wages,
 where market conditions warrant.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Australia has ratified and fully respects ILO Convention 105
 concerning forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Although no federally mandated minimum age for employment
 exists, state-imposed compulsory education requirements,
 monitored and enforced by state educational authorities,
 prevent most children from joining the work force until they
 are 15 to 16 years old. In addition, Federal and State
 Ministries of Labor monitor and enforce a complicated network
 of legislation (which often varies from state to state)
 governing such interactive factors as minimum school-leaving
 
 
 AUSTRALIA
 age, minimum age to claim unemployment benefits, and minimum
 age to engage in specified occupations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Australia has long had a tradition that workers should be
 guaranteed a decent standard of living. Although a formal
 minimum wage exists, it is not used. Instead, most workers are
 covered by differing minimum wage rates for individual trades
 and professions which are embodied in a comprehensive system of
 "awards," determined by the various quasi-judicial state and
 federal industrial relations commissions after submissions by
 union, employer, and government representatives. In many cases
 involving individual business enterprises, the commissions
 approve wage rates previously negotiated and agreed upon by
 employer and union representatives. Where market conditions
 warrant, higher wages than those provided for in industrywide
 awards ("over-award payments") are common. The lowest current
 federal award of $314 per 38-hour week is for clothing
 workers. Combined with other regularly provided benefits and
 government entitlements for low-income families, this wage
 provides a decent standard of living.
 A complex body of federal and state regulatory and commission
 decisions prescribes a 40 hour (or less) workweek, paid
 vacations, sick leave, and health and safety standards in the
 workplace, as well as other benefits for the overwhelming
 majority of Australian workers. Compliance with these and
 other regulations is actively monitored and enforced by federal
 and state Ministries of Labor. A tripartite body called
 "Worksafe Australia" conducts periodic assessments of these
 issues. The Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1991 gives
 employees the legal right to cease work if they believe there
 is an immediate threat to their health or safety.
