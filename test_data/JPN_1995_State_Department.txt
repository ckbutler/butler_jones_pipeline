 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy based on a 1947 Constitution. Sovereignty
 is vested in the people, and the Emperor is defined as the symbol of state. Executive
 power is exercised by a cabinet, composed of a prime minister and ministers of
 state, responsible to the Diet, Japan's two-house Parliament. The Diet, elected by
 universal suffrage and secret ballot, designates the Prime Minister, who must be a
 
 
 member of that body. The Government, formed in June 1994, is a three-party coali-
 tion consisting of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Japan Socialist Party, and the
 New Party Sakigake. The judiciary is independent of the Government.
 A well-organized and disciplined police force generally respects the human rights
 of the populace and is firm   under the control of the civil authorities. However,
 there continued to be credible reports of harsh treatment of some suspects in cus-
 tod.
 he industrialized free market economy is highly efficient and competitive in
 world markets and provides residents with a high standard of living. In 1995, how-
 ever, the economy continued in a stats of recession which began in 1991.
 A just and efficient legal system generally assures observance of constitutionally
 provided human rights. However, there continue to be some reports of physical and
 psychological abuse of prisoners or detainees. Officials are sometimes dismissed for
 such abuse but are seldom tried, convicted, and imrisoned. The Burakumin (a
 group historically treated as outcasts), the Ainu (Japan s indigenous people), women,
 and alien residents experience varying degrees of societal discrimination, some of it
 severe and longstanding.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment. However, reports by several Japanese bar associa-
 tions, human ri     groups, and some prisoners indicate that police sometimes use
 physical violence, including kicking and beating, as well as psychological intimida-
 tion, including threats and name calling, to obtain confessions from suspects in cus-
 tody or to enforce discipline. In Japan confession is regarded as the first step in the
 rehabilitative process. Although under the Constitution, no criminal suspect can be
 compelled to make a self-incriminating confession, roughly 90 percent of all criminal
 cases going to trial include confessions, reflecting the priority that the system places
 on admissions of guilt. The Government points out that the high percentage of con-
 fessions, like the high conviction rate, is reflective of a higher standard of evidence
 needed to bring about indictment in the Japanese system. Since a system of arraign-
 ment does not exist in Japan, a suspect, if indicted, will be brought to trial even
 if that person has confessed to the crime. This results in a higher conviction rate
 than would otherwise be the case.
 Appellate courts have overturned several convictions in recent years on the
 ground that they were obtained as a result of forced confession. In addition, civil
 and criminal suits have been brought against some police and prosecution officials,
 alleging abuse during interrogation and detention. Finally, there were scattered al-
 legations of beatings of detainees in immigration detention facilities.
 The Japanese Federation of Bar Associations and human rights groups have criti-
 cized the prison system, with its emphasis on strict discipline and obedience to nu-
 merous rules. Guards sometimes selectively enforce rules and impose punishment,
 including "minor solitary confinement," which may be imposed for at least 1 and not
 more than 60 days and in which the prisoner is made to sit (for foreigners) or kneel
 (for Japanese) motionless in the middle of an empty cell.
 Some human rights groups allege that physical restraints, such as leather hand-
 cuffs, have been used as a form of punishment and that prisoners have been forced
 to eat and relieve themselves unassisted while wearing these restraints. Ministry
 of Justice officials state that restraints are used inside the prison only when pris-
 oners have been violent and pose a threat to themselves and others, or when there
 is concern that a prisoner might attempt to escape.
 d. Arbitray Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Constitutional provisions for freedom
 from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment are respected in practice. Japanese law pro-
 vides for judicial determination of the legality of detention. People may not be de-
 tained without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate
 before trial that probable cause exists to detain the accused. Under the Code of
 Criminal Procedure, a suspect may be held in police custody for up to 72 hours with-
 out judicial proceedings. Preindictment custody may be extended by a judge for up
 to 20 additional days. fan indictment follows, the suspect is transferred to a crimi-
 nal detention facility. Bail is available in only about 25 percent of cases.
 The Bar Association and human rights groups have criticized the practice of "sub-
 stitute detention." Although the law stipulates that suspects should be held in
 
 
 "houses of detention" between arrest and sentencing, a police detention facility may
 be substituted at the order of the court. This provision was originally added to cover
 a shortage of normal detention facilities. H-owever, according to the most recent
 Ministry of Justice White Paper on Crime, published in 1994, normal detention fa-
 cilities were filled to approximately 52 percent of capacity in 1993. Critics charge
 that allowing suspects to be detained by the same authorities who interrogate them
 heightens the potential for abuse and coercion. The Government counters that ade-
 quate safeguards to prevent abuse, including strong judicial oversight, have been
 built into the system.
 The length of time before a suspect is brought to trial depends on the nature of
 the crime but rarely exceeds 2 months from date of arrest; the average is 1 to 2
 months. Critics charge that access to counsel is limited both in duration and fre-
 quency, although the Government denies that this is the case. The Criminal Proce-
 dure Code grants the prosecution and investigating police officials the power to con-
 trol access to attorneys before indictment when deemed necessary for the sake of
 the investigation. As a court-appointed attorney is not approved until after indict-
 ment, suspects must rely on their own resources to hire an attorney for counseling
 before indictment. In addition, counsel may not be present during interrogation at
 any time before or after indictment. Beyond this, the Government affirms that the
 right of the accused to seek legal counsel is fully respected and that attorneys are
 almost always able to see clients without obstruction. Local bar associations provide
 detainees with a free counseling session prior to indictment. Counsel is provided at
 government expense after indictment if the arrested person cannot afford one.
 Preventive detention does not exist.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The judiciary is independent and free from execu-
 tive branch interference. The Cabinet appoints judges for 10-year terms, which can
 be renewed until judges have reached the age of 65. Justices of the Supreme Court
 can serve until the age of 70 but face periodic review through popular referendum.
 A defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision of a trial court of first instance
 may, within the period prescribed by law, appeal to a higher court. There are sev-
 eral levels of courts, with the Supreme Court serving as the highest judicial author-
 ity. There is no trial by jury in Japan.
 The Government respects in practice the constitutional provisions for the right to
 a speedy and public trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases. The defend-
 ant is informed of charges upon arrest and assured a public trial by an independent
 civilian court with defense counsel and the right of cross-examination. The Constitu-
 tion provides defendants with the right not to be compelled to testify against them-
 selves as well as to free and private access to counsel, although the right to such
 access is sometimes abridged m practice. For example, the law allows prosecutors
 to control access to counsel before indictment, and there are persistent allegations
 of coerced confessions. Defendants are also protected from the retroactive applica-
 tion of laws and have the right of access to incriminating evidence after a formal
 indictment has been made. However, the law does not require full disclosure by the
 prosecutor, and material that the prosecution will not use in court may be sup-
 pressed.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made upon separate warrant is-
 sued by a judge. Standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard against arbi-
 trary searches. There were no reports that the Government or any other organiza-
 tion arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and is respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shintoism are the two major reli-
 gions, there are many others, including several Christian denominations. Some tem-
 ples and shrines receive public support as national historic or cultural sites.
 The Government does not require that religious groups be licensed. However, to
 receive official recognition as a religious organization, which brings tax easement
 and other benefits, a group must register with local or national authorities as a "re-
 ligious corporation." In practice, almost all religious groups register, and in 1995 the
 procedure was little more than a formality. However, following a series of crimes
 
 
 allegedly carried out by the Aum Shinrikyo religious sect, the Government prepared,
 and the Diet in December passed, amendments to the Religious Corporation Law.
 The amendments give governmental authorities increased oversight of religious bod-
 ies and require greater disclosure of financial assets by religious corporations. An-
 other change shifts authority over religious corporations active in more than one
 prefecture from local authorities to the Ministry of Education. It remains unclear
 whether these amendments will result in an infringement of freedom of worship or
 of expression.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have the right to travel freely both within Japan and abroad,
 to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. Japa-
 nese nationality may be lost by naturalization in a foreign country, for people bern
 with dual nationality, or by failure to elect Japanese nationality at the required age.
 Japan has granted asylum in only a small number of cases to those claiming fear
 of persecution if they return to their homeland. The Government believes that most
 people seeking asylum in Japan do so for economic reasons. According to the For-
 eign Ministry, from 1982 to August 1995, Japan determined that 208 of 1,162 appli-
 cants met the required standard for asylum. The Government has shown flexibility
 in dealing with visa extensions for Chinese student dissidents, although it continues
 to be reluctant to grant permanent asylum.
 Strict administrative procedures contribute to the roughly 20-percent rate of ap-
 proval of asylum applications. For example, appeals of initial denials are reviewed
 by a separate authority of the same body, and decisions are rarely overturned. Asy-
 lum seekers and some critics claim that the processing of asylum applications is not
 readily understandable, making it difficult for applicants to comply with government
 procedures. Also, the Government's "60-day rule" requires applicants to appear at
 an immigration office within 60 days of arrival or within 60 days of the time they
 learn they are likely to be persecuted in their home country; most asylum seekers
 arrive in Japan without knowledge of this requirement and can inadvertently waive
 their claim by not acting promptly. In an effort to make procedures clearer to appli-
 cants, the Government has revised the English-language pamphlet it distributes to
 those interested in the asylum process.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right peacefully to change their government and are able to ex-
 ercise this right in practice through frequent, free, and fair elections on the basis
 of universal suffrage by secret ballot. A parliamentary democracy, Japan is governed
 by the political party or parties able to form a majority in the lower house of its
 bicameral Diet. From 1955 until 1993, all prime ministers and almost all cabinet
 ministers were members of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which enjoyed a
 majority in the lower house throughout this period. From August 1993 to June 1994,
 non-LDP coalitions governed the country. The current three-party coalition govern-
 ment includes the LDP. Local and prefectural governments are often controlled by
 coalitions.
 There are no legal or de facto impediments to women's participation in govern-
 ment and politics, but cultural attitudes are not favorable to their participation.
 Women hold 14 seats in the 511-member lower house of the Diet, and 19 seats in
 the 252-member upper house. As of December, the 21-member Cabinet had no fe-
 male members. Women make up 21.6 percent of all national government workers
 but hold less than 0.8 percent of top (director level and higher) government posts.
 In 1991 the Prime Minister's Office promulgated an action plan to increase the
 number of women in leadership positions on government advisory panels to 30 per-
 cent by the end of fiscal year 1995. However, the target was later cut to 15 percent,
 a step apparently reflecting slower than anticipated progress. Only 75 of the 203
 existing panels have met the 15-percent target.
 There is one Ainu member of the Diet (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of local and international human rights organizations function freely,
 without governmental restrictions or impediments, investigating and publishing
 their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative
 and responsive to their views, although the Government restricts access to prisons
 and detention facilities by human rights groups.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, sex, social
 status, or family origin, and, in general, the Government enforces these provisions
 effectively.
 Women.-According to the Ministry of Justice, 2,204 incidents of spousal abuse
 against women were reported to authorities in 1994. However, violence against
 women, particularly domestic violence, often may go unreported due to social and
 cultural concerns about shaming one's family or endangering the reputation of one's
 spouse or offspring. Typically, victimized women often return to the home of their
 parents rather than fieR reports with authorities. Therefore, Ministry of Justice sta-
 tistics on violence aginst women undoubtedly understate the scope of the current
 situation. Many local governments are responding positively to a need for confiden-
 tial assistance by establishing special women's consultation departments in police
 and prefectural offices.
 Recent immigration trends reflect the growing problem of trafficking of Asian
 women to Japan. While the number of illegal male workers has decreased from its
 peak in 1992, the number of illegal female workers has continued to increase. Ac-
 cording to the Ministry of Justice, just over 6 percent of illegal female immigrants
 work in occupations involving prostitution. However, human rights groups estimate
 that the figure is actually much higher. The Government is working to reduce the
 foreign prostitution problem by en orcing existing antiprostitution laws as well as
 provisions in the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act directed against
 anyone "encouraging a person to engage in illegal work." In recent years, police, es-
 pecially in Tokyo, have conducted a number of sweeps against both foreign pros-
 titutes and their employers.
 The position of women in society, although significantly improved during the last
 few decades, continues to reflect deep-seated traditional values that assign women
 a subordinate role in the workplace. Although discrimination by private employers
 against women is prohibited by the Constitution, it persists. Legislation has been
 enacted over the past 30 years to accord women the same legal status as men. The
 Equal Employment Opportunity Law of 1986 was aimed at eliminating sex discrimi-
 nation in such areas as recruitment, promotion, and vocational training. Yet the law
 does not expressly forbid discrimination in recruitment, hiring, assignment, and pro-
 motion of workers; it merely states that "employers should endeavor" to avoid it.
 Under this law and other regulations, the Ministry of Labor attempts to encourage
 corporate compliance with its objectives by positive inducements; it does not enforce
 compliance through fines or other punitive measures. In addition, as part of their
 lower overall intake of new employees because of continuing recessionary pressures,
 some companies announced that they would hire no women in 1995. Other compa-
 nies did not announce such a policy but reduced the percentage of women hired for
 entry-level positions or laid off a higher proportion of female than male employees.
 Significant disparities in pay and access to managerial positions persist for
 women, who comprise over 40 percent of the employed population. Several cases are
 pending which challenge management's allegedy biased use of Japan's two-track
 (general versus administrative) system in hiring female employees. Initially de-
 signed to create a "career" track for employees while maintaining a separate "cleri-
 cal" track, observers say the system is used to discriminate against women, who tra-
 ditionally have not been hired for managerial positions. While the Labor Standards
 Law prohibits employers from discriminating against women in wages, it does not
 ban disproportionate hiring into different career tracks based on gender. According
 to the Ministry of Labor, the average wage of women workers in 1995 was less than
 65 percent of that of men, and women hold only 3.9 percent of management posts
 in the country. In May an advisory commission to the Tokyo governor ruled in favor
 of six female employees who accused their employer of sexual discrimination in per-
 sonnel assignment and wage distribution.
 Public awareness of discrimination against women and sexual harassment in the
 workplace has increased. A growing number of government entities are establishing
 hot lines and designating ombudsmen to handle complaints of discrimination and
 sexual harassment. Nevertheless, sexual discrimination and stereotyping in the
 workplace continue to be major problems for women.
 In August 1993, the Prime Minister officially acknowledged and apologized for the
 former Imperial Government's involvement in the army's practice of forcing an esti-
 mated 200,000 women (including Koreans, Filipinos, Chinese, Indnesians, Bur-
 mese, Dutch, and Japanese) to provide sex to soldiers between 1932 and 1945. Cur-
 rent plans by the Government to make amends for these abuses by the old Imperial
 Army d not include direct government compensation to surviving 'cmfort women."
 Two cases are pending in Tokyo District Court-one brought by 3 Korean plaintiffs
 
 
 634
 and the other by 18 Filipino plaintiffs-seeking compensation for these abuses, but
 a decision in these cases is likely to take years. Meanwhile, in August, a govern-
 ment-backed, private body known as the Asian Women's Fund began to raise pri-
 vate-sector funds for eventual payment as compensation to surviving comfort
 women.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare, and in
 general, the rights of children are adequately protected. Boys and girls have equal
 access to health care and other public facilities. There is no pattern of societal abuse
 against children.
 In recent years, the problem of severe bullying, or *ime," received greater public
 attention. It involves verbal or physical abuse in middle and high schools. In 1994
 there were 21,598 cases of bullying reported to the Ministry of Education, but many
 cases go unreported. According to police reports, 11 children under the age of 18
 committed suicide in response to bullying last year, and the actual number of bully-
 n-related suicides was probably higher. To cope with bullying, as well as with
 other children's issues, the Ministry of Justice in August 1994 established the Office
 of Ombudsman for Children's Rights.
 People With Disabilities.-Although not generally subject to overt discrimination
 in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services, the disabled
 face limited access to public transportation, "mainstream" public education, and
 other facilities. Japan has no national law protecting the rights of the disabled, in-
 cluding access an employment, but some prefectures and cities have enacted their
 own legislation addressing the issue. Despite the disabled's lack of legal protection,
 there is growing societal awareness of the issue.
 Indigenous People.-The Ainu, a people descended from the first inhabitants of
 Japan, now probably number fewer than 100,000; almost all of them live on
 Hokaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands. Their primary occupa-
 tions are fishing, small-scale farming, and manual labor. As a result of a law passed
 in 1899, the Former Aborigines Protection Act, the Ainu today control only approxi-
 mately 0.5 percent of their original landholdings. Ainu leaders continue to express
 grievances about this situation. Meanwhile, the Ainu continue to face social dis-
 crimination while engaging in an uphill struggle against complete assimilation.
 The Government has done little in response to Ainu grievances. An interagency
 study group opened hearings in January 1990 with the stated goal of reviewing
 Ainu history and making recommendations, but it has not been active. Additionally,
 in March the Government formed an advisory panel to the Chief Cabinet Secretary
 to focus on Ainu issues. The body is to issue a report following a 1-year discussion
 period.
 In July 1994, Shigeru Kayano became the first Ainu member of the Diet when
 he gained a seat in the House of Counciors. KIyana has drawn attention to Ainu
 issues.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The ethnocentric nature of Japanese society,
 reinforced by a high degree of cultural and ethnic homogeneity and a history of iso-
 lation from other cultures, has impeded the integration of minority groups. This pri-
 marily affects Burakumin, Koreans, and alien workers.
 The Burakumin (descendants of feudal era "outcasts" who practiced "unclean" pro-
 f essions such as butchering and undertaking), although not subject to govermental
 discrimination, are frequently victims of entrenched social discrimination including
 restricted access to housing and employment opportunities. They are estimated to
 number approximately 3 million, but most prefer to hide their identity. Beginning
 in 1969 e      vernment introduced with some success a number of social, eco-
 nomic, nd legal programs designed to improve conditions for the Burskumin and
 hasten their assimilation into mainstream Ja panese society. In recent years, how-
 ever, some within the Burakumin community have questioned whether assimilation
 is an appropriate goal. The Government has extended basic legislation to provide
 funding for Burakumin programs until 1997, but the Burakumin continue to lobby
 for a new law that will expand current programs.
 Despite improvements in Japan's legal safeguards against discrimination, Korean
 permanent residents (most of whom were born, raised, and educated in Japan and
 who are estimated to number approximately 700,000) are still subject to various
 forms of deeply entrenched social discriminatin.
 In 1993 the Government halted the finepntinguof permanent forein residents.
 Instead of finerings, the Government has es ished a family regotry system
 that uses the resident's picture and signature and contains information on parents
 and spouses living in Japan, a system similar to that used for Japanese nationals.
 The current law leaves intact the requirement that all foreign residents carry alien
 registration certificates at all times.
 
 
 635
 In recent years, the Government has enacted several laws and regulations provid-
 ing permanent resident aliens with equal access to public housing and loans, social
 security pensions for those qualified, and certain public employment rights. Some
 immigrants reportedly face police harassment and discrimination in obtaining hous-
 ing, jobs, and health care. In recognition of the difficulties faced by foreigners in
 these areas, the city of Tokyo has issued a law to prevent housing discrimination
 against foreigners.
 The January 1991 Memorandum Between the Japanese and South Korean Gov-
 ernments extended employment rights to local government positions, giving each lo-
 cality the authority to decide which jobs may be held by non-Japanese nationals.
 Local governments are also being urged by the Government to allow Korean resi-
 dents to take the Teacher Entrance Examination and to employ them on a full-time
 basis. Private-sector employment and social discrimination are still common. Anti-
 discrimination laws affecting Korean residents were initiated as government guid-
 ance and are not supported by penalty provisions. In the first court test of Japan's
 antidiscrimination laws, in September 1994 a second-generation Korean nurse sued
 the Tokyo metropolitan gvernment on the grounds that she had been refused con-
 sideration for promotion because she is not Japanese. The case is still pending.
 By law, aliens with 5 years of continuous residence are eligible for naturalization
 and the simultaneous acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right to vote.
 In fact, however, most eligible aliens choose not to apply for citizenship, in part due
 to fears that their cultural identity would thereby be lost. De facto obstacles to natu-
 ralization include broad discretion available to adjudicating officers and great em-
 p hasis on Japanese language ability. In February, the Supreme Court ruled that the
 Constitution does not bar permanent foreign residents from voting in local elections.
 However, the court also ruled that existing laws denying voting rights to foreign
 residents are not unconstitutional.
 The Immigration Bureau of the Justice Ministry estimates that, as of May 1995,
 there were 286,704 foreign nationals residing illegally in Japan, a decrease of 2 per-
 cent from the previous year. Many are laborers from Southeast Asia, China, Iran,
 and South Korea.
 While many of Japan's illegally resident foreigners came in search of better-pay-
 ing manufacturing and construction jobs, these opportunities decreased during Ja-
 pan's economic slowdown. Thus, more of the foreign workers are unemployed or
 marginally employed. Some illegal alien workers have been exploited. Activist
 groups claim that, with little or no knowledge of the Japanese language or of their
 legalrights, employers can easily discriminate against foreign workers. The Govern-
 ment attempts to deal with the problem of illegal workers within the bounds of ex-
 isting law. It has tried to reduce the inflow of illegal foreign workers by prosecuting
 employers. Recent revisions of the Immigration aw provide for penalties against
 employers of undocumented foreign workers. Suspected foreign workers may also be
 denied entry for passport, visa, and entry application irregularities. The Govern-
 ment continues to study the foreign worker issue, and several citizens' groups are
 working with illegal foreign workers to improve their access to information on work-
 er rights.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associaton.-The Constitution provides for the right of workers
 to associate freelyin unions. Approximately 24 percent of the active work force be-
 longs to unions. Unions are free of government control and influence. Most unions
 are involved in political activity as well as labor relations, but they are not con-
 trolled by political parties. The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (RENGO),
 which represents 7.8 million Japanese workers and was formed in 1989 through the
 merger of several confederations, is Japan's largest labor organization. There is no
 requirement for a single trade union structure, and there are no restrictions on who
 may be a union official. Members of the armed forces, police, and firefighters, how-
 ever, are not permitted to form unions or to strike.
 In 1995 Japan made progress on the 20-year-long dispute before the International
 Labor Organization's Committee on the Application of Recommendations and Con-
 ventions involving the right of firefighters to organize a union. The Home Affairs
 Ministry and the Prefectural and Municipal Workers Union agreed to establish a
 consultation system to serve as a stopgap measure, while revision of the Local Offi-
 cials Act is being studied with a view to allowing union organization by firefighters
 and other emergency workers (except police).
 Unions are active in international bodies, most notably the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions, and maintain extensive international contacts. The
 right to strike, implicit in the Constitution, is exercised. During 1994, 85,000 worker
 days were lost to strikes. Japanese laws prohibit retribution against strikers and
 
 
 636
 are effectively enforced. Public employees do not have the right to strike, although
 they do have recourse to mediation and arbitration. The Government determines the
 pay of government employees based on a recommendation by the independent Na-
 tional Personnel Authority.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The Constitution provides
 unions with the right to organize, bargain, and act collectively. These rights are ex-
 ercised freely, and collective bargaining is practiced widely. The annual 'Spring
 Wage Offensive," in which individual unions in each industry conduct negotiations
 simultaneously with their firms, involves nationwide participation. Management
 usually consults closely with its enterprise union. However, trade unions are inde-
 pendent of management and aggressively pursue the interests of their workers.
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law and adequate mechanisms exist for
 resolving such cases as do exist. A high-profile example still pending concerns the
 privatization of the national railway system in 1986. The East Japan Railway Com-
 pany and some of the other private successor companies of the Japan National Rail-
 way refused to offer employment to thousands of former employees who were union
 members. Fourteen cases related to this matter have been fied with the Central
 Labor Commission. Two have been decided in favor of the workers but are under
 appeal by management, and the other 12 were still pending at year's end.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Standards Law pro-
 hibits the use of forced labor, and there are no known cases of forced or compulsory
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the revised Labor Stand-
 ards Law of 1987, minors under 15 years of age may not be employed as workers,
 and those under the age of 18 years may not be employed in dangerous or harmful
 work. The Labor Inspection Division of the Ministry of Labor rigorously enforces
 child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Minister of Labor or the Director of the
 Prefectural Labor Standards Office administratively determines minimum wages,
 based usually on the recommendation of the Tripartite Minimum Wage Council.
 Minimum wage rates vary by industry and region. In the Tokyo area, a steel-
 worker's rate is $7.25 (708 yen) per hour. The wage rates are sufficient to provide
 workers and their families with a decent living. The Labor Standards Law provides
 for a 40-hour maximum workweek in most industries.
 The Ministry of Labor effectively administers various laws and regulations gov-
 erning occupational health and safety, principal among which is the Industrial Safe-
 ty and Health Law of 1972. Standards are set by the Ministry of Labor and issued
 after consultation with the Standing Committee on Safety and Health of the Tri-
 partite Labor Standards Commission. Labor inspectors have the authority to sus-
 pend unsafe operations immediately, and the law provides that workers may voice
 concerns over occupational safety and remove themselves from unsafe working con-
 ditions without jeopardizing their continued employment.
