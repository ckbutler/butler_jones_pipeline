 Vanuatu is a South Pacific island nation with an estimated
 population of 150,000. It became independent in 1980,
 following more than 70 years of joint British-French rule. It
 has a parliamentary system of government with a prime minister
 and a 46-member parliament. Independence was accompanied by
 temporary political turbulence which left a legacy of
 suspicion towards outside interference. Most of the internal
 strains from the 1980 secessionist rebellion have now
 subsided, although island and regional loyalties remain
 strong. The civilian authorities control the police and the
 paramilitary mobile forces.
 Political legitimacy in Vanuatu is based on majority rule,
 supported by both Melanesian and Western tradition. Following
 free and fair elections in 1983 and 1987, Vanuatu underwent a
 period of domestic turmoil beginning in May 1988.
 The Vanuatu economy is dependent on international trade and
 therefore vulnerable to shifts in world market prices. Prior
 to the political turbulence, tourism earned more foreign
 exchange than all other exports combined. The downward trends
 in tourism and foreign investment, started by cyclone Uma in
 early 1987 and exacerbated by the violence in 1988 and
 subsequent political uncertainty, continued into early 1989.
 Tourism, however, picked up considerably after the
 establishment of Air Vanuatu's direct weekend flights to
 Australia in mid-1989.
 Despite the political turbulence, human rights remained
 generally unrestricted, although concerns have been raised
 about restrictions on freedom of speech and press.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Neither-the Government nor any organized group has resorted to
 political or other extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports-of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Constitutional guarantees against torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment are observed in practice and enforced
 by the courts. Prisoners also have recourse to an Ombudsman.
 In 1988 four members of the Vanuatu Mobile Force were
 convicted by a local magistrate court on charges that they
 beat a prisoner.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrests in Vanuatu. Arrest
 is by warrant. There is no exile. During the period of
 political turmoil, opposition figures charged that the
 Government tried to interfere with their access to counsel by
 revoking the residency permit of.an expatriate lawyer who had
 been a prominent advisor to the opposition. However, all of
 
 
 1007
 VANUIATUI
 the "interim government" defendants had outside counsel
 available to them in their trial and in the subsequent
 (successful) appeal. The constitutional provision is observed
 that suspects will be informed-of charges and given a speedy
 hearing before a judge.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a fair public
 trial, presumption of innocence until guilt is proven,
 prohibition against double jeopardy, the right of habeas
 corpus, and appeal to the Supreme Court. The courts are free
 of ilitary or executive interference. Throughout the
 constitutional turmoil of December 1988 and the subsequent.
 trial of the members of the "interim government," the courts
 functioned freely and their authority was upheld without
 question. The Government acquiesced without complaint in the
 appellate court's ultimate dismissal of charges against the
 four convicted members of the "interim government." There
 were no reports of arbitrary or unfair exercise of judicial
 authority in 1989'.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 C orrespondence
 There is no arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home,
 or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 -a.. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of expression,
 the Government publishes and controls the country's only
 national newspaper and manageq the national radio station.
 There is no independent newspaper or radio. During the
 December 1988 "interim government" crisis and the subsequent
 trial of the participants, the opposition alleged that its
 members and their-views were denied free access to the
 government-run media. A statement by the then-president which
 was critical of the Government was not aired, but the
 criticism was subsequently broadcast live over the radio as
 part of his speech at the opening of Parliament. One
 Australian broadcast journalist, whose reports of the "interim
 government" crisis were deemed inaccurate by the Government,
 was ordered out of the country. -Vanuatu citizens are not
 allowed to buy television satellite dishes.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political
 parties or other groups in Vanuatu. There are two main
 political parties and several smaller ones. The out-of-power
 politi6ans who have left or been ejected from the ruling
 Vanua'aku party have formed their own political parties and
 are actively canvassing for support.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is protected by law and respected in
 practice. Missionaries of various Christian denominations
 work without restriction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Vanuatu citizens are free to travel internally and
 externally and to return from abroad without restrictions.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Vanuatu is a multiparty democracy. Numerous candidates
 competed in the parliamentary elections in 1983 and 1987; both
 the campaign and voting were considered by outside observers
 to have been fair. Elections to provincial and local councils
 have also been freely contested and fair.
 Beginning with a violent protest march by antigovernment
 demonstrators in May 1988, Vanuatu underwent a period of
 domestic turmoil. Subsequent ejections and resignations of
 antigovernment members from Parliament led the President to
 attempt to sack the Vanua'aku Party Government, install a
 caretaker "interim government," and call for a new general
 election. After the Vanuatu Supreme Court declared the
 President's action illegal, the Government arrested the
 President and his five-man "interim government" on charges of
 sedition, incitement to mutiny, unlawful assembly, and
 conspiracy to overthrow the Government. They were tried in
 February 1989, and four of the six were convicted; however,
 all were freed in April by the Appeals Court.
 Major opposition parties remained outside of Parliament for
 all of 1989, their members having resigned or been expelled.
 They continued to demand general elections, and boycotted
 by-elections held to fill the vacant seats.
 To an extent unusual among Pacific Island states, the ruling
 Vanua'aku Party is the primary policymaking body and its
 decisions are implemented by the Government. The Vanua'aku
 Party has in the past used government power to restrict
 opposition political activity, for example, by denying other
 parties the use of the government-owned radio and press.
 There have been reports in the past of harassment against
 individual communities suspected of having supported
 opposition candidates. There also have been complaints that
 the Government arbitrarily revoked residency permits of
 foreigners who displeased the party or government leaders.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no allegations by outside organizations of human
 rights violations in Vanuatu. There are no local
 nongovernmental human rights organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most of the population is comprised of Melanesians whose
 ancestors probably migrated from New Guinea. The small
 
 
 1009
 -VANUATU
 minorities bf Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese,'Tongans, and
 Europeans, generally concentrated in the two towns and on a
 few plantations, experience discrimination with regard to land
 o6i1ership. Although there have been allegations of corrupt
 prbctices'by tembers of the rul1ing Vanua'aku party, there is
 no 6viaence to suggest a'-pattern of discrimination in the
 Government's provision of basic services.
 While women have equal rights under the law, they are dnly
 slowly emerging from a traditional culture characterized by
 male dominance, a geAeral reluctance to educate women, and a
 widespread belief that i'omen should devote themselves "
 primarily to childrearing. Nevertheless, an increasing number
 of women are finding Work in the unskilled, semi-skilled, and
 service occupations.
 While no accurdte data are available, violence against women,
 particular-ly'wife beating; is"reportedly commof and often
 a1cohof related. Several severe cases have been reported
 where-victims have died. While there are no specific laws
 against spouse beating, the courts have dealt-severely with
 such cases, using common law assault as a basis 'for imposing
 punishment. On those islands where bride price is paid, there
 is often a feeling that the-bride is the property of the
 husband and to be dealt with as he chooses. Very few cases of
 Yife behtimgn'are brought to the  aftention of the authorities,
 afid'evdn "fewer are attually prosdcuted. Usually the cases are
 rdropped by thewWomed involved before going to court.' The
 police are 3ettuctdnt--to intervene in what are considered
 purely d6mestic mdatters. The Natidnal-Council-of Women is
 workiNg to~edudate iofien ab6ut their rights and to urge
 establishmient of legaI protection for women againstabuse and
 n6lect. -
 Secti6n 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Vanuatu's workers have the right to organize unions, choose
 their own representatives, and to strike, but strikes have
 seldom occurred, due in part to high rates of unemployment.
 Unions may not affiliate with international labor federations
 without the permission of the Government. The fundamental
 legislation establishing the right of workers to organize into
 unions, setting out the scope of union activity, and providing
 for the arbitration and conciliation of labor disputes
 consists of the Trade Union Act of 1983 and the Trade Disputes
 Act of 1983. There are some 20 trade unions, grouped under an
 umbrella organization, the Vanuatu Trade Union Congress, which
 is a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. The trade unions are independent of the Government.
 ,Vanuatu is not a member of the International Labor
 Organization.
 An American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations official who had been working with Vanuatu labor
 leaders on a continuing basis to strengthen union activities
 was declared a prohibited immigrant in late 1988, reportedly
 because of allegations that he participated in or encouraged
 the May 1988 demonstrations.
 
 
 1010
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions in Vanuatu have and use the right to organize and
 bargain collectively. The high percentage of the population
 still engaged in subsistence agriculture and fishing, however,
 serves as a deterrent to extensive union activity. There are
 no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and there
 have been no reports that either is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under 12 years of age are not permitted to work
 outside of family-owned agriculture, where many children do
 assist their parents. Employment of children 12 to 18 years
 of age is restricted by occupational category and conditions
 of labor--such as shipping and nighttime employment. In
 general, however, the high level of adult unemployment
 discourages any resort to child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In comparison with other Pacific island countries, wages and
 salaries are relatively high. Minimum wage legislation has
 recently been introduced. The minimum wage is about 50 cents
 per hour for nonagricultural workers, and about 45 cents per
 hour for agricultural workers. Most workers are not in the
 wage economy and are thus outside the scope of the minimum
 wage law. For the remainder, these minimums provide an
 adequate standard of living within the local context. There
 are laws to regulate the rights to sick leave, annual
 vacations, and other-conditions of service. Information on
 health and safety sbendards7 legal.workweek, and enforcement
 of labor standards is not available.
