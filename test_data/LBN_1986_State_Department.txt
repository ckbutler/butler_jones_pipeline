 LEBANON
 Formally, Lebanon is a constitutional democracy with a directly
 elected, unicameral Parliament which chooses the President.
 Political power is divided on the basis of a formal
 Constitution and in accordance with the unwritten,
 confessionally based National Pact of 1943, which provides for
 a Maronite Christian President, a Sunni Muslim Prime Minister,
 and a Shi'ite Muslim Speaker of Parliament. The National Pact
 also provides for the proportional allocation of government
 positions among various religious groups on the basis of the
 1932 national census.
 Eleven years of war, however, have drastically reduced the
 authority of the central Government and its ability to
 safeguard human rights and have seriously undermined the
 country's democratic institutions. Unofficial militias have
 seized control of much of the country, where they, in effect,
 govern the civilian population and enforce their own version
 of justice without regard to the central Government or legal
 norms. Moreover, the presence of foreign forces has greatly
 diminished those areas under government authority. Although
 Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from South Lebanon
 during 1985, the Lebanese Government has yet to extend
 effective authority to that region. Through the presence of
 an estimated 30,000 troops, Syria continues to control large
 parts of northern Lebanon as well as much of the Biqa' Valley.
 Even in those few areas of Lebanon under nominal central
 government control, the authority of the State and its security
 services does not go unquestioned.
 Already seriously disrupted by more than a decade of war,
 Lebanon's free enterprise economy deteriorated catastrophically
 in 1986. Business confidence, already eroded, dwindled
 further, new investment stagnated, and remittances from
 Lebanese abroad dropped to the lowest level since 1975. The
 value of the Lebanese pound plummeted, causing a serious
 decline in the standard of living of most Lebanese and for the
 first time seriously threatening the middle class.
 The year 1986 brought no overall improvement in the human
 rights situation. As in previous years, major battles fought
 in densely populated areas intentionally or unintentionally
 cost the lives of hundreds of civilians and displaced thousands
 of others. Noncombatants far from the fighting have also been
 the targets of violence, such as terrorist bombings, random
 shellings, assassinations, and abductions. Freedom of movement
 between East and West Beirut and to much of the country was
 severely limited.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Rival factions routinely kill for political motives. Such
 killing has not been restricted to soldiers and militiamen; it
 has also been used frequently against noncombatants. Both
 indiscriminate and carefully planned attacks against civilian
 targets continued to occur throughout 1986, killing hundreds
 and wounding, endangering, and displacing thousands. While
 forces outside of government control were responsible for most
 of these killings, opponents of the Lebanese Government charge
 
 
 1217
 LEBANON
 that security forces and the Lebanese Army also carried out
 such attacks during the past year.
 Such political killing has resulted from both conventional
 warfare and terrorist attacks. In 1986 residential areas in
 greater Beirut, Sidon, and elsewhere in South Lebanon were
 frequently the target of random shelling, whose purpose often
 appears to have been to kill or intimidate civilians.
 Terrorist attacks in the form of massive car bombs
 indiscriminately killed scores of civilians in East and West
 Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon. In all instances, these
 explosions took place in neighborhoods or villages in which
 one confessional group predominates, and thus appear to have
 been aimed against that group. The car bombs were usually
 detonated in crowded areas in order to maximize casualties.
 For parts of 1986, South Lebanon was virtually sealed off from
 the rest of the country by intense fighting between Lebanese
 Shi'a and Palestinians. The "War of the Camps," which first
 erupted in 1985, resumed in April 1986, continued until
 mid-June, and broke out again with renewed violence at the end
 of September. During the summer and fall, repeated attacks
 against the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) forced a
 major redeployment of the French contingent and reconsideration
 of the UNIFIL mandate.
 Heavy fighting also occurred between Lebanese Shi'a and
 Palestinians in and around the refugee camps in West Beirut.
 These clashes resulted in several hundred deaths on each side,
 including both militiamen and civilians.
 In addition to random acts against civilians, there were
 numerous assassination attempts against prominent political,
 military, and religious figures. These assassination attempts
 took the form of ambushes, rocket attacks on homes, and car
 bombings. Attacks on foreign diplomats in Beirut continued.
 The French Military Attache was killed, and there were
 numerous attacks against a number of embassies.
 b. Disappearance
 Thousands of Lebanon's inhabitants have disappeared since the
 beginning of the war in 1975. Private militias and foreign
 forces, rather than official Lebanese security services, appear
 to be responsible for most of these kidnapings. Some victims
 may have been summarily executed. Most of these persons remain
 unaccounted for, but occasional hostage exchanges and releases
 do occur.
 During 1986 politically motivated kidnapings continued
 unabated. Abductions were particularly prevalent in West
 Beirut and along the so-called Green Line, which divides
 predominantly Christian East Beirut from mostly Muslim West
 Beirut. Some Lebanese were kidnaped because-of their
 affiliation with rival militias. Most, however, were civilians
 abducted simply on the basis of religion. The Lebanese victims
 included, for example, Muslims traveling to East Beirut and
 Christians living or working in West Beirut. In 1986
 abductions of foreign diplomats, journalists, and academics
 continued in West Beirut. A few were eventually released but,
 as of the end of 1986, 18 U.S., French, British, Italian,
 Irish, and South Korean nationals remained hostage. Two
 British citizens and an American librarian from the American
 University of Beirut (AUB), kidnaped in late 1984, were
 murdered by their captors in April 1986. In 1986 two U.S.
 
 
 1218
 LEBANON
 nationals, the comptroller of AUB and the former director of
 the Lebanese International School, were abducted. Several
 Lebanese employees of AUB and the American University Hospital
 (AUH) were abducted during the year as well.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Overwhelmed by the presence of private militias and foreign
 forces, the official Lebanese security services control so
 little territory that relatively few allegations of torture are
 made against them.
 Almost no reliable information is available on the treatment of
 prisoners held by Lebanese militias, Syrian occupying forces,
 the Israeli-sponsored Army of South Lebanon, or Palestinians.
 Allegations of brutal treatment abound, but it is impossible to
 determine to what extent these allegations, which are often
 leveled by archenemies, reflect actual practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Lebanese law, a suspect must be arraigned before an
 accusation committee (a panel of three judges) and the
 prosecutor within 48 hours, but government prosecutors
 sometimes hold suspects indefinitely for interrogation without
 reference to a judge. Every prisoner has the right to legal
 counsel, but there is no public defender's office. Bail is
 permitted in most cases.
 No militia or foreign occupying force observes the legal
 safeguards which the Government is committed to apply in arrest
 cases. In general, persons arrested by these groups are denied
 access to the judicial system.
 Various militias detain individuals arbitrarily for indefinite
 periods, often to be exchanged for persons held by rival
 militias. Such detainees are frequently held incommunicado.
 In addition to politically motivated abductions, some militias
 presume to enforce law and order in regions under their
 control, arresting, imprisoning, and executing individuals on
 purely criminal charges.
 The Army of South Lebanon maintains a detention center in
 Khiyam, which neutral observers have not been allowed to visit.
 The Government does not, as a rule, arrest or exile its
 political opponents. Fear of assassination by political rivals
 has, however, driven several prominent Lebanese into voluntary
 exile, and the general decline in public security has
 stimulated the emigration of many Lebanese.
 The Government does not use forced labor. In the present
 anarchy, however, militias have forced workers, especially
 immigrant laborers, to perform unpaid duties such as filling
 sandbags for use in building defenses against attack.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Lebanese law, practice, and custom provide the right to a fair
 public trial. A decade of war, however, has disrupted the
 judicial process and many cases remain unadjudicated. Trial
 delays result, for example, from the difficulty of conducting
 investigations when most of the country remains beyond
 effective government control, from a shortage of judges, and,
 most importantly, from the general breakdown in security.
 
 
 1219
 LEBANON
 Although Lebanese police and courts are present throughout the
 country, the disposition of criminal cases ultimately depends
 on the group in power locally. For example, militias
 frequently intervene to protect their supporters from
 detention and prosecution.
 The Government does not sentence persons to imprisonment for
 essentially political beliefs or acts. As noted, however,
 militias frequently arrest and imprison members of opposing
 political and military groups.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally has evinced no interest in controlling
 personal life. The law requires the Government to obtain the
 equivalent of a warrant before entering homes, except when the
 Lebanese Army is pursuing an armed attacker.
 Rights of privacy, however, have been violated frequently in
 the course of military operations mounted by the army,
 militias, and foreign forces in Lebanon. Arl of these groups
 have attempted to gather intelligence on their adversaries;
 these effort's have included informer networks and telephone
 monitoring.
 In 1986 armed groups in many sections of the country violated
 the sanctity of the home by deliberately shelling residential
 areas, destroying houses, and killing and wounding their
 occupants. During periodic operations in South Lebanon,
 Israeli forces demolished the houses of persons suspected of
 anti-Israeli activities. Throughout 1986, shelling of
 nonmilitary targets occurred in the greater Beirut area, almost
 always in densely populated residential neighborhoods.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Lebanon has a strong heritage of freedom of opinion, speech,
 and press. The Government has traditionally protected the
 rights of those who have opposed government policies through
 peaceful means.
 Dozens of newspapers and magazines representing a broad
 spectrum of opinion are freely published, and the Government
 has tolerated the activities of extralegal radio and
 television stations operated by widely diverse political
 groups.
 Intimidation of journalists by militias and terrorists
 constituted the most serious threat to press freedom. In 1986
 several foreign journalists were abducted. Few other foreign
 journalists remain in the country. Christian militias have
 prevented the regular distribution in East Beirut of several
 leftist and Islamic publications.
 The continued breakdown in security in 1986 greatly disrupted
 schools and universities to the detriment of academic freedom.
 Terrorists and militiamen, who continued to intimidate
 university faculty and administrators, represented a serious
 threat to Lebanon's long tradition of academic freedom.
 
 
 1220
 LEBANON
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government places no restrictions on the right of free
 assembly, as long as it does not incite popular unrest. Many
 groups in Lebanon excercised their right to engage in peaceful
 public demonstrations during the year.
 The major constraint came from the militias and foreign forces.
 In areas under the exclusive control of one militia,
 demonstrations or open shows of support for rival militias or
 political groups were not permitted.
 Political groups, such as those which opposed the Israeli
 occupation, are not permitted to operate freely in areas still
 under the control of the Israeli-backed militia. The Syrians
 do not, in general, allow groups hostile to them to remain in
 areas they occupy.
 Lebanon has traditionally enjoyed democratic labor and
 management institutions. Collective bargaining and the right
 to strike continue to exist (widespread strikes protesting the
 deteriorating economy took place peacefully on July 3 and
 December 2), despite 11 years of war. But with unemployment
 reaching 30 to 50 percent in certain sections of the country,
 traditional labor practices have become increasingly
 irrelevant. There are no current statistics on union
 membership. Employees remain highly organized in the banking
 industry, which is one of the few sectors of the Lebanese
 economy which continues to function at near former levels.
 Lebanon's major labor union negotiates wage increases with the
 Government to offset inflation whenever economic pressures
 dictate.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government affirms the right of freedom of worship, and
 Lebanese practice their various religions with a great degree
 of liberty.
 The 1943 National Pact essentially allocated political power
 on a confessional basis, according to the proportion of various
 religious groups in Lebanon as determined by the 1932 census.
 The unwritten National Pact stipulated that the President would
 be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and
 the Speaker of Parliament a Shi'ite Muslim. Seats in the
 Parliament were divided on a six-to-five ratio of Christians to
 Muslims. Positions in the government bureaucracy were
 allocated on a similar basis. Some religious groups thus enjoy
 greater institutionalized political power than others, and it
 has been frequently charged that politically powerful groups
 influenced government policies to the economic benefit of their
 coreligionists. Efforts to alter or abolish the confessional
 system of allocating political power have been at the center
 of Lebanese politics for more than 3 decades. Those religious
 groups most favored by the 1943 formula have sought to preserve
 it, while others who feel disadvantaged by it have sought to
 revise it on the basis of new demographic realities or to
 abolish it entirely. This struggle has given a strongly
 religious coloration to Lebanese politics and to the
 continuing civil strife there.
 The intensification of religious hatreds has led away from
 confessional mixing and towards confessional segregation.
 Today Lebanese live more and more in neighborhoods and
 villages inhabited exclusively by one religious community.
 
 
 1221
 LEBANON
 Many fear to travel to areas where other sects predominate.
 Few Muslims live, for example, in East Beirut. Christians
 continued to leave mainly Muslim West Beirut during 1986,
 complaining of increasing efforts to enforce Islamic mores and
 of a severe deterioration in public security (despite the
 introduction of a Syrian security force). Virtually no Jews
 remain in their traditional neighborhood in West Beirut.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not restrict foreign travel by Lebanese
 citizens. Emigration and dual citizenship are permitted.
 There is no impediment to voluntary repatriation by Lebanese
 with valid identity papers.
 Lebanon historically has been a land of asylum. During this
 century, it has given refuge to hundreds of thousands of
 Armenians and Palestinians as well as to smaller numbers from
 other Middle Eastern ethnic and religious groups. Lebanon's
 political and economic troubles in recent years have greatly
 diminished its appeal to refugees. Relatively few sought
 asylum there in 1986.
 Lebanon's relationship with the Palestinian community has been
 difficult. Most Palestinians, like other foreigners, have not
 been able to obtain Lebanese citizenship. Their status as a
 "state within a state" under the 1969 Cairo accords and their
 involvement in internal fighting from 1975 until 1982 resulted
 in the bitter enmity of many other groups. In the wake of the
 1982 conflict, many Palestinians encountered difficulty in
 renewing residence permits and travel documents, and delays
 still continue. In 1986 Palestinian combatants continued to
 return to Lebanon, and there were serious battles between them
 and Shi'ite Lebanese fighters.
 Lebanese traditionally enjoyed freedom of internal travel, but
 this freedom has been greatly circumscribed by militia groups
 which have established checkpoints to keep those deemed
 undesirable out of areas under their control. The so-called
 Green Line bisecting East and West Beirut remained closed for
 lengthy periods, effectively dividing the city and paralyzing
 many aspects of daily life in Beirut. Crossing the Green Line
 even when it was officially open remained extremely risky.
 The Israeli-sponsored Army of South Lebanon maintained tight
 restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out
 of areas which they occupied.
 Because of the closure of the Green Line, fighting and
 kidnapings along the road to Beirut International Airport, and
 chaotic security conditions at the airport itself, many
 Lebanese encountered serious difficulties in traveling abroad.
 Travelers unable or unwilling to risk using Beirut
 International Airport, which is located in West Beirut, had
 the option of traveling overland to Damascus or using the ferry
 to Cyprus.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Formally, Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy. According to
 its Constitution, direct elections must be held for its
 99-member Parliament every 4 years. Parliament, in turn,
 
 
 1222
 LEBANON
 elects a president every 6 years, and the President appoints a
 cabinet which must obtain the confidence of Parliament.
 Political parties may be formed. Women enjoy the same civil
 rights as men.
 More than a decade of political turmoil, growing militias, and
 foreign occupation has robbed these democratic institutions of
 much of their substance. No parliamentary elections have been
 held since 1972.. Although Parliament, the Presidency, and the
 Cabinet continue to exist, their effective authority does not
 extend to most of the country, which is under foreign
 occupation or militia control.
 In the past decade, violence has dominated the political
 process as militia groups and foreign forces have resorted to
 force to gain their way. Leaders of the major factions met in
 Lausanne, Switzerland in March 1984 and agreed on a program
 for national conciliation. These leaders later formed a
 National Unity Government, whose efforts to implement the
 national conciliation program have so far not succeeded. In
 September 1986, the Cabinet, which had not met since March
 1985, briefly resumed meeting as a "Committee of Dialogue."
 The dialogue broke down after approximately 6 weeks and the
 Cabinet subsequently has not met.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has a mixed record in dealing with international
 human rights groups, and indigenous groups have not pressed the
 Government strongly on human rights issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social-Status
 Women enjoy equality of civil rights and attend institutions
 of higher learning in large numbers. Religion, social
 tradition, and the prevailing atmosphere of insecurity and
 economic hardship make it difficult, however, for women to
 expand their participation in Lebanon's social, political, and
 economic institutions. The women's organizations that do exist
 are, for the most part, subordinate arms of political parties
 which work to advance the interest of the parent party rather
 than that of women in general.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Lebanon has comprehensive labor laws covering a range of issues
 involving workers' rights, including minimum wages, safe
 working conditions, length of the workweek, child labor, and
 annual holidays. However, given the civil strife engulfing the
 country, it is not known whether these statutes continue to be
 enforced.
