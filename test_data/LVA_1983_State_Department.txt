 LATVIA
 With a population of 2.5 million, Latvia is intermediate in
 size between Estonia and Lithuania and is situated between
 them on the eastern Baltic littoral.
 Today, the capital Riga and many of Latvia's other population
 centers are the most russified in the Baltic states. Since
 annexation, Latvia has had to absorb the largest number of
 Slavic settlers from the Soviet Union, over 600,000. Soviet
 statistics indicate that this in-migration is continuing at
 the rate of about 12,000 per year. Of the Baltic peoples,
 Latvians are the closest to becoming a minority in their own
 land. They now make up only 53 percent of Latvia's
 inhabitants and less than 40 percent of the population of
 their capital.
 This influx of settlers with a different language and
 different political and cultural traditions is regarded by
 many Latvians as the chief problem facing Latvians today, and
 threatens their survival as a distinct ethnic group. More
 advanced than in Estonia or Lithuania, the process of
 assimilation in Latvia has led to an "endangered species"
 mentality among many Latvians. Soviet authorities strictly
 forbid any political activity outside the framework of'the
 established party and state structure.
 During its first decade of independence, Latvia established a
 liberal parliamentary democracy, which carried out extensive
 political and economic reforms. The proliferation of
 competing political parties and the global economic crisis of
 the early 1930s undermined political stability. An
 authoritarian regime was imposed in 1934 which restricted
 civil and political rights. Succeeding governments promised a
 return to democracy following constitutional reforms, but
 these were never completed. In 1940, the Soviet Union annexed
 Latvia, and in 1941 it was seized by Germany. Extensive and
 brutal violations of human rights accompanied both events, in
 which some Latvians participated. Under German occupation, a
 Nazi extermination camp was set up at Salaspils near Riga;
 tens of thousands of Jews perished there. The Soviet
 reconquest of 1944 was again accompanied by extensive arrests,
 deportations, and executions. By one estimate, nearly 300,000
 Latvians were lost to the war, Nazi occupation, and forcible
 annexation. The ethnic Latvian population in 1982 was even
 smaller than in 1939.
 Under Soviet rule, Latvians have suffered deprivations of
 basic rights characteristic of the Soviet system, and recent
 trends are not encouraging. Within the past three years,
 there has been a series of arrests and trials of persons
 suspected of affiliation with non-Communist political
 organizations. Propaganda and intimidation designed to
 discourage contact and communication with the non-Soviet world
 have increased. Restrictions on emigration and travel have
 been tightened. Censorship remains severe, and the Government
 has decreased steadily the use of Latvian as the official
 language of the republic. Although food production increased
 in 1983 from low 1981 and 1982 levels, Latvians continue to
 experience periodic food shortages, especially with respect to
 meat and dairy products.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person
 Violations parallel those described in the report on the
 Soviet Union. In Latvia, the authorities employ a wide range
 of legal and extralegal measures ranging from loss of
 employment to criminal charges of espionage or "anti-Soviet
 behavior" in order to persecute Latvians who oppose Soviet
 rule or who describe the Soviet occupation in a negative
 light. For example, the young Latvian Zanis Skudra is serving
 a 12-year sentence following his trial in 1978. It .appears
 Skudra offended the authorities by compiling and disseminating
 a photographic record of Latvia's churches since the Soviet
 annexation. During a republic-wide series of raids in 1983 by
 Soviet officials on the houses of human rights activists, six
 Latvians were arrested, one of whom died of an apparent heart
 attack.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights
 The situation in Latvia with respect to the freedoms of
 speech, the press, and peaceful assembly and association is
 just as circumscribed as in the Soviet Union, with the added
 restriction that any Latvian nationalist political activity is
 strictly forbidden. In January 1983, six Latvians were
 arrested for "anti-state activities" during searches of 50
 homes of persons suspected of being dissidents. One of them,
 Lidija Lasmane-Doronina, was imprisoned for the third time.
 She had been helping the wives and families of political
 prisoners. Also indicative of intolerance of civil rights are
 the arrests of Latvians peacefully celebrating Latvian
 independence day, and the frequent interrogation and
 harassment of foreigners visiting their Latvian relatives.
 Religious worship is narrowly confined. Members of the
 Catholic, Baptist, and Adventist churches appear to have
 encountered more difficulties with the authorities than the
 larger Lutheran Church, perhaps because they have been more
 active and outspoken. A Catholic priest, for example,
 complained during a sermon in Riga in 1982 of the restrictions
 on the number of priests, which compel some to serve as many
 as 17 parishes simultaneously.
 Soviet internal security agents are reported to have raided
 several religious congregations in 1983 and interrogated and
 threatened the members. Despite the fact that Latvian Julian
 Vaivods was named to the College of Cardinals in Rome in 1983,
 the state of religious liberty in Latvia has deteriorated.
 The churches continue to represent a major impediment to
 Soviet nationalities and antireligious policies.
 The granting of permission to emigrate from Latvia is
 arbitrary and subject to increasing restrictions. Harassment
 of potential emigrants and the general deterioration of their
 living conditions, once intent to emigrate is known, is
 designed to discourage applications. One Latvian with a claim
 to U.S. citizenship, Arthur Zarins, has been seeking exit
 permission since 1947. Currently there are 60 Latvian
 families on the list of those repeatedly refused permission to
 emigrate to Israel; some have been seeking permission for 10
 years.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Non-Communist Latvians have almost no opportunity to
 participate in the political process. The Communist Party and
 Government of Latvia have an opportunity to advance their own
 interests, within limits, but they are compelled to construe
 their interests in such a way as to exclude a great deal
 historically incorporated in Latvian national identity. In
 1958, a movement within the Latvian Communist Party sought to
 avert further russification through education reforms, limits
 on Latvian industrial growth, and replacement of Russian party
 officials by native Latvians. The Soviet leadership, alarmed
 by this threat to control from Moscow, removed the movement's
 leadership and carried out a sweeping purge intended to root
 out party members with nationalist tendencies down to the
 level of school principals. Despite this purge, 17 Latvian
 Communist Party members sent an appeal in 1972 to West
 European Communists, again complaining of the russification of
 Latvia's political and economic structure and the submersion
 of the Latvian language.
 Latvians have the lowest proportion of Communist Party
 membership of the three Baltic states. In 1973, ethnic
 Latvians comprised only 43 percent of all party members in
 Latvia. Latvians thus are a minority in the only legal
 political party in their country. Political activity outside
 the Communist Party is not tolerated. Recently the party has
 acted against persons connected directly or indirectly to the
 Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party, which is based in
 Stockholm and which stems from the principal left-wing
 political party at the time of Latvia's independence. Among
 the victims of this campaign were Jurns Bumeisters and Dainis
 Lismanis, sentenced in May 1981 to 15 and 10 years of
 imprisonment, respectively, on charges of "betrayal of the
 Motherland"; Valdis Vinkelis, 70, who died in a prison
 hospital following his arrest in March 1981; and his nephew,
 Juris Vinkelis, sentenced in January 1982 to two years in
 prison for circulating literature published abroad. In May
 1981, the underground Social Democratic Party distributed a
 leaflet calling for independence, restoration of democratic
 rights, and an end to russification. There has been
 speculation that Soviet authorities, alarmed by developments
 in Poland, are trying to suppress the Social Democrats in
 Latvia to prevent them from becoming a catalyst for
 independent political activity.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The attitude of the U.S.S.R. on the investigation of human
 rights violations within its own territory, as stated in
 Section 4 of the report on the Soviet Union, applies equally
 to Latvia.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Since its annexation, Latvia has become an industrial workshop
 and trading center for the Soviet Union, importing raw
 materials and producing finished products. The emphasis under
 
 
 1151
 Soviet rule has been on heavy industry: industrial output
 increased by a factor of 40 from 1940 to 1976. During the same
 period, however, agricultural production increased by a factor
 of only 1.4. Because of Latvia's small labor force and very
 low birth rate, the effect of this disproportionate investment
 in industry has been to produce a massive influx of Slavic
 workers from elsewhere in the Soviet Union, with accompanying
 social and cultural dislocation. The neglect of agriculture,
 in turn, has caused shortages of food, particularly meat and
 dairy products, in a country that exported such products during
 independence. In 1982, production of meat, milk, and eggs
 declined in absolute terms. While starvation or severe
 malnutrition are not present, there has been an observable
 deterioration in the average diet during the past two years.
 In an apparent attempt to spur an increase in food production,
 in the first half of 1983, investment in the agricultural
 sector has reportedly increased significantly. It is not known
 at this time what, if any, effect this will have on local food
 supplies.
 By most measures of economic well-being, Latvia has for decades
 been regarded as better off than most areas of the Soviet
 Union. To some extent, its former prosperity is now working
 against it, as centrally controlled funds are diverted to less
 developed areas in the Soviet Union. The deterioration of
 housing is readily observable, and the same phenomenon is said
 to extend throughout the economic and social infrastructure,
 including roads, schools, institutes, hospitals, and even
 factories.
 The large proportion of non-Latvians in the population, along
 with cultural censorship and a mandatory ideology, has placed
 the Latvian language and culture in jeopardy. Lacking an
 internal rallying point such as the Catholic Church provides
 for Lithuanians, or a nearby external point of support, as
 Finland is for Estonians, Latvians face worsening odds in their
 efforts to preserve and refresh their own cultural traditions.
