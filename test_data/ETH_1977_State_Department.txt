 ETHIOPIA
 Respect for human rights in Ethiopia, not well observed
 by the autocratic regime of Emperor Haile Selassie, has
 deteriorated since the assumption of power bythe
 Ethiopian Provisional Military Government (EPMG) in
 September 1974. The human rights situation is deeply
 affected by the political revolution currently in pro-
 gress and by armed conflict against the secessionist
 Eritreans as well as against other opponents, including
 Ogadeni Somalis supported by Somalia.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includ-
 ing Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 We have received a few allegations of torture which
 appear to be valid.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no substantiated reports of cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. However,
 under the prevailing wartime conditions excesses often
 occur, perpetrated both by government forces and their
 opposition. In an effort to check active opposition,
 and particularly to disarm urban terrorists groups,
 the EPMG has organized several wide-ranging search and
 seizure programs. One such campaign became haphazard
 and unsupervised in March 1977, resulting in numerous
 deaths and arrests. Another occurred in December 1977
 when there were reports of widespread executions and
 numerous bodies were found in the streets as if on
 display. This recent campaign, officially labelled
 "red terror" by the government, is continuing in
 1978.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The use of arbitrary arrest and the lengthy imprison-
 ment of opponents of the government has been common.
 For example, the wives and children of many of the 60
 high-ranking officials summarily executed in 1974 by
 the regime remain in prison.

 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Denial of fair public trial is a common occurrence
 in Ethiopia.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 As part of the government's search and seizure pro-
 grams, neighborhood associations (Kebeles) were armed
 and authorized to carry out indiscriminate searches of
 homes, vehicles and persons in an effort to locate
 weapons and anti-government literature.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 Although the revolutionary turmoil has in part
 blocked realization of this goal, government policy
 seems genuinely aimed at raising the social and
 economic level of the masses. Centuries of feudal-
 ism seem to have been dealt a fatal blow by EPMG
 actions. The approach of the government, however, is
 heavily ideological, and it tolerates no opposition to
 its approach or methods.
 The government's land reform program has ended the wide-
 spread ownership of land by an oppressive aristocratic
 caste (this was formerly most striking in the areas
 inhabited by non-Amharic people, notably the Galla-peopled
 Southwest). More food is now consumed or stored by the
 rural populace than was the case under the Emperor. There
 appears to be considerable satisfaction among the peasant
 class, which makes' up the bulk of the population, with the
 economic and social gains achieved to date.
 Health care at best is rudimentary in Ethiopia, but its
 improvement is being given top priority by the government.
 The EPMG is cooperating with the World Health Organization
 in eliminating the last vestiges of smallpox from Ethiopia;
 Somalia is the only other country in the world where small-
 pox is still reported.
 Corruption in the Ethiopian Government is not widespread.
 
 
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 With the exception of religion, these rights are
 non-existent in Ethiopia. Ethiopia's labor union
 movement is subservient to the EPMG, which has des-
 troyed the relative independence the movement once
 enjoyed.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Travel abroad by Ethiopians is strictly controlled.
 Except for disruptions caused by the security situa-
 tion, movement within the country seems so far to have
 remained unaffected by the revolution. Emigration has
 been virtually halted although a number of exceptions
 on humanitarian grounds have been reported. Social
 contacts between Ethiopian officials and many foreign
 diplomats (mostly Western) are probably unofficially
 discouraged and many private citizens no longer con-
 sider such contacts wise in the present political
 climate.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The EPMG rules by decree on the basis of a rough
 consensus provided by military personnel elected
 by military units. Ultimate power is vested in the
 Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC)
 or Dirg, which makes all major decisions. The Parlia-
 ment and Constitution have been dissolved and no
 national elections are contemplated for the near
 future, although elections with universal adult
 suffrage have been held in urban areas for the Kebele
 Leadership Councils.
 Of course, the absence of political parties or elec-
 tions for national office seriously circumscribes the
 political life of the country. Nevertheless, for the
 mass of the populace opportunities to participate in
 
 
 rudimentary political activities have been widened at
 the local level. The formation of urban and rural
 dwellers' associations have provided a vehicle for the
 Ethiopian masses to make a limited contribution
 to some of the political decisions that have a bearing
 on their lives. The masses had scant influence on such
 decisions under Haile Selassie.
 4.   Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights'
 In the government's view, the level of human rights
 enjoyed by the Ethiopian masses has improved measur-.
 ably since the revolution. The EPMG points to econom-
 ic gains and participation in the basic decision-
 making process at the local level as areas in which
 the government deserves credit. Proposals for inter-
 national or non-governmental investigation of alleged
 violations would probably be regarded as interference
 in domestic affairs. The International Red Cross has
 been denied access by the EPMG to strife-torn Eritrea.
 This is the only such request that has come to our
 attention.
