 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy which guarantees by law and
 reflects in practice the civil, political, and religious rights
 of its citizens. It has free elections, a multiparty political
 system, an independent judiciary, and an elected legislature
 (the Knesset) which may restrict the government by legislation
 and can bring it down by a vote of no confidence. There is no
 constitution; a series of basic laws define the
 responsibilities of government institutions. Emergency
 regulations, associated with the state of emergency in force
 since the founding of the state in 1948, are still in effect.
 In 1979, as provided in the Camp David Accords, Egypt and
 Israel signed a peace treaty ending the formal state of war
 which had existed between them since 1948. Israel and its
 other Arab neighbors continue to be in a formal state of war.
 Pursuant to the Egypt-Israel treaty, Israel returned the Sinai
 Peninsula to Egypt over a 3-year period. Israel continues to
 occupy other territories (the Golan Heights, Gaza Strip, the
 West Bank, and the eastern sector of Jerusalem) captured in the
 1967 war. In early 1985, Israel withdrew the bulk of its
 troops from southern Lebanon, where they had been since the
 1982 war, but it still maintains a residual presence and
 continues to support a local militia, the "Army of South
 Lebanon."
 Many Israelis doubt that other Arab states are prepared to
 accept Israel's right to exist on the basis of U.N. Security
 Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Terrorist incidents within
 Israel and the absence of peace treaties between Israel and its
 other Arab neighbors make security a dominant concern which
 affects many facets of Israel's national life.
 Approximately 16 percent of the population of Israel are Arabs
 who do not share the Zionist principles upon which the state
 was founded. Some Jewish communities in Israel also reject
 Zionism.
 Israel enjoys a relatively high standard of living. It has a
 market economy with substantial governmental participation and
 subsidized prices for basic commodities. Israeli economic
 policy has been oriented toward social welfare. In recent
 years, Israel has experienced increasing balance of payments
 deficits, rising foreign debt, triple-digit inflation, and a
 declining level of foreign exchange reserves. A new economic
 program, initiated at mid-year, is designed to reduce the level
 of inflation and improve Israel's international financial
 position.
 Israeli society is characterized by its openness and by its
 wide-ranging and lively public debate of all issues of popular
 concern. Police and internal security functions are under the
 control of Cabinet ministers who must answer to the Knesset
 concerning the actions of personnel for whom they are
 responsible and whose performance is subject to the scrutiny of
 a vigorous free press.
 *Because of the sharply differing sociopolitical environments
 in Israel and in the Arab territories which Israel has occupied
 since the 1967 war, the respective human rights situations are
 treated in separate but parallel fashion. The report on the
 occupied territories follows the report for Israel.

 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 As in the past, the most significant human rights problems for
 Israel in 1985 derived from the strained relations between the
 Israeli authorities and the Arab inhabitants of the occupied
 territories. These problems were exacerbated by attacks
 against Israelis in those areas and by acts of violence by
 Jewish settlers. During the year, Israeli leaders, including
 President Herzog and Prime Minister Peres, expressed concern
 over the growth of extreme views and violent actions and their
 effects on Israeli society.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no indication that political killing is sanctioned by
 Israeli authorities.
 In 1985, terrorists killed and injured a number of Israelis
 and residents of territories under Israeli occupation.
 Despite the Israeli authorities' strong efforts to preempt
 terrorist attacks and to bring the perpetrators to justice,
 the number of terrorist incidents increased by 40 percent in
 the first 10 months, according to the Police Minister. The
 Minister ascribed 50 percent of these incidents to individuals
 not linked to any organization.
 In 1985 the Justice Ministry concluded its investigation of
 the deaths of two Palestinian terrorists who died during
 interrogation in the immediate aftermath of a bus hijacking in
 1984. The Ministry reiterated the findings of an earlier
 commission of inquiry that the two had died under
 interrogation and recommended that the area military
 commander, who had been present during the questioning, be
 brought to trial. A military court subsequently cleared him
 of direct responsibility for the deaths. The case of the two
 soldiers involved has not yet been resolved.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such practices are prohibited. Evidence or confessions
 obtained under duress are inadmissible in court, and the
 administrative codes of conduct of the prison and police
 authorities contain stringent sanctions against the use of
 force or brutality. Police officers accused of brutality or
 violence against prisoners or suspects may be prosecuted
 either in administrative courts for violation of the code of
 conduct or in regular criminal courts for criminal assault.
 Acute overcrowding remains a problem in Israeli prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Israeli law provides strong guarantees against arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other
 procedural and substantive safeguards are available.
 Defendants are considered innocent until proven guilty.
 
 
 1259
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Administrative detention may be employed in security-related
 cases when it is determined to the satisfaction of a judge
 that formally charging a person would compromise sensitive
 sources of evidence. Any individual under administrative
 detention is entitled to representation by counsel and must be
 brought before the president of the appropriate district court
 within 48 hours of being taken into custody. Upon application
 of the Defense Minister to a district court, the right to
 representation by counsel may be delayed from 48 hours to 7
 days in most instances and up to 15 days in terrorist-related
 cases. Each case of administrative detention must be
 submitted to judicial review at least every 3 months
 thereafter for the entire period of detention. The decision
 of the president of the district court can be appealed:to the
 Supreme Court.
 Israel does not accord prisoner-of-war status under the Third
 Geneva Convention to prisoners captured during and after the
 Lebanese conflict who were not members of the armed forces of
 another country. Israel has maintained, however, that such
 detainees are treated in accordance with the provisions of the
 Fourth Geneva Convention in all matters relating to the
 guarantee of humane treatment and conditions of internment.
 It has stated that under the Fourth Geneva Convention it has
 the right to intern persons who constitute a danger to the
 security of the occupying power.
 The Israeli Supreme Court confirmed in 1984 the applicability
 of the Fourth Convention in Lebanon but held that, for
 security reasons, Israel was permitted to deny the detainees
 access to family members and legal counsel.
 In the course of the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon more than
 1,200 prisoners brought back from Lebanon were incarcerated at
 the Atlit camp as security risks in violation of the Fourth
 Geneva Convention which prohibits forcible transfers of
 protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of
 the occupying power. The Atlit prisoners were held
 incommunicado until Israel responded to international urging
 and allowed occasional visits by the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC). They were released in phases, the
 last group on September 10, 1985.
 On May 21, 1985, under the auspices of the ICRC, Israel
 released 1,150 prisoners, including 879 who had been convicted
 of security offenses and 150 Atlit detainees, in exchange for
 3 Israeli military personnel who had been captured in
 Lebanon. About 400 were released in the occupied territories.
 There is no forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of a hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is guaranteed by law. The judiciary
 is independent and effectively insulated from political
 interference. With the exception of security cases, which may
 be tried by military courts, all trials are open. In security
 cases, Israeli law provides that part or all of a trial may be
 closed, with the burden of justifying nonpublic proceedings
 falling on the prosecution. Counsel is present during closed
 proceedings. In security cases, the law also provides for
 possible restriction on the choice of defense counsel, but
 there were no known cases in 1985 in which this provision was
 invoked.
 
 
 1260
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Privacy of the individual and the sanctity of homelife and
 correspondence are fully protected. There are effective legal
 safeguards against arbitrary invasion of the home.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press, limited by security-based
 censorship provisions, are basic rights in Israel. These
 rights are protected by law and the judiciary and are broadly
 exercised by citizens and individuals and by an independent
 and vigorous press, which expresses a wide variety of
 political opinion.
 Media censorship is based on British Mandatory emergency
 regulations, according to which the censor may prohibit the
 publication of material which, in his opinion, will harm the
 defense of Israel, the public safety, or public order.
 Censorship decisions may be appealed through the judiciary.
 In practice, censorship of the media is usually limited to
 military security matters, and journalists generally know
 which security-related areas are off-limits to publication.
 Licenses to publish newspapers are required and normally are
 routinely issued.
 Israeli radio and television are run by the Independent Israel
 Broadcast Authority (IBA). The Government helps to fund the
 IBA and appoints its governing board but has almost no control
 over programming. The independence of the IBA is protected by
 law, subject to the censorship provisions. Radio and
 television programs are in Arabic as well as in Hebrew.
 Movies and theater are subject to censorship if deemed
 pornographic or otherwise offensive to religious or social
 mores or likely to create a disturbance of public order.
 Censorship board decisions can be appealed in the courts.
 Possession and distribution of literature considered hostile
 to the State and issued by illegal Palestinian organizations
 are punishable offenses.
 Israeli law forbids public manifestations of support for
 organizations defined by the State as terrorist in nature.
 Proscribed acts include flying the Palestinian flag or
 displaying its colors, displaying Palestinian nationalist
 slogans, and publicly expressing support for the Palestine
 Liberation Organization (PLO). In June 1985, four Israeli
 Arabs received prison terms of 3 to 6 months for displaying
 Palestinian flags during a rally ifi September 1982 protesting
 the massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee
 camps in Beirut.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These are basic rights in Israel, protected, along with the
 right to demonstrate, by law and rulings of the courts. In
 the case of political rallies and outdoor meetings beyond an
 established size, permits are required and routinely granted.
 Existing laws prohibit contact, deemed harmful to the State,
 with the PLO, its subdivisions, and non-PLO organizations
 
 
 1261
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 classified as terrorist groups. Pending legislation would
 further restrict such contacts. Legislation is also pending
 which, if passed, would ban "racist" political parties.
 Israel has a free and democratic labor movement, which plays
 an important role in the social, economic, and political life
 of the country. Israel's most powerful labor organization,
 the General Federation of Labor (Histadrut), and its
 affiliates operate the largest national health insurance
 program and seven retirement pension systems, as well as a
 number of large industrial enterprises. Over 85 percent of
 the working population are Histadrut members. The membership
 includes 60 percent of the adult Israeli Arab population.
 Israeli workers, including those in the public sector, make
 frequent use of the right to strike. Histadrut has
 traditionally been active in the international field; it runs
 a large labor assistance program and is active in a number of
 international labor organizations.
 Israel's labor laws are modern and comprehensive; they reflect
 the social democratic values of Israel's founding fathers and
 the conditions of employment negotiated by Histadrut over many
 years. The Collective Agreements Law of 1957 governs trade
 union representation and collective bargaining.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Israel was founded as a Jewish State in which all citizens are
 guaranteed freedom of religion by law, Muslims, Christians,
 Druze, and other minority religious groups make up about
 17 percent of the population. The prevailing interpretation
 of the Jewish nature of the State has been secular rather than
 religious. The Law of Return of 1950, which abolished all
 restrictions on Jewish immigration, and the Citizenship Law of
 1952, which granted every Jew the right to citizenship upon
 arrival in Israel, confer an advantage on Jews in matters of
 immigration and citizenship.
 All religious groups may maintain contacts with their
 coreligionists outside Israel. Foreign clergy are permitted
 to live in Israel to minister to their coreligionists.
 Several thousand Israeli Muslims make the pilgrimage to Mecca
 each year. There is no operating Islamic seminary in Israel.
 Muslims may obtain such training in institutions in East
 Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza, or Egypt. The International
 Center of the Baha'i religion is located in Haifa.
 Israel has retained the Ottoman millet system under which each
 religious community is governed in matters of personal status
 by its own religious law and not by civil law. This feature
 of Israeli law gives each religious community freedom to
 observe its own customs and religion within the area where the
 millet system applies, but sometimes fails to protect the
 rights of individuals who do not follow the dominant tradition
 within their religious community. These difficulties do not
 normally arise in religious worship but do occur in areas such
 as marriage, legitimacy, inheritance, or conversion. In some
 religious communities, the rights of women are limited.
 The Government was not a party to the dispute between
 Ethiopian Jews, who arrived in Israel from 1983 through 1985,
 and Jewish religious authorities. The Ethiopian Jews
 protested a ruling by the Chief Rabbinate which would have
 required them to undergo ritual immersion before being
 
 
 1262
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 considered Jews for purposes of those aspects of civil law
 (e.g., marriage and divorce) administered by the Rabbinate.
 The Prime Minister and Absorption Minister offered their
 services as mediators at various stages of the dispute. It
 was agreed that eligibility for ritual marriage will be
 reviewed on a case-by-case basis by Rabbinical authorities.
 A law enacted in 1977 prohibits the offering and receipt of
 material benefits as inducements to religious conversion. In
 1979, the Justice Minister stated that the law is not intended
 to restrict the religious freedom of any community or to
 impede any community from the pursuit of normal educational or
 philanthropic activities. The Attorney General has ordered
 that no action be taken under the law without his express
 permission, and the law has not been employed. It
 nevertheless continues to cause uneasiness among some
 Christian groups. Persons considered to be missionaries and
 purporting to belong to missionary groups have been subjected
 to physical attacks by private individuals and in some cases
 harassment by Jewish religious groups. The police have been
 active in protecting missionary groups. The Ministry of
 Religious Affairs cooperates with and gives financial support
 to a variety of interfaith groups which seek to promote
 understanding between members of different religious groups.
 In the summer of 1985 some Jewish groups began to oppose
 publicly plans by Brigham Young University, a U.S. Mormon
 institution, to build a study center and expand its
 educational operations on Mt. Scopus. The civil authorities
 decided to abide by their earlier decision to allow the
 expansion, although an interministerial committee has been
 formed to review the issue.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Israeli citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country
 and are free to travel abroad or to emigrate, subject to
 government review to determine whether military
 service-related obligations have been satisfied. Emergency
 regulations, however, provide that Israeli citizens, by
 military order, may be confined to their neighborhoods or
 villages or barred from traveling to the occupied
 territories. Restrictions of this nature have been applied
 most often to Israeli Arabs. Restrictions on travel of an
 Arab Anglican priest to the occupied territories, imposed in
 1984, were extended by the northern military commander through
 January of 1986.
 There are general restrictions on travel by all residents to
 security zones along the borders, areas around certain
 military bases, and areas closed for military exercises.
 Since 1948 Israel has taken in over a million Jewish refugees,
 principally from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Soviet
 Union and has worked toward integrating them into its society
 and economy. From 1983 through 1985, the Absorption Ministry
 has settled some 7,000-8,000 Ethiopian Jewish immigrants. The
 flow of immigrants from other countries also continued in
 1985. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 of
 December 11, 1948, calls upon Israel to permit Arab refugees
 who left their homes in the 1947-48 fighting to return if they
 are willing to live in peace, or to be compensated for their
 losses if they choose not to return. Israel has not
 
 
 1263
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 recognized the validity of this resolution, pointing out the
 losses to its own citizens who fled Arab states; it did,
 however, take back some refugees under the principle of family
 reunification and has, on occasion, indicated willingness to
 accept some refugees in the context of a final peace
 settlement.
 Section 3   Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty system.
 All adult Israeli citizens have the right to vote for candidates
 of their choice and to participate in the political process.
 The Israeli Arab community is proportionally underrepresented in
 the Knesset (Parliament); 16 percent of Israel's total
 population is Arab, but only 7 of 120 Knesset members are Arab.
 This may be due, in part, to poor political organization within
 the Arab community. Israeli Arabs are included in the
 parliamentary election lists of several of the Zionist parties,
 the non-Zionist Israeli Communist Party, and the Progressive
 List for Peace.
 Israeli Arabs actively participate in local (municipal)
 elections, and Israeli Arab municipal councils serve in Arab
 towns throughout Israel. These municipal councils freely
 participate in Israeli regional councils. Complaints of lack of
 budget parity between Israeli-Arab and Jewish municipalities of
 equal size have been documented, but these differences also may
 be the result in part of poor political organization rather than
 active discrimination.
 Women participate freely in the political process and account
 for more than 40 percent of the political party membership. Ten
 members of the Knesset and two of the judges of the Supreme
 Court are women. There are no women in the 25-member Cabinet.
 One woman is currently serving as a Deputy Minister.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violation
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains an office of human rights in the
 Foreign Affairs Ministry, and several human rights groups in
 Israel work for the protection of individual liberties and
 women's rights. Private Israeli groups, such as the Israeli
 League for Human and Civil Rights, the Association for Civil
 Rights in Israel, and Peace Now, freely criticize Israeli
 government actions in Israel, the occupied territories, and
 Lebanon. They issue statements and reports, hold press
 conferences, and organize demonstrations without governmental
 interference.
 The Government permits visits to Israel by representatives of
 private international human rights groups, as well as the United
 Nations Economic and Social Council, the World Health
 Organization, and the International Labor Organization. The
 Government has generally permitted the ICRC to visit Palestinian
 prisoners taken in Lebanon and the occupied territories. The
 Government also investigates and replies to inquiries by
 organizations such as Amnesty International.
 Amnesty International, in its 1985 report on Israel and the
 occupied territories, expressed particular concern regarding due
 
 
 1264
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 process and the treatment of prisoners. Freedom House considers
 Israel "free"; it characterizes the occupied territories as
 "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Israel is about 4.28 million and is increasing
 by about 1.9 percent annually. After a decline in  per capita
 gross national product (GNP) in 1984 to $5,022 (constant 1980
 dollars) from the previous year, GNP increased in 1985 to $5,122.
 Israel historically has run a balance of payments deficit in
 order to provide the resources to absorb large-scale immigration
 in the early years of statehood, maintain a high defense
 capability, and raise the general standard of living.
 Substantial financial assistance from abroad, public and
 private, has helped Israel cover the payments gap.
 After facing record inflation of nearly 500 percent in 1984, the
 Government initiated a new economic program on July 1, 1985,
 which was designed to reduce the level of inflation and to
 improve its deteriorating balance of payments situation.
 Inflation will be closer to 200 percent for all of 1985, and
 less than 40 percent for the last 6 months of the year. The
 balance of payments is improving slowly. Outside factors,
 including U.S. assistance on an all-grant basis and the recent
 decline of the dollar vis-a-vis European currencies, have
 assisted the Israeli economy.
 Budget cuts have reduced both consumer and export subsidies and
 had a negative impact on health, education, and social
 services. Since the implementation of the new economic program,
 there has been real wage erosion and a substantial increase in
 unemployment (projected at 8.5 percent for the end of 1985).
 State education in either secular or religious schools is
 compulsory for all Israeli citizens through age 15. The primary
 school enrollment ratio is about 97 percent and the literacy
 rate about 89 percent. The parallel education systems in Israel
 for Jews and Arabs, conducted in Hebrew and Arabic respectively,
 show a disparity in quality, with greater resources per student
 going into the Jewish system.
 Israel has an advanced health care system with a high
 doctor-to-patient ratio. Life expectancy is 74 years, and the
 infant mortality rate is 13.1 per 1,000 live births. According
 to the Israeli Health Ministry's National Committee for Drinking
 Water Standards, the quality of drinking water is poor and the
 incidence of disease connected with pollutants in water is
 significantly higher than in Europe or the United States. The
 Committee is recommending new standards to improve water quality.
 Title to 93 percent of the land in Israel is claimed by the
 State or quasi-public organizations in trust for the Jewish
 people. According to law, anyone may purchase the remaining
 seven percent of privately-owned land through ordinary
 commercial transactions. In practice, little privately-owned
 land is ever on the market.
 The Collective Agreements Law of 1957 empowers the Labor
 Minister to extend the provisions of collective agreements,
 including the minimum wage in the agreement between Histadrut
 and the Manufacturers Association, to workers not otherwise
 covered by collective agreements. The Youth Labor law of 1955
 prohibits the employment of children under the age of 15 and
 
 
 1265
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 regulates employment of youths under the age of 18. The Labor
 Inspection Law of 1954 provides a labor inspection service to
 enforce health and safety standards in the workplace.
 Women's rights in Israel are protected by law as well as by
 governmental and private organizations.  The Equal Opportunity
 Law forbids discrimination on account of sex or marital or
 parental status, and employers are legally bound to pay female
 workers a wage equal to that paid male workers for the same or
 generally similar work. Laws and regulations also provide for
 protection of the rights of female employees with respect to
 pregnancy and childbirth. The Government includes a senior
 adviser on the status of women. The Civil Service Commission
 and several government ministries have officers responsible for
 promoting fair treatment for women. A number of nongovernmental
 women's organizations also work to advance the status of women,
 ensure equal opportunity in all fields, and other family
 services such as child care for working mothers.  The senior
 adviser on the status of women has publicly criticized as
 discriminatory the provision in many labor agreements that
 women, but not men, must retire at age 60.
 Over 40 percent of university graduates are women, as are
 39 percent of the work force. Fifty-two percent of Israeli
 civil service employees are women, but they appear to be
 disadvantaged at the higher levels of the Government. Women
 account for approximately two-thirds of the instructors employed
 in the educational system but they occupy only about one-fifth
 of the senior positions of the professional grade of the career
 civil service. Women are well represented in professional and
 technical jobs in the media, and work in a broad range of
 nongovernment professions and other occupations. Women are
 drafted into the army for service in noncombat units.
 The Israeli Arab minority has equal rights under the law in most
 respects, and Israeli Arabs have made substantial educational
 and material progress since the founding of the State. Some
 have risen to responsible positions in the civil service,
 generally in the Arab departments of government ministries.
 Israeli Arabs, however, are relatively powerless and tend to
 feel alienated. Despite some governmental and private efforts
 to bridge the gap, there is little social interaction with
 Israeli Jews. Israeli Arabs assert that they are denied equal
 access to education, housing, and other services, and that they
 are discriminated against in such areas as employment and
 appointment to government positions. Government grants to Arab
 local councils represent a smaller percentage of the councils'
 budgets than is the case for grants to Jewish municipalities.
 While Arabs make up about 16 percent of the population of
 Israel, less than 2 percent of the persons in senior government
 positions are Arabs, less than 3 percent of Israeli judges are
 Arabs, and no large bank, industrial enterprise, or agricultural
 undertaking in Israel is headed by an Israeli Arab. Israeli
 Arabs make up 3 percent of university students and less than 1
 percent of the academic positions in the universities.
 Druze and Circassians are subject to Israel's military draft,
 and some Bedouin serve voluntarily in special units. Most
 Muslims and Christians have not been permitted to serve and
 therefore are disqualified from many economic and social
 benefits which require military service as a precondition.

 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 The territories which Israel has occupied since 1967 consist
 of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the
 Gaza Strip. The West Bank and Gaza remain under military
 government. Israel regards East Jerusalem and the Golan
 Heights as subject to Israeli law, jurisdiction, and
 administration.
 The United States holds the view that Israel's presence in all
 these territories is that of an occupying power. The United
 States regards Israel's administration as subject to the Hague
 regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention
 concerning the protection of civilian populations under
 military occupation.
 Israel declares that the Fourth Geneva Convention does not
 apply to the West Bank and Gaza, but that it voluntarily
 observes most of the Convention's provisions in these areas.
 Major differences have arisen in regard to the applicability
 of these provisions in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,
 the introduction of civilian settlers, and the use of
 collective punishment. Israel declares that it enforces
 Jordanian law in the West Bank and British Mandatory
 regulations in the Gaza Strip. In addition, Israel has issued
 over 1,000 military orders altering or overriding portions of
 these laws and uses some British Mandatory ordinances and
 Ottoman Empire laws on the West Bank.
 The complex human rights situation in the occupied territories
 is largely the result of the fact that since the 1967 war and
 in the absence of a peace settlement, the territories remain
 under military administration and there is friction between
 occupation authorities and the Palestinian population which
 opposes Israeli control. Among the symptoms of friction are
 active resistance to the occupation, including episodes of
 violence, sometimes encouraged by outside extremist groups.
 Friction also arises from security measures taken by Israel to
 counteract terrorist acts and threats of terrorism, and to
 counter other kinds of activities which the Israeli
 authorities assert endanger security. Another cause of
 friction is the introduction of civilian Israeli settlers,
 although settlement activity has slowed. Establishment of new
 settlements was limited to six by the National Unity
 Government agreement in late 1984. In 1985 three of these
 were officially dedicated, one in the Golan Heights and two in
 the West Bank. Frictions are exacerbated by some Israeli
 political elements who advocate annexation or permanent
 Israeli control of the territories as well as by the refusal
 of the principal Palestinian organizations to recognize the
 State of Israel.
 Israel implements its policy in the West Bank and Gaza through
 civil administrations. These were created in 1981 under the
 control of the Defense Ministry, and are staffed by military
 as well as civilian personnel. Israel's national police,
 border police, security service, and the Israel Defense Forces
 (IDF) all have a role in the administration of the occupied
 territories. The national police, which includes local
 Palestinians in its ranks, is seldom the target of criticism.
 However, there are frequent complaints by West Bankers and
 Gazans about the actions of the other organizations.
 
 
 1268
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Civil Administration authorities have attempted to reshape
 local politics, particularly by blocking the influence of the
 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and by trying to
 promote an alternate leadership. Israel permitted municipal
 elections in 1972 and 1976, but after 1980, citing security
 considerations, postponed further elections and removed
 numerous elected and appointed officials in the West Bank and
 Gaza. Threats and intimidation by extremist Palestinians have
 also inhibited the development of a visible, moderate local
 leadership. The present Israeli policy is to support the
 installation of acceptable, non-PLO Palestinian mayors who
 have local and Jordanian support in place of Israeli military
 appointees. A new Arab mayor of Nablus took office in
 December, and there is discussion of installing other Arab
 mayors.
 Israel has allowed the establishment of four universities in
 the West Bank and one in Gaza where none existed before, but
 has restricted activities of student and faculty members which
 it regards as threatening to its security. Israel permits
 criticism of its policies by the East Jerusalem-based Arabic
 press but has often censored articles and editorials and
 restricts the circulation of Arabic publications in the West
 Bank and Gaza. One Arabic newspaper and one press service
 were ordered closed during the year and one Jewish settler
 newspaper was temporarily banned. Broad restrictions on
 speech and assembly apply in the occupied territories.
 Arab and Jewish residents suffered from a marked increase in
 violent acts in 1985. One or another faction of the PLO as
 well as a variety of PLO dissident groups claimed
 responsibility for nearly all acts of violence against the IDF
 or Israeli civilians. Much of the violence, including the
 increased use of homemade bombs, knives, guns, and Molotov
 cocktails, appears, however, to have been spontaneous and
 local.
 Complaints of settler violence continued throughout the year,
 including unauthorized armed patrols and physical harassment.
 Israel prosecuted and convicted Jewish settlers for a variety
 of illegal acts. Twenty-five Jewish settlers were convicted
 of offenses including membership in a terrorist organization,
 murder, conspiracy, and other charges in 1985 and were given
 sentences ranging from 4 months to life imprisonment. Two IDF
 officers are currently being tried for their alleged roles in
 terrorism against Arabs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killing is not condoned by the Israeli Government.
 There have been, however, deaths and serious injuries as a
 result of both terrorist acts and IDF security enforcement
 measures. A military government spokesman said in October
 that 660 terrorist incidents had occurred in Israel and the
 occupied territories since January 1985.
 At least 2 unarmed Arab residents of the occupied territories
 were killed and 17 wounded by IDF soldiers enforcing security
 regulations. Members of the IDF also killed at least 4
 
 
 1269
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 residents of the occupied territories and wounded at least 5
 in armed confrontations. Attacks by Arabs took the lives of
 at least 4 IDF soldiers, 5 Jewish civilians (in addition to 4
 who were killed in Israel) and 4 Arabs, while at least 7 IDF
 soldiers, 40 Jewish civilians, and 16 Arabs were wounded.
 During 1985, two Palestinians who had been missing for some
 time were found dead at the site of explosions.
 b. Disappearance
 Israeli authorities neither sponsor nor condone disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by Israeli law and there is no evidence
 that torture is condoned by the Israeli authorities. Israeli
 border and national policemen have been convicted of abusive
 use of force against Arab prisoners, and the Israeli Supreme
 Court has ordered the withdrawal from evidence of confessions
 by West Bankers on the grounds that they appeared to have been
 obtained by force.
 Palestinian prisoners at a number of West Bank and Israeli
 prisons conducted hunger strikes throughout the year
 protesting conditions. The head of occupied territories
 prisons said inmates at Jenin prison spend 23 hours a day in
 30 square-meter cells holding 14 people each. In 1984 Israeli
 courts convicted two former officials of Farah prison of
 having abused prisoners. Based on affidavits collected from
 former prisoners between May 1982 and May 1984, a report
 prepared by the West Bank organization Law in the Service of
 Man, and published by the the International Commission of
 Jurists, alleged in January that prisoners at Farah prison are
 systematically abused. Israel denied the charges of
 systematic abuse.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Persons arrested for common crimes in the occupied territories
 are usually provided the opportunity for bail, access to an
 attorney, and a clear statement of charges. Individuals may
 be held in administrative detention without formal charges for
 up to 18 days. The normal detention period after the filing
 of charges is 60 days before trial. This period can be
 extended by a Supreme Court judge for an additional 3 months,
 and this extension may be renewed at the end of the 3 months.
 Persons detained for security investigations are not permitted
 bail and initially are denied access to an attorney or other
 outside contact, including consular officers. In some cases,
 officials have declined initially to confirm a person's
 detention to consular officers. This denial of notification
 of arrest to any third party can, under Israeli law, be
 extended for up to 15 days. It is unclear whether detainees
 are informed of the specific charges against them. Many of
 those released from such detention without charges claim
 ignorance of the reasons for their detention.
 A sizable number of Arabs are often detained after terrorist
 incidents or the dispersal of demonstrations. Such detentions
 usually do not result in formal charges and are not
 prolonged. Persons arrested during demonstrations are tried
 in military courts on security grounds. The security forces
 
 
 1270
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 can and do detain individuals without prompt notification of
 their relatives and apparently without the use of warrants.
 In May, Israel released 1,150 prisoners, including 879 who had
 been convicted of security offenses (alleged terrorists, their
 accomplices, and contacts), in exchange for 3 Israeli military
 personnel who had been captured in Lebanon. Some of the
 approximately 400 security prisoners who were released in the
 occupied territories as the result of this exchange were later
 rearrested on new security charges. Thirty-one of those
 released in the occupied territories were served expulsion
 orders alleging that they were not bona fide residents of the
 territories. The Government of Israel permitted 10 of the 31
 to remain in the territories after they proved to the
 satisfaction of the Israeli courts that they were pre-1967
 residents of the West Bank. Twenty-one others were expelled,
 drawing a rare public rebuke from the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC), which had helped negotiate the
 original exchange agreement. The ICRC disagreed with the
 Israeli interpretation of the residency requirements as
 established in the agreement. Israel maintained that those
 who had reentered Israel illegally had forfeited their
 residency rights; the ICRC disagreed.
 In August, after a 5-year hiatus, the Israeli Government
 revived 6-month administrative detention and deportation from
 the territories. The United States has indicated its belief
 that these measures are likely to foster further tensions and
 that they are inconsistent with the Fourth Geneva Convention.
 Since that time, approximately 100 Palestinians have been
 placed under administrative detention. Administrative  .
 detention must be confirmed by a military judge. The hearing
 is confidential and the detainee and counsel are not
 automatically given access to evidence cited as grounds for
 the detention. Six West Bank Palestinians were deported for
 alleged security offenses. Where the deportees appealed, the
 Israeli Supreme Court upheld the deportation orders.
 In 1985 at least 25 Arabs were placed under new or renewed
 orders restricting them to their town of residence for 3
 months or more. Such restrictions involve no formal charges
 and are ordered by regional military commanders without
 judicial review. Many of those so restricted are political
 activists, persons who are outspoken critics of Israeli
 policies, or PLO supporters.
 More than 10 West Bank towns and at least 10 refugee camps
 were placed under curfew at least once during 1985.
 Complaints about other forms of collective punishment and
 humiliating treatment at the hands of the security forces,
 such as the holding of groups of Arab men in town or village
 squares for long periods, rose sharply in 1985, especially
 during August and September. Some soldiers were disciplined
 for improper use of force and for stealing from those they had
 stopped for questioning or search.
 There is no forced labor in the occupied territories.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial �
 Jordanian law, as modified by Israeli military orders, remains
 in force in the West Bank for most criminal and civil
 matters. British Mandatory law, as modified, prevails in
 Gaza. The judicial application of these laws, except in
 
 
 1271
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 security cases, land acquisition, or where jurisdiction has
 been transferred by military order, has been left in the hands
 of an Arab judiciary, which acts independently of Israeli
 authority. Residents of the occupied territories accused of
 nonsecurity offenses receive public trials in local courts. In
 East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, Israeli law applies.
 Persons suspected of having committed security offenses, which
 are not precisely defined under Israeli law, are normally
 tried in Israeli military courts with a military judge
 presiding, and are defended by counsel. Israeli residents of
 the occupied territories accused of security offenses are not
 tried by military court but by the Israeli district court
 closest to their residence or the scene of their crime.
 Most military trials are open to the public, except for some
 cases involving serious security offenses. Consular officers
 normally have no difficulty in attending any court proceeding
 in which a foreign citizen is involved. Israel asserts
 jurisdiction with respect to alleged security offenses
 committed outside of Israel and the occupied territories.
 Orders of the Civil Administration may be appealed to the
 Israeli Supreme Court. Nonjudicial administrative orders of
 the military government may be appealed to area military
 commanders and the Supreme Court. No appeal of military court
 verdicts is possible, although the area commander may exercise
 the right of commutation. In April, a petition was filed on
 behalf of two Palestinians to have Israel establish a military
 appeals court in the occupied territories, contending that
 such a court is required by international law. The Government
 has argued that international law does not require an appeals
 apparatus, that the present system is adequate, and that an
 appeals court would undermine the military's antiterrorism
 deterrent measures. As of this date, the Israeli Supreme
 Court has not yet rendered a decision.
 Palestinians complain that due process is denied in the course
 of Israel's designating as state land areas of the occupied
 territories regarded by them as community or private land.
 Complaints include a lack of written notification or that the
 30-day period for filing competing claims is too brief to
 obtain substantiating documentation. Earth-moving work
 sometimes begins before the 30-day period has elapsed.
 Israeli authorities respond that extensions are granted upon
 requests, and that no title is required if the disputed land
 has been cultivated for at least 10 years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under occupation regulations, military authorities can and do
 enter private homes and institutions without prior judicial
 approval in pursuit of security objectives. A military order
 permits any soldier to search any person or premise on the
 West Bank at any time without warrant on the suspicion that a
 person or organization may be in possession of a proscribed
 publication.
 In 1985, at least 17 houses of West Bank and Gaza residents
 accused of involvement in security incidents were demolished
 and 20 were sealed. There is no judicial review of a decision
 to seal or demolish a house or room and such action is usually
 taken before the suspect has been put on trial. Houses or
 
 
 1272
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 rooms used by Israelis suspected or convicted of security
 offenses in the occupied territories were not demolished or
 sealed in 1985.
 It is widely believed that mail and telephone services in the
 West Bank and Gaza are monitored. Individuals can be and are
 questioned on their political views by security officials.
 Such inquiries can involve overnight detention.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression is restricted on security grounds.
 Proscribed acts include flying the Palestinian flag or
 displaying its colors, displaying Palestinian nationalist
 slogans, and publicly expressing support for the PLO. The
 Arabic press, most of which is located in East Jerusalem,
 remains outspoken in its criticism of Israeli policies and
 actions. Arrests, prison sentences, land seizures, and other
 politically sensitive stories are generally reported, but
 editorials and articles are frequently censored in whole or in
 part. All items to be printed in Jerusalem's Arabic papers
 must be submitted to the censor for prior review. Hebrew
 papers need submit only articles on military security matters
 to the censors. At least 90 editorials and commentaries from
 Arabic newspapers were censored during the year. Censorship
 decisions may be challenged by appeal to the chief censor.
 Materials licensed to be published in East Jerusalem are free
 to circulate there, but require an additional license for
 distribution in the West Bank and Gaza. Military orders
 forbid the printing or publishing of anything containing
 political significance without a prior license. Political
 significance is not defined in the order.
 A permit must be obtained for every publication (book,
 magazine, or newspaper) imported into the occupied
 territories. Arabic educational materials, periodicals, and
 books originating outside Israel are censored or banned for
 anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli content and for the encouragement
 of Palestinian nationalism. Possession of banned materials by
 West Bank or Gaza Arabs is a criminal offense. Restrictions
 of this kind are usually not applied to Israeli residents.
 Lawyers have complained of difficulty in obtaining the list of
 proscribed publications. The number of books explicitly
 prohibited was reduced from 1,300 to 350 after the present
 Israeli Government took office.
 In September, the Arabic weekly newspaper Al Darb was ordered
 permanently closed on the charge that it was run and'directed
 by the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. An
 appeal has been filed. Also in September, the East Jerusalem
 press service Al Minar was ordered shut for 6 months. In
 October, the Arabic weekly magazine Al Biyadar As Siassi was
 refused permission to distribute in the occupied territories
 for 2 weeks for failing to submit published material to the
 censors. The Arabic daily Ashaab was shut down for 3 days in
 August for printing material not approved by the censor. Five
 Arab journalists were placed under administrative detention in
 1985. In November, the Jewish settler newspaper Aleph Yud was
 temporarily prevented from publishing due to alleged
 incitement to violent resistance against what was contended to
 
 
 1273
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 be the willingness of the Government of Israel to make
 territorial concessions as part of a peace settlement.
 Arabic-language radio and television programs from Jordan,
 Syria, and other Arab countries, including broadcasts of the
 Voice of Palestine, are received in the occupied territories
 without jamming.
 Foreign journalists have not reported any difficulties in
 meeting with inhabitants of the occupied territories. All
 reports filed by the foreign press, however, are subject to
 military censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Israeli occupation authorities have permitted a wide range
 of labor, professional, and fraternal groups organized before
 1967 to continue to function. Professional associations are
 active and frequently take public stands on political issues.
 No political parties or other groups viewed as primarily
 political are permitted. Public gatherings, defined as a
 group of more than 10 people, require permission, often
 withheld from both Arab and Israeli groups, based on the
 consideration of public order.
 There are approximately 40 labor unions in the occupied
 territories, grouped into 2 rival federations. Fifteen new
 labor unions have been permitted to register in the West Bank
 since the beginning of the occupation, but over 100
 applications have been turned down and a number of Arab unions
 have been disbanded by the occupation authorities for alleged
 security concerns. In 1985, the Israeli authorities refused
 permission for a union of Arab lawyers on the West Bank to
 form. Strikes are legal so long as they are not undertaken
 for political reasons. There were no reports of arrests for
 labor-organizing activity during 1985. Some union activities,
 such as cultural exhibitions or May Day festivities, were
 prohibited during the year on security grounds.
 West Bank unions are generally small and confined to urban
 workers in skilled craft trades. The occupation authorities
 must approve all candidates for election to union office but
 such elections are held without other interference.
 Membership in the Histadrut, the Israeli national labor
 organization, is open to Arab workers from East Jerusalem and
 the Golan Heights.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religious practice exists in the occupied
 territories. No group or sect is banned on religious
 grounds. Muslim and Christian holy days are observed without
 hindrance, and Muslims and Christians operate a variety of
 private schools and institutions. There has been controversy
 concerning rights of access to worship inside the Ibrahimi
 Mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs, which is also the site of an
 ancient synagogue. The occupation authorities tolerate the
 existence of a number of Islamic fundamentalist groups. There
 has been no reported interference with the publication or
 distribution of religious publications.
 Israel protects Muslim and Christian holy places and usually
 assures freedom of access to them. On occasion, the
 authorities have denied both Arab and Jewish groups access to
 
 
 1274
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 religious sites on religious or security grounds. Israel
 makes concerted efforts to facilitate travel into Jordan for
 Muslims wishing to make the Hajj to Mecca. This includes
 expedited bridge clearance procedures and extended hours of
 crossing. In 1985, several thousand Muslims from the occupied
 territories made the pilgrimage. At least 20 were refused
 permission on security grounds.
 In July, a number of suspects in the Jewish terrorist
 underground trials were convicted and sentenced to prison
 terms for, among other things, conspiracy to destroy the Dome
 of the Rock with explosives.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is generally unrestricted for Arabs within
 the occupied territories, but certain categories are
 significantly restricted. Approximately 80,000 Arabs travel
 daily to Israel to work. All residents over 16 must carry
 identity documents with them at all times and must show them
 to military or law enforcement officials whenever requested.
 Vehicles owned by Arabs of the occupied territories are
 frequently stopped for security checks, sometimes at
 unauthorized roadblocks manned by settlers. Palestinians are
 required to obtain permits to remain overnight in Israel; West
 Bankers are generally forbidden to remain in Jerusalem after
 midnight.
 Most inhabitants of the occupied territories are permitted to
 travel abroad and many thousands do so each year. Exit visas
 are required. The Government of Israel issues laissez passers
 to residents of the occupied territories upon their request to
 facilitate foreign travel after a security check. In some
 cases, restrictions are imposed on reentry. Travel bans are
 also imposed on some persons suspected of antioccupation
 activities. Eight West Bank women were prohibited from
 traveling to the U.N. Conference on Women in Nairobi in
 August. The leader of a West Bank charitable society was
 denied permission to travel to the United States in September
 to attend the Congressional Black Caucus annual conference.
 Bans on the travel of residents of particular areas have been
 employed by Israeli security forces as a form of collective
 punishment. The residents of at least 10 West Bank towns were
 prohibited from crossing the Allenby Bridge to Jordan for
 various periods following terrorist attacks. Bans on Tulkarm
 and Hebron lasted 1 month and 5 weeks, respectively.
 00espite the formal state of war between Israel and Jordan,
 two-way travel between the West Bank and Jordan is permitted.
 Palestinians returning from Jordan, as well as other Arabs or
 persons of Arab descent, all of whom are subject to search,
 complain of unnecessarily harsh or humiliating treatment and
 harassment. Israel permitted all members of the Jordanian
 Parliament resident in the West Bank to travel freely to
 attend parliamentary sessions during 1985.
 There are no obstacles to emigration. Israel sometimes
 refuses to renew the laissez passers of West Bank residents
 who study or work abroad for a period of time, even though
 they have not acquired foreign citizenship. Such residents
 are permitted to return to the West Bank, as tourists only,
 and are sometimes denied the right to return at all. Entry
 permits or residency rights are often denied to spouses and
 
 
 1275
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 children solely because the head of the household has
 emigrated. Israel also has not permitted the return of many
 former West Bank residents who happened to be absent at the
 time the June 1967 war broke out and Israeli occupation
 began.
 Gazans normally do not require prior approval for travel to
 the West Bank. Under special arrangements concluded between
 Israel and Egypt, thousands of Gazans regularly cross the
 border into Egypt, particularly to work or visit relatives in
 the divided city of Rafah. Israel permits Golan Heights Druze
 to return after attending school in Syria; it has not,
 however, permitted the return of other Syrians who fled or
 were expelled from the area during and after the 1967 war.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There is no regional self-government in the occupied
 territories and only limited Arab administration at the town
 level; most villages retain their traditional leadership.
 Arab civil servants, institutions, and municipal officials
 operate under the military government. No indigenous formal
 political parties or overtly political organizations are
 permitted.
 Municipal elections, held in 1972 and 1976 and scheduled for
 1980, were postponed and have not been rescheduled. Of the 23
 Arab mayors and municipal councils elected in 1976, 14 of the
 mayors and'at least 4 municipal councils were dismissed by
 occupation authorities. The mayors of the major towns of
 Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah, and El Bireh were replaced by
 Israeli officials. Neither the dismissals nor appointments of
 alternate officials is subject to judicial review. Bethlehem
 and Tulkarm are the only major towns governed by elected Arab
 mayors. Nablus was returned to an Arab mayor, the last duly
 elected deputy mayor and elected head of the Chamber of
 Commerce, in December 1985.
 Arab residents of East Jerusalem are permitted and encouraged
 to vote in municipal elections. Approximately 20 percent of
 those eligible did so in the 1983 elections.
 Most Arab residents of the West Bank are Jordanian citizens
 and as such are represented by 2 senators and 30 members of
 the Jordanian Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A variety of local groups, both Israeli and Palestinian, are
 concerned with human rights issues. These groups'
 publications and statements are allowed to circulate in the
 occupied territories.
 The Israeli Government normally permits international human
 rights groups to visit the occupied territories, and does not
 interfere with'their investigations.  However, two field
 investigators for Law in the Service of Man, the West Bank
 affiliate of the International Commission of Jurists which is
 involved in legal assistance on human rights issues, were
 placed under administrative arrest in September on security
 
 
 1276
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 grounds. One was released in December; the other is due to be
 released in March.
 Since 1978 the International Labor Organization has sent
 factfinding missions to Israel and the occupied territories.
 Among its recommendations it has urged that "the impact of the
 state of occupation.. .on the exercise of trade union
 activities should be reduced to a strict minimum...."
 Amnesty International's 1985 Report on Israel and the occupied
 territories expressed concern regarding due process and the
 treatment of prisoners. Freedom House has characterized the
 occupied territories as "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 There are between 800,000 to 1 million Palestinians in the
 West Bank. Living standards have risen substantially since
 1967, although more slowly than in Israel or Jordan; per
 capita gross income in 1985 was three times its 1967 level.
 Much of this increase in income is due to the large number of
 West Bankers working in Israel and to remittances from
 Palestinians working abroad. In 1985, Israel's economic
 problems continued to affect West Bank commercial and
 agricultural sales, tourist trade, and local construction. A
 large but undetermined portion of the Arab work force is
 traditionally underemployed or engaged in seasonal work.
 Economic life in the occupied territories has become enmeshed
 in Israeli regulations, some used politically. Israeli
 restrictions on the export to Israel of West Bank and Gaza
 products, especially agricultural products, limits local
 market opportunities. While Jordan imposes market-protection
 limits on West Bank produce, export to Jordan is sometimes
 banned by Israel as punishment for a security incident.
 Construction of new factories is also restricted for political
 as well as economic reasons. Some localities from which
 security offenders have been arrested have been declared
 off-limits to development projects. While Israel is concerned
 that funds from the PLO or other hostile sources might be
 brought into the occupied territories under the guise of
 development, Arabs contend that even projects which are fully
 funded by proven local sources have not been approved.
 The Israeli Government has indicated that it would review
 favorably several long-standing Arab proposals and in October
 the Civil Administration approved a large number of projects
 which had previously been rejected. Several municipalities
 have been permitted to import funds held in Jordanian banks
 and private import of funds has been liberalized.
 The taking of land by Israeli authorities for settlements,
 military use, and in connection with major road plans, and the
 reclassification of communal areas as state land,
 significantly affects the lives and economic activities of
 Palestinians. According to some calculations, Palestinians
 have been precluded from use of an area approaching 50 percent
 of the West Bank land and 15 percent of the Gaza Strip, of
 which about one half is presently vacant and barren. There
 are currently more than 150 nonmilitary settlements in the
 West Bank (excluding unilaterally expanded Jerusalem) and
 Gaza, with a total population of about 40,000, although the
 growth of settlements slowed considerably in 1985. The

 agricultural and urban development. A disproportionate amount
 is allocated for settlers' use.
 The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the
 military government meet the basic educational needs of
 refugee students in the West Bank. Overall adjusted primary
 school enrollment there was 83 percent in 1984. The West Bank
 is served by four universities, one college, one community
 college, and a variety of other educational institutions, all
 established or upgraded since the beginning of the Israeli
 occupation. None of the universities receives financial
 support or other assistance from the occupation authorities.
 The creation of additional institutions is under consideration
 by various Arab groups. All teachers at educational
 institutions in the occupied territories must receive
 certificates from the Israeli authorities, issuance of which
 include criteria beyond that of professional competence. In
 March, 18 teachers were dismissed for political activities.
 An-Najah University was closed twice during 1985: once for 2
 months after occupation authorities seized materials
 considered inflammatory during a campaign for student council
 elections and for 3 days in December for allegedly allowing
 illegal assembly. Bir Zeit University was closed by the
 authorities for 1 month and Bethlehem University was closed
 for 1 week when proscribed books were found at book fairs on
 the campuses. Bethlehem was also closed for 1 day in November
 following student demonstrations protesting deportations.
 These measures at times go beyond what might be reasonably
 justified on security grounds.
 The 363 square kilometer Gaza strip has a population of about
 500,000 with a per capita income of about $1,100 a year.
 Gaza's economy advanced marginally in the early 1980's,
 whereas real gross national product grew at over 10 percent in
 the late 1960's and 5 to 6 percent in the late 1970's. Since
 1967, infant mortality has declined sharply and health
 services have improved. Gaza's basic needs for food,
 clothing, and shelter are largely met. Severe population
 pressure and inadequate public sanitation remain major
 problems. Housing is especially crowded in the eight Gaza
 refugee camps, where approximately 210,000 of the 370,000
 refugees registered with UNRWA live. Approximately 35,000
 refugees have left the camps to live in Israeli
 government-sponsored communities. Inadequate classroom space
 has forced double-shifting at many UNRWA and government
 schools in recent years. Gaza producers of citrus, the major
 crop, complain that marketing has suffered from both Israeli
 and Jordanian restrictions. Israel has reduced water use to
 allow the water table to rise and inhibit saline intrusion.
 The fishing industry has shrunk due to restrictions on fishing
 waters. About 35,000 Gazans commute daily to work in Israel,
 earning about one-third of Gaza's income. Gaza's Al Azhar
 University, an affiliate of Al Azhar in Cairo, offers a 4-year
 program to about 3,300 Gaza students.
 The Israeli-occupied portion of the Golan Heights consists of
 1,295 square kilometers, and has an Arab population of about
 15,000, mostly Druze and a small percentage of Alawites.
 Approximately 7,500 Israeli settlers live in some 32
 settlements in the Golan Heights. Druze village councils have
 complained that they do not receive sufficient funding to
 provide minimal municipal services, and a third of the
 estimated 4,000 school children are reported to be studying in
 substandard classrooms.

 Child labor is not permitted and adequate regulations on
 working conditions are in effect. Histadrut, the Israeli
 national labor organization, has taken steps to assure that
 working conditions for Golan Druze are comparable to those of
 Israelis.
 Urban West Bankers are increasingly sophisticated in their
 social attitudes, including toward the role of women, but the
 rural majority continues to hold more traditional social
 values. There are no legal or administrative prohibitions on
 the employment of women in the occupied territories, although
 traditional cultural mores and family commitments limit most
 to homemaking. Most Palestinian women holding jobs outside
 their homes reside and work in urban areas. Employment of
 women is concentrated in service industries, education, and
 health services, with a small number working in journalism,
 law, and other professions.
 Although women legally have equal access to public education,
 custom and family pressures limit the number of women in West
 Bank schools. Even so, female school enrollment is quite high
 by Middle Eastern standards. A little over 45 percent of the
 primary and secondary school students are female. While
 female enrollment at the postsecondary level varies between
 roughly 30 to 45 percent at coeducational West Bank colleges
 and universities, a number of teacher and vocational training
 centers are all male or all female.
 There is a wide range of women's cooperative groups for health
 care, child care, handicraft production, vocational training,
 and other services. The West Bank-wide Society for the
 Preservation of the Family is active in supporting women's
 needs.
