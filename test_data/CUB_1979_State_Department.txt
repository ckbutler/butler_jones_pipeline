 CUBA
 Fidel Castro took power on January 1, 1959, after a long
 and bloody struggle against the corrupt, authoritarian
 Batista regime. Though Castro promised free elections
 and a return to constitutionality, he had begun by 1961
 to establish a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship. In the
 process, Cuba acquired one of the worst human rights
 records in the Hemisphere with respect to integrity of
 the person. Tens of thousands were arbitrarily arrested.
 Torture and execution were cordmon.
 By the mid-seventies, however, the Castro government
 had drastically reduced the incidence of torture, insti-
 tuted penal reforms, and improved the conditions under
 which political prisoners are held. Further, in November
 1978, Castro announced the beginning of a prisoner release
 program under which most political prisoners were to
 be set free. Some 3,600 had been released as of September
 15, 1979. The Cuban government has not revealed how
 many political prisoners remain. The prominent political
 prisoner Huber Matos estimated after his release in October
 1979 that there are still about 1,100.
 Cuba's record on providing economic goods and services
 to its people is mixed. Although disparities in income
 distribution have been largely eliminated and the formerly
 lowest economic sectors of the population have made some
 gains, the aggregate standard of living may actually
 have fallen since 1959. Education is available to all,
 and illiteracy has been reduced to a level approaching
 that of most developed countries. Medical care is provided
 at virtually no cost. The Cuban government has made
 a major effort to construct low-cost housing, but not
 all urban shanty-towns and sub-standard rural habitations
 have been eliminated. Many foodstuffs are in short supply,
 but what is available is distributed equitably through
 a strict rationing system. The diet of nearly all Cubans
 seems adequate, though often lacking in certain vitamins
 and minerals.
 Although most Cubans now have the basic material necessities
 of life, they have paid a high political price political.
 Cuba is ruled under a totalitarian Marxist-Leninist system.
 All political, economic, social, and cultural activities
 are under the close control of the Communist Party.
 No political opposition is allowed. The press is owned
 and controlled by the Party-state apparatus. Freedom
 of speech is severely circumscribed. With the institution
 of the new system of people's assemblies, the individual
 citizen now has some limited political participation
 at the grass roots level. National policies and foreign
 policy, however, are still decided by a small elite within
 the Communist Party Political Bureau and Secretariat.
 A new Penal Code went into effect on November 1, 1979.
 At the time this report wasr prepared, it was not yet
 clear what effect the new code would have on the human
 rights situation in Cuba.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture.
 Use of torture by the Cuban Security Service was common
 during the sixties, especially during interrogation.
 The new Cuban Constitution, implemented in December 1976,
 outlaws this practice and states that "the person who
 has been arrested or the prisoner is inviolable in his
 personal integrity." Some abuses still occur, but torture
 now seems to be rare. Amnesty International's 1978 report
 does not mention any recent instances of torture.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment.
 A recently released American prisoner, in Cuban jails
 since 1965, said he was subjected to intense "psycholo-
 gical torture" during his early years of incarceration.
 He and many others have reported severely overcrowded
 conditions, starvation diets, and beatings and other
 maltreatment by guards during the sixties and early seventies.
 Many recently released prisoners agree, however, that
 prison conditions in most facilities have improved since
 1975. New, modern prison facilities have been constructed.
 Reports of maltreatment at the hands of guards are rare,
 and such maltreatment probably is not officially condoned,
 though there are still exceptions to the rule. Huber
 Matos, a Cuban political prisoner released in October
 1979, has indicated he was severely mistreated in the
 weeks preceding his release. The Cuban prison diet is
 lacking in essential vitamins and minerals, but this
 in part reflects food shortages in Cuba as a whole.
 Medical facilities are generally adequate.
 The Cuban government classifies its prisoners as common
 criminals and counterrevolutionary prisoners. According
 to Amnesty International, the Cuban authorities in 1971
 implemented a "progressive plan" to replace an earlier
 policy of political re-education which had included compulsory
 political education and recantations of past opposition
 to the revolution. Under the "progressive plan," prisoners
 work at prison facilities and receive monthly salaries
 for work satisfactorily performed. They are granted
 various rights and privileges, e.g., home visits, visits
 by family, possible early release, etc., depending on
 their prison category, from the most lenient (open prisons
 - frente abierto, regimen comun) to the most severe (regimen
 severo).
 A group of prisoners (who call themselves plantados)
 has persistently rejected government education schemes
 as well as the "progressive plan." These prisoners refuse
 to wear prison uniforms or to take part in any of the
 plan's duties and activities. Amnesty International,
 in its 1978 report, cited reports that plantado prisoners,
 kept apart from the rest, had been denied family visits,
 correspondence, adequate exercise, and satisfactory medical
 attention. Cuban officials, while admitting that certain
 
 
 restrictions were imposed on the plantado group, insist
 that all prisoners received minimum      s including
 adequate medical attention and exercise and that even
 the severest category of prisoners received "one visit
 and one letter every three months."
 The International Committee of the Red Cross is not allowed
 access to Cuban prisoners.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment.
 Amnesty International estimated that in 1978 there were
 3,200 political prisoners in Cuban jails. At news conferences
 in September and December 1978, President Castro said
 there were 3,000 "counterrevolutionaries" imprisoned
 for "crimes against the security of the state" and 600
 persons imprisoned for "illegal departure." He said
 these totals did not include about 400 prisoners held
 for serious crimes committed during the Batista era (the
 so-called batistianos) or prisoners "affiliated with
 terrorist groups." Amnesty International's 1979 report
 expresses concern with the lack of information on these
 latter two categories of prisoners. Castro pledged to
 release all 3,600 prisoners in the first two categories
 during 1979, but made no promises regarding the batistianos
 or the "terrorists."
 By November 15, 1979, the Cuban government had released
 approximately 3,600 political prisoners since late 1978.
 This presumably includes most of those persons imprisoned
 for counterrevolutionary activities and illegal departure.
 It is not yet clear whether the Cuban government plans
 additional releases.
 Former political prisoners often find it difficult to
 find satisfactory employment and become reintegrated
 into Cuban society. The answer of the Cuban government
 to the problem is to encourage their emigration, thereby
 relieving the state of the burden of supporting the politically
 suspect and, not incidentally, minimizing the risk of
 their becoming a source of dissent.
 On the question of distinguishing "prisoners of conscience"
 from those detained because of politically motivated
 acts of violence, Amnesty International states: "from
 the information currently available to us, it does seem
 that certain individuals may have been arrested and sentenced
 to long terms of imprisonment more because of their op-
 position to the revolutionary government than on account
 of any specific offense."
 The Cuban government acknowledges holding prisoners convicted
 of political crimes, but takes the position that there
 are no "prisoners of conscience," rather, all are said
 to have been guilty of "crimes against the integrity
 and security of the state." Chapter VI of the new Cuban
 Constitution enumerating fundamental rights, duties,
 and guarantees, includes a fail-safe article 61 that
 states: "none of the freedoms which are recognized for
 citizens can be exercised contrary to ... the existence
 and the objectives of the socialist state, or contrary
 to the decision of the Cuban people to build socialism
 and communism. Violation of this principle can be punished
 by law."
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 
 
 294
 The new Cuban Constitution specifies that the courts
 shall be "a system of state organs independent of all
 others." All courts, however, are subordinated to the
 National Assembly of People's Power, and thus, also,
 the Council of State. The 1977 Judicial System Law con-
 firmed provisions of a 1973 law disbanding the revolution-
 ary tribunals which until then had been empowered to
 deal specifically with "counterrevolutionary offenses."
 Such political offenses now fall within the competence
 of the state security chambers of the higher-ranking
 people's courts.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel under Cuban law; these
 are appointed by the court. The court-appointed counsels
 have access, though it is not unlimited, to defendants.
 However, the pervasive control exercised by the regime
 and the Communist Party in all areas of society, including
 the police, courts, and lawyers, makes an independent
 judicial process impossible.
 e.   Invasion of the Home.
 The new Cuban Constitution states: "the home is inviolable.
 No one can enter the home of another against his will,
 except in those cases foreseen by law." In practice,
 Cuban courts issue warrants upon request by the Cuban
 Security Service in cases affecting national security.
 Therefore, the individual has scant legal protection
 against arbitrary search by the Cuban Security Service.
 In a carefully controlled society like Cuba, it is difficult
 to estimate the prevalence of arbitrary searches of homes.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education.
 The Cuban Constitution guarantees the right of all citizens
 to free health protection and care (including dental
 care), regular medical examinations, vaccinations, and
 free hospitalization. The implementation of this policy
 has been impressive, but its success has been inhibited
 by factors such as lack of trained doctors and medical
 technicians, inaccessibility of rural areas, and shortage
 of medicines.
 Similarly, free education is guaranteed for all in the
 Constitution, the level to be determined by student ability,
 social demands, and the needs of socio-economic development.
 The Cuban government's policy to eradicate illiteracy
 has been especially successful, and Cuba now has a very
 high literacy rate (by most estimates, above 95%).
 Black-marketing is widespread. Other forms of corruption
 do not appear to be widely prevalent in such a structured
 society and are severely punished when discovered.
 The character of Cuba's economy, like its political structure,
 
 
 295
 is Marxist-Leninist. Since the early 1960's there has
 been state ownership of virtually all land, and the country's
 business and industrial sectors have been completely
 nationalized. The economy is a centrally planned, non-
 market system in which nearly all economic activity is
 controlled and executed by state entities. Small family
 farms have been allowed to remain in private hands, and
 around these some subsistence farming and quasi-truck
 gardening private activities occur.
 Recent nationwide food shortages, caused in part by export
 of agricultural and marine products that earn hard currency,
 have exacerbated the lean dietary standards imposed on
 the Cuban population by a rationing system that seeks
 to determine scientifically what kind of diet (number
 of calories, amount of protein, vitamins, etc.) each
 classification of socialist worker needs to fulfill his
 useful social function. There is a shortage of adequate
 housing in Cuba's urban centers, but what is available
 is equitably distributed. Rural housing has much improved
 over the past two decades, but not all substandard housing
 has been replaced.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly.
 These civil and political liberties do not exist in Cuba.
 All the print and electronic media are government-owned
 and completely controlled.
 Freedom of religious belief is guaranteed by the new
 Constitution. There have been some complaints that those
 who practice regular religious observance are
 discriminated against in matters such as employment,
 housing, and schooling. The office of the Papal Nuncio
 has frequently intervened with the government in cases
 like these, but with mixed success. Members of sects
 such as the Jehovah's Witnesses who disagree with the
 government on matters of employment, education, compulsory
 military service, etc., are subject to prosecution for
 their dissent.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration.
 Domestic travel within Cuba is not circumscribed or controlled.
 Unofficial foreign travel is rarely available to the
 vast majority of the Cuban people. Those who wish to
 travel abroad temporarily must get an exit permit from
 the Cuban government. Persons who wish to emigrate also
 need exit permits. Several thousand ex-political prisoners
 were granted permission to emigrate during 1979. It
 is not clear what criteria the government uses to grant
 or deny requests for exit permits.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process.
 
 
 296
 Cuba is a centralized Marxist-Leninist state. The Communist
 Party is Cuba's only legal political party. All pre-1959
 organizations and political parties have disappeared,
 and Cuba's trade unions, its womens' federation, its
 youth and other organizations have been transformed and
 reshaped, primarily to refocus and direct public energies
 towards the goals and objectives of the government and
 the Party. With the institution of the new system of
 peoples' assemblies, the individual citizen now has some
 limited participation in discussions of such local issues
 as public transportation, sanitation, and crime prevention.
 Cubans have constitutionally and legally outlawed
 discrimination against women, and there has been considerable
 advancement of women's rights in employment and working
 conditions. At the political level, women are represented
 nominally in the Central Committee, but none are in the
 hierarchy of the Communist Party itself, and few are
 at the top of government. They are importantly involved
 in some mass organizations (which are used more for political
 and economic mobilization than for popular representation)
 such as the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution
 and, of course, the Cuban Federation of Women.
 Nearly all Cuban workers belong to the Confederation
 of Cuban Workers. There is no collective bargaining
 or right to strike. Labor-management relations are admini-
 stered by the Ministry of Labor. Union members can vote
 for the officers of their local sections, but not for
 the municipal, provincial, and national officers who
 represent the union within the ministry which regulates
 their particular industry.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 According to the 1978 Amnesty International report, the
 Cuban government allowed Amnesty International officials
 to visit Cuba "in their private capacities" in late 1977,
 but specified in advance that the visit could not be
 considered an "investigation." The Amnesty International
 team met with prison officials, judges, and government
 officials, including Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez,
 and was allowed to visit certain prison facilities.
 They were allowed to meet with some prisoners -- but
 never alone -- and were denied permission to meet with
 any plantado prisoners. According to the report, Vice
 President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez agreed to further com-
 munication between the Cuban government and Amnesty Inter-
 national.
 Cuba was suspended from participation in the Organization
 of American States in 1962. The Cuban government therefore
 has neither signed the American Convention on Human Rights
 nor allowed the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 to visit Cuba.
