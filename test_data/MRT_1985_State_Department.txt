 MAURITANIA
 Mauritania-is governed.by the Military Committee for National
 Salvation,.established in the wake of a bloodless 1978 coup
 which removed the civilian president and abolished the
 .parliamentary system established at independence in 1960.
 Colonel Maaouya oul Sid' Ahmed Taya-,..in his role as President
 of the Committee, is Chief of.State.- He assumed power after
 the peaceful-ouster of the former.president, Lt. Colonel
 Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla. on December 12. 1984. All 21
 members of the Military Committee retain ministerial
 portfolios.or occupy-other-key government posts. Prospects
 for an'early return to civilian rule appear remote; the
 military remains-the "custodian of the nation's sovereignty."
 All.political parties-and opposition groups are banned. In
 -the absence, of any formalized means of communication between
 the.Government, and the people, the Structure for the Education
 of the Masses was~created in 1982 on a nationwide basis.
 Organized down to the village and neighborhood level, it is
 used to explain government policy, mobilize manpower for
 self-help projects, and air grievances. The exercise of state
 power is tempered-by traditions of informal consensual
 decisionmaking and the historical fragmentation of authority
 among various tribes, families, and regions,
 The country.continues to face daunting economic and social
 problems:  desertification and other aftereffects of prolonged
 drought; the-Western Sahara conflict; racial tensions; massive
 unemployment;-the highest per capita debt in Africa; poor
 infrastructure; inadequate health and education systems; and a
 mass exodus from the rural areas;. Although-adequate rains
 fell in 1985 for the first time in many years, the 13-year
 drought destroyed much of the agricultural and animal
 husbandry resources and severely weakened the nomadic culture
 of the Maurs. The gradual disappearance of traditional
 culture and ancient religious centers has generated a sense of
 crisis, and the explosive growth of urban refugee camps has
 placed enormous burdens on the State.
 The advent of the Taya regime brought some improvements in
 1985 in the human rights situation. In. late 1984, the new
 regime released and pardoned all political prisoners and
 detainees and invited exiles to return to Mauritania. The
 Government also decided to restore the property and pension
 rights of families of released detainees. President Taya has
 deepened the-dialogue with blacks, focusing on efforts to
 eradicate the remnants of slavery which have survived three
 attempts at abolition.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no reports in 1985 of politically motivated
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 -There were no cases of politically inspired disappearances
 during 1985.

 MAURITANIA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 Mauritanian law prohibits the use of torture, and there is no
 evidence that it was practiced in 1985. However, extended
 confinement is sometimes used to encourage
 self-incrimination. Some political prisoners released in late
 1984 charged that they had been tortured under the previous
 Haidalla regime. Amnesty International, in its 1985 report
 (covering 1984), states that the secretaries general of the
 labor and student organizations were held incommunicado with
 other detainees, many of whom were reportedly tortured shortly
 after their arrest by being suspended by their hands and feet
 and beaten with rifle butts and clubs.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Mauritanian law guarantees expeditious arraignment and trial,
 access to legal counsel, and the right of appeal. However, an
 inadequate and underfinanced judicial system results in
 suspects being held regularly for long periods before trial.
 Moreover, based on legislation enacted before the 1978 coup,
 the authorities have the prerogative to detain, without trial
 or appeal, anyone judged to be a threat to national security.
 Such detainees are usually confined to their residences but
 can also be detained in prisons, which exist in both
 Nouakchott and Jereida for the more serious cases.
 As many as eight government officials and businessmen closely
 associated with former President Haidalla were detained along
 with him at the time of the coup in 1984. These men are still
 under house arrest or in prison and no formal charges have
 been brought against them. There were no arbitrary arrests or
 detentions reported in 1985.
 Although the Government remains opposed to slavery and has
 established a commission to implement abolition decrees,
 vestiges of the practice still exist. In the spring of 1985,
 the United Nations Subcommission on Human Rights released a
 report on slavery in Mauritania, based on a 1984 visit by a
 Commission representative. The report criticized the
 continued existence of slavery, especially in rural areas, but
 acknowledged the Government's intent to stamp it out. Efforts
 to implement Mauritania's 1980 Declaration of the Abolition of
 Slavery have been limited and only partially effective. Some
 government-sponsored resettlement programs for former slaves
 have been implemented. Estimates of the number of persons
 remaining in a slave status run as high as 100,000, although
 such figures are impossible to verify. The institution
 persists largely in southern Mauritania, where it originated
 in historic conflicts between nomadic Maurs and sedentary
 blacks. The drought has had a tremendous impact on slavery,
 causing many Maurs to release their slaves as, under
 deteriorating economic conditions, they could no longer meet
 the costs of slave-holding. Slavery in Mauritania is not
 identifiable with the chattel servitude of the American
 historical experience. There is no commercial market for
 slaves, and the large class of freed slaves and their
 descendants is regulated by complex social obligations.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Former President Haidalla released a number of political
 prisoners shortly before his ouster. President Taya, in late
 
 
 210
 MAURITANIA
 1984, released and pardoned all remaining political prisoners;
 those whose goods were confiscated at the time of their
 detention had their belongings restored by the Government.
 Although President Taya also invited all exiles to return home
 to Mauritania, only small numbers have done so.
 The Shari'a Islamic Code, as instituted in Mauritania in 1980,
 covers adultery, theft of personal property, and murder. A
 Muslim.judge presides over a jury chosen by the governor of
 the region. The defendant has a right to counsel and can
 -appeal a guilty verdict to the Supreme Islamic Court within 15
 days.. Circumstantial evidence cannot be admitted as proof of
 guilt. Admission of guilt is sometimes obtained in the
 context of a promised reduction in punishment. An inability
 to convince the sitting magistrate that the Government's
 charges are in error is in itself considered by the courts as
 a legal admission of guilt, as is the convincing testimony of
 a firsthand witness or codefendant. All sentences must be
 approved by the President. Opposition to the Shari'a Code has
 been expressed most often by blacks and women, who believe
 that the Shari'a Code favors the Maur way of life and limits
 the role of women. Although a strict interpretation of the
 Shari'a in earlier years produced communal tension, the issue
 has largely passed from public debate due to a more moderate
 government implementation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government interference in private affairs, save in instances
 where treason is suspected, is limited. Reflecting the
 nomadic penchant for privacy and the sanctity of confidences,
 a lack of sophisticated equipment to undertake surveillance,
 and the isolation of various parts of the country from one
 another, the Government limits its surveillance to patrols on
 major highways, occasional nighttime inspections of vehicular
 traffic, and inspection of mail suspected of containing
 currency or prohibited items. Under the Haidalla regime, some
 individuals who were believed not to support the regime were
 interrogated by the security agencies. This practice appears
 to have diminished or ended under the Taya regime.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The freedoms of speech and press are restricted. Mauritania's
 only newspaper,-news agency, and radio/television station are
 government-operated. The Government does not permit criticism
 of its policies or authority, and editorial content of the
 media is controlled. International news magazines and
 newspapers generally circulate freely in Mauritania.
 Shortwave broadcasts and Senegalese television are followed
 openly.
 Association with foreigners and the free expression of
 opinions are not discouraged,-although most Mauritanians are
 careful not to propagate antigovernment opinions. Private
 discussion is lively in family and clan networks which act as
 vehicles for communicating complaints and airing dissent, as
 do the Structures for the Education of the Masses. The
 nomadic tradition also provides for candid expressions of
 concern to the leadership. In practice, the Government
 appears to concern itself largely with activities directly
 
 
 211
 MAURITANIA
 related to the destabilization or overthrow of the military
 Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly has been suspended since 1978 when
 civilian rule was ended by a military coup. The Government
 enforces strictly its prohibition of public meetings
 addressing political themes.
 Labor unions were the only nationwide organizations with any
 political import that were not dissolved following the 1978
 coup. Labor unions are grouped in a national organization
 called the Mauritanian Workers Union (UTM). In 1984, the
 Government arrested the Secretary General of the UTM, as well
 as the Secretary General of the politically active (since
 1981) of the National Student Union, for allegedly possessing
 material indicating active Libyan involvement in their
 activities. The Government then installed an entirely new
 leadership at the Mauritanian Workers Union, and student union
 activities were "frozen." Later in 1984, former President
 Haidalla released these two leaders, who shortly thereafter
 resumed their former positions. In the case of the
 Mauritanian Workers Union, this led to an acrimonious split
 within union ranks which continues to paralyze the
 organization.
 The Mauritanian Workers Union is allowed a large measure of
 freedom in its organizational efforts. The union is
 associated with a number of regional and international labor
 organizations, and its officials are permitted to travel
 abroad to attend international labor meetings. Within the
 confines of Mauritania's basic foreign policies, union
 officials are free to take positions on international labor
 matters. Unions are recognized only when they register with
 the official body and accept an appointed director general.
 Local union officials claim that their membership has reached
 30,000 members. Union membership is not universal; workers
 must pay an annual membership fee of $4.00, but the Government
 indirectly finances most union activities. The right to
 strike exists in theory, but an extended strike would probably
 be strongly opposed by the Government. There have been two
 brief strikes in recent years.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Mauritania and the country's
 official name is the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.
 Virtually all citizens are Muslim. Proselytizing and the
 construction of churches and other non-Islamic houses of
 worship are prohibited without government permission.
 Mauritania's small Roman Catholic community has been granted
 permission in several instances to build churches. A number
 of Catholic churches operate freely. There are no
 restrictions on personal religious expression, but Mauritanian
 Muslims are prohibited from entering non-Islamic houses of
 worship. There is no religious discrimination in employment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movbment within the country,
 although travelers are frequently subjected to routine police
 checks. Temporary curfews have been imposed several times
 
 
 212
 MAURITANIA
 during emergency situations, most recently following the 1984
 .restructuring" of the Military Committee for National
 Salvation. In 1985, the Government ended the requirement that
 Mauritanians must have an exit visa before traveling abroad.
 A few Mauritanian officials have left the country because of
 political opposition to the Government. The Western Sahara
 conflict has led to a small immigration of refugees into
 Nouadhibou and other northern towns, but there are no
 acknowledged political refugees in Mauritania.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The right of citizens to change their government has not
 existed since 1978, when Mauritania's military ended all
 democratic procedures and abolished the country's sole
 political party. At the present time, there are no
 parliamentary bodies, and opposition groups and political
 parties are prohibited.
 The Structure for the Education of the Masses, which was begun
 by the Government in 1982, functions in some respects as a
 party organization, and some observers believe that it may
 eventually evolve into a political party. The Movement has
 emphasized mobilization of manpower for community projects,
 explanation of government policies, and raising public
 awareness of means for combatting drought and its collateral
 effects. In the wake of the 1984 coup, the Government decided
 to give greater attention to leadership of the Structure for
 the Education of the Masses since local leaders were sometimes
 presenting viewpoints different from the official government
 position. On a regional level it is always headed by a member
 of the Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN), but
 local officials tend to be prominent businessmen or tribal
 leaders.
 The black population is represented at all levels of the
 Government but underrepresented in terms of its proportion of
 the population. Many blacks believe that they already
 constitute a majority of the population, and that Maur
 domination in government and religious institutions is a
 result of discrimination. The same situation prevails in the
 key state-owned enterprises and among larger private sector
 firms. The Government insists that a substantial majority of
 the population is Maur and that a sizable segment of the black
 population considers itself to be Maur since its mother tongue
 is Hassaniya Arabic and it shares Maur cultural traditions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to criticism on human rights and
 has been cooperative with the U.N. Human Rights
 Subcommission's working group on slavery, including with the
 Commission's representative during his 1984 visit. There has
 been, however, no official response to the Subcommission's
 report, which was released in 1985. The Government is also
 aware of the continuing Amnesty International concerns over a
 number of human rights issues, but considered that the
 majority of the specific charges were based on
 misinformation. There are no human rights organizations based
 in Mauritania. Amnesty International's 1985 report noted that
 all but three of the prisoners of conscience had been released
 
 
 213
 MAURITANIA
 by the end of 1984, (The others have since been released.)
 Freedom House rates Mauritania "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mauritania's population is estimated at 1.6 million, with an
 annual growth rate of 2 percent. On a per capita basis,
 Mauritania falls within the middle group of developing nations
 (1984 - $480), but this figure conceals wide differences
 between the modern, internationally oriented mining and
 fisheries sectors and the very underdeveloped subsistence
 livestock and agricultural sector in which the majority of the
 population is engaged.
 During recent years, Mauritanian food production has declined
 sharply as a result of the drought; an estimated 15 percent of
 cereal needs and 7 percent of overall food requirements are
 met through local production. In the fall of 1985, rainfall
 was adequate throughout the country for the first time in
 several years, and forecasts for the 1985-86 agricultural
 season call for greatly increased production.  Even if the
 most optimistic predictions are realized, however, Mauritania
 will remain heavily dependent on food aid for the foreseeable
 future. Several years of consistent rains will be needed
 before it is clear whether the enormous ecological damage from
 the drought can be overcome. In the meantime, the
 Government's position is complicated by the need to implement
 an adjustment program in the near term to deal with serious
 fiscal and balance of payments problems, as well as to carry
 out a series of policy and institutional reforms in the medium
 term in an effort to increase productivity. Unemployment is
 estimated in Mauritania at 50 percent. It is probably even
 higher in the urban shantytowns. Many Mauritanian workers go
 abroad for work, but Mauritania also receives substantial
 numbers of workers from the neighboring countries.
 A collateral effect of the drought has been the near
 destruction of traditional nomadic cultures, as hundreds of
 thousands of former desert dwellers came to the cities in
 search of food and assistance. Although this concentration of
 population allowed the Government and donors to distribute
 food relatively easily to much of the endangered population
 and thereby avert a famine, it has also created severe strains
 on the social fabric. Nouakchott, built for 30,000 people,
 now has more than 500,000 inhabitants.
 The Government is able to provide only minimal assistance in
 such basic areas as sanitation, education, employment, health
 care, social services, and economic opportunity. The average
 life span at birth is 47 years and thought to be declining as
 a result of drought-induced malnutrition and disease. Infant
 mortality rates in 1984 were 136 per 1,000 live births. The
 literacy rate is estimated at 17 percent. About 36 percent of
 eligible children attend primary school (46 percent male, 26
 percent female).
 No child may be employed in Mauritania before the age of 14
 without the express permission of the Minister of Labor and
 the National Labor Council. The standard minimum age of
 employment in nonagricultural enterprises is 15 years. The
 Labor Code does not address conditions of employment for
 family members in agriculture or animal husbandry, which is
 largely outside the cash economy. Although there are no
 figures available, the use of child labor (except in the
 
 
 214
 MAURITANIA
 family-owned agricultural sector) is not thought to be
 widespread due to massive unemployment among adult males.
 There is a guaranteed minimum wage, established in 1985 for
 unskilled workers and for agricultural workers and in 1984 for
 skilled workers. Information on actual wage levels is scanty
 and often unreliable.
 The standard nonagricultural workweek in Mauritania is not to
 exceed 40 hours, nor 6 days per week. Enforcement of labor
 laws is the responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate, Ministry
 of Labor. Disputes over labor issues are heard before special
 three-person labor courts which are jointly overseen by the
 Ministries of Justice and Labor. The leadership of the
 National Labor Union indicates that the courts are unbiased
 and effective.
 Although Mauritanian women are legally free to participate
 fully in governmental affairs and private business,
 traditional values and practices limit the scope of
 activities. A number of women have risen to important
 positions in the fields of health and education or hold
 midlevel government positions; however, the number is small
 and the possibilities for advancement are slight.
 Strong racial tensions, present throughout the society, have
 been consistently reflected in the schools. An attempt to
 enforce the use of Arabic in all schools was abandoned due to
 strong opposition by blacks, who traditionally prefer the use
 of French and their tribal tongues. A major shift in
 government policy is being considered that would eventually
 replace French as a medium of instruction and allow students
 to choose between Arabic and one of the three African
 languages spoken in Mauritania.
