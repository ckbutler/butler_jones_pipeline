 BAIRAIN
 Bahrain is a hereditary emirate with few democratic institutions and no political
 parties. The Al-Khalifa extended family has ruled Bahrain since the late 18th cen-
 tury and dominates its society and government. The Constitution confirms the Amir
 as hereditary ruler. The current Amir, Shaikh Isa Bin Sulman Al-Khalifa, governs
 the country with the assistance of a younger brother as Prime Minister, the Amir's
 son as Crown Prince, and an appointed cabinet of ministers. In 1975 the Govern-
 ment suspended some provisions- of the 1973 Constitution, including those articles
 relating to the National Assembly, which was disbanded and never reconstituted.
 Citizens belong to the Shi'a and Sunni sects of Islam, with the Shi'a constituting
 over two-thirds of the indigenous population. The Sunnis predominate because the
 
 
 1633
 
 ruling family is Sunni and is supported by the armed forces, the security service,
 and powerful Sunni and Shi'a merchant families. After a period of relative calm in
 the beginning of the year, Bahrain again experienced incidents of political unrest.
 There are few judicial checks on the actions of the Amir and his Government, and
 the courts are subject to government pressure.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security. It controls the public
 security force (police) and the extensive security service, which are responsible for
 maintaining internal order. The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) is responsible for de-
 fending against external threats. It did not play a role in internal security during
 the year. Security forces committed serious human rights abuses.
 Bahrain has a mixed economy, with government domination of many basic indus-
 tries, including the important oil and aluminum industries. Possessing limited oil
 and gas reserves, the Government is working to diversify the economic base, con-
 centrating on light manufacturing and the service sectors, particularly banking, fi-
 nancial services, and consulting. The Government has used its modest oil revenues
 to build a highly advanced transportation and telecommunications infrastructure.
 Economic growth has slowed as a result of low oil prices, but the economy remains
 stable. Bahrain is a regional financial and business center. Tourism, particularly via
 the causeway linking Bahirain to Saudi Arabia, also is a significant source of income.
 The country's human rights situation improved slightly during the year due again
 to a decrease in the level of political unrest and the easing of civil unrest; however,
 there was no change in the Government's human rights practices, and numerous se-
 rious problems remain. The main problems continue to include the denial of the
 right of citizens to change their government; extrajudicial killngs; torture; arbitrary
 arrest; incommunicado and prolonged detention; involuntary exile; infringement on
 citizens' privacy rights; limitations on or the denial of the right to  fair public trial,
 especially in the security court; infringements on citizens' right to privacy; and re-
 strictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, and worker rights. The
 Government also imposes some limits on freedom of religion and movement. Vio-
 lence against women and discrimination based on sex, religion, and ethnicity remain
 problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. However, there were reports of extrajudicial i gs by members of the se-
 curity forces.
 On July 22, the body of a young Bahraini, Nooh Khalil AlNoo, from a Shi'a vil-
 lage near Manama, was returned to his family. He reportedly was tortured to death
 in police custody (see Sections .c., .d., and 2.b.). There has been no reported gov-
 ernment inquiry into allegations that he died from torture.
 There were no investigations or prosecutions of any security forces personnel for
 alleged extrajudicial killings committed during the year or in previous years.
 Two Asian laborers died in early August when a fire destroyed a store in
 Manama. Credible sources consider it likely that antigovernment arsonists were re-
 sponsible for the attack.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confurmed reports of politically motivated dis-
 appearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are pro-
 hibited by law; however, there e lcredible reports that prisoners often are beaten,
 both on the soles of their feet and about the face and head, burned with cigarettes,
 forced to endure long periods without sleep, and, in some cases, subjected to elec-
 trical shocks. The Government has difficulty in rebutting allegations of torture and
 of other cruel, inhuman, or degrading practices because it permits incommunicado
 detention and detention without trial. There were no known instances of authorities
 being punished for abuses committed against detainees and prisoners either during
 the year or in any previous year.
 Dissidents and human rights groups allege that the security forces sometimes
 threaten female detainees with rape and inflict other forms of sexual abuse and har-
 assment on them while they are in custody. These allegations are difficult either
 to confirm or deny.
 In July police used tear gas to disperse protests stemming from the burial of a
 young Bahrani man who died from mistreatment while in police custody (see Sec-
 tions .a., 1.d., and 2.b.). In October security forces used tear gas to disrupt a pro-
 test on Sitra islnd and arrested demonstrators who were protesting the death of
 
 
 1634
 
 a Shi'a man who allegedly died from injuries he received when police detained and
 tortured him in 1994 (see Sections 1.d. and 2.b.).
 Prisons are overcrowded but generally meet minimum international standards.
 Local defense attorneys report that their clients received improved care and treat-
 ment. In addition, the release of hundreds of detainees from jail, perhaps as many
 as 400, during the year's Murharram (April 28-May 7) plus the reduced number of
 arrests in 1998, helped to ease overcrowding. On December 23, another 209 pris-
 oners and detainees were released by the Amir's traditional National Day decree.
 At the Government's invitation, the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) continued the series of visits to prisons that it started in 1996. -
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are prob-
 lems. The Constitution states that "no person shall be arrested, detained, impris-
 oned, searched, or compelled to reside in a specified place. . . except in accordance
 with the provisions of the law and under the supervision of the judicial authorities."
 However, in matters regarding arrest, detention, or exile, the 1974 State Security
 Act takes precedence in practice. Under the State Security Act, persons may be de-
 tained for up to 3 years without trial for engaging in activities or making state-
 ments regarded as a threat to the broadly defined concepts of national harmony and
 security, and the Government continued arbitrarily to arrest and detain citizens.
 The scope of the State Security Act extends to any case involving arson, explosions,
 or attacks on persons at their place of enployment or because of the nature of their
 work. Detainees have the right to appeal such detentions after a period of 3 months
 and, if the appeal is denied, every 6 months thereafter from the date of the original
 detention.
 Government security forces used the State Security Act regularly during the year
 to detain persons believed to have been engaged in antigovernment activities, as
 well as those who attempted to exercise their rights of free speech, association, or
 other rights deemed to be in opposition to the Government. Activities that also may
 lead to detention, questioning, warning, or arrest by the security forces include:
 Membership in illegal organizations or those deemed subversive, painting
 antigovernment slogans on walls, joining antigovernment demonstrations (see Sec-
 tion 2.b.), possessing or circulating antigovernment writings, preaching sermons con-
 sidered by the Government to have an antigovernment political tone, and harboring
 or associating with persons committing such acts.
 In addition to overseeing the security service and police, the Ministry of Interior
 also controls the Office of the Public Prosecutor, whose officers initially determine
 whether sufficient evidence exists to continue to hold a prisoner in investigative de-
 tention. The Ministry is responsible for all aspects of prison administration. In the
 early stages of detention, prisoners and their attorneys have no recourse to any au-
 thority outside the Ministry of Interior. The authorities rarely permit visits to in-
 mates who are incarcerated for security-related offenses, and such prisoners may be
 held incommunicado for months, sometimes years. However, prisoners detained for
 criminal offenses, generally may receive visits from family members, usually once
 a month.
 Security forces are estimated to have held over 1,300 people in detention for secu-
 rity-related offenses during the year, including some who were arrested, released,
 and then arrested again. The Government pardoned as many as 600 persons de-
 tained in connection with antigovernment activities by year's end. At year's end, as
 many as 800 persons still remained in detention.
 Police rounded up and detained demonstrators in July following protests stem-
 ming from the burial of Nooh Khalil Al-Nooh, a young Bahraini man who died from
 mistreatment while in police custody (see Sections L.a., 1.c., and 2.b.). Abdul Jahil
 Abdula Khadim, the owner of the shop where AI-Nooh had worked, reportedly was
 arrested in connection with the incident that led to Al-Nooh's death and remained
 in detention at year's end. In October police detained up to 20 young men following
 demonstrations against the Government for the death of a Shi'a man who died from
 injuries he allegedly received whei police detained and tortured him in 1994 (see
 Sections l.c. and 2.b.). -
 Abdul Amir Al-Jamri, a prominent Shi'a cleric, longtime opposition activist, and
 one of the original 14 signers of the 1994 petition to the Amir calling for the restora-
 tion of the National Assembly, was arrested in January 1996 and remained in cus-
 tody throughout the year. Although he reportedly was accused by the Government
 of committing a wide variety of security-related crimes, including treason, Al-Jamri
 has not been brought to trial or publicly charged with any crime. Several other Shi'a
 clerics associated with Al-Jamri, including Abdul Wahab Hussein, Hassan
 Mushaimaa, Hassan Sultan, All Bin Ahmed Al-Jedhafsi, and Haji Hassan Jarallah,
 also were arrested at the same time as Al-Jamri and remain in jail. One of the cler-
 
 
 1635
 ics detained, Ali Mirza AI-Nachas, died in detention in June 1997. The Government
 announced that he died of natural causes.
 While the authorities reserve the right to use exile and the revocation of citizen-
 ship to punish individuals convicted or even suspected of antigovernment activity,
 there were no reports of exile orders issued during the year. In the past, the Gov-
 ernment has revoked the citizenship of persons it considered security threats. The
 Government considers such persons to have forfeited their nationality under the
 Citizenship Act of 1963 because they accepted foreign citizenship or passports, or
 engaged in antigovernment activities abroad. Bahraini emigre groups and their local
 contacts have challenged this practice, arguing that the Government's revocation of
 citizenship without due process violates the Constitution. According to the emigre
 groups, as many as 500 citizens continue to live in exile. This total includes both
 those prohibited from returning to Bahrain and their family members who volun-
 tarily live abroad with them.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the courts are subject to government pressure regarding sentencing
 and appeals.
 The civil and criminal legal systems consist of a complex mix of courts, based on
 diverse legal sources including Sunni and Shi'a Shari'a (Islamic law), tribal law, and
 other civil codes and regulations. The 1974 State Security Act created a separate,
 closed security court system that has jurisdiction in cases of alleged antigovernment
 activity.
 The Bahrain Defense Force maintains a separate court system for military per-
 sonnel accused of offenses under the Military Code of Justice. Military courts do not
 review cases involving civilian, criminal, or security offenses.
 Defense attorneys are appointed by the Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs.
 Some attorneys and family members involved in politically sensitive criminal cases
 complain that the Government interferes with court proceedings to influence the
 outcome or to prevent judgments from being carried out. There are periodic allega-
 tions of corruption in the judicial system.
 In past cases, the Amir, the Prime Minister, and other senior Government officials
 all have lost civil cases brought against them by private citizens. However, the
 court-ordered judgments, are not always implemented expeditiously. Members of the
 ruling  1         family are well represented in the judiciary and generally do not
 excuse themselves from cases involving the interests of the Government.
 A person arrested may be tried in an ordinary criminal court or, if recommended
 by the prosecution, in the Security Court. Ordinary civil or criminal trial procedures
 provide for an open trial, the right to counsel (with legal aid available when nec-
 essary), and the right to appeal. Criminal court proceedings enerally do not appear
 to discriminate against women, children, or minority groups. H~owever, there is cred-
 ible evidence that persons accused of antigovernment crimes and tried in the crimi-
 nal courts were denied fair trials. The accused are not permitted to speak with an
 attorney until their appearance before the judge at the preliminary hearing. Trials
 in the criminal courts for antigovernment activities are held in secret.
 Security cases are tried in secret by judges on the Supreme Court of Appeals, sit-
 ting as the Security Court. Family members usually are not permitted in the court
 until the final verdict is rendered. Procedures in the security courts do not provide
 for even the most basic safeguards. The Security Court is exempt from adhering to
 the procedural protections of the Penal Code. Defendants may be represented by
 counsel but seldom see their attorneys before the actual day of arraignment. Convic-
 tions may be based solely on confessions and police evidence or on testimony that
 may be introduced in secret. The defense cannot review the evidence against the de-
 fendant prior to trial proceedings. Defense lawyers assert that they rarely are given
 sufficient time to produce witnesses. There is no right to judicial review of the legal-
 ity of arrests. There is no judicial appeal of a State Security Court verdict, but the
 defendant may request clemency from the Amir. The Security Court heard no cases
 during the year.
 The number of political prisoners is difficult to determine because the Govern-
 ment does not release data on security cases, such cases are not tried in open court,
 and visits to prisoners convicted of security offenses are restricted strictly. The Gov-
 ernment denies that there are any political prisoners, and claims that all inmates
 incarcerated for committing security offenses were convicted properly of subversive
 acts such as espionage, espousing or committing violence, or belonging to terrorist
 organizations.
 In accordance with tradition, the Government releases and grants amnesty to
 some prisoners, including individuals imprisoned for political activities, on major
 holidays. The Government pardoned over 400 prisoners in April and May during
 Murharram and 209 in December during the National Day celebrations.
 
 
 1636
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the State Security Law, the Ministry of Interior may authorize entry into private
 premises without specific judicial authority. Telephone calls and correspondence are
 subject to monitoring. Police informer networks are extensive and sophisticated.
 During the year, the Government infringed on citizens' right to privacy, using ille-
 gal searches and arbitrary arrests as tactics to control politica unrest, although
 there were fewer reports of violation of citizens' rights to privacy than in recent
 years. There were reports that security forces frequently raided villages at night,
 entered private homes without warrants, and took into custody residents who were
 suspected   of  either  participating  in, or   having  information   regarding,
 antigovernment activities. While conducting these raids, security forces frequently
 confiscated, damaged, or destroyed personal property, for which owners were not
 compensated by the Government. Security forces also frequently set up checkpoints
 at the entrances to villages, requiring vehicle searches and proof of identity from
 anyone seeking to enter or exit. Whenever possible the Government jams, either in
 whole or in part, foreign broadcasts that carry antigovernment programming or
 commentary. A government-controlled proxy prohibits user access to Internet sites
 considered to be antigovernment or anti-Islamic (see Section 2.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for the right
 "to express and propagate opinions," citizens are not in practice free to express their
 public opposition to the Government in speech or writing. Press criticism of ruling
 amily personalities and of government policy regarding certain sensitive subjects-
 such as sectarian unrest and the dispute with Qatar over the Hawar Islands-are
 strictly prohibited. However, local press coverage and commentary on international
 issues is open, and discussion of local-economic and commercial issues also is rel-
 atively unrestricted. Many individuals express critical opinions openly on domestic
 political and social issues in private settings but do not do so to leading government
 officials or in public forums.
 The Information Ministry exercises extensive control over all local media. News-
 papers are privately owned, but they routinely exercise self-censorship of stories on
 sensitive topics. The Government does not condone unfavorable coverage of its do-
 mestic policies by the international media and occasionally has revoked the press
 credentials of offending journalists. Since the Ministry controls foreign journalists'
 residence permits, unfavorable coverage may lead to deportation. However, there
 were no reports of the Government revoking press credentials during the year. The
 Government generally afforded foreign journalists access to the country and did not
 limit their contacts.
 The State owns and operates all radio and television stations. Radio and tele-
 vision broadcasts in Arabic and Farsi from neighboring countries and Egypt can be
 received without interference. However, international news services, including the
 Associated Press, United Press International, and Agence France Presse, frequently
 complain about press restrictions. The Cable News Network is available on a 24-
 hour basis by subscription, and the British Broadcasting Corporation world news
 service is carried on a local channel, 24 hours a day free of charge. However, the
 Government generally jams, wholly or partially, foreign broadcasts that carry
 antigovernment programming or commentary (see Section l.f.).
 Most senior government officials, ruling family members, and major hotels use
 satellite dishes to receive international broadcasts, as do well-to-do private, citizens.
 Access to satellite dishes and the importation or installation of dishes no longer re-
 quire prior government approval (see Section 3).
 Access to the Internet is provided through the National Telephone Company
 (BATELCO). A government-controlled proxy prohibits user access to sites considered
 to be antigovernment or anti-Islamic; e-mail access to information is unimpeded, al-
 though it may be subject to monitoring (see Section l.f.).
 Although there are no formal regulations limiting academic freedom, in practice
 academics try to avoid contentious political issues. University hiring and admissions
 policies appear to favor Sunnis and others who are assumed to be supportive of the
 Government, rather than focus on professional experience and academic qualifica-
 tions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Despite the Constitution's pro-
 vision for the right of free assembly, the Government prohibits all public political
 demonstrations and meetings and controls religious gatherings that may take on po-
 litical overtones. Permits are required for most other public gatherings, and permis-
 sion is not granted routinely. Unauthorized public gatherings of more than 5 per-
 sons are prohibited by law. The Government monitors gatherings that might take
 on a political tone and frequently disperses such meetings.
 
 
 1637
 In July security forces used force to disperse a gathering during which protesters
 denounced police brutality in the death of a young Bahraini man (see Sections L.a.,
 1.c., and 1.d.). After the incident, suspected leaders and some active participants
 were arrested. In October police detained up to 20 young men following demonstra-
 tions against the Government for the death of a Shi'a man who died from injuries
 he alleyedly received when police detained and tortured him in 1994 (see Sections
 l.c. and l.d.).
 The Constitution provides for the right of free association; however, the Govern-
 ment this right. The Government prohibits political parties and organizations. Some
 professional societies and social/sports clubs traditionally have served as forums for
 discreet political discussion, but they are restricted by law from engaging in political
 activity. Only the Bahraini Bar Association is exempt from the regulations that re-
 quire that the constitutions of all associations include a commitment to refrain from
 political activity. The Bar Association successfully argued that a lawyer's profes-
 sional duties may require certain political actions, such as interpreting legislation
 or participating in a politically sensitive trial. However, in January after the Bar
 Association sponsored a lecture in which prodemocracy speakers publicly attacked
 the Government, the Government told current board members that they would not
 be allowed to stand for reelection. Other organized discussions and meetings still
 are discouraged actively.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion, and the population is over-
 whelmingly Muslim. However, Christians and other non-Muslims, including Jews,
 Hindus, and Baha'is are free to practice their religion, maintain their own places
 of worship, and display the symbols of their religion. Bibles and other Christian
 publications are displayed and sold openly in local bookstores that also sell Islamic
 and other religious literature. Some small groups worship in their homes. Notable
 dignitaries from virtually every religion and denomination visit the country and fre-
 quently meet with government and civic leaders. Religious tracts of all Islamic sects,
 cassettes of sermons delivered by Muslim preachers from other countries, and publi-
 cations of other religions are readily available.
 Proselytizing by non-Muslims is discouraged, anti-Islamic writings are prohibited,
 and conversions from Islam to other religions, while not illegal, are not tolerated
 well by society.
 Both Sunni and Shi'a are subject to governmental control and monitoring. During
 the year, the Government closed a few mosques and ma'tams (Shi'a community cen-
 ters) in certain locations to prevent religious leaders from delivering political
 speeches during their Friday prayers and sermons. The High Council for Islamic Af-
 fairs is charged with the review and approval of all clerical appointments within
 both the Sunni and Shi'a communities, and maintains program oversight for all citi-
 zens studying religion abroad. Public religious events, most notably the large annual
 commemorative marches by Shi'a, are permitted but are closely watched by the po-
 lice. There are no restrictions on the number of citizens permitted to make pilgrim-
 ages to Shi'a shrines and holy sites in Iran, Iraq, and Syria. However, stateless resi-
 dents of Bahrain who do not possess Bahraini passports often have difficulties ar-
 ranging travel to religious sites abroad. The Government monitors travel to Iran
 and scrutinizes carefully those who choose to pursue religious study there.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to move within the country and change their place of
 residence or work. However, passports may be denied on political grounds. Approxi-
 mately 3 percent of the indigenous population, the "bidoon," or stateless persons,
 mostly Persian-origin Shi'a, do not have passports and cannot obtain them readily,
 although they may be given travel documents as Bahraini residents (see Section 5).
 The Government occasionally grants citizenship to resident non-Bahrainis who are
 Sunni Muslims, mostly from the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt.
 Citizens living abroad who are suspected of political or criminal offenses may face
 arrest and trial upon return to Bahrain. Under the 1963 Citizenship Law, the Gov-
 ernment may reject applications to obtain or renew passports for reasonable cause,
 but the applicant has the right to appeal such decisions before the High Civil Court.
 The Government also has issued temporary passports, good for one trip a year, to
 individuals whose travel it wishes to control or whose claim to Bahraini nationality
 is questionable. Noncitizen residents, including bidoon of Iranian origin, also may
 obtain Bahraini laissez passers (travel documents), usually valid for 2 years and re-
 newable at Bahraini embassies overseas. Laissez passer holders also require visas
 to reenter Bahrain.
 Bahrain does not usually accept refugees due to its small size and limited re-
 sources. However, in practice refugees who arrive in Bahrain are not repatriated to
 countries from which they have fled. Many Iranian emigres who fled Iran after the
 Iranian Revolution have been granted permission to remain in Bahrain, but they
 
 
 1638
 have not been granted citizenship. Although the Government cooperates with the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the maximum extent possible,
 it has not formulated a formal policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right or ability peacefully to change their government
 or their political system, and political activity is controlled by the Government.
 Since the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1975, there have been no formal
 democratic political institutions. The Prime Minister makes all appointments to the
 Cabinet. All other government positions are filled by the relevant ministries. About
 one-third of the cabinet ministers are Shi'a Muslim, although they may not hold se-
 curity-related offices. The Government views all dissent as terrorism, rejects sub-
 stantive reform as a threat to regime stability, and has taken only halting steps to
 expand political participation. The ordinary citizen may attempt to influence govern-
 ment decisions through submission of personal written petitions and informal con-
 tact with senior officials, including appeals to the Amir, the Prime Minister, and
 other officials at their regularly scheduled public audiences, called majlises.
 In 1992 the Amir established by decree a Consultative Council (Majlis Al-Shura).
 Its 40 members are divided evenly between Sunni and Shi'a and are appointed by
 the Amir. They are selected to represent major constituent groups, including rep-
 resentatives from the business, labor, professional, and religious communities. There
 are no-members of the ruling Al-Khalifa family or religious extremists in the Majlis.
 In addition to legislation submitted for its review by the Cabinet, the Majlis may
 initiate debate independently on nonpolitical issues. The Majlis also may summon
 cabinet ministers to answer questions, but its recommendations are not binding on
 the Government- The Majlis held its sixth session from October 1997 to May and
 began a new session on October 6.
 During the year, the Majlis debated a number of contentious social and economic
 issues, including unemployment, privatization, and provision of social services, and
 drafted proposals on these and other issues for government consideration. According
 to the Speaker of the Majls, the Government responded favorably to the majority
 of the Majlis' recommendations by incorporating them into legislation or by taking
 other appropriate actions. During its sixth session, the Majlis debated and approved
 a law permitting the private importation and installation of satellite dishes.
 There are no women in the Majlis or at the ministerial levels of government. The
 majority of women who choose to work in government do so ina support capacity,
 and only a few have attained senior positions within their respective ministries or
 agencies.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights organizations. Because of the restrictions on free-
 dom of association and expression, any independent, domestically based investiga-
 tion or public criticism of the Government's human rights policies faces major obsta-
 cles. Several political opposition movements in exile also report on human rights in-
 vestigations. These include the Damascus-based Committee for the Defense of
 Human Rights in Bahrain, the London-based Bahrain Freedom Movement, the Bei-
 r-based Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, and the Copenhagen-based
 Bahrain Human Rights Organization, formerly the Committee for the Defense of Po-
 litical Prisoners in Bahrain. These groups are composed of small numbers of
 emigres living in self-imposed exile and reportedly receive funding from sources hos-
 tile to the Government.
 The Government malntains that it is not opposed to visits by bona fide human
 rights organizations. However, in practice international human rights organizations
 have found it difficult to conduct activities in the country. In October 1996, the Gov-
 ernment invited the ICRC to undertake visits to the country's prisons. The visits
 continued throughout 1998 and, while the ICRC has maintained its usual standards
 of confidentiality regarding its findings, credible reports indicate that conditions
 throughout the penal system have improved.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "liberty, equality, security, tranquillity, education, so-
 cial solidarity, and equal opportunities for citizens shall be pillars" of society assured
 by the State." It further states that every citizen shall have the right to medical
 care, welfare, education, property, capital, and work. However, in practice these
 rights are protected unevenly, depending on an individual's social status, ethnicity,
 or sex.
 
 
 1639
 
 Women.-Violence against women occurs, but incidents are usually kept within
 the family. In general there is little public attention to, or discussion of, the prob-
 lem. However, during the year a few articles appeared for the first time in the local
 press discussing violence against women and the need for laws to defend women
 who are abused. No government policies explicitly address violence against women.
 Women's groups and health care professionals state that spousal abuse is common,
 particularly in poorer communities. There are very few known instances of women
 seeking legal redress for violence. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the courts are
 not receptive to such cases.
 It is not uncommon for foreign women working as domestic workers to be beaten
 or sexually abused. Numerous cases have been reported to local embassies and the
 police. However, most victims are too intimidated to sue their employers. Courts re-
 gortedly have allowed victims who do appear to sue for damages, return home, or
 oth.
 Shari'a governs the legal rights of women. Specific rights vary according to Shi'a
 or Sunni interpretations of Islamic law, and are determined by the individual's
 faith, or by the court in which various contracts, including marriage, have been
 made.
 While both Shi'a and Sunni women have the right to initiate a divorce, religious
 courts may refuse the request. Although local religious courts may grant a divorce
 to Shi'a women in routine cases, occasionally Shi'a women seeking divorce under un-
 usual circumstances must travel abroad to seek a higher ranking opinion than that
 available in the country. Women of either sect may own and inherit property and
 may represent themselves in all public and legal matters. In the absence bf a direct
 male heir, Shi'a women may inherit all property whereas Sunni women inherit only
 a portion, the balance divided among brothers, uncles, and male cousins of the de-
 ceased.
 In divorce cases, the courts routinely grant Shi'a and Sunni women custody of
 daughters under age 9 and sons under age 7, although custody usually reverts to
 the father once the children reach those ages. In all circumstances except mental
 incapacitation, the father, regardless of custody, retains the right to make certain
 legal decisions for his children, such as guardianship of any property belonging to
 the child, until the child reaches legal age. A noncitizen woman automatically loses
 custody of her children if she divorces their citizen father.
 Women may obtain passports and leave the country without the permission of the
 male head of the household. Women are free to work outside the home, to drive cars
 without escorts, and to wear the clothing of their choice. Women also increasingly
 have taken jobs previously reserved for men. The Labor Law does not discriminate
 against women; however, in practice there is discrimination in the workplace, in-
 cluding inequality of wages and denial of opportunity for advancement. Women con-
 stitute over 20 percent of the work force. The Government has encouraged the hir-
 ing of women by enacting special laws to promote female entry into the work force,
 and is itself a leading employer of women. The Labor Law does not recognize the
 concept of equal pay for equal work, and women frequently are paid less than men.
 Generally, women work outside the home during the years between secondary
 school or university and marriage. Some women complain that admissions policies
 at the National University are aimed at increasing the number of male students at
 the expense of qualified female, applicants, especially Shi'a women. Nevertheless,
 women make up the majority of students at the country's universities. .
 There are women's organizations that seek to improve the status of women under
 both civil and Islamic law. Some women have expressed the view that, despite their
 participation in the work force, women's rights are not significantly advancing and
 that much of the lack of progress is due to the influence of Islamic religious tradi-
 tionalists. However, other women, desire a return to more traditional values and
 support calls for a return to traditional Islamic patterns of social behavior.
 Children.-The Government often has stated its commitment to the protection of
 children's rights and welfare within the social and religious framework of this tradi-
 tional society. It honors this commitment through enforcement of its civil and crimi-
 nal laws and maintains an extensive social welfare network. Public education for
 children below the age of 15 is free. While the Constitution calls for compulsory edu-
 cation at the primary levels, authorities do not enforce attendance. Limited medical
 services for infants and preadolescents are provided free of charge.
 The social status of children is shaped by tradition and religion to a greater ex-
 tent than by civil law. Public discussion of child abuse is rare, and the preference
 of the authorities always has been to leave such matters within the purview of the
 family or religious groups. The authorities actively enforce the laws against pros-
 titution, including child prostitution, procuring, and pimping. Violators are dealt
 with harshly and can be imprisoned, or, if a noncitizen, deported. In some cases,
 
 
 1640
 authorities reportedly will return children arrested for prostitution and other non-
 political crimes to their families rather than prosecute them, especially for first of-
 fenses. Some legal experts have called on the Government to establish a separate
 juvenile court. However, other citizens insist that the protection of children is a reli-
 gious, not a secular, function and oppose greater government involvement. Inde-
 pendent and quasi-governmental organizations such as the Bahraini Society for the
 Protection of Children and the Mother and Child Welfare Society play an active part
 in protecting children by providing counseling, legal assistance, advice, and, in some
 cases, shelter and financial support to distressed children and families.
 There were numerous arrests and detentions of juveniles during the year in con-
 nection with the political unrest. These children generally were released without
 charges within several days of their arrests. However, those juveniles charged with
 security offenses received the same treatment as adult prisoners, i.e., incommuni-
 cado detention and trial before a State Security Court.
 People With Disabilities.-The law protects the rights of people with disabilities
 and a variety of governmental, quasi-governmental, and religious institutions are
 mandated to support and protect disabled persons. The regional (Arabian Gulf) Cen-
 ter for the Treatment of the Blind is headquartered in Bahrain, and a similar Cen-
 ter for the Education of Deaf Children was established in 1994. Society tends to
 view people with disabilities as special cases in need of protection rather than as
 fully functioning members of society. Nonetheless, the Government is required by
 law to provide vocational training for disabled persons who wish to work and main-
 tains a list of certified, trained disabled persons. The Labor Law of- 1976 also re-
 quires that any employer of over 100 people must hire at least 2 percent of its em-
 ployees from the Government's list of disabled workers. The Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs works actively to place people with disabilities in public sector jobs,
 such as in the public telephone exchanges. The Government's housing regulations
 require that access be provided to disabled persons. Greater emphasis has been
 given in recent-years to public building design that incorporates access for the dis-
 abled. However, the law does not mandate access to buildings for persons with dis-
 abilities.
 Religious Minorities.-Although there are notable exceptions, the Sunni Muslim
 minority enjoys a favored status. Sunnis receive preference for employment in sen-
 sitive government positions and in the managerial ranks of the civil service. Shi'a
 citizens are not allowed to hold significant posts in the defense and internal security
 forces. In the private sector, Shi'a tend to be employed in lower paid, less skilled
 jobs.
 Educational, social, and municipal services in most Shi'a neighborhoods, particu-
 larly in rural villages, are inferior to those found in Sunni urban communities. In
 an effort to remedy social discrimination, the Government has built numerous sub-
 sidized housing complexes, which are open to all citizens on the basis of financial
 need. In order to ease both the housing shortage and strains on the national budget,
 in 1997 the Government revised its policy in order to permit lending institutions to
 finance mortgages on apartment units.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-A group of approximately 9,000 to 15,000
 persons, mostly Shi'a of Persian origin, but including some Christians, are stateless.
 The bidoon enjoy less than full citizenship under the Citizenship Act of 1963. Many
 are second- or third-generation residents whose ancestors emigrated from Iran. Al-
 though they no longer claim Iranian citizenship, they have not been granted Bah-
 raini citizenship. Without citizenship these individuals officially are unable to buy
 land, start a business, or obtain government loans, although in practice many do.
 The law does not address the citizenship rights of persons who were not registered
 with the authorities prior to 1959, creating a legal problem for such persons and
 their descendants and resulting in economic and other hardships. The Government
 maintains that many of those who claim to be bidoon are actually citizens of Iran
 or other Gulf states who voluntarily have chosen not to renew their foreign pass-
 ports. Bidoon and citizens who speak Farsi, rather than Arabic, as their first lan-
 guage, also face significant social and economic obstacles, including difficulty finding
 employment.
 Section 6. Worker-Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The partially suspended 1973 Constitution recog-
 nizes the right of workers to organize, but internationally affiliated trade unions do
 not exist. The Constitution provides for "freedom to form associations and trade
 unions on national bases and for lawful objectives and by peaceful means," in ac-
 cordance with the law, and states that "no person shall be compelled to join or re-
 main in any association or union."
 
 
 1641
 In response to labor unrest in the mid-1950's, 1965, and 1974, the Government
 passed a series of labor regulations that allow the formation of elected workers' com-
 mittees in larger companies. Worker representation is based on a system of Joint
 Labor-Management Committees (JLC's) established by ministerial decree. Between
 1981 and 1984, 12 JLC's were established in the major state-owned industries. Four
 new JLC's were established in 1994 in the private sector, including one in a major
 hotel. In September three more JLC's were created, bringing the total to 19.
 The JLC's are composed of equal numbers of appointed management representa-
 tives and worker representatives elected by company employees. Each committee is
 chaired alternately by the management and worker representative. The selection of
 worker representatives appears to be fair. Under the law, the Ministry of Interior
 may exclude worker candidates with criminal records or those deemed a threat to
 national security.
 The elected labor representatives of the JLC's select the 11 members of the Gen-
 eral Committee of Bahrain Workers (GCBW), established in 1983 by law, which
 oversees and coordinates the work of the JLC's. The Committee also hears com-
 plaints from Bahraini and foreign workers and assists them in bringing their com-
 plaints to the attention of the Ministry of Labor or the courts. In March elections
 were held for 3-year terms for representatives to the GCBW. Workers from a variety
 of occupations were elected to the body, including Sunni and Shi'a Muslims, foreign
 workers, and one woman. These elections, which were held by secret ballot, ap-
 peared to be free and fair.
 Although the Government and company management are not represented on the
 GCBW, the Ministry of Labor closely monitors the body's activities. It approves the
 GCBW's rules and the distribution of GCBW funds. The JLC-GCBW system rep-
 resents nearly 70 percent of the island's indigenous industrial workers, although
 both Government and labor representatives readily admit that nonindustrial work-
 ers and foreign workers clearly are underrepresented in the system. The Ministry
 of Labor and Social Affairs supports the formation of JLC's in all public and private
 sector companies that employ more than 200 workers.
 Although foreign workers constitute 67 percent of the work force, they are under-
 represented in the GCBW. Foreign workers can and do participate in the JLC elec-
 tions, and five foreign workers currently serve on JLC's. However, none sits on the
 board of the GCBW. It is a long-term goal of both the Government and the GCBW
 to replace foreign workers with citizens throughout all sectors of the economy and
 to create new jobs for citizens seeking employment.
 The Labor Law is silent on the right to strike, and there were no strikes during
 the year. Actions perceived to be detrimental to the "existing relationship" between
 employers and employees or to the economic health of the State are forbidden by
 the 1974 Security Act. There are no recent examples of major strikes, but walkouts
 and other job actions have been known to occur without governmental intervention
 and with positive results for the workers.
 The GCBW represents workers in the Arab Labor Organization but does not be-
 long to any international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-As in the case of strikes, the
 Labor Law neither grants nor denies workers the right to organize and bargain col-
 lectively outside the JLC system. While the JLC's are empowered to discuss labor
 disputes, organize workers' services, and discuss wages, working conditions, and
 productivity, workers have no independent, recognized vehicle for representing their
 interests on these or other labor-related issues. Minimum wage rates for public sec-
 tor employees are established by government decrees. Private businesses generally
 follow the Governments lead in establishing their wage rates.
 There are two export processing zones. Labor law and practice are the same in
 these zones as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced orcompulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law. In practice, the labor laws apply for the most part only to citizens;
 however, abuses occur, particularly of domestic workers and those working illegally.
 In some cases, workers arrive in Bahrain under the sponsorship of an employer and
 then switch jobs, while continuing to pay a fee to their original sponsor. The Gov-
 ernment has announced its intention to abolish this illegal practice, which makes
 it difficult to monitor and control the employment conditions of domestic and other
 workers. However, no substantive action had yet been taken by year's end.
 Labor Law amendments passed in 1993 stiffened the penalties for job switching
 to include jail sentences of up to 6 months for the sponsor of every illegally spon-
 sored worker. In such cases, the workers involved are likely to be deported as illegal
 immigrants after the case is concluded. During the summer and fall, the Govern-
 ment conducted an amnesty program under which undocumented foreign workers
 
 
 1642
 were permitted either to legalize their status or leave the country without penalty.
 As many as 38,000 workers opted to participate in the amnesty program.
 The sponsorship system leads to other abuses as well. There are numerous reports
 that employers withhold salaries from their foreign workers for months, even years,
 at a time, and may refuse to grant them the necessary permission to leave the coun-
 try. The Government and the courts generally work to rectify those abuses brought
 to their attention, but the fear of deportation or employer retaliation prevents many
 foreign workers from making complaints to the authorities.
 Labor laws do not-apply to domestic servants. There are credible reports that do-
 mestic servants, especially women, sometimes are forced to work 12- to 16-hour
 days, given little time off, and are subjected to verbal and physical abuse.
 The law also prohibits force and-bonded child labor, and the Government enforces
 this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment is 14 years of age. Juveniles between the ages of 14 and
 16 may not be employed in hazardous conditions or at night and may not work more
 than 6 hours per day or on a piecemeal basis. Child labor laws are effectively en-
 forced by Ministry of Labor inspectors in the industrial sector; child labor outside
 that sector is less well monitored but is not believed to be significant outside family
 operated businesses, although some children work in the market areas as car wash-
 ers and porters. The law prohibits forced and bonded child labor, and the Govern-
 ment enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.). While the Constitution
 calls for compulsory education at the primary levels, authorities do not enforce at-
 tendance (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wage scales, set by government de-
 cree, exist for public sector employees and generally afford a decent standard of liv-
 ing for workers and their families. The minimum wage for the public sector is
 $278.25 (105 dinars) per month. Wages in the private sector are determined on a
 contract basis. For foreign workers, employers consider benefits such as annual trips
 home, an& housing and education bonuses as part of the salary.
 The Labor Law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, mandates
 acceptable conditions of work for all adult workers, including adequate standards
 regarding hours of work (maximum 48 hours per week) and occupational safety and
 health. The Ministry enforces the law with periodic inspections and fines routinely
 imposed on violators. The press often performs an ombudsman function on labor
 problems, reporting job disputes and the results of labor cases brought before the
 courts. Once a complaint has been lodged by a worker, the Ministry of Labor opens
 an investigation and often takes remedial action. The Fourth High Court has juris-
 diction over cases involving alleged violations of the Labor Law.
 Complaints brought before the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs that cannot
 be settled through arbitration must, by law, be referred to the court within 15 days.
 In practice most employers prefer to settle such disputes through arbitration, par-
 ticularly since the court and labor law generally are considered to favor the em-
 ployee.
 The Labor Law specifically favors citizens over foreign workers, and Arab foreign-
 ers over other foreign workers, in hiring and firing. Because employers include
 housing and other allowances in their salary scales, foreign workers legally can be
 paid lower regular wages than their citizen counterparts, although they sometimes
 receive the same or a greater total compensation package because of home leave and
 holiday allowances. Western foreign workers and citizen workers are paid com-
 parable wages, with total compensation packages often significantly greater for the
 former. Women are entitled to 60 days of paid maternity leave and nursing periods
 during the day. However, women generally are paid less than men.
 In 1993 the Government strengthened the Labor Law, by decree of the Amir, an-
 nouncing that significant fines and jail sentences would be imposed upon private-
 sector employers who fail to pay legal wages. This law applies equally to employers
 of citizens and foreign workers and is intended to reduce abuses against foreign
 workers who sometimes have been denied legal salaries (see Section 6.c.). The law
 provides equal protection to citizen and foreign workers, but all foreign workers still
 require sponsorship by citizens or locally-based institutions and companies. Accord-
 ing to representatives of several embassies with large numbers of workers in the
 country, the Government generally is responsive to embassy requests to investigate
 foreign guest worker complaints about unpaid wages and mistreatment. However,
 foreign workers, particularly those from developing countries, often are unwilling to
 report abuses for fear of losing residence rights and having to return to their native
 countries. -Sponsors are able to cancel the residence permit of any person under
 their sponsorship and thereby block them for 1 year from obtaining entry or resi-
 
 
 .1643
 dence visas from another sponsor, although the sponsor may be subject to sanctions
 for wrongful dismissal.
 Under the labor law, workers have the right to remove themselves from dan-
 gerous work situations without jeopardizing their continued employment.
