 ITALY
 Italy is a longstanding, multiparty parliamentary democracy. Executive authority
 is vested in the Council of Ministers, headed by the President of the Council (the
 Prime Minister). The Head of State (the President of the Republic) nominates the
 Prime Minister after consulting with leaders of all political forces in Parliament.
 Parliament was elected in free and democratic elections in April 1996. The judiciary
 is independent, but critics complain that some judges are politicized.
 The armed forces are under the control of the government and Parliament. Four
 separate police forces report to different ministerial or local authorities. Under ex-
 ceptional circumstances, the government may call on the army to provide security.
 The army supports the police in general guard duties in the region of Sicily and in
 the province of Naples, both areas with high levels of organized crime, thus freeing
 the police for investigative and related activities. There were a number of credible
 reports that some members of the security forces committed abuses.
 Italy has an advanced, industrialized market economy, and the standard of living
 is high. Small and midsized companies employ some 70 to 80 percent of the work
 force. Major products include machinery, textiles, apparel, transportation equip-
 ment, and food and agricultural products. The government owns a substantial num-
 ber of enterprises in finance, communications, industry, transportation, and serv-
 ices, but privatization is moving forward at a measured pace.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. The law and
 the judiciary generally provide effective means of dealing with instances of individ-
 ual abuse. However, there were problems in some areas. There continued to be re-
 ports of police abuse of detainees. Prisons are overcrowded, and the pace of justice
 remains slow. Societal discrimination against women, abuse of children, and dis-
 crimination and sporadic violence against immigrants and other foreigners are prob-
 lems. The Government is taking steps to combat violence against women. There
 were some reports of child labor in the underground economy.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kidling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 The case against two Turin police officers tried on manslaughter charges for alleg-
 edly beating a suspect to death after his arrest in 1993 came to an end in December
 1996, when the Turin Appeals Court upheld a lower court decision absolving the of-
 ficers.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punrshment.-
 The law prohibits torture and cruel or degrading punishment. However, there have
 been some reports of abuse by police. Amnesty International (AD, the United Na-
 tions Human -Rights Commission (UNHRC), the United Nations (U.N.) Committee
 Against Torture, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture, and the Council of Eu-
 rope's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) reported instances in which
 police abused detainees, commonly at the time of arrest or during the first 24 hours
 in custody, before detainees saw an attorney or a judicial authority. Examples of
 mistreatment include insults, particularly those aimed at aliens or Roma, kicking,
 punching, beatings with batons, or deprivation of food. A high proportion of these
 cases involve non-European Union immiants (mostly Africans), Roma, and persons
 held in connection with drug-related offenses. The U.N. Committee, the UNHRC,
 the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture, and Caritas expressed concern over apos-
 sible trend towards racism. Amnesty International (AI), the UNHRC and the U.N.
 Committee noted that, although authorities routinely investigate complaints of mis-
 treatment in detention, some of the investigations lack thoroughness. The U.N.
 Committee and the UNHRC also questioned whether appropriate sanctions were
 imposed on those found guilty. Italy has ratified all of the principal international
 instruments prohibiting torture and cruel, inhuman, or degradingtreatment or pun-
 ishment, but the CPT and the UNHRC recommended that the authorities take more
 effective steps to safeguard detainees and inmates from treatment. The CPT's first
 visit to Italian prisons was in 1992. Further visits took place in 1995 and 1996, but
 only the report on the 1995 visit was available by the end of the year. In the report,
 the CPT called on the Government to provide more f'ormal training for prison
 guards, highlighting the rights of detainees, and for improvements in the investiga-
 tion of complaints by prisoners. Al reported several specific instances of mistreat-
 ment by law enforcement and prison officers. One involved the alleged beating and
 verbal abuse of the driver of a car by police officers acting as bodyguards for a judge
 in Sicily. The driver filed a complaint against the police, but a prosecutor, after re-
 viewing the case, recommended that charges not be filed against the police. This
 recommendation is under review. In 1996 AI reported that an Italian citizen of Ni-
 gerian origin filed a complaint with the courts claiming that she had been beaten
 y two police officers, who had asked her for her identity documents. Court hearings
 into this complaint are underway. The case of the Ghanian citizen resident in Den-
 mark who reportedly was beaten by police at the Rome airport in 1995 was referred
 to the Rome prosecutor's office. There is no information regarding an investigation.
 In June the press published reports of alleged episodes of torture of Somalis, in-
 cluding sexual abuse, the use of electrical shocks, and beatings, by Italian para-
 troopers during the international peacekeeping efforts in Somalia in 1993. The Gov-
 ernment launched investigations into the charges by both military and judicial au-
 thorities. Some of these investigations are still underway; some found wrongdoing
 but not of an institutional nature. Two generals temporarily resigned. A number of
 officers and men were disciplined, and investigations that could lead to charges
 against some continued at year's end.
 Prison standards meet minimal international standards. However, despite the
 construction of new prison space, the prison population exceeds the maximum capac-
 ity of the prisons by some 15 percent. In some cases, the number of inmates is two
 or three times greater than capacity. Overcrowding creates problems of poor sanita-
 tion and strains medical services, so much so that it was noted as a negative factor
 by the CPT in its report on prison conditions after a visit in 1992 (published in
 1995). AIDS is a major problem, although the law allows judges to release prisoners
 whose detention would prevent access to appropriate treatment or endanger the
 health of other inmates. According to data from the Interior Ministry's prison ad-
 ministration, about 4 percent of the totalprison population is HIV positive. There
 were 36 suicides in prison as of the end of July, compared with 45 during 1996.
 Allegations continued of the abuse of prisoners by guards. In 1994 the Naples ju-
 diciary committed to trial 71 prison officials of the Secondigliano prison including
 the chief warden, on charges of mistreating some 300 inmates in 1993. Two trials,
 
 
 1132
 one involving 65 of the defendants and another involving 6 were still in progress
 at year's end.
 The Government permits the independent monitoring of prison conditions by par-
 liamentarians, local human rights groups, the media, and other organizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In response to public concern over the
 excessive use of preventive or investigative detention, Parliament passed a law in
 1995 clarifying that preventive detention can be imposed only as a last resort, or
 if there is clear and convincing evidence of a serious offense, such as crimes involv-
 ing the Mafia, or those related to drugs, arms, or subversion. In these cases, a maxi-
 mum of 2 years of preliminary investigation is permitted. Except in extraordinary
 situations, preventive custody is not permitted for pregnant women, single parents
 of children under 3 years of age, persons over 70 years of age, or those who are seri-
 ously ill. Preventive custody can be imposed only for crimes punishable by a maxi-
 mum sentence of not less than 4 years.
 Detainees are allowed prompt and regular access to lawyers of their choosing (al-
 though occasional lapses in this general rule have been alleged) and to family mem-
 bers. If detainees are indigent, the State provides a lawyer. The preliminary hearing
 judge's interrogation of an accused person must be conducted within 5 days, or the
 defendant must be released. Interrogation by a magistrate of a person in custody
 must be recorded on video or audio tape, or the statements cannot be utilized in
 any proceedings. The prosecutor is required to include in his request for preventive
 detention all evidence favorable to the accused. In addition the defense may present
 any favorable evidence directly to the court.
 There is no provision for bail, but judges may grant provisional liberty to suspects
 awaiting trial. As a safeguard against unjustified detention, panels of judges ("lib-
 erty tribunals ") review cases of persons awaiting trial and decide whether contin-
 ued detention is warranted. Despite these measures, as of mid year, 42 percent of
 inmates were in prison awaiting either trial or the outcome of an appeal, rather
 than because they had been finally sentenced. The Constitution and law provide for
 restitution in cases of unjust detention.
 Punishment by exile abroad is not practiced, and the law prohibits domestic exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 There are three levels of courts. The lower level has three separate tracks: praetor
 Courts for offenses punishable by monetary fines or imprisonment for not more than
 4 years; a Court of Assizes for crimes punishable by prison terms of more than 24
 years; and a Tribunal Court for offenses falling between the jurisdiction of the first
 two. The Assizes Court of Appeals hears appeals from all three tracks. Decisions at
 this level can be further appealed to the highest level, the Court of Cassation in
 Rome.
 The law provides for trials to be fair and public, and the authorities observe these
 provisions. The law grants defendants the presumption of innocence. Trials are pub-
 lic, and defendants have access to an attorney sufficiently in advance to prepare a
 defense. Defendants can confront witnesses. All government-held evidence is nor-
 mally made available to defendants and their attorneys. Defendants can appeal ver-
 dicts to the highest appellate court.
 Cumbersome procedures slow the pace of justice. The average waiting period for
 trials is about 18 months. The Code of Criminal Procedure that took effect in 1989
 sought to streamline the process, but it has not produced substantial improvement.
 Since 1991 public prosecutors have conducted sweeping investigations of corrup-
 tion among the political and economic elites and in the judiciary. These inquiries
 continue and enjoy public support. However, there are critics who complain that
 some investigating magistrates are occasionally influenced by political or other in-
 terests in choosing targets of inquiry, or sometimes fail to show adequate respect
 for the rights of suspects by, for example, making excessive use of preventive deten-
 tion (see Section 1.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 safeguards the privacy of the home, and the authorities respect this provision.
 Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant
 and in carefully defined circumstances. Violations are subject to legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press-The law provides for freedom of speech and the
 press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press,
 an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to en-
 sure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 
 
 1133
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government does not re-
 strict the right of peaceful assembly, including protests against government policies,
 except in cases where national security or public safety is at risk. Permits are not
 required for meetings, but organizers of public demonstrations must notify the po-
 lice in advance. Professional and employer associations organize and operate freely.
 While allowing general freedom of association, the Constitution and law prohibit
 clandestine associations, those that pursue political aims through force, that incite
 racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination, or that advocate fascism.
 C. Freedom of Religion.1The Constitution provides for freedom of religions and
 the Government respects this right. The Government subsidizes the Roman Catholic
 Church, the Adventist Church, and the Assemblies of God by allowing taxpayers to
 elect to designate a fixed percentage of their tax payment to one or another of these.
 In 1997 Parliament passed a law extending these subsidies to the Lutheran and
 Jewish denomination. In 1993 the Buddhist community applied for the same fund-
 ing, but the Government has not yet responded.
 Roman Catholic religious instruction is offered in public schools as an optional
 subject. Those students who do not want to attend the "hour of religion" may take
 an alternative course.
 Nontraditional religious groups are free to follow their beliefs and proselytize pro-
 vided they respect public order and eneral moral standards. In August the Su-
 preme Court reversed a lower court Iecision that Scientology was not a bona fide
 religion, ruling that the definition of religion applied was unconstitutional.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution and law provide for these rights, and the Government
 respects them in practice. Citizens who leave are guaranteed the right to return.
 The Constitution forbids deprivation of citizenship for political reasons.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. It provides first
 asylum for refugees fleeing hostilities or natural disasters, for example. In these
 cases the refugees are granted temporary residence permits that must be renewed
 periodically and that carry no guarantee of future permanent residence. 220,000 for-
 eigners living irregularly in Italy, including would-be asylum seekers, were able to
 obtain residence and work permits in 1996 as a result of a 1995 amnesty decree.
 As of mid-year, the number of refugees present in Italy, largely of Balkan origin,
 increased to 62,500 because of the continuing difficulties in the former Yugoslavia
 and the unrest in Albania. The Government also provides political asylum, often for
 permanent residence, and 107 such permits were granted as of mid-year, compared
 with a total of 175 for all of 1996. There were no reports of forced expulsion of any
 person having a valid claim to refugee status.
 In December the Government began closing the camps housing refugees who fled
 Albania earlier in the year. The Government acted after ascertaining that sufficient
 civil authority was restored in Albania and after the International Committee for
 the Red Cross determined that there was no longer a humanitarian emergency
 there.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 There are no restrictions in law on women's participation in government and poli-
 tics. Fewer women than men, however, are office holders: women held 3 of 23 cabi-
 net positions, 24 of 325 Senate seats, and 69 of 630 seats in the Chamber of Depu-
 ties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex (except with regard to
 hazardous work-see below), religion, ethnic background, or political opinion and
 provides some protection against discrimination based on disability, language, or so-
 cial status. However, societal discrimination persists to some degree.
 
 
 1134
 
 Women.-Legislation to protect women from physical abuse, including from mem-
 bers of their family, was updated and strengthened in 1996. The law treats spousal
 rape the same as any other rape.
 Media reports of violence against women are common. Telefono Rosso, a promi-
 nent nongovernmental organization, in a 1996 survey detected a slight increase in
 reports of beatings and rape but a slight decline in reports of sexual harassment.
 Law enforcement and court officials are not reluctant to bring perpetrators of vio-
 lence against women to justice, but victims sometimes do not press charges due to
 fear, shame, or ignorance of the law. The new legislation passe din February makes
 the prosecution of perpetrators of violence against women easier and shields women
 who have been objects of attack from publicity. The Government provides a hot line
 through which abused women can obtain legal, medical, and other assistance. The
 city of Milan maintains a clinic served by 40 doctors to provide free medical assist-
 ance to abused women and minors. Women's associations also maintain several shel-
 ters for battered women.
 The media report cases of trafficking in women, often involving forced prostitu-
 tion. The women (as well as their exploiters) are usually illegal immigrants and are
 therefore reluctant to contact the police. Nevertheless, the police have been able to
 make arrests on several occasions using the charge of profiting from or exploiting
 the prostitution of others.
 A number of government offices work to ensure women's rights. The Prodi Gov-
 ernment created a new cabinet-level position, the Office of Minister for Equal Op-
 portunity, and named a woman to this position. In addition there is an Equal Op-
 portunity Commission the Office of the Prime Minister. Another such commission
 is in the Labor Ministry and focuses on discrimination and women's rights in the
 workplace. The Labor Ministry has a counselor who deals with these problems at
 the national level and similar officials serve with regional and provincial govern-
 ments. Many of these counselors, however, have limited resources for their work.
 Some laws intended to protect women from hazardous work keep them out of jobs
 such as night shifts or underground work in mines, quarries, or tunnels. Maternity
 leave, introduced to benefit women, does add to the cost of employing them, with
 the result that employers sometimes find it advantageous to hire men instead.
 Women generally receive lower salaries than men for comparable work. They are
 underrepresented in many fields, such as management or the professions (women,
 for example, account for only 25 percent of magistrates and only 10 percent of police
 officers). Women experience unemployment more frequently than men.
 While the law does not specifically prohibit sexual harassment, labor agreements
 covering broad sectors of the economy, in both the private and public sectors, do con-
 tain clauses that address the problem.
 Women enjoy legal equality with men in marriage, property, and inheritance
 rights
 Many NGO's actively and effectively promote women's rights. Most are affiliated
 with labor unions or political parties.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare. It signed the European Convention on the Exercise of the Rights
 of Minors on January 25. In September it launched an extensive study of the living
 conditions of minors to serve as a data base for policies to improve their situation.
 In August Parliament passed a law aimed at helping shield children from dangerous
 situations and encouraging them to attend school. The major objective of the law
 is child welfare but it also is connected with government efforts to banish child labor
 (see Section 6.d.). Boys and girls enjoy equal access and treatment with regard to
 education, health, and othqr government services.
 Schooling is compulsory for children from the age of 7 to 14. The dropout rate is
 high, especially in junior and senior high school. In 1995 on average only 56 stu-
 dents graduated from senior high school of each 100 who enrolled in primary school
 19 years earlier.
 The abuse of children is a societal problem Telefono Azzurro, an NGO that main-
 tains a toll-free hot line for cases of child abuse, received an average of 800 calls
 a day during 1996 and in the first 3 months of 1997. From all of these calls, follow-
 uF services were required in 1,425 cases in 1996 and 437 cases in the first 3 months
 1997. Social workers counsel abused children and are authorized to take action
 to protect them.
 People With Disabilities.-The law forbids discrimination against disabled persons
 in employment, education, or in the prvision of state services. The law requires en-
 terprises with more than 35 employees to hire the disabled to staff 15 percent of
 their work force, directs that public buildings be made accessible to persons with
 disabilities, and stipulates a number of specific rights for the disabled. Compliance
 with these requirements, however, is still incomplete.
 
 
 1135
 
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Immigrants and other foreigners face soci-
 etal discrimination. Some are subjected to physical attack. Roma encounter difficul-
 ties f'nding places for their groups to stay. The city of Rome opened six camps for
 them and launched a program of compulsory schooling for Roma children.
 The Forum of Foreign Communities continues its work on behalf of immigrants
 and foreign residents. It maintains a hot line to report incidents of violence against
 foreigners. Other NGOs, such as Caritas, provide a broad range of assistance to im-
 migrants throughout the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides for the right to establish trade
 unions join unions, and carry out union activities in the workplace. Some 40 per-
 cent of the work force is organized. Trade unions are free of government controls
 and no longer have formal ties with political parties. The right to strike is embodied
 in the Constitution and is frequently exercised. A 1990 law restricts strikes affecting
 essential public services such as transport, sanitation, and health. Unions associate
 freely with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively, and these rights are re-
 spected in practice. By custom (though not by law), national collective bargaining
 agreements apply to all workers regardless of union affiliation.
 The law progibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers. It requires employers who have more than 15 employees and who are found
 guilty of antiunion discrimination to reinstate any workers affected. In firms with
 less than 15 workers, an employer must state the grounds for firing a union em-
 ployee in writing. If a judge deems these grounds spurious, he can order the em-
 ployer to reinstate or compensate the worker.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including that performed by children, and it does not occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 forbids forced or bonded labor involving children, and such practice� do not occur
 (see Section 6.c.). The law also forbids employment of children under 15 years of
 age (with some limited exceptions). There are also specific restrictions on employ-
 ment in hazardous or unhealthful occupations for males under age 18, and females
 under age 21. The enforcement of minimum age laws is effective only outside the
 extensive "underground" economy. The leader of the largest union put the number
 of child laborers at 300,000.
 In addition to their legal obligations, the government, labor, and business volun-
 teered in a January 1996 pact to mobilize against exploitation of child labor at home
 and abroad.
 The August law aimed at helping shield children from dangerous situations and
 encouraging them to attend school is the first step in the Government's plan to
 strenghen support for children and is connected with government efforts to banish
 childlabor (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are not set by law but rather
 by collective bargaining agreements. These specify minimum standards to which in-
 dividual employment contracts must conform. Wen an employer and a union fail
 to reach agreement, courts may step in to determine fair wages on the basis of prac-
 tice in comparable activities or agreements.
 A law enacted in June reduced the legal workweek to 40 hours from 48. Most col-
 lective agreements provide for a 36- to 38-hour workweek. Overtime may not exceed
 2 hours a day or an average of 12 hours per week.
 The law sets basic health and safety standards and guidelines for compensation
 for on-the-job injuries. European Union directives on health and safety have also
 been incorporated into the law; some provisions have already taken effect and oth-
 ers will be phased in during 1997. Labor inspectors are from local health units or
 from the Ministry of Labor. They are few in numbers, given the scope of their re-
 sponsibilities. Courts impose fines and sometimes prison terms for violation of
 health and safety laws. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dan-
 gerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued employment.
