 HONDURAS
 
 Honduras has been governed since 1982 by the civilian
 administration of President Roberto Suazo Cordova. The
 Honduran military, which ruled the country for almost 20 years
 before 1982, supports the present civilian government and is
 publicly committed to national and local elections which are
 scheduled in 1985, as well as to observance of human rights.
 There are four political parties which are legally registered
 and represented in the Congress. Other important political
 actors include private sector organizations, trade unions, and
 campesino groups.
 The political instability in Central America has greatly
 affected Honduras. Violent border encounters with Nicaraguan
 Government forces, inside Honduran territory, increased in
 early 1983, but diminished in the second half of the year in
 the presence of U.S. naval forces and during the conduct of
 U.S.-Honduran military exercises. Throughout the year the
 Honduran Government remained highly concerned about the
 possibility of conventional Nicaraguan attack. Although
 terrorist activity was at a much lower level than in 1982, a
 few bombing incidents occurred from July to September. These
 coincided with the infiltration from Nicaragua into Honduras of
 guerrillas trained in Cuba and Nicaragua. The Honduran
 Government quickly overwhelmed the guerrillas who were plagued
 by defections, the hostility of the local population, and poor
 logistics. The guerrilla infiltration, however, posed a new
 threat to Honduras and coupled with the bombings led the
 authorities to increase security measures, including searches
 of vehicles and the detention of suspected terrorists. At the
 same time, the Sandinistas and many international observers
 charge that Nicaraguans engaged in anti-Sandinista insurgent
 activities are being supported from Honduras.
 It is estimated that up to 10 persons were victims of
 politically motivated killings .in the first 10 months of 1983.
 The Government is not believed to have been responsible for any
 of these murders; most resulted from a combination of personal
 and factional rivalries in rural areas. Local human rights
 groups also reported 10 unresolved disappearances during 1983,
 less than half the number in 1982, but Government officials
 claimed that many of these were being trained abroad as
 guerrillas or had disappeared for personal reasons. There
 were, however, reports of torture and mistreatment of persons
 who had been detained. The Government in some cases
 disciplined members of the security forces who had abused their
 authority. For example, in January 1984 the chief of the
 Investigative'Police was fired following disclosure of the
 death of an individual from a beating while in police custody.
 The policemen suspected of the beating were relieved of their
 duties and turned over to the criminal courts for prosecution.
 Many criminal suspects were detained for extended periods
 before being released or arraigned. Toward the end of the
 year, however, the Government began bringing suspects to trial
 rather than detaining them without presenting charges.
 Honduras continued to host refugees from neighboring
 countries, whose numbers grew to more than 40,000 in 1983.
 Freedoms of speech and press, of assembly and association, of
 religion, and of movement within and outside the country were
 generally respected during 1983 in Honduras.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1     Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The Honduran Government neither condones nor knowingly permits
 killings of a political or nonpolitical nature. In rare cases
 in which members of the security forces have been accused of
 murder, the Government has brought the perpetrators to
 justice. For example, when four members of a leftist trade
 union were killed in the spring, individuals belonging to the
 security forces were swiftly arrested and charged; their trial
 is in process. During the year, several policemen were
 arrested for homicides motivated by personal animosities.
 Through October 1983. it was estimated that fewer than 10
 killings of a possible political nature took place. According
 to available evidence, government authorities did not order any
 of these murders; most appear to be attributable to some
 combination of personal and political rivalry in the rural
 areas. In early January 1984, a university student charged
 with passing false checks died from a beating while in police
 custody. The director of the Investigative Police was fired a
 few days later, and the three policemen suspected of the
 beating wereformally arraigned in criminal court.
 b. Disappearance
 The nongovernmental Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
 and the Committee of Families of Disappeared Persons alleged
 that, as of October, some 10 persons seized in public during
 1983 had not been released, turned over to courts, acknowledged
 to be in custody, or found dead. In addition, the Human Rights
 Committee still has on its list of disappeared persons over 40
 such cases from previous years. The records of these private
 groups indicated that the number of new unresolved
 disappearance cases was less in 1983 than in 1982 (24).
 Government officials often claimed that many of these
 "disappeared" persons were either involved in guerrilla
 training in Nicaragua or Cuba or vanished for personal reasons.
 During the year, in a number of instances government officials
 repeatedly denied that they had detained persons who
 disappeared, but those persons later were released by the
 security forces or arraigned.  In other cases, the individuals
 were released after several days and claimed their unknown
 captors were security agents who questioned them regarding
 "subversive elements".
 c.   Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although Honduran law specifically prohibits torture, prisoners
 often claim to have been physically abused and a few have come
 forward with physical evidence. Mistreatment of detained
 persons, including some physical harm and denial of food for
 short periods, apparently occurs fairly often. As noted above,
 one person died from a beating while in police custody in
 January 1984. In this case and some others during 1983,
 disciplinary action has been taken against members of the
 security forces who abused their authority. The courts have
 found inadmissible confessions and other evidence obtained when
 the use of torture was substantiated.
 
 
 611
 Prison conditions are generally poor, with severe overcrowding
 and insufficient food and shelter the most serious problems.
 The main prison in Tegucigalpa, for example, was built to hold
 about 400 prisoners but currently has over 1300. Often inmates
 receive meager rations and must supplement their diet with food
 brought by relatives or purchased with funds received from the
 sale of handicraft items made in prison.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Honduran law, a person accused of a criminal act must be
 presented before a judge within 24 hours of arrest, and the
 judge must decide within six days whether there is sufficient
 evidence to hold the accused for trial. Although these
 procedures are followed in the vast majority of cases, the
 director of the National Department of Investigations, Major
 Juan Blas Salazar, publicly acknowledged that his department
 had held an unspecified number of prisoners for indefinite
 periods.
 In 1983 there continued to be instances of extended pre-trial
 detentions by security forces, usually in terrorism/subversion
 cases. The detainees were usually presented to the competent
 tribunal or released within two or three weeks, but several
 cases of extralegal detention exceeded 90 days. During the
 second half of the year the number of cases involving persons
 formally charged with subversive acts increased, but fewer
 persons were detained beyond the time permitted by the judicial
 system before formal arraignment.
 In the case of a detained person, under Honduran law, an
 "appeal for personal exhibition" can be filed with the Supreme
 Court for the appointment of a "judge executor" to investigate
 and attempt to locate the individual. If the individual is
 found, the judge must recommend to the Supreme Court whether
 continued detention is merited. The police and armed forces
 usually refuse direct access to the cells, allowing instead
 review of the list of detainees. In some cases in which
 appeals were filed, the authorities have at first denied that
 the persons were being detained but later acknowledged at the
 time of release or arraignment that they were being held when
 the appeals were filed.
 Release on. bail for common crimes is both commonplace and
 lenient. While the legal system provides for public defenders,
 in practice they are often not available because of budgetary
 constraints. Interns in a law school legal clinic also assist
 defendants, but since the internships only last for six months
 they are not able to follow many cases through to completion.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are no political prisoners in Honduras. Individuals are
 prosecuted not for their political beliefs but rather for
 criminal acts defined in the penal code. In 1983 the
 authorities detained for investigation several persons who
 belonged to radical left organizations but they were released
 because it could not be proven that they had engaged in
 criminal acts. Persons not released on bail are often detained
 for lengthy periods because of the slow judicial process.
 Cases are eventually brought to trial, however, and often in
 
 
 612
 cases in which the defendant has been released on bail it is
 the defense, and not the prosecution, which uses dilatory
 tactics.
 The Constitution provides a number of guarantees for judicial
 independence. Supreme Court justices are appointed to their
 four-year terms by the National Congress and lower court judges
 can be removed by the executive. The judicial system appears
 to be generally free of corruption. There are no secret
 tribunals or courts.
 f.   Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally does not interfere with the personal
 or family lives of its citizens. Invasion of the home without
 a warrant is forbidden by the Constitution, but security forces
 sometimes have entered homes without proper judicial
 authorization to search for terrorists. This appears to have
 been done less frequently in 1983 than in the previous year
 when there was more terrorist and subversive activity.
 Section 2     Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and prohibits
 the arbitrary closing of any registered source of public
 information or the confiscation its property. Over 100 radio
 stations, four daily newspapers, a two-station national
 television network, and assorted magazines and journals--all of
 which are independent--operate in Honduras. The vigorous
 press, which covers the political spectrum, often criticizes
 the Government and other political actors, including the
 military. The Government does not censor the media, although
 government advertising has on occasion been temporarily
 withheld as a sign of displeasure.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties, student groups, trade unions, peasant
 associations, and other interest groups are free to organize,
 meet, and demonstrate publicly. Professionals, such as
 lawyers, doctors, engineers, and journalists, must be members
 of the corresponding professional associations, which are
 independent of the Government, in order to carry on their
 profession. Similarly, business interests band together in
 private sector organizations which have considerable influence
 with the Government.
 Honduras has a strong trade union movement, dating to the
 banana worker strikes in the early 1950's. Approximately 40
 percent of the urban and 20 percent of the rural labor force is
 unionized. Labor legislation is heavily weighted in favor of
 the worker and unions, and most industries are unionized.
 Labor has no direct role in party politics, although trade
 unions span the ideological spectrum and major parties maintain
 contacts with the unions.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Honduras has no state religion. Honduran nationals are legally
 guaranteed the right to worship in any manner they choose.
 Approximately 90 percent of the population is Roman Catholic;
 
 
 613
 the remainder is divided between various other Christian
 denominations and a very small Jewish community. Evangelists
 and missionaries operate freely throughout the country, despite
 the historical legacy of a foreign-dominated clergy which from
 time to time causes social tension between church groups and
 Honduran authorities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within or outside
 Honduras by its citizens or foreigners, except that some
 rufugees are restricted to the area of their camps. Honduras
 is host to approximately 20,000 El Salvadoran, 22,000
 Nicaraguan, and 600 Guatemalan displaced persons in camps
 throughout the country and continues to accept them freely
 despite the economic and administrative burden they impose.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 In January 1982 the civilian administration of President
 Roberto Suazo Cordova was inaugurated, ending nearly 20 years
 of military rule and culminating a process of democratization
 which included election of a constituent assembly in 1980 and a
 presidential election the following year. Approximately 80
 percent of Honduras' eligible voters participated in the
 presidential election.
 The armed forces retain a strong behind-the-scenes role in the
 political process but both publicly and privately defer to the
 civil-authorities in the policy making process. The military
 is publicly committed to the preservation of the democratic
 system, including the holding of national and local elections
 1985.
 Official preparations are now under way for these elections,
 including voter registration to extend the franchise to as many
 citizens as possible. No group is barred from engaging in the
 election process, and all four registered parties are
 represented in the National Congress.
 Section 4     Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rightsz
 The Government cooperates fully with international commissions
 which visit Honduras to investigate the human rights
 situation. Honduran authorities including President Suazo have
 had frequent exchanges with human rights-oriented groups to
 detail the governmental position. Americas Watch notes that
 Honduras places no obstacles in the way of international
 observers and that "Government officials do discuss these
 matters freely with visitors" but criticizes the Government
 record on response to written inquires.
 Amnesty International, in a report covering the 1982 human
 rights situation, expressed concern about "repeated and
 increasing reports of arbitrary arrest and detention, torture,
 disappearances, and the extrajudical execution of both Honduran
 and foreign citizens." By 1983, extrajudicial actions had
 sharply decreased, and, in several of the cases cited by
 Amnesty International which could be substantiated, human
 
 
 614
 rights violators were awaiting trial or had been tried and
 convicted. Freedom House terms Honduras "free." The
 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, in its 1982-83
 report, expressed concern about reports of disappearances in
 Honduras, as well as reports of arrest and subsequent prolonged
 detention incommunicado. The Commission did not comment on the
 merits of the reports. In 1983 the principal active domestic
 human rights organizations was the independent Committee for
 the Defense of Human Rights, established in 1980. The
 Committee reports have been publicly criticized by the
 Government and private Honduran groups for often adopting
 political positions on topics outside the sphere of human
 rights. Two other groups, a committee of the Congress
 concerned with "constitutional guarantees and national
 security" and an organization formed under the aegis of the bar
 association, were created in 1983 but have yet to define their
 areas of action.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATIONs
 Honduras has suffered a sharp economic downturn since 1980.
 Although the gross national product grew in nominal terms to
 $675 per capita in 1982, in real terms it declined by 1.1
 percent. The country has a population of 4,276,000 which is
 growing at an annual rate of 3.4 percent. Infant mortality has
 continued to decrease to the rate of 77.9 per 1,000 live
 births, and life expectancy at birth is now up to 58.27 years.
 Approximately 46 percent of the population has access to safe
 water. Caloric consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements is 93.33 percent.
 Discrimination on the basis of race or sex is not permitted by
 law. Women occupy an increasingly important role in Honduran
 society. The cabinet includes one woman (Minister of
 Education), and a woman is Attorney General in the Ministry of
 Interior and Justice. Female enrollment in professional
 schools at the National University approaches 50 percent of the
 student body. Literacy statistics in general show little
 difference between male (58.9 percent) and female (55.1
 percent). Approximately 85 percent of school age females
 (versus 92 percent of school age males) are enrolled in primary
 school. The labor code provides special protection for those
 who are pregnant or nursing. Most occupations are open to
 women, including positions with the military, police, and the
 civil service. Honduras' ethnic minorities, geographically
 concentrated on the Caribbean coast, are fully integrated into
 the society, with representation in the cabinet and the
 legislature.
 Land reform has received new emphasis from the Suazo
 Government, with over 40,000 hectares having been distributed
 since January 1982. There are insufficent funds to expropriate
 land or pay for necessary infrastructural improvements to open
 up areas in the eastern area of the country, and the Government
 has concentrated on granting legal title to peasants who have
 long occupied public land or rented land from absentee
 landowners.
