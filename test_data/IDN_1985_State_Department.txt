 The "New Order" Government, which came to power in 1966 in the
 wake of an abortive, Communist Party-backed coup, has its
 authority concentrated in a small group of active-duty and
 retired military officers and civilian technocrats acting
 under the dominant leadership of President Soeharto. A partly
 elected, partly appointed Parliament serves as a forum for
 consultation on and promulgation of legislation proposed by
 the Executive Branch. In reaction to the legacy of political
 and economic turmoil from the Sukarno days, the Government
 gives priority to economic development, stability, and social
 equity, and has been generally successful in these areas.
 Faced with a wide diversity of ethnic, social, linguistic, and
 religious groups, Indonesian governments have continually
 sought to create a national identity and develop a governing
 system which can accommodate this diversity while
 strengthening national unity. In meeting this challenge, the
 Soeharto Government has made Pancasila the national social and
 political ideology and the centerpiece of its political
 program. Pancasila consists of five principles: belief in
 one supreme god, belief in a just and civilized humanity,
 nationalism, democracy, and social justice. Government based
 on it emphasizes social harmony and the traditional Indonesian
 process of consultation and consensus as major elements in
 decisionmaking. In 1985 the Government passed legislation
 strengthening Pancasila's central role in society by requiring
 all social organizations to acknowledge Pancasila as their
 fundamental philosophy.
 Indonesia has a mixed economy with the State involved in
 nearly all sectors. The remarkable economic growth over the
 past decade has recently slowed somewhat. Chinese-Indonesian
 citizens are heavily represented in the modest but
 increasingly active private sector. Indonesia's national
 ideology and current 5-year economic plan stress improved
 social welfare for all without discrimination.
 Although there were improvements in the human rights situation
 in 1985, problems nevertheless remain. These include
 unexplained deaths and disappearances, reports of torture and
 cruel treatment of prisoners, and restrictions on freedom of
 speech and press, freedom of movement, and activities of
 political parties and labor organizations.
 In East Timor periodic skirmishes between the dwindling number
 of Fretilin guerrillas and the army continued, with unknown
 but relatively small numbers of casualties on both sides. The
 Government has permitted increased access to East Timor,
 including a series of escorted diplomatic visits and tours by
 Western newsmen. As a result of ambitious government plans,
 East Timor is benefiting from significant improvements in
 social services, particularly education and health centers,
 communications, and economic conditions.
 In Irian Jaya, fear of activities by the Organization for
 Papuan Freedom (OPM) rebels and the Indonesian army continued
 to influence Irianese to cross into neighboring Papua New
 Guinea. Observers believe that reduced Indonesian military
 activity in Irian Jaya has significantly cut down the number
 of new border crossers.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Press reports of covert summary executions of suspected
 criminals continued to appear in 1985, although the overall
 number of killings is believed to be less than in previous
 years. The executions, begun in 1982, started as a response
 to the fast-rising rate of violent crime. While the specific
 perpetrators of these executions, known euphemistically as
 "mysterious killings," have not been publicly identified, past
 comments by government officials supported the widespread
 public suspicion of government involvement. In contrast to
 previous years, government officials made virtually no public
 comments on the so-called "mysterious killings".
 Officially, press reporting of "mysterious killings" is
 banned, but in practice a variety of newspapers report
 periodic discoveries of unidentified corpses found shot,
 stabbed, or beaten to death, which, combined with other
 characteristics, are generally understood to mark victims of
 "mysterious killings." One widely respected daily newspaper
 reports crime statistics from time to time, including
 unidentified, unexplained murders, implying a monthly figure
 of 25 to 50 victims country-wide, but it is impossible to know
 how many of these should be considered "mysterious killings."
 It is very difficult to estimate the number of such killings
 as they are indistinguishable from many other acts of
 violence, particularly among criminal bands. In the past
 there have been claims that some of the killings were
 politically motivated, but no such assertions have been made
 recently. Earlier claims were not substantiated.
 Another police response to increasing crime is a new policy of
 "shoot to kill" in instances of violent crimes where the
 criminal is attempting to escape from the police. Presumably
 as part of an effort to make this new policy well-known,
 incidents of police shootings have received wide press
 coverage over recent months.
 There have been no substantiated reports of political killings
 in Irian Jaya or East Timor, both areas of ongoing internal
 strife between authorities and the rebels. The Government
 continued to offer amnesty to rebels in both provinces. The
 commander of a Fretilin military unit, Muruk, and several of
 his followers took advantage of the amnesty and surrendered in
 January, 1985. Although the Government maintains restrictions
 on their movements, the amnesty has been generally respected
 for these individuals. While rebel activity in Irian Jaya
 continues, there have been no reports of political killings on
 either side.
 b. Disappearance
 In late 1985, an Indonesian Muslim social organization
 developed a list of 40 or more people who "disappeared" during
 the 1984 Tanjung Priok Riots and are presumed dead. Continued
 reports of disappearances often refer to cases before 1985.
 The Amnesty International report on East Timor, published in'
 1985, for example, lists disappearances up to 1984.
 Regularized International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 access to prisons in East Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia has
 
 
 774
 INDONESIA
 helped to locate some persons thought to have disappeared. In
 Irian Jaya, increasingly, persons presumed to have disappeared
 are found to have crossed into Papua New Guinea.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although stated government policy discourages torture and
 cruel punishment of prisoners or detainees, instances of
 torture, cruel treatment, and even death while under detention
 are reported periodically in the press and elsewhere. Amnesty
 International, in its 1985 Report on East Timor, again cites
 what it claims is a military manual issued to Indonesian
 troops in East Timor which appears to permit the use of
 torture and threats on the lives of prisoners. The U.S.
 Government is unaware of any evidence that would verify the
 authenticity of the document. There have been a number of
 press reports of prisoners' claims of maltreatment by the
 police, and of individuals arrested and subsequently dying
 while in police custody. The authorities generally do not
 respond to such reports nor do they provide the public a more
 detailed explanation about the victims' deaths,
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although the December 1981 Criminal Procedures Code (KUHAP)
 contains protections against arbitrary arrest and detention
 and specifies the right of prisoners to legal counsel and
 notification of family members, a number of abuses still
 occur. The provisions of the KUHAP are honored more often in
 urban areas than in small towns or remote provinces, in part
 because of a shortage of trained trial lawyers and ignorance
 of the law on the part of those detained as well as by the
 police. Indonesian law does not specifically include the
 right of habeas corpus or its equivalent. Martial law,
 declared in 1957, has never been lifted. Under special
 emergency provisions instituted in 1966, a military
 organization, the Command for the Restoration of Security and
 Order (KOPKAMTIB) has wide powers to detain and interrogate
 persons thought to endanger national security. These special
 powers supersede the KUHAP protections and apply particularly
 to cases of suspected subversion, sabotage, secession, or
 corruption. No cases of KOPKAMTIB exercising its extralegal
 powers were reported during 1985.
 Although precise estimates of the number of persons detained
 without trial are unavailable, human rights observers believe
 there may be at least as many as 500 throughout Indonesia,
 including in Aceh, East and Central Java, Irian Jaya, and East
 Timor. The Governor of East Timor reports that a number of
 Timorese have been released from detention for lack of
 evidence. Since 1981 Indonesian authorities have used Atauro
 Island off the coast of East Timor as a detention facility for
 Timorese suspected of supporting Fretilin, or of having family
 members fighting with it. The number of detainees at Atauro
 reached 4,000 in late 1982 and then fell steadily. In October
 1985, when the Government returned 239 detainees to the main
 Timor Island, only 932 remained on Atauro, most of them from
 the Viqueque area. While the Government intends to return
 them as soon as possible, many have asked to stay on Atauro
 until there is no longer any possible Fretilin threat in the
 Viqueque area. In the meantime, the ICRC continues to provide
 nutritional and medical assistance to those still detained on
 Atauro.
 
 
 775
 INDONESIA
 Although Indonesia is a party to a number of International
 Labor Organization (ILO) conventions on the right to organize
 and bargain collectively and on forced labor, government
 officials have made clear that Indonesia's obligations under
 these conventions will not be allowed to interfere with
 "Pancasila" labor relations. There have been no reports of
 the use of forced labor in Indonesia in recent years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Political interference and corruption exist in the Indonesian
 legal system. In criminal proceedings, defendants are
 sometimes able to buy their way out of prosecution at various
 stages of the proceedings. In civil cases, court decisions
 are sometimes influenced by the payment of bribes. In
 response to these abuses, from time to time the Government has
 taken action against particularly flagrant offenders, but by
 and large these practices continue unabated.
 In cases involving what could broadly be defined as
 .political" issues, particularly instances in which persons
 are being tried under the subversion provisions of 1963, the
 accused are rarely, if ever, found innocent. The Government
 vigorously pursued prosecution of persons charged in
 connection with the 1984 Tanjung Priok riots. All of the
 persons tried during 1985 for involvement with the riots or
 the various bombing incidents in Java in 1984-85 have been
 found guilty of antigovernment activity and received stiff
 sentences. In all such security-related cases, it is widely
 believed that the Government will ensure conviction
 irrespective of the evidence presented in court. Although the
 Government has not announced data on the number of persons
 serving sentences for subversion, one reliable estimate
 suggests there may be several hundred.
 A number of well-known figures were tried in 1985 under
 subversion laws: Muslim preacher A.M. Fatwa for purported
 instigation of rioting in Tanjung Priok in 1984; retired
 Lieutenant General H.R. Dharsono for subversive and criminal
 activity following the riots; a former government minister for
 involvement in bombings in Jakarta; and a 23-year-old
 publisher in Jogjakarta accused of printing articles appearing
 to oppose the Government. Fatwa was convicted and sentenced
 to 18 years in prison. Attorneys for General Dharsono sought
 to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the 1963
 regulations, promulgated in response to the serious internal
 instability of that time, were no longer valid in Indonesia's
 present stable condition. The court did not accept this
 argument. In the same case, Dharsono's attorneys claimed the
 retired general was not permitted to meet with legal counsel
 for most of the 7 months he was held preceding his trial, and
 that his continued detention during trial contravened common
 legal practice, which would permit him to be released on
 bail. However, during the trial he was given full opportunity
 to air his views and those of defense witnesses as well;
 although the court permitted only 6 of the 12 witnesses the
 defense sought to testify. Dharsono received a 10-year
 sentence.
 The Government's execution of four former Indonesian Communist
 Party (PKI) activists in mid-1985 generated strong criticism
 from some foreign governments and private organizations. The
 Government responded by noting that each of the victims had
 been tried, provided the right of appeal, and executed in
 accordance with Indonesian law.
 
 
 776
 INDONESIA
 Indonesia's criminal justice system lacks the number of
 courts, trained judges, prosecutors, and police needed to cope
 with the increase in crime in recent years. As a result there
 are frequently lengthy delays in scheduling trials. Trials
 are conducted by a three-judge panel which hears evidence,
 decides guilt or innocence, and assesses punishment. Although
 the right of appeal is not absolute, it is observed in most
 cases. Most court sessions are open to the public, and most
 defendants have access to counsel.
 As government employees, judges in Indonesia come under the
 jurisdiction of the Executive Branch. The Indonesian society
 of trial lawyers, Peradin, has noted that interference from
 the Executive Branch greatly affects the independence of the
 judiciary. In 1985 the Government proposed legislation which
 would establish judges as civil servants with a slightly more
 independent position.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Judicial warrants for searches are required except for
 suspected subversion, economic crimes, and corruption.
 However, forced or surreptitious entry by security agencies
 reportedly occurs periodically. Both local and international
 telephone calls are believed to be monitored selectively by
 government security agencies. Although, in general,
 correspondence is not monitored, letter mail to and from East
 Timor is subject to official scrutiny.
 Permits are required for the import of foreign publications
 and video tapes, which must be reviewed by government
 censors. Some foreign newspapers and magazines, especially
 from Australia, cannot be imported. Communist literature is
 prohibited. Foreign publications which do enter Indonesia are
 subject to censorship.
 Excepting one quasi-official daily newspaper which uses
 Chinese characters and claims a circulation of over 100,000,
 Chinese language publications can neither be imported nor
 produced domestically. Chinese characters are routinely
 blotted out of foreign news photos and advertising. There are
 no laws against speaking Chinese, but the Government lays
 heavy stress on the learning and use of the national language,
 Bahasa Indonesia, to promote national unity.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is circumscribed. The
 Constitution gives Parliament the authority to legislate these
 restrictions. In recent years, Parliament has helped create a
 body of law delimiting the rights of individuals and of the
 Government. In the absence of implementing regulations for
 many of these laws, different government agencies frequently
 interpret them as they choose. The result is that these
 agencies hold considerable discretionary authority in the
 field of civil rights; e.g., in freedom of the press and
 speech. Traditional governmental concern about public
 statements or publications which could be perceived as
 critical of the Government, and therefore threatening to the
 nation's stability, is a major factor inhibiting the exercise
 of free speech and press.
 
 
 777
 INDONESIA
 Opposition groups are generally free to meet and formulate
 views, but they are inhibited from disseminating them publicly
 because of media reluctance to risk official disapproval or
 because of informal government instructions not to publish the
 opinions of or news about prominent opposition figures. In
 1985 the Government brought to trial several well-known
 figures whom it accused of committing or contributing to
 possibly subversive acts while speaking their views.
 Authorities provided general topic guidelines to Muslim
 speakers during the Muslim holidays, when preachers addressed
 large gatherings. In a few instances, preachers who went
 beyond these guidelines were arrested.
 The general lack of specific, clear guidelines on what is
 permissible has generated a significant degree of
 self-censorship both in public speaking and in the press.
 School faculties sometimes refrain from producing materials,
 including dissertations, which they believe might provoke
 government displeasure. Publishers also are unwilling to
 accept manuscripts dealing with controversial issues. Foreign
 books critical of the Government or dealing with sensitive
 topics, such as human rights, are similarly avoided by
 importers. Foreign periodicals, readily available in
 Indonesia, are scrupulously censored by their private
 importers in order to avoid government confiscation of the
 materials. With few exceptions this self-censorship is
 thorough and effectively responds to government concerns.
 The press is largely privately owned. While espousing a
 "free" press, the Government expects the media to be
 "responsible" by supporting national economic development
 goals and domestic stability. While journalists and
 publishers practice considerable self-censorship, the
 Government closely monitors the media for material it finds
 unacceptable. In such instances, editors or journalists
 routinely receive oral instructions from government officials
 about news which cannot be reported. Articles and editorials
 do address sensitive issues, and, within the vaguely defined
 limitations, journalists are sometimes given a surprisingly
 wide latitude in which to operate. Directly or indirectly the
 press periodically criticizes government officials and
 policies, with no negative result from authorities. Outside
 Jakarta the press occasionally draws public attention to
 corruption cases involving government officials.
 There is a single, government-run television network. Private
 radio stations, of which there are more than 400 throughout
 the country, are required to use government-provided news
 reports.
 In 1985 the Government invited two separate groups of foreign
 journalists to visit East Timor. Of the resulting reports,
 the local press avoided publication of all but the mildest
 articles. Some of the same material in the foreign press
 entered Indonesia without trouble, and some was subsequently
 censored.
 During 1985 the Department of Information suspended
 publication of two small-circulation journals, both for
 printing what the Government perceived to be inflammatory,
 antigovernment articles. One journal was permitted to
 reopen. The editor of the other journal was sentenced to 8
 years in prison.
 
 
 778
 INDONESIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Regional and national meetings of virtually all organizations
 must have government permission, and local jurisdictions often
 require prior approval for smaller gatherings as well. While
 such approval is usually granted, there are restrictions on
 meetings in East Timor. The Government authorizes public
 assembly for social and ceremonial events and, as long as
 there is no perceived security risk, for political
 activities.
 In mid-1985, the Parliament passed a "Social Organizations"
 bill (known as the "OR IAS" bill) which requires virtually all
 organizations to accept the state ideology of Pancasila. The
 law, which has yet to be implemented, empowers the Government,
 with the approval of the Supreme Court, to disband any
 organization it believes to be acting against the tenets of
 Pancasila. In addition, government approval will be required
 before any organization can accept funding from foreign
 donors. The ORMAS bill is the fifth and final piece of a
 five-part package of controversial political legislation
 designed to broaden and strengthen government control over the
 political process. The other four bills passed in the 1984-85
 legislative session similarly served to consolidate and extend
 government influence on political parties, the composition of
 Parliament, national referendums, and general elections.
 Indonesian workers are organized in a national federation
 (SPSI) which has been composed of 21 national industrial
 unions. These unions have recently been reduced in number and
 will no longer maintain regional and district organizations.
 No decision has been reached about the final number of unions
 that will be formed. They have a total membership of some 3
 million out of a work force of 65 million, in which some 15
 million persons are employed in the industrialized sector.
 The SPSI is the only trade union federation legally permitted
 in Indonesia, and all trade unions must belong to it.
 Political activity by the SPSI is forbidden. It is not
 permitted to organize civil servants or workers in
 government-owned enterprises nor in major sectors of the
 economy declared by the Government to be vital, such as air
 transportation and oil. However, some professional
 organizations, such as those for teachers, do act as unions in
 some respects.
 .Restrictions on the SPSI's autonomy include the imposition of
 government appointees in many of its positions, a requirement
 that its senior officials be active members of the
 government-sponsored GOLKAR, and extensive government
 intervention in labor-management relations. The law requires
 government permission for strikes, which as a matter of
 practice is never given.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The constitutional guarantees of religious freedom apply only
 to those religions recognized by the State--Islam,
 Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Although the Indonesian
 population is overwhelmingly Muslim, practice and teaching of
 the other recognized faiths are permitted.
 A plethora of mystical and other "folk religions" also
 exists. In 1985 the North Sumatra High Prosecutor banned 13
 mystical sects, with approximately 18,000 adherents in all.
 While it appears that the Government tolerates private
 
 
 779
 INDONESIA
 practice of banned religions, adherents of these groups are
 occasionally harassed by local authorities.
 A 1972 letter of the Supreme Prosecutor reiterated a
 Presidential Decree of 1962 banning membership in Jehovah's
 Witnesses and the Baha'i faith. Although technically belief
 in one of these religions is not prohibited, legal decisions
 based on the 1972 and 1962 decrees made clear that such belief
 implies membership, which is illegal.
 Because the first tenet of Pancasila specifies belief in a
 Supreme Being, atheism is forbidden. Some animists in remote
 parts of Indonesia have reportedly been pressured to convert
 to Islam or Christianity in order to fulfill the requirement
 of belief in a Supreme Being. There are no legal bars to
 religious conversion, and conversions between faiths do
 occur. However, proselytizing in heavily Islamic areas is
 seen as potentially disruptive and is discouraged. For this
 reason, restrictions on the activities of foreign
 missionaries, such as difficulty in obtaining or renewing
 visas or residence permits, have increased in such areas in
 recent years. In other areas, missionary activities are
 relatively unimpeded and in fact are welcomed in remoter
 districts where government resources in fields such as
 education and health are insufficient.
 Official holidays include Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist, as
 well as Muslim holy days. Indonesian Muslims, Christians, and
 Buddhists maintain active links with coreligionists outside
 Indonesia. Travel to religious gatherings is permitted. The
 Government organizes annual Hajj trips to Mecca for
 Indonesians wishing to undertake this pilgrimage.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Although movement within Indonesia generally is unimpeded,
 restrictions do exist. The Government requires permits to
 change residence in certain areas, primarily to control the
 further shift of population from rural to urban locations.
 Since 1958-59, ethnic Chinese have been denied the right to
 live in rural areas of Java. Travel to certain regions.
 including much of eastern Indonesia, requires a permit. There
 are also restrictions on movement to and within East Timor and
 within parts of Irian Jaya. Former political detainees
 associated with the abortive 1965 coup attempt are required to
 notify authorities of travel away from their homes. Members
 or alleged supporters of the PKI outside Indonesia have not
 been allowed to return except on a case-by-case basis. The
 Government has tried to keep track of all of the 2.5 million
 former members of the PKI and some 20 million members of its
 front groups. However, government statements indicate that it
 has lost track of several million of them (including fairly
 senior members.)
 The Government periodically restricts foreign travel of
 domestic critics and others in disfavor with the Government.
 An estimated 20,000 Indonesians are currently not permitted to
 leave the country. They include "Petition of 50" members
 critical of the Government, those arrested in the student
 riots of 1974, and others. However, other critics of the
 Government are free to travel abroad, and a person banned at
 one time may be permitted to travel subsequently. A
 Presidential Instruction in 1985 removed a requirement for
 students to obtain government permission before going abroad
 
 
 780
 INDONESIA
 to study. In July the Director General of Immigration
 announced that Indonesian students will no longer be permitted
 to study in 31 countries: those which are "Socialist-
 Communist;" those with which Indonesia has no diplomatic ties;
 and those termed "extremist," particularly Libya, Iraq, Syria,
 and Iran. Although many of the countries concerned protested
 this decision, it is unclear whether the Government has
 rescinded it.
 In October the Government announced that it will move 1,324
 "illegal immigrants" to the Island of Sumba. Most of these
 reportedly are Chinese who illegally reentered Indonesia after
 having left it for China in the 1960's. Government officials
 state that Sumba will be a temporary residence site until the
 countries of origin of these people agree to take them back.
 Earlier in the year .the press reported signs that the
 Government planned to settle up to 15,000 "illegal immigrant"
 families in Sumba.
 Under its humane refugee policy, Indonesia has given first
 asylum to over 95,000 Indochinese refugees since 1975. In
 cooperation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), the Government also has provided one of the region's
 three refugee processing centers, where Indochinese refugees
 who have landed in Indonesia, as well as those from other
 first asylum countries, are given training to prepare them for'
 permanent-residence in other countries.
 In 1985 residents of Irian Jaya continued to cross into
 territory of Papua New Guinea, but in much smaller numbers
 than in 1984. There currently are an estimated 10,000
 Irianese in refugee camps in Papua New Guinea. Most fled
 their homes in response to rebel warnings or threats of
 Government and OPM warfare or other disturbances in their home
 areas. Continued rebel allegations of Indonesian military
 reprisals against border crossers have kept most of them from
 returning to their homeland. Since 1984 the Indonesian and
 Papua New Guinea governments have worked together closely in
 an effort to resolve the border crosser problem and to ensure
 the peaceful return of Irianese to their homes. To date,
 however, less than a thousand have returned under government-
 sponsored programs. In late 1985, the Government agreed that
 any Irianese who wished to return to Irian Jaya were welcome,
 and those who did not were free to live where and how they
 wish.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government has its authority largely concentrated in the
 hands of a small group of active-duty and retired military
 officers and civilian technocrats led by President Soeharto.
 This system ensures the continued role of the military in all
 fields of governmental activity. The Parliament, political
 parties, and the general public have little ability to
 influence government decisions. However, particularly in
 budgetary matters, including military procurement, civilian
 technocrats exercise decisive influence, and government
 ministers are obliged to defend their departments' budgets and
 programs before parliamentary committees, the proceedings of
 which receive wide press coverage.
 All adult citizens, except active-duty members of the armed
 forces and convicted criminals serving prison sentences,,are
 eligible to vote in 1987 for the 400 elected memliers of
 
 
 781
 INDONESIA
 Parliament. In mid-1985 the Government announced that persons
 convicted of involvement in the 1965 PKI-inspired coup attempt
 may be permitted to vote for the first time under the New
 Order Government. To do so, however, they must pass a
 stringent government review of their current and past
 activities to ensure there is no lingering PKI taint.
 Elections for Parliament, held every 5 years, are scheduled
 for 1987. Currently, the military is represented in
 Parliament by 75 appointed members, who join the 360 elected
 members and 25 other appointed ones for a total of 460. In
 accordance with the 1985 law, in the 1987 election 400 members
 of Parliament will be elected; there will be 400 appointees,
 all from the military.
 The President is elected by the People's Consultative Assembly
 (MPR), which consists of Parliament plus an equal number of
 appointed members and sits in a special session every 5 years
 following the general parliamentary election.
 Parliament considers laws presented to it by government
 departments and agencies but does not draft laws on its own.
 The Government seeks to resolve any potential parliamentary
 concerns before the bills are officially presented to
 Parliament. Parliament can and does change the text and
 intent of bills it reviews. Bills of major significance,
 however, are often passed with little or no alteration.
 Usually Parliament works on the basis of consensus, not
 majority voting, to resolve any differing views during
 committee consideration of a bill.
 A 1975 law limits the number of political parties to three.
 One of these is made up of four former Muslim political
 parties and another of former nationalist and Christian
 parties. Members in these two parties occasionally reflect
 their earlier party affiliations, thereby exacerbating
 factional splits in their new parties. This is one factor
 weakening the parties' election prospects and diminishing
 their ability effectively to represent their constituents'
 concerns to the Government. The third, GOLKAR, is a
 longstanding, government-sponsored organization of functional
 groups which serves a role similar to that of a political
 party. In the three national elections since 1971, GOLKAR has
 won with more than 60 percent of the vote each time. Civil
 servants and their families are expected to vote for GOLKAR.
 Districts which support non-GOLKAR candidates may find
 government resources devoted to development projects in the
 area reduced. The two parties and GOLKAR are prohibited from
 organizing and operating officially below the district level
 except during election campaigns. Critics contend this system
 gives GOLKAR an advantage, since its civil service members
 have constant access to small towns and villages because of
 their official duties.
 The PKI and a formerly powerful Muslim party (MASYUMI) linked
 with separatist rebellions in the late 1950's are specifically
 banned. Members of the former and many leaders of the latter
 are not allowed to run for office or to be active politically.
 In 1985 even a family relationship to a person accused of
 Communist party sympathies or involvement could prevent one
 from running for office.
 
 
 782
 INDONESIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government considers outside investigations of alleged
 human rights to be interference in its internal affairs.
 Amnesty International representatives, for example, have been
 refused official access to Indonesia because of the
 organization's continued criticism of the Government and the
 Government's belief that it is biased. There is no local
 chapter of Amnesty International, although individual citizens
 may have memberships.
 In 1985 the Government concluded an agreement with the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) permitting it
 to: conduct an annual series of visit to prisoners detained
 in connection with the events in East Timor; provide medical
 and food aid to displaced persons on Atauro Island as well as
 to assess the situation of those persons returned to the main
 island after having been displaced in Atauro; carry out
 medical-nutritional surveys to vulnerable villages in East
 Timor; and continue efforts to reunite divided families in
 East Timor and abroad (mainly Portugal).
 In addition, the ICRC is permitted to visit prisoners
 convicted of participation in the PKI-backed attempted coup in
 1965.
 The Government largely declined to comment on the Amnesty
 International Report on East Timor issued in mid-1985 and
 refused to respond to any of the allegations made in it. In
 response to a European Parliament resolution condemning the
 execution of former PKI activists and a proposal to condemn
 human rights practices in Indonesia, the Indonesian Government
 sent a delegation to the Parliament to defend Indonesia's
 policies.
 A number of domestic organizations are concerned with human
 rights. The Department of Justice has an agency charged with
 the drafting of legal codes to replace the colonial laws still
 in effect. This agency also has responsibility for the
 establishment of legal documentation facilities and for
 programs to inform citizens of their legal rights. In
 addition, several state university law departments and private
 ,groups associated with mosques and churches are involved in
 providing legal counseling services. The trial lawyers
 association, Peradin, provides some free legal services to the
 disadvantaged.
 There are private legal aid organizations which help in cases
 of human rights violations by defending or representing
 aggrieved parties in court and by stimulating press attention
 and discussion. Several of these were prominent in defending
 persons charged in connection with rioting in Jakarta in
 1984. These private legal aid organizations have established
 offices in many larger Indonesian cities but they are
 dependent on donations. In 1985 the Government refused to
 permit a foreign donation to one of these legal aid groups.
 The Jakarta city government withdrew long-supplied funding to
 another, reportedly as a cost-cutting measure. The ORMAS bill
 requiring government approval of any foreign funding is
 expected to result in an overall reduction of contributions to
 these organizations.
 In its 1985 Report, Amnesty International expresses concern
 about continuing reports of extrajudicial executions,

 "disappearances," torture, and arbitrary arrests and detention
 on political grounds by the security forces. It was also
 especially concerned about alleged human rights violations in
 the aftermath of and related to the 1984 Tanjung Priok riots,
 and, in connection with the abortive 1965 coup, the continued
 detention of about 200 prisoners, a number of whom it believes
 may not have received fair trials. Freedom House rated
 Indonesia "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Indonesia is the fifth most populous country in the world and
 the largest nation in Southeast Asia, with a population in
 1985 estimated at 173,103,000. Although the population growth
 rate has been reduced to 2 percent, population pressure on
 the overcrowded islands of Java, Madura, and Bali continues to
 be a government concern. In an effort to reduce some of this
 pressure, and to develop more isolated parts of the country,
 the Government has an ambitious "transmigration" program which
 attempts to resettle farmers from overcrowded areas in less
 populous and usually more backward and remote areas.
 The memory of the economic and social chaos of the last years
 of the Sukarno regime continues to ensure that orderly social
 and economic development for all segments of society remains
 the New Order's primary goal. This goal is reiterated in the
 fifth principle of Pancasila, social justice, which is
 interpreted to mean that the basic human needs of all
 Indonesians should be satisfied without discrimination. While
 there continue to be great disparities in wealth and
 opportunity, under the Soeharto Government the benefits of
 development and improved economic conditions have been
 widespread. Although the Government has largely abandoned
 special programs designed to strengthen the "Pribumi" or
 ethnic Indonesian role in business, an increasing number of
 young ethnic Indonesians are now choosing business careers
 over civil service jobs.
 World Bank figures show the per capita gross national product
 (GNP) at $560 for 1983. Although agriculture is the most
 important domestic sector of the economy, accounting for more
 than 30 percent of the GNP and employing about 66 percent of
 the labor force, petroleum exports of 800,000 to 900,000
 barrels per day dominate the external economy. Economic
 growth continues at a moderate but steady pace but is expected
 to decline from 1984's 6 percent to about 3 percent for 1985.
 A continued soft international petroleum market and generally
 lower prices for commodities hindered more rapid economic
 growth. The World Bank estimates 26 percent of the urban
 population and 44 percent of the rural population were below
 the absolute poverty level in 1980, a sharp drop from 1970
 levels of 51 percent and 59 percent respectively.
 Agricultural output has increased significantly in recent
 years, about 3.8 percent per annum. A good harvest in 1985
 followed a remarkable increase in food production in 1984. In
 that year the country achieved self-sufficiency in rice
 production for the first time since independence, a feat
 repeated in 1985. Partly as a result of improving output, the
 percentage of caloric supply available for consumption
 relative to nutritional requirements was 110 in 1981.
 Community health standards remain low, although intensive
 government efforts are underway to train doctors and other
 health specialists and to provide medical facilities and

 supplies. Tuberculosis, mosquito-borne diseases, including
 malaria, and skin disease are endemic. In 1985, life
 expectancy at birth was 55 years, and the infant mortality
 rate was 89 per 1,000 live births. In 1981, 23 percent of the
 population (40 percent in urban areas and 19 percent in rural
 areas) had access to safe water.
 By 1981, virtually all primary school-age children were
 enrolled in schools, although the Government continues to face
 difficulty recruiting and keeping teachers for schools in
 isolated areas. In 1984, the President announced compulsory
 education through primary grades and encouraged wealthy
 Indonesians to "adopt" poorer students and help them pay for
 schooling. The World Bank estimates that as of 1981 total
 adult literacy stood at 67 percent--77 percent of men and 58
 percent of women; 83 percent of urban and 52 percent of rural
 dwellers.
 Employment of children under age 14 is forbidden by the basic
 labor law of 1948. The law also established an 8-hour day,
 48-hour week, 1 rest day per week, and a definite vacation
 period. An extensive body of labor law and ministerial
 regulations provides for minimum standards of industrial
 health and safety. In practice, these statutes are rarely
 observed.
 Indonesian law provides that the Department of Manpower Office
 in each region shall, at regular intervals, establish a
 minimum wage for its particular region. A new minimum wage
 for Jakarta, for example, was established in November 1985 at
 $1.18 per day. The range of regional minimum wages is from a
 high of $1.18 per day in some areas to a low of .500 per day
 in others. The Department of Manpower and the Central
 Statistical Office also report for each region a minimum
 physical needs figure.
 Indonesian women generally enjoy a high degree of economic and
 social freedom, and there is significant cultural latitude for
 women's participation in public life. Women occupy important
 mid-level positions in the civil service, educational
 institutions, labor unions, the military, the professions, and
 private business. The Cabinet named in 1983 includes two
 women: The Minister of State for Women's Affairs and the
 Minister for Social Affairs. Although legislation guarantees
 women equal treatment, women seldom receive equal pay for
 equal work. In addition to a government-sponsored women's
 organization in which membership and participation are
 mandatory, there are several voluntary, private groups which
 work to advance women's legal, economic and political rights.
 Chief among these is KOWANI (Congress of Indonesian Women), an
 umbrella organization for some 55 women's groups.
 Ethnic Chinese are pressured to adopt Indonesian customs and
 take Indonesian names. While they are also encouraged to
 become citizens, some Chinese find legal avenues to
 citizenship blocked or are discouraged by the time-consuming
 and expensive task of obtaining citizenship documents.
 Government regulations prohibit the operation of all-Chinese
 schools and institutions of higher learning, teaching in
 Chinese languages, the formation of exclusively Chinese
 cultural groups or trade associations, and the use of Chinese
 characters on signboards or in publications. However, social
 and religious groups which are in effect all Chinese are not
 proscribed and do exist.
