 ESTONIA
 After more than 50 years of Soviet occupation, Estonia regained
 its independence in 1991. On September 2, the United States
 Government, which had refused t6 recognize the forcible
 incorporation of Estonia into the Union of Soviet Socialist
 Republics (U.S.S.R.) in 1940, established formal diplomatic
 ties with the Estonian Government, and the Soviet Union itself
 recognized the independence of Estonia on September 6. Estonia
 was also admitted as a member of the United Nations in 1991.
 In early 1991, reactionary forces in the Soviet Union tried to
 intimidate and undermine the legitimate government of Estonia
 and, in August, forcibly to overthrow it as part of the
 attempted coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
 During an anonymous bombing campaign in January and February,
 several bombs exploded in Tallinn, including one on Toompea
 Hill, the seat of Estonia's Government. In January Moscow
 announced that it would commence "joint patrolling" of the
 streets of Tallinn by the Soviet military in conjunction with
 local militia. The Soviet garrison commander in Tallinn,
 however, did not carry out the directive. Interfront, a
 Moscow-sponsored political organization which ostensibly
 represents ethnic Russians in Estonia, issued ultimatums
 threatening both general strikes and other, unspecified
 "political actions." These threats were not carried out. The
 Interior Ministry's Black Beret special forces (OMON) attacked
 an Estonian customs post in the spring but no casualties
 occurred.
 Residents of Estonia confirmed their strong support for
 independence at the ballot box on March 3 in a nonbinding,
 "advisory" referendum. A convincing majority of voters favored
 independence. However, about 60 percent of Estonia's ethnic
 Russians (particularly those living in Estonia's northeastern
 border region with Russia) voted to remain in the U.S.S.R. The
 arrest of the coup leaders in Moscow in August marked the end
 of the attempted putsch in Estonia as well. Although the
 Estonian Government did not outlaw the Communist Party, it
 confiscated some of its property.
 Estonia is a parliamentary democracy. The highest legislative
 authority is the Supreme Council; its Chairman serves as Head
 of State. A prime minister, elected by the Supreme Council, is
 the chief executive official. Day-to-day government operatiohs
 are the responsibility of the Council of Ministers, elected by
 the Parliament and directed by the Prime Minister.
 The primary law enforcement organization is the Estonian
 police, newly organized'to replace the Soviet-period militia.
 Until independence, Soviet militia forces, Interior Ministry
 troops, and the Committee for State Security (KGB) were present
 in Estonia in large numbers and continued to monitor the local
 population. Since the coup, the KGB has been outlawed, and
 Soviet Interior Ministry troops are being'withdrawn. However,
 large concentrations of regular Soviet army troops remain on
 Estonian soil.
 Estonia enjoys a higher standard of living than the U.S.S.R.
 Nevertheless, the general Soviet economic decline has affected
 Estonia, leading to shortages and some rationing. Although the
 Estonian Government is gradually liberalizing the economy, many
 Soviet economic structures remain.
 The human rights situation improved as respect for the
 individual and for civil liberties increased. A constituent
 
 
 1100
 ESTONIA
 assembly is to draw up a new constitution which, together with
 additional legislation, should institutionalize human rights
 improvements and set the stage for new elections in 1992.
 Questions about the ramifications of possible changes in the
 citizenship law remain unresolved.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known cases of such killings in 1991.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Such practices are prohibited by law. However, prior to
 independence, prisons were administered according to Soviet
 practice. Harsh treatment of prisoners occurred during both
 interrogation and confinement in labor camps and prisons.
 Physical and psychological abuse of prisoners, overcrowding,
 and detention under extremely unhealthful conditions were
 common.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Estonian law forbids arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile.
 There were no known instances of Estonian authorities engaging
 in such activities. Warrants are required to make an arrest.
 In addition, detainees have access to legal counsel within 72
 hours of arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Estonian judicial system is based on a three tier court
 system: city courts, county courts, and the supreme court.
 The county courts and the supreme court are appellate courts.
 Court decisions are based on majority rule, with a judge and
 two jurors sitting in judgment.
 Until the August coup attempt, Soviet practice continued to
 prevail in Estonia, and the State retained the ability to
 control the judicial process and to determine arbitrarily the
 outcome of trials. Estonian authorities are now working to
 improve existing procedural safeguards and to establish a
 judicial system based on the rule of law.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Until Soviet Internal Ministry troops and the KGB departed
 Estonia in the wake of the August coup attempt, the Soviet
 security apparatus continued to operate in Estonia. Soviet
 security organs employed informers and technical means to
 monitor correspondence and telephone communications in selected
 cases. Estonian law requires a search warrant for search and
 seizure of property.

 ESTONIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Estonians enjoyed wide freedom of speech throughout 1991. The
 press in 1991 harshly criticized both the Estonian and Soviet
 Governments. Despite the seizure of the Tallinn television
 tower during the August coup attempt, the media were never
 silenced duking the coup or at any other time during 1991. The
 Government does not. ration newsprint. However, governhient-
 owned publications have access to newsprint at a lower price
 than privately ownedpublications. Estonia'has one state-oWned
 radio and television station. Private radio stations, however,
 are beginning to emerge around the country.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and ssociation
 The Constitution provides for the right to as'semble freely.
 Permits for all public gatherings must be obtained 3 weeks
 prior to the date of the public gathering. The authorities
 have wide discretion to prohibit such gatherings but seldom
 exercise it. In 1991 numerous mass gatherings took place
 peacefully without government interference.
 c. Freedom-of Religion
 Freedom of conscience and freedom of religious proselytism are
 guaranteed by law and honored in practice. There were no known
 instances of discrimination based on religious belief.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The law permits free movement within the country; it is honored
 in practice. Prior to independence, Soviet law and practice
 governed foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, although
 Soviet authorities did not appear.to hinder such travel in
 1991.- Estonian law guarantees the right of repatriation.
 After the U.S.S.R. recognized Estonian independence, Soviet
 border officials cooperated with Estonian authorities in
 transferring border controls to Estonia. Until trained
 Estonian replacements are available, Soviet border guards
 continue to function at most ports of entry.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Despite the best efforts of reactionary forces in Moscow to
 undermine and overthrow Estonia's legitimately elected
 Government, the country achieved full independence in 1991.
 During the August coup attempt, the Estonian Government
 announced that it would form a constituent assembly to draft a
 new constitution and that new elections would be held in late
 1992 after the adoption of the constitution. The ad hoc
 assembly, the members of which were chosen by the Supreme
 Council and the Congress of Estonia (representing the citizens
 of the pre-1940 Estonian republic and their descendants), was
 established in September. The Constitution has been drafted
 and was adopted in December by the Constituent Assembly.
 However, implementing legislation is still being drafted.
 Several political parties and movements offering a broad array
 of viewpoints are in active competition. There is no
 
 
 1102
 ESTONIA
 discrimination, in law or in practice, against the
 participation of women in government or politics.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 Estonia welcomed visits by human rights organizations and
 received a delegation from the U.S. Commission on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited by the Constitution. Tensions are present, however,
 in the relationship between ethnic Estonians and the large
 Russian population in Estonia. During the years of forcible
 incorporation into the U.S.S.R., thousands of non-Estonians
 emigrated to Estonia to work as laborers and administrators.
 Today, Estonians constitute approximately 63 percent of the
 population.
 Not surprisingly, the issue of citizenship is at the center of
 politics. In November the Parliament voted to reestablish the
 1938 citizenship law and asked the Government to propose
 implementing legislation. This legislation will specify the
 residence and language requirements for citizenship, a matter
 of deep concern to non-Estonian residents. Non-Estonians,
 especially Russians, have alleged job, salary, and housing
 discrimination based on Estonian-language requirements for
 certain jobs.
 Women possess the same legal rights as men and, in addition,
 have significant day-care and maternity benefits. Women also
 are legally entitled to equal pay for equal work. Statistics
 are not available on violence against women. Women's rights
 organizations have been formed in Estonia and are attempting to
 increase public awareness of women's issues.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Soviet labor law and practice were enforced in Estonia until
 the August coup attempt. Since that time, Estonia has moved to
 reform its labor code to permit the formation of independent
 trade unions, and, in January 1992, it rejoined the
 International Labor Organization. Several political strikes
 took place during 1991 without police interference.
 The major trade union, formerly the Estonian branch of the sole
 Soviet labor confederation, is now a purely Estonian
 organization and is seeking to reform itself under the name of
 the Central Organization of Estonian Trade Unions (EAKL). It
 claims about 650,000 members organized in 34 unions. A smaller
 rival Confederation of Free Trade Unions has also been formed
 recently.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under Soviet law, Estonian workers did not enjoy the right to
 bargain collectively. Under the old system, the union was
 essentially an arm of the Cominunist Party, with the function of
 distributing fringe benefits such as housing and vacation
 
 
 1103
 ESTONIA
 trips. Both the employers and the unions were organs of the
 State and Party system.
 Although Estonian workers now have the right to bargain
 collectively, the private sector is only beginning to emerge,
 and collective bargaining is still virtually nonexistent. The
 EAKL still looks to the Government to resolve labor issues.
 Early in 1991, before Estonia declared its independence, the
 Estonian Government consulted with the EAKL before establishing
 a new minimum wage.
 No export processing zones have been established.
 q. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor was common in Soviet-administered Estonian
 prisons prior to August. Conditions in these prisons were
 often harsh and degrading. Estonia has moved quickly to
 improve conditions since August.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 According to labor law prevailing in Estonia, the statutory
 minimum age for employment is 16. Minimum age and compulsory
 education laws are enforced by state authorities through
 inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor conditions in Estonia are similar to but usually better
 than those in the Soviet Union. Under Estonian law, the
 maximum permitted work week is 41 hours. The average workweek
 is 40 hours for most white-collar workers and 41 hours for most
 blue-collar workers.
 According to union sources, the minimum wage rate agreed to in
 early 1991 between the EAKL and the Government was overtaken by
 inflation by the end of the year. The EAKL states that a rate
 three times the existing one is required to provide a minimum
 standard of living. 'The law establishes minimum standards of
 occupational health and safety, which are widely ignored.
