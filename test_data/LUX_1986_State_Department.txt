 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary
 form of government. Executive power is vested in the Grand
 Duke and a cabinet consisting of nine ministers. Legislative
 power rests with the Chamber of Deputies, elected every
 5 years. Bills are submitted for advice to the 21-member
 Council of State appointed by the Grand Duke.
 Police forces are organized by municipal authorities. The
 Gendarmerie is responsible for security throughout the country.
 Luxembourg's highly developed economy and free enterprise
 system place heavy emphasis on steel production, financial
 services (especially banking), radio and television
 broadcasting, and tourism.
 With its long tradition of democratic government, Luxembourg
 ensures that human rights are respected at home and works
 actively to promote human rights internationally. Luxembourg
 continues efforts to treat its large foreign population
 fairly. The independent labor unions are prominent in
 decisionmaking, in both industrial relations and government
 policies.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political reasons by the Government or opposition
 political organizations is unknown in Luxembourg. The
 mysterious bombings directed against public buildings and
 facilities in 1985 continued in early 1986, resulting in
 property damage but no personal injuries. One bomb exploded
 outside the home of the retired chief of the Gendarmerie. No
 group has claimed responsibility for the bombings. Thus far
 there is no evidence linking the bombings to international
 terrorist groups.
 b. Disappearance
 Governmental or officially sanctioned abduction or secret
 arrest did not occur.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law and is not practiced. Prisoners
 are fairly treated, are free to choose their own attorneys,
 and are allowed visitors. Luxembourg has a modern prison
 facility.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Luxembourg law is a composite of local
 practice, legal tradition, and foreign systems--French,
 Belgian, and German. Preventive detention does not exist.
 Defendants must be charged no later than 24 hours after
 arrest. Persons can be incarcerated pending trial, if so
 ordered by a judge. Exile is not imposed, nor is there forced
 labor.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Luxembourg's judiciary is independent and free from executive
 or military interference. There are military courts, but
 civilians are not subject to their jurisdiction. All
 defendants have the right to legal counsel. Criminal charges
 are formally and clearly stated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police must have a warrant, issued by the judiciary, to enter
 a private home. Statutes prohibit other violations of the
 home such as demolition, sealing doors and windows, and
 electronic surveillance. The privacy of correspondence is
 universally respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press.
 Except for reasonable legal restrictions against pornography,
 there is no media censorship. The Government does not
 interfere with public criticism or academic inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is guaranteed by
 the Constitution and respected in practice. There are no
 limitations on orderly public meetings. No groups are denied
 the right of free assembly.
 Unions have the right to organize, negotiate, and strike,
 although strikes are virtually unknown. Unions participate as
 equal partners in a tripartite arrangement with the Government
 and employers in all decisionmaking affecting the economy and
 workers' welfare. The two largest industrial unions are linked
 to, but organized independent of, Luxembourg's Socialist Party
 and Christian Social Party respectively. A large percentage
 of the work force belongs to labor unions, but membership is
 in no case compulsory. Unions and professional groups maintain
 unrestricted contact with international bodies in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Luxembourg does not have a state religion, and there is no
 discrimination against practitioners of any religious faith.
 The population is statistically 99 percent Roman Catholic.
 A consensus with church teachings often surfaces on social
 issues; for example, there is no government funding for
 abortions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Luxembourg,
 foreign travel, or emigration and repatriation. There are no
 barriers to applicants for immigration from countries of the
 European Community (EC), with the exception of Portugal. The
 status of Portuguese citizens in Luxembourg--since 1970,
 Luxembourg has had a large Portuguese population--is
 guaranteed by bilateral agreements and their right to
 immigrate is now determined by the terms of Portugal's

 accession to the EC in January 1986. Although Luxembourg is
 not a country of first application for refugees, government
 officials believe that, on a per capita basis within the EC,
 relatively liberal numbers of refugees (notably Vietnamese)
 have been admitted. Once admitted, refugees benefit from
 state social programs and are well treated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All Luxembourg citizens 18 years of age and older may
 participate in national and local elections. Luxembourg's
 sizable foreign resident population (26 percent) does not have
 the right to vote, although it enjoys other civil and
 political rights, including the rights of free speech, press,
 assembly, movement, and religion. Foreign residents may also
 join organizations such as labor unions, which exert
 considerable indirect influence on the political process.
 Women holding prominent political positions include the leader
 of the opposition Liberal Party and the mayor of Luxembourg
 City.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Luxembourg governments have consistently supported
 international and nongovernmental investigation of alleged
 violations of human rights. The Red Cross, Amnesty
 International, and the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees have representatives in Luxembourg.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Luxembourg is notably free of general forms of discrimination.
 Adequate food, shelter, health care, and education are
 available to all inhabitants regardless of race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. Women in
 increasing numbers participate in the political process and in
 the financial and business communities, although few women in
 Luxembourg are senior executives.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The right to work is guaranteed to every Luxembourger by the
 Constitution. Luxembourg has one of the highest per capita
 incomes in the European Community, with workers and their
 families enjoying a decent living standard. Luxembourg law
 adequately protects the safety and health of workers. The
 normal workweek is 40 hours, spread over 5 workdays. Work on
 Sunday is generally prohibited, except in continuous process
 industries (e.g., steel and chemicals) and for certain
 individuals, such as maintenance and security personnel. The
 employment of children under the age of 16 is prohibited.
 Worker representatives are required in all businesses of 15 or
 more employees. In businesses with over 150 employees, 50
 percent of the joint works councils are elected by the
 employees. In businesses with more than 1,000 employees,
 one-third of the membership of the boards of directors must be
 employees or their elected representatives.
