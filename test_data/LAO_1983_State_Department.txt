 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic is ruled by a Communist
 government established in December 1975 after an insurgency of
 20 years supported by North Vietnam. The regime takes its
 political ideology from Marx, Lenin and Ho Chi Minh. It is
 dependent on Vietnamese and Soviet military and economic
 support to retain power. There are about 50,000 Vietnamese
 troops in Laos. The country is ruled by a single political
 party, the Lao People's Revolutionary Party. The Government's
 insecurity and efforts to establish a Communist political and
 economic structure based on the Soviet and Vietnamese models
 have resulted in numerous human rights violations.
 Laos' estimated 3.6 million ethnically diverse people,
 scattered over more than 91,000 square miles of rugged terrain,
 have no common national history and share few common values.
 National institutions remain weak. There is no constitution or
 codified body of law. No national elections have been held
 since the establishment of the regime.
 Laos is an extremely poor and backward country which gained
 independence from France in 1954. Laos found itself on the
 frontier between the Communist and non-Communist worlds and
 among major regional rivals, Thailand and Vietnam. Factional
 fighting among the Communist Pathet Lao, Neutralists, and
 Royalists lasted until the communist victory in 1975. Regional
 and domestic political tension, scattered anti-government
 resistance activity, and poor economic conditions continue,
 contributing to a siege mentality on the part of the
 narrowly-based Lao leadership. The state security apparatus,
 which reinforces central control through threats, fear,
 intimidation and imprisonment, is a primary source of abuses of
 human rights in Laos.
 There is considerable evidence, which the United Nations has
 investigated, that toxin/chemical weapons have been used
 against Hmong tribespeople in Laos by the Government and/or
 Vietnamese forces. In 1983 there was a general decrease in the
 lethality of verified attacks and the use of toxic agents. The
 Government has refused to permit U.N. investigators on its
 territory.
 After taking over in 1975, the new regime arrested many
 officials of the former Government and sent them to prisons it
 referred to as "re-education camps," remote from the capital.
 Some of these officials died in these camps, some were
 subsequently released, but a number are still being held.
 Although many officals of the previous Government remained at
 their posts after 1975, the arrests frightened a large
 percentage of the small middle class, including Chinese and
 Vietnamese urban traders and artisans, who fled the country.
 Since 1975, more than 300,000 persons, or nearly eight percent
 of the population, have fled Laos but the rate of departures
 has dropped significantly in recent years. The departure of a
 significant portion of the skilled middle class has held back
 economic progress, as have the Government's preoccupation with
 political and military security and its mistrust of the few
 well-educated persons who have remained. The nation's
 mountainous geography, pronounced ethnic cleavages, and lack of
 support for the Government among the populace also make
 progress difficult.

 826
 Human rights violations, such as arbitrary arrests and
 detention without trial, continued in 1983. The individual
 remains subject to the arbitrary control of the state and the
 Communist Party, and capricious officials. Lao culture,
 however, emphasizes humane values which tends to mitigate
 somewhat the totalitarian nature of the regime.
 Compared with the period just after the Communist take over, in
 1983, there have been a few limited improvements in some human
 rights in Laos, although very serious abuses persist. The
 Government has suspended its policy of forced agricultural
 collectivization. Fewer people have apparently been sent to
 "re-education camps," some have been released, and the
 conditions of some who remain under detention have been
 improved.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Reports continued in 1983 of villagers, particularly Hmong
 tribespeople, being killed by Government and/or Vietnamese
 forces using toxic weapons. The number of toxic agent related
 deaths and illnesses in 1983 decreased. There are reports that
 Lao Government and Vietnamese patrols have fattally shot both
 person fleeing from Laos and those entering the country
 illegally--usually smugglers or suspected members of the
 anti-government resistance. An unknown number of people are
 killed annually in combined Lao/Vietnamese military operations
 against resistance forces. There are recurrent reports of
 attacks involving killings in isolated areas on vehicles
 bearing government officials and buses. These are attributed
 to resistance elements but have also involved ordinary
 robberies of the buses. Resistance groups have also reportedly
 killed a few aid experts from other Communist countries.
 Official policy calls for the execution of resistance leaders,
 but no such executions were reported in 1983. Amnesty
 Internations in its 1983 report expressed concern about reports
 in 1982 that some political prisoners had been taken away from
 "re-education camps" and were alleged to have been executed.
 b.   Disappearance
 Although there were numerous cases of secret arrest and removal
 of persons to "re-education" camps in the first years of the
 present regime, disappearance has been reported only rarely in
 the last several years and not at all in 1983.
 c.   Torture, Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of torture for the past four years.
 Former "re-education camp" inmates have reported that
 conditions for political prisoners varied considerably from
 camp to camp, but all were primitive, and had limited medical
 facilities and poor food. Families were generally able to
 exchange letters with inmates; in some cases, wives (and
 children) were allowed to join their husbands at the camps or
 nearby villages for extended periods. Former inmates reported
 that punishment for misbehavior could include brutal public
 
 
 827
 beatings, shackling, deprivation of food, and sometimes, for
 those who tried to escape, execution. Some inmates died from
 malnutrition. Lao Government officials have publicly denied
 reports of mistreatment of persons in the "re-education camps."
 Laos also has ordinary prisons and prison work camps where
 those awaiting trial or convicted of crimes are held together
 with persons accused of undefined political offenses.
 Conditions are said to be spartan.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Lao Government continues to maintain a number of
 "re-education camps" in which persons associated with the
 previous Government are imprisoned. Figures on those
 incarcerated are unavailable. In 1975 and 1976 thousands of
 Lao citizens (as well as a fe(4 foreign residents) were arrested
 and sent, without public hearing or trial, to remote camps for
 "re-education."
 According to information obtained from refugees, in 1980 there
 were at least 20 "re-education camps" with a total population
 of more than 15,000 inmates (including family members). The
 camps are concentrated in the Viengsai area and Houa Phan
 Province near the Vietnamese border, in the Plain of Jars, near
 Ban Ban in Xieng Khouang Province, and in Saravane and Attopeu
 Provinces in south Laos. Information collected on 4,182
 inmates indicated that 3,134 were former soldiers (of whom 982
 held the rank of major and above), 564 were former policemen,
 and 350 were former government officials.
 Since 1979, at least three "re-education camps" have been
 closed. People continue to be released from the remaining
 camps. Some, however, are required to remain and work in
 remote parts of the country because they either are on
 probation or cannot arrange the necessary travel documents from
 the Government. Others who have lost their property and
 families are reported to have chosen to remain in areas near
 the camps to begin new lives. There is said to be a "special
 camp" located close to the Vietnamese border for persons who
 resist "re-education." A Government official told a press
 conference during Australian Foreign Minister Hayden's visit in
 1983 that "only a few" people remained under detention in the
 camps and that most will be released by 1985. In December the
 same official claimed to a reporter that all reeducation camps
 had been closed. It has not been possible to verify the
 accuracy of this statement.
 Those accused of hostility to the regime or of what the
 Government calls "socially undesirable habits" such as
 prostitution, drug abuse, idleness, and "wrong thought" are
 sent to "rehabilitation" centers, usually without trial. Most
 of these persons have been allowed to return to their homes
 after periods ranging from a few months to several years of
 hard labor, political indoctrination, and admission of guilt.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No code of law exists in Laos and there is no guaranteed due
 process of law. The Government is in the process of revising
 the pre-1975 law code. In the meantime, it has promulgated
 interim rules and regulations for the arrest and trial of those
 accused of specific crimes, including armed resistance to the
 
 
 828
 Government. These regulations were disseminated to local
 authorities in October 1978, primarily to correct the haphazard
 way in which they were carrying out their duties. Although the
 regulations allow the accused to make a statement presenting
 his side of the case, they provide no real opportunity for the
 accused to defend himself and do not permit bail or use of an
 attorney. Rather, the Government has issued instructions on
 how to investigate, prosecute, and punish wrongdoers. These
 instructions are applied capriciously and inconsistently.
 People can be arrested on the accusation of others and detained
 while the accusations are investigated. Those arrested are not
 always informed of the charges against them, and investigations
 often take a long time unless family members and friends take a
 strong interest in the cases. Influential government officials
 and their families can easily influence the judgments reached.
 There is some provision for appeal, except that important
 political cases tried by "people's courts" are without appeal.
 Death sentences must be approved by the Council of Ministers.
 Lao regulations call for judgment to be given in public. This
 is, in effect, a public announcement of the sentence not a
 public trial.
 f.   Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search and seizure are authorized by the security bureaus
 themselves rather than by an impartial judicial authority, and
 Government regulations, which are not always followed, provide
 little protection for the individuals affected. Both
 international and domestic mail is selectively opened on a
 routine basis. Mail from China and the non-communist countries
 is particularly suspect. Telephone calls are frequently
 monitored. Privately owned land may not be sold but can be
 inherited. Houses, appliances, and other private property can
 be sold only with difficulty in most cases since the possession
 of large amounts of cash in this poor country draws immediate
 government suspicion. Inheritances cannot be passed on to
 relatives who have left the country as refugees and acquired
 another nationality. Lao are rarely permitted to study or
 train in non-communist countries even at their own expense.
 Only government officials and others whom the Government
 determines have a professional need are allowed to possess
 non-Communist foreign newpapers, magazines, and other
 publications. The Government, however, makes no attempt to
 stop Lao from watching Thai television or listening to foreign
 radio stations like the Voice of America. The state security
 apparatus monitors family life extensively through a system of
 neighborhood wardens and informers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Peaceful Speech and Press
 The Lao press is owned by the Government and party and used to
 disseminate official positions. Written or spoken opposition
 to the the Government is not permitted. Some persons who have
 engaged in such activity have been jailed. Most Lao are
 intimidated into avoiding discussion or association with
 foreigners. Academic freedom does not exist.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 
 
 829
 The Government controls all meetings and, except for religious
 and athletic events, organizes them. Individuals do not have
 the right to join together to promote causes not sponsored by
 the regime or to protest government policies. All associations
 are government controlled and authorized "mass organizations"
 such as those for youth, women and worker and a "peace
 organization." These are organized to exercise government
 control and disseminate government policy. All professional
 groups are organized by the party, and their leadership is
 ordinarily drawn from party ranks. Trade unions are organized
 as "mass organizations" of the Government and have no real
 influence in determining working conditions. Lao associations
 are permitted to maintain relations with like-minded
 organizations in other countries, particularly those in
 Communist countries.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Nearly all Lao are Buddhists or, in the case of some hill
 tribes, animist. The Government has taken over some Buddhist
 and Christian places of worship for use as political
 indoctrination centers or warehouses, but in 1983, construction
 of Buddhist temples increased and in general they were more
 actively used than in 1982. The number of monks has
 increased. A new Roman Catholic bishop coadjutor of Vientiane
 was consecrated and several Protestants were released from
 "re-education" in 1983. One local Roman Catholic church leader
 has been in jail for the past two and a half years for alleged
 anti-government activity.
 In official statements, the Government has recognized the right
 of the people to religious belief as well as the contributions
 religion can make to the development of the country. Many Lao,
 however, believe that the Government has begun a long-term
 effort to subvert the role of religion--in part because it
 considers the maintenance of temples and the activities of
 monks non-productive. This effort includes carefully
 controlling the education of young monks and compelling the
 Buddhist clergy to propagate some elements of Marxist-Leninist
 doctrine. Monks, however, are the only remaining social group
 still entitled to special honorific terms of address, and even
 high party and government officials continue to use them.
 Religious festivals are permitted to take place without
 hindrance. Young people regularly enter into religious orders
 for short periods. Links may be maintained with
 co-religionists and religious associations only in countries
 approved by the Government, usually other Communist countries.
 Traditional links to Thai Buddhists are no longer permitted.
 In theory, missionaries are not banned from entering Laos to
 prosyletize, but in most cases they have been denied
 permission. Many top party officials still participate in
 religious ceremonies, but the military are forbidden even to
 have Buddhist funerals.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Lao citizens must obtain permission from the authorities for
 all internal travel of any distance and in all cases when
 crossing provincial boundaries. A curfew exists in the
 capital and other major cities. Its rules change from time to
 time, as does its enforcement. Government officials have
 cited threats of "disorders" created by "reactionary" elements
 
 
 830
 as the reason for the restrictions.
 Foreign travel is permitted for officials, students in
 government-approved programs, and some others who have access
 to foreign exchange. In 1983 there was a noticeable increase
 in the number of Lao permitted to travel abroad. Border
 crossing permits are available for those with business in
 Thailand. Although the Lao Government has said that those
 wishing to emigrate will be allowed to so do, as a practical
 matter legal emigration is rarely authorized for ethnic Lao
 and, when it is reportedly requires substantial bribes. Since
 1975, about 281,500 of the Lao who have fled Laos and
 registered as refugees in Thailand.
 Some of those fleeing are fired upon and some killed by Lao,
 Vietnamese, or Thai border patrols as they attempt to cross
 the Mekong river. Many Lao caught seeking to leave illegally
 have been imprisoned, although in some cases they have only
 been sent to short indoctrination seminars and then released.
 The Lao and Thai Governments have agreed to take back, on a
 case-by-case basis, those of their respective citizens who
 have illegally crossed into the other country and wish to
 return home. From May 1980, when agreement was reached with
 Thailand and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) on a voluntary repatriation program, to May 1983,
 2,263 Lao refugees voluntarily returned to Laos under the
 auspices of the UNHCR. The Lao Government suspended the
 program after May 1983, citing logistical problems, but
 repatriation resumed in November 1983. Those accepted for
 return receive several days of political indoctrination and
 are then released to return to their homes, where they are
 placed under the control of village authorities. The UNHCR
 provides basic necessities and monitors treatment and living
 conditions thereafter. Perhaps 4,000 to 5,000 refugees have
 repatriated themselves without official involvement. There
 appears to be no pattern of official harassment or
 maltreatment of these voluntary returnees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Laos is ruled by a small elite of the Lao People's
 Revolutionary Party, the sole party. There is neither freedom
 to participate in politics outside the party, nor popular
 choice of policies or officials. After the Communists seized
 power in May in 1975 but before the establishment of the
 present regime in December of that year, local elections were
 held in which voters chose from a list of candidates selected
 by the party. Representatives to the Lao People's Supreme
 Council were subsequently reported to have been chosen by
 those local officials, although this process was not made
 public. There have been no national elections. A few
 "by-elections" have been organized to replace representatives
 who have died or been transferred.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Laos has refused to cooperate with the U.N. Secretary
 General's committee of experts in their investigation of the
 use of chemical/toxin weapons in Laos. Hmong refugees
 
 
 831
 continue to report attacks against them with toxic agents,
 apparently by Lao and/or Vietnamese military forces with
 Soviet assistance. The lethality of verified attacks and use
 of toxic agents decreased in 1983. Since September 1981,
 organic samples containing such agents have added to the
 evidence that chemical/toxin weapons have been used within
 Laos. The Lao Government has denied the use of such weapons.
 International efforts to gather information, to express
 concern over these reports, and to seek an impartial
 international investigation continue. A team of United
 Nations investigators stated in December 1982 that, "it could
 not disregard the circumstantial evidence suggestive of the
 possible use of some sort of toxic chemical substance in some
 instances." Other countries have urged Laos to accede to the
 Geneva Protocol of 1925 on such weapons, but have received no
 response.
 Laos does not cooperate with private international
 organizations interested in human rights. Amnesty
 International in its 1983 report expressed concern that in
 1982 large numbers of people continued to be detained in
 "re-education camps," most of them for over seven years
 without charges or trial, because of their political
 activities or positions under the former government. Amnesty
 also expressed concern that some political prisoners had been
 taken from the camps and were alleged to have been executed,
 and it decried the lack of legal safeguards for people
 detained on political grounds. Freedom House in its 1983
 report stated that Laos was "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In 1983 the economic and social situation improved with a
 slowing of the forced socialization of the economy and
 inflation. The value of the kip stabilized until late in the
 year when it dropped about 13 percent, and the 1982-83 rice
 crops was sufficient to meet domestic consumption.
 Approximately half of the population in Laos is ethnic Lao,
 also called "lowland Laol" 20 percent are tribal Thai; 15
 percent are Phoutheung (or Kha); and other mountain tribes
 constitute another 15 percent (Hmong, Yao and others). The
 Lao Government is attempting to integrate these groups and
 overcome traditional antagonisms between lowland Lao and
 minority groups.
 The Hmong are split along clan lines. Many were strongly
 anti-communist, but others sided with the Communist Pathet Lao
 and the Vietnamese. The Government is repressive toward all
 groups that fought against it, especially those who continue
 to resist its authority by force. The Hmong have a strong
 military tradition and have attempted to defend some of their
 tribal areas. Vietnamese and Lao armed forces have conducted
 military operations to dislodge them from their strongholds.
 Refugees report that large numbers of women and children were
 killed in bombing raids in previous years and that captured
 Hmong soldiers were dealt with harshly and in some cases
 killed.
 The Government wants to resettle some ethnic minorities who
 now inhabit mountainous areas in the lowlands, where they
 would be under government control and engage in settled
 agricultural production. Force has been used to move some
 
 
 832
 tribal groups. The Government has reportedly abandoned such
 efforts in favor of a voluntary program based on material
 inducements.
 There has also been a Government campaign to suppress
 resistance from lowland Lao groups, mainly in southern Laos,
 around Vientiane, and in northwest Laos. Many of the
 insurgents appear to be former Royal Lao Army troops. Both
 sides are reported to use brutal tactics, with the
 anti-government forces attempting assassination and ambush of
 Lao, Vietnamese, and other communist military and civilian
 personnel.
 Deterioriation in Sino-Lao relations has resulted in
 increasing Lao Government suspicion of and surveillance of
 local Chinese. The Government so far has not persecuted or
 expelled Chinese although it allows them to emigrate rather
 freely; in fact, the majority of Chinese in Laos in 1975 have
 since left on their own, largely for economic reasons. Those
 who remain have maintained the Chinese school in Vientiane and
 Chinese associations.
 About 85 percent of the population of Laos is engaged in
 agriculture. Per capita gross national product (GNP) is
 variously estimated at from about $100 to $220. The country's
 economic problems are complicated by inadequate internal
 transport and isolation from the sea. The avowed aim of the
 Government is economic self-sufficiency and improved
 conditions for the people through a socialist transformation
 of the economy, including collectivization of agriculture.
 Earlier coercion of farmers to join agricultural cooperatives
 caused some lowland farmers to leave the country. The
 formation of new cooperatives has since been slowed, and the
 Government has declared that farmers will not be forced to
 join collectives but economic incentives are given to those
 who join. The Government has nationalized most industries and
 has at times tried to impose strict controls on urban private
 enterprise. Private trade is allowed to continue, however,
 because it still constitutes the principal and most efficient
 way to distribute goods. In 1983 there were unsuccessful
 attempts to impose majority (51 percent) government ownership
 on some private businesses, mostly restaurants.
 Laos continues to experience serious foreign exchange
 difficulties and has difficulties in paying its import bills
 for many necessities, including fuel. Natural and man-made
 problems continue to hold timber and coffee exports far below
 their potential. In addition, the Government has used these
 commodities and minerals to pay for aid from Soviet bloc
 countries, rather than selling them for hard currency.
 Partial restrictions on trade through Thailand may have played
 a role in these developments.
 Health conditions are poor. In 1976 infant mortality was
 about 204 per 1000 live births according to government
 figures. Life expectancy at birth was approximately 45
 years. The estimated overall population growth rate is 2.3
 percent. According to government statistics, in 1982 there
 were only 226 physicians and 1184 medics in the country.
 Major causes of death in Laos are gastrointestinal diseases
 from unsafe drinking water, malaria, respiratory infections,
 and malnutrition. The Government is attempting to improve
 public health by training more personnel in basic health care,
 
 
 833
 improving water supplies, modernizing 13 provincial hospitals,
 constructing clinics in all districts, inoculating against
 cholera and other diseases, and promoting adult education on
 preventive hygiene.
 Lao authorities are also continuing a campaign to reduce
 illiteracy, and the Government has claimed that illiteracy has
 been eliminated in some provinces. The official claim of 60
 percent adult literacy (85 percent between ages 15 and 45)
 seems exaggerated. The World Bank estimated the literacy rate
 at 41 percent in 1980. The Government carries out an
 intensive program of adult education aimed at indoctrinating
 adults along "socialist lines." Approximately 93 percent of
 children aged 5-14 are said to attend school regularly. Their
 training of teachers has usually been rudimentary, however.
 According to some accounts, in provincial areas the time
 teachers must devote to supplementing their meager salaries
 causes them to reduce classroom hours substantially.
 Emphasis in higher education is placed on training technicians
 and engineers to work on development projects. Thousands of
 Lao students have been sent abroad for training in the
 U.S.S.R., Vietnam, and Eastern Europe. The pool of trained
 manpower in Laos is gradually increasing as students begin to
 return from abroad, but some do not find jobs in their areas
 of training.
 The role of women in Lao society has traditionally been
 subservient to that of men, but discrimination is not highly
 pronounced. Lao women are currently being encouraged to take
 an increasing part in economic and state-controlled political
 activity.
