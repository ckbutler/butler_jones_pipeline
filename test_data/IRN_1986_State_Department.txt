 IRAN*
 The human rights situation in Iran in 1986 was exacerbated
 by the ongoing war with Iraq, a war which began in 1980 and
 continues with little hope for an end in the near future. The
 war has resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties,
 massive population displacement and refugee problems for the
 Government, and billions of dollars of loss due to missile and
 bombing attacks. Costly in human and economic terms to both
 sides, the Iranian refusal to negotiate a settlement with the
 present Iraqi regime has caused a prolongation of hostilities
 which are severely disruptive and affect every facet of
 civilian life. Insurgency in the ethnic Kurdish area of Iran
 and urban terrorism by groups opposed to the Khomeini regime
 also cause civilian casualties and property damage. Seemingly
 random bomb attacks, often perpetrated by these groups in
 strictly civilian and public places, only add to the violence
 and suffering caused by the war.
 Iran is officially an Islamic Republic under the leadership of
 Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini. Its formal system, based
 on the Constitution approved in 1980 by popular referendum,
 follows a parliamentary pattern with a legislature, the
 Majles, and a president elected from among multiple candidates
 by universal suffrage. However, only candidates meeting
 highly restrictive religious and political criteria are
 permitted to contest elections, and the choice offered to
 voters is limited. The regime's hold on power is reinforced
 through arrests, executions, and other forms of intimidation.
 The regime is dominated by a political elite composed of Shi'a
 Muslim clerics who support Khomeini and of laymen aligned with
 these clerics. The regime, however, is not monolithic, and
 there are major differences on theology and on economic issues
 such as private property ownership, government versus private
 control of foreign trade, industrial policy, and strategy for
 the war with Iraq.
 Eight years after the 1979 ouster of the Shah and the advent
 of the Islamic Revolution, the Iranian regime still considers
 itself revolutionary but must grapple with the need to revive
 the economy and operate political and social institutions,
 both new and old, in a productive manner. Iran is an oil-rich
 developing country. The disruptions of the revolutionary
 period and the war have caused serious economic deterioration.
 Inflation and unemployment are high, and corruption and black
 market activities flourish.
 Although the trend is toward greater adherence to
 constitutional guarantees of human rights, particularly since
 December 1982, Iran's human rights record in 1986 continued to
 show serious abuses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reliable statistics were not available on the number of people
 killed for political or religious reasons in 1986. Due to the
 * Because of the absence of a United States Mission in Iran,
 this report draws heavily on unofficial sources.
 
 
 1157
 IRAN
 lack of procedural safeguards for defendants tried in
 revolutionary courts, which handle virtually all political
 cases, most of the executions ordered each year by such courts
 amount to summary executions. It is also difficult to
 separate cases of executions for participation in violent
 activities or narcotics trafficking from executions based
 purely on the defendants' beliefs, statements, and
 associations, given the regime's practice of cloaking the
 latter category with trumped-up charges from the former.
 In its 1986 Report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the continuing large-scale executions of prisoners in
 Iran for both political and nonpolitical offenses and said it
 had learned of 470 executions in 1985. Noting that executions
 on political grounds were rarely made public in Iran, Amnesty
 International expressed its belief that the actual number of
 executions was considerably higher than the 470 of which it
 was informed.
 Political killings have also been perpetrated by opposition
 groups, including the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, which appears to be
 the most active antiregime organization in Iran.
 b. Disappearance
 No information is available on the number of disappearances
 in 1986.
 Disappearances are seldom permanent in Iran. People are
 arbitrarily arrested or carried off, held without charge, and
 some are summarily executed; the society, however, is not
 tightly controlled, so a persistent relative can usually
 determine who was responsible for the arrest and locate the
 detainee.
 There are, however, some cases of long-term disappearance.
 One report obtained by Amnesty International stated that
 sometimes opposition members are listed as "killed while
 resisting arrest," when in fact they are still alive and in
 jail. Most such arrests are believed to be the work of the
 Revolutionary Guard and to be sanctioned by the regime.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Stories of torture in Iran's prisons are rampant and cover a
 wide range of inhuman practices, particularly in Tehran's Evin
 Prison, Iran's largest and most notorious. Mock executions
 reportedly have been a favorite method of torture there, along
 with blindfolding and solitary confinement. Beatings of all
 kinds appear to be common. Allegedly, prisoners are beaten on
 the soles of their feet until they can no longer walk; others
 have had damaged kidneys as a result of being kicked and
 beaten.
 This torture apparently occurs in government prisons or in
 government houses in which prisoners of special interest are
 held for questioning. Presumably it takes place with the
 sanction of top officials. Many of these reports come from
 individuals who themselves were in the prisons and who, in
 some cases, experienced the torture.
 The regime continues to revise Iran's civil code to conform
 more closely with its interpretation of Islamic law. In 1985
 the Government announced the development and inauguration of a
 
 
 1158
 IRAN
 new machine for surgical amputation of the hands of convicted
 thieves. As interpreted in Iran, this punishment consists of
 amputation of the four fingers of the right hand. There were
 subsequent announcements of the occasional use of this
 device. Death by stoning reportedly has been reinstituted as
 a punishment for certain crimes against morality. There are
 many reports of floggings, both as a means of torture and as a
 formal punishment for sexual offenses.
 In its report, "Torture in the Eighties," Amnesty International
 expressed concern that torture has become a routine practice
 in at least some Iranian prisons and noted in particular two
 kinds of ill-treatment of prisoners: the officially
 sanctioned punishment of prisoners by whipping, and the
 torture of prisoners held in incommunicado detention during
 interrogation to extract confessions.
 Iran holds an estimated 45,000 to 60,000 Iraqi prisoners of
 war (POW's). Former prisoners have reported that Iran
 regularly subjects POW's to whippings, random executions, and
 psychological torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although arrests for expression of views critical of or
 different from those of the Government have decreased during
 the past several years, opposition to the regime itself or to
 an Islamic form of government still remains grounds for
 arbitrary detention. If there is a formal accusation, the
 charge is usually subversion, antiregime activities, or
 treason. There is also evidence that some persons are
 arrested on trumped-up criminal charges (for example, on drug
 charges) when their actual "offenses" are political; the lack
 of fair trials and other procedural safeguards encourage such
 a practice.
 Political arrests are made by members of the Revolutionary
 Guard or, less commonly, by members of komitehs, local
 neighborhood groups which have assumed a quasi-official role.
 There normally are no warrants for political arrests. No
 judicial determination of the legality of detention exists in
 Iranian law. Suspects are held for questioning at local
 Revolutionary Guard offices or in jails. In some cases a
 mullah (a religious official) is involved, in others
 unidentified questioners, sometimes including torturers. It
 is unclear whether this questioning constitutes a trial by a
 revolutionary court or whether it is part of the investigation
 process. Sometimes defendants are released after several
 hours or days, but the process may be repeated two or three
 times before the authorities decide the detainee is innocent
 or that he is guilty and should be jailed.
 A number of foreigners (including two Americans) were arrested
 in Iran during 1986, one for allegedly spying. (At least one
 other American has been imprisoned in Iran since 1984). These
 foreigners sometimes appear to become pawns in power struggles
 between various leaders and factions, with release dependent
 on how long it takes for their usefulness in this regard to be
 exhausted. The Iranians do not regularly grant consular
 access to these persons, nor do they notify the embassies
 involved that their nationals have been detained.
 Information as to whether forced labor is used in Iran is
 unavailable.
 
 
 1159
 IRAN
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most of those arrested have a trial of some sort, but although
 so-called trials of major opposition figures have sometimes
 been telecast, no trial by a revolutionary court can be called
 fair or public. If the trial is given publicity, it is
 generally because the prisoner has already been forced to
 confess to crimes.
 Restraints on arbitrary actions of the revolutionary courts
 were reportedly severely weakened in 1985 by a decision to
 limit the review authority of the Supreme Court. Formerly,
 all cases decided by the revolutionary courts were subject to
 review by the Supreme Court, permitting improper decisions to
 be overturned, but under the new decision the Supreme Court
 can only examine those cases which are recommended for review
 by the Supreme Judicial Council, which consists of the Chief
 Justice, the Prosecutor General, and three mullahs. The
 judicial system is further weakened by the fact that
 revolutionary courts can consider cases formally under the
 jurisdiction of the civil and criminal courts. Assignment of
 cases to regular rather than revolutionary courts is haphazard
 and apparently occurs mainly when arrests are made by regular
 police. Revolutionary courts can also overturn the decisions
 of civilian courts.
 For common criminal offenses, many elements of the
 prerevolutionary judicial system survive, and the accused
 often have the right to a public trial with benefit of lawyers
 of their own choosing, assuming they can afford the fee. Even
 this judiciary is not fully independent, however. Many of the
 former judges were retired after the revolution, and new
 judges selected. One criterion for new judges is grounding in
 Islamic law, and political acceptability is a requirement for
 any government position. Favorable verdicts reportedly can
 often be "purchased" from the judges serving on civil and
 criminal courts and, to a lesser degree, from judges of
 revolutionary courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government is attempting to remake Iranian society
 according to Khomeini's interpretation of Shi'a Islam. It
 rejects the Western distinction between a.public sphere which
 the Government may control and a sphere of private life
 (religion, culture, thought, and private behavior) which the
 State may not properly control. The regime defines itself as
 Islamic and attempts to enforce a way of life asserted to be
 Islamic.
 Since Khomeini's eight-point decree of December 1982, Iranians
 have enjoyed greater freedom in their private life. One of
 the eight points provided that no one had the right to enter
 private homes without a warrant. An exception was made for
 suspected hideouts of opposition groups. The decree did say
 that if Revolutionary Guards entered a home believing it to be
 an opposition hideout and found they had made a mistake, they
 were to depart, even if they had found evidence of un-Islamic
 activities, such as the presence of alcoholic beverages. The
 decree also stated that mail should not be opened nor
 telephones tapped unless there was good reason to suspect
 antiregime activities. Homes are still entered, mail is still
 opened, and phones are still tapped, but much less so than
 previously. Moreover, Iranians now have a decree by Khomeini
 
 
 1160
 IRAN
 on which to base complaints. A Headquarters for the
 Enforcement of the Imam's Decree was set up, as were a number
 of provincial and local offices. These offices, which may
 still be in operation, are said to have received thousands of
 complaints about violations of rights of privacy.
 Special Revolutionary Guard units check on social activities.
 Women whose clothing does not completely cover the hair and
 all of the body except hands and face, or who wear makeup, are
 subject to arrest. If they are, in the words of the
 Prosecutor General, "reformable," they may be lectured and
 released. If considered defiant, they may go to jail.
 The schools are reportedly used by the regime to assure that
 students' families behave in an "acceptable, Islamic manner."
 Children are asked about the habits of their parents, and
 un-Islamic behavior is reported to Revolutionary Guard units.
 Neighborhood komitehs, which originally acted as "block
 wardens," monitoring the activities of residents, seem to be
 less active now. There have been efforts to disband them and
 many may have, in fact, disappeared.
 Section 21 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution states that "publications and the press may
 express ideas freely, except when they are contrary to Islamic
 principles, or are detrimental to public rights." In
 practice, most publications are controlled by the Government
 or by the Islamic Republican Party, and the remaining
 independent publishers run the risk not only of press
 shutdowns and confiscation of publications and equipment but
 of arrest and summary punishment if they are overly critical
 of the regime. Examples of such punishments were sufficiently
 numerous in past years to retain a chilling effect. All books
 are required to be submitted to the Ministry of Islamic
 Guidance for censorship before they can be published.
 Publishers, authors, and printers also engage in substantial
 "self-censorship" before submitting books to the Ministry in
 an effort to avoid the substantial penalties, including
 economic losses, incurred when books are rejected.
 While there are competing newspapers in Iran, and officials
 and policies of the Government are often subjected to public
 criticism, newspapers are forbidden to criticize Khomeini and
 the concept of the Islamic republic, or support the right of
 self-determination for any ethnic groups in Iran.
 Nevertheless, some independent publishers out of favor with
 the regime continue to survive, and some books and pamphlets
 critical of the regime are published without reprisal.
 Foreign books, newspapers, and magazines may be imported only
 after official review.
 All broadcasting facilities are government owned.
 Academic freedom has increased in the last several years.
 Universities operate under looser constraints than in the
 past, but the regime remains committed to the elimination of
 all un-Islamic influences. As part of the admissions process,
 all Muslim students must pass examinations that demonstrate
 knowledge of the Koran and Islamic precepts. All textbooks
 are reviewed to determine their acceptability.
 
 
 1161
 IRAN
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution permits unarmed assemblies and
 marches "provided they do not violate the principles of
 Islam," the only ones permitted in practice are those
 sponsored by the Government, such as Friday prayers and
 sermons and parades on official occasions. As in the past,
 there were numerous demonstrations of public protest in 1986,
 but these were forcibly dispersed. The Constitution permits
 political parties, groups, professional associations, and both
 Islamic and minority religious associations, but most
 independent organizations have either been banned, co-opted by
 the Government, or are moribund. Restrictions on freedom of
 speech and assembly discouraged the participation in the 1984
 parliamentary elections of any party other than the
 semiofficial Islamic Republican Party (IRP).
 There were until recently no legal labor unions, although some
 unauthorized unions had been organized and were active.
 However, a new national labor union, the Islamic Union, was
 reportedly created in late 1985 under a law enacted by the
 Majles. All economic concerns with a minimum of 50 employees
 are permitted to have a branch of the new union, whose goal is
 said to be to protect workers' interests and further their
 professional development. Nominally independent, it
 reportedly is controlled by the Labor Ministry.
 It is also believed that there are officially sanctioned
 "Islamic workers councils" in some factories. These, however,
 are more instruments of government control than bodies that
 represent workers' interests, although they have frequently
 been able to block layoffs or firings of workers.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iran terms itelf an Islamic republic, and religion is closely
 intertwined with government. Grand Ayatollah Khomeini is
 recognized as the supreme leader, and this position is viewed
 as having something akin to divine sanction. The President
 and many other top officials are mullahs, as are the Speaker
 of the Majles and nearly half the Majles deputies.
 Approximately 90 percent of Iranians are Shi'a Muslims. Aside
 from slightly over 1 percent who are non-Muslims (Baha'is,
 Christians, Zoroastrians, and Jews), the rest are Sunni
 Muslims. The Sunnis are mostly Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans,
 Baluch, and other ethnic minorities. Their political
 influence is very limited. The Constitution declares that
 "the official religion of Iran is Islam and the sect followed
 is Ja'fari Shi'ism," but it also states that "other Islamic
 denominations shall enjoy complete respect." Although Sunnis
 have encountered religious discrimination on the local level,
 the regime has made efforts to reduce Shi'a-Sunni antagonism.
 Tests of Islamic knowledge and orthodoxy, required in the
 early postrevolutionary years for public or semipublic
 employment, have been dropped in recent years on the grounds
 that they conflict with the constitutional provision that "the
 interrogation of people regarding their beliefs is forbidden."
 This provision is ignored, however, in the treatment of
 members of the Baha'i faith.
 The Baha'i religion is considered heretical in Iran, and since
 the Revolution the Baha'is, Iran's largest non-Muslim minority
 (300,000-350,000 members), have suffered severe persecution,
 
 
 1162
 IRAN
 mainly government-directed and aimed at the religious
 leadership. In August 1983, the Prosecutor General issued an
 order that effectively bans all Baha'i religious activity and
 provides the legal foundation on which virtually all members
 of the faith can be charged with crimes. Baha'i property has
 been confiscated, shrines demolished, businesses disbanded or
 confiscated, and known Baha'is denied public-sector employment
 and social services. Baha'i marriages are not recognized.
 Participation by Baha'is in social welfare organizations is
 forbidden, their businesses are outlawed, and teaching of the
 faith is not permitted. Although the Baha'i national leaders
 dissolved the community's organizations in obedience to the
 Prosecutor General's edict, they were subsequently arrested,
 and at least some were executed.
 Many ordinary Baha'is have also been arrested. Charges are
 vague: "crimes against God," "corruption on earth," "warring
 against God," and "Zionism" are among the most frequent. The
 real reason for the arrests seems to be practice of Baha'ism.
 As of October 1986, 750-800 Baha'is were in jail.
 Approximately 200 have been executed or have died following
 torture since the beginning of the revolutionary period; at
 least 3 Baha'is were executed during 1986.
 The small Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian (the pre-Islamic
 religion of Iran) populations are concentrated mainly in urban
 areas. Their religions are recognized by the Constitution,
 and they elect representatives to seats reserved for them in
 the Majles. They are permitted to practice their religions,
 to instruct their children, and, although with a great deal of
 disruptive interference, to maintain schools. There continue
 to be reports of officially sanctioned discrimination against
 these minorities, particularly in the areas of employment and
 public accommodations, and of severe discrimination by the
 Government against Muslims who have converted to
 Christianity. Jews are subject to travel restrictions which
 are not applied to members of other recognized religious
 groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iranians may travel to any part of Iran, except for the war
 zone on the border with Iraq and, in times of heavy fighting,
 some Kurdish areas. Such limitations as exist are for
 purposes of military security. Persons may also change their
 place of residence without obtaining permission.
 Travel outside Iran is considerably easier than before the
 spring of 1983. Khomeini's decree of December 1982 included
 the right to travel abroad. Prior to that time passports and
 exit visas had been difficult to obtain. Males of draft age
 are not issued exit visas except for approved courses of
 study, and Iranians who are politically suspect, such as some
 retired military officers and high level public officials
 under the former regime, may not be able to leave. Persons
 who have not repaid loans obtained from development banks
 under the old regime are also denied exit visas.  Reportedly
 some Iranians, particularly those with skills in short supply
 and who were educated at government expense, are required to
 post bonds to obtain exit visas. Jewish Iranians are
 permitted to obtain passports and to travel, but they are
 normally denied the multiple-exit visas given to most Iranians
 and must make a fresh application (with a fresh fee) for each
 planned trip. Permission is not normally granted for all
 
 
 1163
 IRAN
 members of a Jewish family to travel outside Iran at the same
 time.
 With the exception of some with close ties to the former
 regime, Iranians are generally able to return after long
 periods abroad without reprisal. Not all citizens who leave,
 however, are guaranteed the right to return. Iranians
 suspected of close association with the old regime have
 encountered problems obtaining new passports, and there are
 unconfirmed reports of arrests on their return. However,
 numerous other immediate relatives of persons wanted by the
 regime seem able to live in Iran, travel outside, and return
 without undue difficulty, and in recent years many who fled at
 the time of the revolution have returned and have sought,
 through the Iranian judicial system, the return of their
 properties.
 Iranian passports have always been stamped "not valid for
 emigration," but the Government does not make a clear
 distinction between legal residence in another country and
 emigration. According to the regulations, Iranians with a
 legal residence outside Iran may be issued passports and
 advance exit visas by the Iranian embassy, consulate, or
 interests section in their country of residence. Iranians who
 have acquired U.S. citizenship are considered Iranian (in
 effect dual nationals) unless they have formally renounced
 their Iranian citizenship in accordance with Iranian law.
 Dual nationals have complained that the Iranian Interests
 Section in Washington will neither give them visas in their
 U.S. passports nor issue them Iranian passports and exit visas
 on the grounds that their residence in the U.S. is not legal
 because, according to Iranian law, they emigrated illegally.
 Although such services may be denied, there are no known
 instances of the denial of Iranian citizenship to Iranians who
 left Iran, or to those who have remained there.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders and their lay
 associates who share belief in Ayatollah Khomeini as the
 supreme leader of the revolution and in the legitimacy and
 desirability of a theocratic state based on his interpretation
 of Shi'a Islam. Of Iran's political parties, only the Islamic
 Republican Party is represented in the Government, and most
 high-level government officials belong to it. Roughly half
 the winning candidates in the 1984 Majles elections were
 members; the remainder were elected as independents.
 Beginning a year after the Shah's departure, the revolutionary
 regime has held elections at fairly regular intervals for
 president, Majles deputies, members of the Council of Experts
 (responsible for choosing Khomeini's successor), and members
 of local government councils. All elections have been hard
 fought, generally with several candidates for every position.
 All candidates must be approved by the Council of Guardians,
 however, and only those meeting the Council's vaguely
 described political and religious criteria may run. In
 practice, only supporters of the theocratic state are
 accepted. There has, however, been considerable diversity of
 opinion among candidates on economic and social questions.
 A presidential election was held in 1985, but the Council of
 Guardians denied certification as candidates to 51 of 54
 applicants. Only the incumbent President, Hojjatollah Ali
 
 
 1164
 IRAN
 Khamenei (Secretary General of the IRP), and two fellow
 members of the IRP were permitted to run. The President was
 reelected with a reported 87 percent majority; his majority
 and voter participation were lower than in the 1981 election.
 The independence of the Majles is enshrined in the
 Constitution and exists to a large degree in practice. While
 Majles deputies are typically allied with various powerful
 political and religious officials, they may speak and vote
 independently and may shift from one faction to another. The
 Majles holds genuine debates, normally broadcast live on
 radio, on a wide variety of issues but not, however, including
 central issues such as the war or the fundamental character of
 the Islamic Republic. In some cases, laws proposed by the
 Government have been voted down.
 The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed
 of 12 members, 6 clerics unilaterally appointed by Khomeini,
 and 6 lay members well-grounded in Islamic law who are
 nominated by the head of the Judicial Council subject to the
 Majles' approval. The Council of Guardians must certify all
 bills passed by the Majles as being in accordance with Islamic
 law and the Constitution. If bills fail to be certified, they
 are sent back to the Majles for revision. They cannot become
 law until passed by the Majles and certified by the Council.
 The Council has rejected various important bills and portions
 of bills passed by the Majles, including legislation on land
 reform, foreign trade, private enterprise, the press code, and
 reform of the civil code.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is disdainful of foreign human rights groups,
 government-sponsored or independent, and regards them as a
 Western means of interfering in the country's internal
 affairs. Aside from permitting the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) to assist in several small-scale POW
 exchanges between Iran and Iraq over the past few years, Iran
 has allowed no visits by any humanitarian groups since January
 1985, when a U.N.-appointed team visited POW camps. Since
 1984, the Government has refused to allow a U.N. Human Rights
 Commission special rapporteur to enter Iran to prepare his
 reports. There are no internal human rights groups.
 The ICRC has had access to some POW's, but not to all those
 believed held in Iran. The U.N. Secretary General has
 criticized conditions in prison camps in both Iran and Iraq.
 In October 1986, a Government spokesman announced that the
 ICRC would be permitted to visit POW camps, and the first
 visit took place in early December.
 Iran was the subject of a critical paragraph in the 1985
 report of the International Labor Organization's Committee on
 the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. Focusing
 on the treatment of Baha'is and others, the committee
 expressed concern over Iran's continued failure to comply with
 the Convention on Discrimination in Occupation and called upon
 the Government to ensure a policy consistent with the
 convention.
 Amnesty International has written to Iranian officials,
 including Khomeini, protesting violations of human rights in
 Iran, but has received no reply.
 
 
 1165
 IRAN
 In August 1986, diplomats representing the 12 member states of
 the European Community made a demarche to the Government
 expressing their concern at reports of violations of Bahai's
 human rights. The regime denied the charges.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Always the object of discriminatory practices in Iran's
 conservative society, women have faced even more
 discrimination since the Revolution. Ultraconservative dress,
 entirely hiding the hair and all of the body except the face
 and hands, is now an absolute requirement for all women,
 regardless of their religion, national origin, citizenship, or
 diplomatic status. Women are harassed, detained, or
 physically attacked if they appear in public in clothing which
 official or self-appointed guardians of public morality deem
 insufficiently modest. Employment opportunities for women are
 more restricted than was the case under the Shah. Women are
 legally barred from being judges. Although there are cultural
 barriers making employment in professional level positions
 difficult to obtain, women do work as lawyers, physicians, and
 statisticians, and in other professions in both the public and
 private sectors. Two women serve as deputies in the Majles.
 The Family Protection Act, passed under the Shah, was revoked
 by the Islamic Government and replaced by a civil code
 reflecting Islamic law. A bill passed in mid-1983 did,
 however, give women the right to divorce their husbands, and
 regulations announced in 1984 substantially broadened, to 12,
 the number of grounds for which a woman may seek divorce. A
 husband may still obtain a divorce without having to state a
 reason or go to court. The new marriage regulations provide
 for improved financial settlements for wives whose husbands
 divorce them.
 As noted in Section 2.c., the Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian,
 and Baha'i minorities reportedly suffer officially sanctioned
 discrimination in a number of areas, particularly with respect
 to employment and public accommodations. Muslims who have
 converted to Christianity are similarly discriminated against.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Iranian labor law, which exempts agriculture, domestic
 service, family businesses, and, to some extent, other small
 businesses, forbids employment of minors under 12 years of age
 and places special restrictions on the employment of minors
 under 18 and of women. Under the law, women and minors may
 not be used for hard labor or, in general, for night work.
 The labor law also establishes a 6-day work week of 48 hours
 maximum (except for overtime at premium rates), with 1 day of
 rest (normally Friday), as well as at least 12 days per year
 of leave with pay and a number of paid public holidays. There
 are also legal provisions with respect to minimum wages and
 health and safety in workplaces. Given the large sectors of
 the economy exempted from the labor law, the State's still
 unresolved administrative disorganization resulting from the
 revolution, the effects of the war with Iraq, and the general
 lack of labor unions which are both legal and effective, it is
 unclear to what extent the provisions of Iran's labor law
 actually affect most of the labor force. Despite the war,
 unemployment remains high, probably in the 30 percent range.
 Information on collective bargaining in Iran is not available.
