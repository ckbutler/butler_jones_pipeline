 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a republic governed by a president, a unicameral national assembly,
 and a constitutionally independent judiciary. After two decades of one-party rule,
 free and fair multiparty elections in 1991 resulted in the victory of the Movement
 for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) and the election of President Frederick J. T.
 Chiluba, a former trade unionist. In the November 18 elections, President Chiluba
 was reelected and his party gained 131 of 150 seats in the National Assembly.
 There were 5 presidential and over 600 parliamentary candidates from 11 parties.
 Elections took place peacefully. Following the ballot, several opposition parties and
 nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) declared the electoral process neither free
 nor fair, in part due to constitutional amendments enacted in May that disqualified
 former President Kenneth Kaunda, the main opposition leader, from seeking the
 Presidency. Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP) had boycotted
 the parliamentary polls, alleging that the results were fixed beforehand. Although
 reputable reports indicated some voting irregularities, no evidence of substantial or
 widespread vote rigging or vote-counting fraud has been presented.
 
 
 The police, divided into regular and paramilitary units operating under the Min-
 istry of Home Affairs, have primary responsibility for maintaining law and order.
 The Zambia Intelligence Security Service, under the Office of the President, is re-
 sponsible for intelligence and internal security. Despite reform efforts begun in
 1994, including human rights training and punishment of same offenders, the police
 force lacks sufficient professionalism and discipline. Police continued to commit nu-
 merous, and at times serious, human rights abuses.
 Throughout the year the Chiluba Government continued its free market economic
 reform program. New taxes slowed economic growth and allegations of high-level
 government corruption continued. Rains during the 1995-96 growing season pro-
 duced a good harvest of maize, the staple food, improving the food security of most
 Zambians. The key copper industry, scheduled for privatization in 1997, suffered
 from a gradual weakening of world prices and a fall in production. The resulting
 lost income contributed to a fall in the value of the kwacha. Successful privatization
 in other industries and the development of nontraditional agricultural exports cre-
 ated some new jobs.
 The Government took steps to address some human rights problems, but serious
 abuses continued in several areas. The police were responsible for extrajudicial
 killings as well as beatings of criminal suspects and detainees. Prison conditions are
 harsh and deteriorated farther, posing an increased threat to the health and lives
 of inmates. Arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention, and long trial delays remain
 problems. Police authorities continued efforts to address police brutality, adopting
 community based policing methods, introducing human rights traininginto the cur-
 riculum of the police training college, and instituting a program of human rights
 seminars for midlevel and senior officers.
 The Government unsuccessfully sought to reduce the independence of the judici-
 ary, persisted in attempts to limit freedom of the press, and restricted citizens right
 of peaceful assembly. The Government announced its intention not to privatize gov-
 ernment-owned mass media, contrary to its 1991 promises. The Government re-
 jected most elements of a draft constitution prepared in 1995 by a presidentially ap-
 pointed review commission, choosing instead to pass amendments to the 1991 Con-
 stitution. The principal purpose of the amendments was to disqualify Kaunda, the
 main opposition lear (and many other citizens), from contesting the Presidency by
 making only second-generation Zambians eligible. These amendments restricted the
 right of citizens to change their government. Women continued to experience dis-
 crimination in both law and fact. Wife beating, rape, and denial of widows' inherit-
 ance rights remained widespread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings during the year, but police continued to use excessive force that resulted in
 extrajudicial killings. Press accounts reported that police killed 12 people during the
 year. Most were killed while reportedly trying to escape capture. One of the 12 was
 an innocent woman killed by police gunfire during a gun battle with suspects in
 September. Police acknowledged their mistake and promised to compensate the vic-
 tim's family. According to the police spokesmen, one suspect died in jail when offi-
 cers failed to provide necessary medical attention.
 On December 28, a woman died in police custody in Kasempa. Townspeople, alleg-
 ing that police officers had beaten her to death, attacked government offices in
 Kasempa in an attempt to avenge her death.
 Throughout the year, government officials, nongovernmental organizations, and
 the press closely scrutinized police involvement in human rights abuses, criminal ac-
 tivity, and corruption. Francis Ndhlovu, Inspector General of Police, continued to ex-
 erise his mandate to reform the force. Ndhlovu has instituted a variety of measures
 designed to restore discipline, professionalism, and respect for human rights, includ-
 ing police training in respect or human rights. Ndhlovu's efforts suffered a setback
 in May when a State House official ordered police to attack a peaceful march by
 students, overruling the police commander on the scene. In September Ndhlovu tes-
 tified that he had placed illegal wiretaps on a telephone at The Post newspaper of-
 fice. By year's end, the Government had not taken disciplinary action against him.
 The police undertook investigations of instances of police use of excessive force,
 disciplining officers who committed human rights abuses. The police adopted
 munity based policing methods. Middle-ranking and senior police officers were en-
 rolled in human rights training seminars at the Police Academy. According to statis-
 tics made available by the police command, at least eight police officers were the
 subjects of internal investigations or prosecutions. Further, according to official sta-
 
 
 tistics the authorities arrested at least 12 police officers on such criminal charges
 as robbery and possession of illegal narcotics.
 The government-appointed Human Rights Commission, chaired by prominent at-
 torney Bruce Munyama, aggressively examined police human rights abuses in public
 hearings held throughout 1995. In September 1995, the Commission submitted its
 final report to the President, including recommendations to improve the human
 rights performance of the polie. The report was released by the Government in Oc-
 terwhen the Parliament also passed legislation creating an autonomus human
 rights commission.
 Many prisoners died as a result of harsh prison conditions (see Section 1.c.).
 In June a bomb exploded at the Lusaka airport, killing one police officer who re-
 portedily arrived at the scene to investigate reports of the bomb's presence. In De-
 cember 1995, army recruits near Kapiri Mposhi went on a rampage in retaliation
 for the death of a comrade at the hands of local villagers. They destroyed 10 small
 villages and killed two villagers. Neither the police nor the Ministry of Defense had
 brught charges against the recruits by year's end.
 b. Disappearane.-On December 30, The Post newspaper reported the disappear-
 ance and detention of Chronicle reporter George Jambwe who h~ad entered the Army
 Headquarters (Arakan Barracks) in an effort to interview the army commander. He
 was released to police custody after 3 days and charged with criminal trespass.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrad 'ng Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the 1991 Coastitution prohibits torture, police regularly used excessive
 force wIen apprehending, interrogating, and detaining criminal suspects or illegal
 aliens. In most such instances, detaining officers beat suspects. In March police at
 the Chawama station severely beat a suspect, denied him necessary medical atten-
 tion, and then released him without filing chaes. In May police crushed the tes-
 ticle of a detainee. No officers have been disciplined or arrested for these acts. By
 year's end, the Government had not disciplined  or prosecuted any of the individuaIs
 allegedly involved in the torture of persons detained in connection with the 1993
 state of emergency.
 On October 18, police clashed with supporters of a local politician in Kabwe. Tele-
 vision coverage that evening showed police kicking and beating many of those who
 had been detained and handcuffed. Police action followed President Chiluba's in-
 structions to MMD Secretary General Michael Sata, heard on the public address
 system at the MMD rally in Kabwe, to "sort them, Michael, sort them out."
 Prison conditions are harsh. Deteriorating prison conditions posed an increased
 threat to prisoners' lives. According to official statistics, prisons designed to hold
 6,000 prisoners held over 12,000. This severe overcrowding, combined with poor
 sanitation, inadequate medical facilities, meager food supplies, and lack of potable
 water resulted in serious outbreaks of dysentery, tuberculosis, and other diseases
 at various prisons throughout the year. In a report submitted to Parliament, the Di-
 rector of Prisons said 975 prisoners had died in prison between January 1991 and
 December 1995. Of these 203 died of AIDS-related illnesses, the rest from harsh
 conditions or other illnesses. Prisoners continued to die at about the same rate in
 1996.
 The Government permits prison visits by both domestic and international human
 rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.--Criminal suspects are often arrested on
 the basis of flimsy evidence or an uncorroborated accusation. In these and other
 criminal cases, the law requires that a detainee be charged and brought before a
 magistrate within 24 hours. Attorneys and family members are allowed pretrial ac-
 cess to detainees. In practice the authorities hold most detainees for more than 1
 month from the time of arrest to fir'st appearance before a magistrate. In many
 cases an additional period of 6 months elapses before the magistrate commits the
 defendant to a high court for trial. Following ommittal, preparation of the mag-
 istrate court record for transmittal to a high court takes months-in some cases as
 long as a year. Once a case reaches a high court for trial, court proceedings last
 an average of 6 months.
 Approximately 2,000 of the 12,000 jailed prisoners are awaiting trial on criminal
 charges. In some cases defendants have been awaiting trial for 10 years. These lon
 delays are the result of inadequate resources, inefficiency, lack of trained personne
 and broad rules of procedure that give wide latitude to prosecutors and defense at-
 torneys to request adjournmients. In 1996 the High Court Commissioner began re-
 leasing detainees if the police failed to bring the case to trial.
 Although there is a functioning bail system, overcrowded prisons reflect the large
 number of detainees accused of serious offenses for which bail is not granted. These
 include treason, murder, aggravated robbery, and violations of the narcotics laws.
 Also, poor or indigent detainees rarely have the financial means to post bail. The
 
 
 318
 government legal aid office is responsible for providing legal representation to poor
 or indigent detainees and defendants in criminal or civil cases. In practice few re-
 ceive assistance. In 1996 the office had 14 attorneys to cover the entire country and
 a budget of $110,000.
 Police stations frequently become "debt collection centers," where police officers,
 acting upon an unofficial complaint, will detain a debtor without charge indefinitely
 until he or she pays the complainant. The police receive a percentage of the
 paymentin return. This situation is commonplace. The authorities held approxi-
 mately 500 foreigners, principally from neighboring countries, as illegal aliens until
 they could deport them. At times these detentions last months or years (see Sections
 1.f. and 2.d.).
 The Speaker of the National Assembly ordered the indefinite incarceration of Post
 newspaper writers Fred Mmembe, Bright Mwape, and Lucy Sichone for contempt
 of the House. A high court later quashed the sentences, ruling that the Speaker had
 no authority over private citizens, but only after Mmembe and Mwape had spent
 several weeks in prison.
 The Government arrested eight United National Independence Party (UNIP) lead-
 ers on charges of treason (a nonbailable offense). The prosecution delayed arraign-
 ment and sought to delay the opening of the trial. After several weeks, however,
 the High Court insisted that the government prosecutor pursue the case. Two sus-
 pects were later released due to failure to prosecute. The other six were acquitted
 after a 6 week trial. The health of all eight suffered while they were imprisoned.
 Many attorneys considered the charges purely political. Although technically the
 Government arrested them for their alleged involvement in bombings, their status
 in the opposition and the Government's failure to produce any convincing evidence
 raised the suspicion that they were really political detainees.
 In an effort to intimidate students and discourage them fron publicly criticizing
 the Government, the police arrested Emmanuel Tembo, president of the University
 of Zambia's students' union in July, questioned him about campus demonstrations
 against the Government's constitutional amendments, and released him on the fol-
 lowing day.
 The Government has not used exile for political purposes, but it has used deporta-
 tion or the threat of deportation for such purposes. The case of John Chinula, a
 member of the Central Committee of UNIP (the former ruling party), whom the
 Government had deported in 1994, continued to attract the attention of human
 rights advocates. They protested his deportation, asserting that Chinula had been
 born in Zambia and that the deportation was a denial of due process. However,
 those advocating his case were quieted by a Lusaka High Court decision denying
 habeas corpus to Chinula in September 1995, in which the Court stated that he
 was, in fact, a citizen of Malawi. In December Malawi's Supreme Court ordered
 Chinula returned to Zambia. Zambian immigration officials and the Minister of
 Home Affairs announced that Chinula would be arrested and de]arted if he entered
 Zambia. His whereabouts were unknown at year's end. Chinula s longstanding ties
 to Zambia and his prominence as a politician continue to raise questions about the
 Government's motives in deporting him.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.- fhe Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. Although the Government has generally respected the independence of the ju-
 diciary, it tried unsuccessfully to limit its independence during the year. The Presi-
 dent nominates and the National Assembly confirms the Chief Justice and the other
 eight members of the Supreme Court. The Court has appellate jurisdiction for all
 legal and constitutional disputes. Several high courts have authority to hear crimi-
 nal and civil cases and appeals from lower courts. Magistrate courts have original
 jurisdiction in some criminal and civil cases, while local, or customary, courts han-
 dle most civil cases at the local level.
 In April the Government introduced constitutional amendments that would have
 virtually eliminated the independence of the high courts and the Supreme Court.
 The amendments would have granted the President the power to dismiss judges
 subject only to concurrence by the National Assembly. The President alone would
 have been able to decide what constituted grounds for dismissal. Following strong
 public protest, the Government withdrew the amendments in May.
 Local courts employ the principles of customary law, which vary widely through-
 out the country. Lawyers are barred from partici pating, and there are few formal
 rules of procedure. Presiding judges, who are usually prominent local citizens, have
 great power to invoke customary law in rendering judgments regarding marriages,
 divorces, inheritances, other civil proceedings, and minor criminal matters. Judg-
 ments are often not in accordance with the Penal Code; for example, they tend to
 discriminate against women in matters of inheritance (see Section 5).
 
 
 Trials in magistrate courts are public, and defendants have the opportunity to
 confront accusers and present witnesses. Many defendants, however, are too poor
 to retain a lawyer, and the poor state of the Government's Legal Aid Department
 means that many citizens entitled to legal aid find that it is unavailable.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for respect for privacy and the inviolability of the home, and
 the authorities generally respected these rights in practice.
 Except during a state of emergency, the law requires a warrant before police may
 enter a home; however, police routinely ignored this requirement. The Constitution
 grants the Drug Enforcement Commission and the Zambian Intelligence Security
 Service authority to wiretap telephones. In September the Inspector General of Po-
 lice admitted in open court that he had ordered illegal wiretaps on a telephone at
 the offices of The Post, an independent daily newspaper.
 Roundups of suspected illegal aliens in the home or workplace continued. Accord-
 ing to the government Commissioner for Refugees, immigration officials are empow-
 ered under the law to conduct these roundups without a warrant (see Section 2.d.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution provides for freedom of
 expression and of the press, the Penal Code lists various prohibited activities that
 may be interreted to restrict these freedoms. In February the Government banned
 issue 401 of The Post for allegedly revealing "state secrets" (these were transcripts
 of cabinet discussions of MMD election campaign strategy). It later ordered
 ZAMNET, the Zambian Internet provider, to delete the issue from The Post's home
 page. The Government invoked restrictive na--for example, prohibiting defama-
 tion of the President-in other seleted cases. A magistrate in the copperbelt town
 of Kitwe sentenced William Banda to 3 years' impnsonment for publicly insulting
 President Chiluba during his visit to a housing project. Banda was immediately
 taken into custody by a local official of the ruling MMD party. The Government or
 its appointed officials filed numerous libel and defamation suits against The Post
 in response to a series of headlines and stories focusing on issues of corruption and
 controversial government policies. At year's end over 90 of these cases remained to
 be adjudicated.
 The law includes provisions for investigative tribunals to call as witnesses jour-
 nalists and media managers who print allegations of parliamentary misconduct.
 Failure to cooperate with the tribunal may result in charges of contempt punishable
 by up to 6 months in jail. This is seen by the media as a clear infringement on press
 freedom and a means for parliamentarians to bypass the clogged court system in
 dealing with libel suits against the media. The Press Association of Zambia has its
 own media ethics code and voluntary industry ethics board. The indefinite incarcer-
 ation of three Post writers (see Section i.e.) on orders of the Speaker of the House
 infringed upon freedom of expression.
 A number of independent newspapers actively question government actions and
 policies. They circulate without government interference. Throughout the year the
 leading independent daily, The Post, had a home page on the World Wide Web that
 attracted over 15,000 readers per month. The State House and the government-con-
 trolled Times of Zambia established home pages in April.
 The Government owns the two most widely circulated newspapers, as well as the
 sole television station, ZNBC. In addition to the government-controlled radio station,
 two church-related stations and one private commercial station operate in Zambia.
 MNET, a South African company, provides a subscriber television service. It carries
 British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) world news but provides no local news cov-
 erage. The Government exercises considerable influence over the government-owned
 media, which have followed the government line on important issues to an increas-
 ing degree. The government-sponsored radio stations carry some BBC and German
 World Service news programs. In August the Government announced its intention
 not to privatize government-owned mass media, contrary to its 1991 promises.
 Although the Government attempted to influence the politics of university stu-
 dents (see Section 1.d.), it took no action restraining academic freedom during the
 year. Following a rock-throwing incident involving university students, the Faculty
 Senate at the University of Zambia closed the campus 1 week before the November
 18 general election. Although the Senate insisted that it acted independently, uni-
 versity andpolice actions before the incident indicate the Senate succumbed to gov-
 ernment influence.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, but the Government restricted these
 rights in practice. On January 10, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional key
 
 
 320
 provisions of the 1955 Public Order Act, which had been used to restrict the right
 of peaceful assembly. Subsequently, the National Assembly passed legislation re-
 14 days prior notification to the police in order to hold a public meeting.
 President Chiluba reduced this to 7 days in September. In practice the police did
 not interfere with peaceful rallies whose leaders had followed the prior notification
 rule.
 All organizations must apply formally for registration to the Registrar of Societies.
 In most cases the authorities routinely approved these applications. During the year
 there were 36 political parties in operation and dozens of NGO's.
 Following the November elections, several NGO's declared that the elections were
 neither free nor fair. The Government accused them of colluding with foreign powers
 and of engaging in unpatriotic activity. Subsequently police briefly detained the di-
 rectors of two of these groups, Alfred Zulu of the Zambian Independent Monitoring
 Team and Ngande Mwanajiti of the Clean Campaign Committee. Police also
 searched the offices, confiscated materials, and froze the bank accounts of the two
 organizations. At year's end, police charged Alfred Zulu with illegal reception of for-
 eign funds. The assets of both organizations remained under court control.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-A 1996 amendment to the Constitution declares Zambia
 a Christian nation while providing for freedom of religion. The Government respects
 the rights of all faiths to worship freely in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foregn Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to move freely
 throughout Zambia, to reside in any part of the country, and to depart and return
 to the country without restriction. The authorities generally respected these rights,
 but police roadblocks to control criminal activity continued, and police sometimes ex-
 torted money and goods from motorists.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that
 there were approximately 120,000 refugees, mainly Angolans, in Zambia in 1996.
 Approximately 500 refugees from Africa's great lakes region were present in Zambia
 at year's end. The Government cooperates fully with UNHCR. As in the past, the
 Government continues to provide first asylum to refugees from several countries and
 allows refugees to resettle in Zambia. There were no reports of forced return of per-
 sons to a country where they feared persecution or a pattern of abuse.
 A steady trickle of Zairians continued to cross into Zambia during the year. In
 response to alleged criminal activities of many Zairians in the border region, the
 Government rounded up, arrested, and deported many Zairians and other illegal
 aliens throughout the year. The authorities held approximately 500 foreigners, prin-
 cipally from neighboring countries, as illegal aliens pending their deportation. On
 occasion such detentions last for months or years (see Sections 1.d. and 1.f.). The
 deportation of illegal aliens is lawful, but Zairians and others who had been ac-
 corded refugee status by the UNHCR were sometimes picked up and held for vary-
 ing lengths of time before being released. In several cases the Government deported
 refugees who were registered with the UNHOR. The Government detained 12
 Rwandans accused of war crimes. The Government cooperated fully with U.N. and
 International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTh) officials. The courts ordered
 four of the suspects transported to Arusha, Tanzania for trial by the ICTR and re-
 leased eight others for lack of evidence.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised the right to change their Government in multi party elections
 in November. Constitutional amendments barring first-generation Zambians from
 contesting the Presidency and preventing traditional chiefs from running for politi-
 cal office restricted the right of citizens to change their Government .The former
 provision barred the most popular opposition candidate, former President and UNIP
 leader Kenneth Kaunda, from running for President; the latter provision barred
 UNIP's number two, Senior Chief Inyambo Yeta.
 Under the 1991 Constitution, as amended, the President wields broad authority.
 Although the National Assembly ratifies major appointments and has other powers,
 inpa tice it continued to provide only a limited check on executive authority.
 Although the principal opposition party, UNIP, boycotted the parliamentary bal-
 loting, a total of 11 parties contested 150 parliamentary seats. Five candidates con-
 tested the Presidency. Just under 50 percent of eligible voters registered. Of these,
 approximately 60 percent cast ballots. While the MMDs use of government re-
 sources (civil servants as campaign workers, use of government vehicles, and the
 state-owned media) apparently did not change the overall outcome, it called into
 question the fairness of the process. The Government's failure to implement a trans-
 
 
 parent registration project raised doubts about the Government's willingness to
 ave an open electoral process.
 The number of women in politics and government is increasing, but their numbers
 remain small. There are 13 women in the 158-member National Assembly. Women
 serve as cabinet ministers, deputy ministers, and ministerial permanent secretaries.
 Chiluba's post-election Cabinet has two female ministers and one minister of Asian
 (Indian) descent.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights and civic organizations generally operated without gov-
 ernment hindrance. These include the Law Association of Zambia, the Foundation
 for Democratic Process, and the Zambia Civic Education Association. Other groups
 were active in promoting women's civil and political rights. The Government an-
 nounced that it would establish an autonomous human rights commission before
 year's end and continued to be receptive to criticism from human rights and civic
 organizations. On occasion, however, government officials accused human rights
 monitors of abetting crime and thwarting the work of the police through their focus
 on the victims of police brutality, which the Government apparently interpreted as
 an effort to discredit the authorities. The Government was receptive to inquiries and
 visits by international human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, tribe, sex, place of origin,
 marital status, political opinion, color, or creed. Constitutional amendments barring
 native born Zambians of partial or full foreign ancestry from the Presidency were
 unsuccessfully challenged in court.
 Women.-Violence against women remained a serious problem. Wife beating and
 rape were commonplace. According to official statistics, over 3,000 rape cases were
 reported to the plice between 1991 and 1996. Of these, approximately 30 percent
 resulted in conviction and 5 percent acquittal. The remainder were either dismissed
 or remain unresolved. Defendants convicted of rape normally were sentenced to pris-
 on at hard labor. Since many rapes are not reported to the  lice, the actual number
 is considered much higher. Domestic assault is a criminal   theff  but in practice
 police are often reluctant to pursue reports of wife beating, preferring to broker a
 reconciliation. The Government and Nm h's expressed inreasing onern about vio-
 lence against women, and the media devoted considerable publicity to it during the
 year.
 The Constitution and other laws entitle women to full equality with men in most
 areas. In practice, however, women are severely disadvantaged compared to men in
 formal employment and education. Married women who are employed often suffer
 from discriminatory conditions of service. For example, allowances for housing and
 children and tax rebates to which they as employees are entitled often accrue to
 their cusbands. Similarly, women have little independent access to credit facilities;
 in most cases, they remain dependent on husbands, who are required to sign for
 loans. As a result, few women own their own homes.
 Customary law and practice also place women in subordinate status with respect
 to property, inheritance, and marriage, despite various constitutional and legislative
 provisions. Under traditional customs prevalent in most ethnic groups, all rights to
 inherit property rest with the deceased man's family. The 1989 Intestate Succession
 Act is designed to guarantee women a share of the joint estate. Under the act, the
 children of a deceased man share 50 percent equally among themselves; the widow
 receives 20 percent; the parents 20 percent; and relatives 10 percent. A 1996 "re-
 form" of the act places the widow's share as 20 percent to be divided equally among
 the women who have a claim. Formerly one was considered a widow only if there
 was a registered church wedding or weddings. (Polygamy was and is permitted if
 the first wife agrees to it at the time of the first wedding.) Now the widow or wid-
 ows must share the inheritance with any other women who can prove a marital re-
 lation (not a registered or recorded marriage) with the deceased man, thus granting
 inheritance rights to mistresses or concubines.
 In practice "property grabbing" by the relatives of the deceased man continues to
 be rampant, particularly when local customary courts have jurisdiction. These
 courts often use a different law, the Local Courts Act, to distribute inheritances
 without reference to the percentages mandated in the Succession Act. As a result,
 many widows receive lite lor nothing from the estate. Fines mandated by the Suc-
 cession Act for property grabbing are extraordinarily low.
 
 
 322
 Children.-The Government seeks to improve the welfare of children, but scarce
 resources and ineffective implementation of social programs adversely affected the
 welfare of children and adults alike. Due to harsh economic conditions, both rural
 and urban children often must work in the informal sector to help families make
 ends meet (see Section 6.d.). There was no societal pattern of discrimination or
 abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-Persons with disabilities face significant societal dis-
 crimination in employment and education. The Government continued to take steps
 to ameliorate their hardships, including establishing a national trust fund to provide'
 loans to the disabled to help them start businesses but its efforts are limited by
 scarce resources. The Government has not legislated or otherwise mandated acces-
 sibility to public buildings and services for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens
 to form trade unions and approximately 60 percent of the 300 000 formal sector
 workers are unionized. Fourteen of the country's 19 large national unions, organized
 by industry or profession, are affiliated with the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions
 (ZCTL). The ZCTU is democratically operated and, like its constituent unions, is
 independent of any political party and the Government. By a majority vote of its
 members, a union may decide on affiliation with the ZCTU or with trade unions or
 organizations outside Zambia. The Mine Workers Union of Zambia and four other
 ZCTU constituent unions broke away from ZCTU and have established a rival um-
 brella organization.
 The ZCTU is a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 Labor leaders travel without restriction to international conferences and to visit
 counterparts abroad.
 The 1993 Industrial and Labor Relations Act (ILRA) reestablished the "one indus-
 try, one union" principle. In December the Government ratified articles 97 and 98
 of the International Labor Organization Convention allowing the establishment of
 more than one labor confederation. The Bankers Union of Zambia, a new union, was
 duly registered with the Government in 1993 but has been unable to operate be-
 cause the employers recognize the existing Zambia Union of Financial and Allied
 Workers. In November 1993 the Ndola HiM Court ordered the Government to reg-
 ister the Secondary School Teachers Union of Zambia. The Government continues
 to argue that the Zambia National Union of Teachers represents secondary school
 teachers and has administratively delayed recognition of the new secondary teach-
 ers union.
 All workers have the right to strike, except those engaged in essential services,
 the Zambia Defense Force, the judiciary, the police, the prison service, and the In-
 telligence Security Service. The ILRA defines essential services as power, medical,
 water, sewage treatment, firefighting, and certain mining occupations as essential
 to safety. It permits strikes only after all other legal recourse has been exhausted,
 and in practice virtually all work stoppages during the year were illegal. The ILRA
 prohibits employers from retribution against employees engaged in legal trade union
 activities. Workers engaged in illegal strikes do not enjoy this protection.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The ILRA provides for the
 right to organize and bargain collectively. Employers and unions in each industry
 negotiate collective bargaining agreements through joint councils in which there is
 no government involvement. In practice the industry joint councils function effec-
 tively as collective bargaining units. Civil servants and teachers, as public officials,
 negotiate directly with the Goveent. Collective bargaining disputes are first re-
 ferred to a conciliator or a board of conciliation. If conciliation fails to resolve the
 dispute, the parties may refer the case to the Industrial Relations Court or, in the
 case of employees, vote to strike. In practice legal strikes under the ILRA are rare,
 totalling two durig the year. The IA prohibits antinion discrimination by em-
 ploersaganstunion members and organizers. An employee who believes he or she
 hays agn eait for union activities may, after exhausting any existing adminis-
 trative channels for relief, file a complaint with the Industrial Relations Court. This
 Court has the power to order appropriate redress for the aggrieved worker. The
 complainant may appeal a judgment of the Industrial Relations Court to the Su-
 preme Court. In practice the Court often orders employers to reinstate workers
 found to have been the victims of discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compzdsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits slavery
 and involuntary servitude, but it authorizes citizens to be called upon to perform
 labor in specific instances, for example, during national emergencies or disasters.
 Moreover, a citizen can be required to perform labor that is associated with tradi-

 tional civic or communal obligations, as when all members of a village are called
 upon to assist in preparing for a visit by a traditional leader or other dignitary
 d. Minimum Age or Employment of Children.-The minimum legal age for em-
 ployment of children is 16 years. The Labor Commissioner effectively enforces this
 taw in the industrial sector in which, because of the high demand for employment
 by adults, there are no jobs available for children. The law is not enforced, however
 for those who work in the subsistence agricultural, domestic service, and informal
 sectors, where persons under age 16 are often employed. In urban areas children
 commonly engage in street vending
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wor.-The minimum wage for nonunionized workers
 is set at $0.06 (70.30 kwacha) per hour. Assuming a 48 hour workweek-the legal
 maximum for nonunionized workers-a worker earning the minimum wage would
 receive about $11.30 (14,600 kwacha) per month. The minimum wage covers non-
 unionized workers in categories such as general workers, cleaners odice orderlies
 and watchmen. The minimum wage is insufficient to provide an adequate standard
 of living for a worker and family, and most minimum wage earners must supple-
 ment their incomes through second jobs, subsistence farming, or reliance on the ex-
 tended family.
 With respect to unionized workers, each industry sets its own wage scales and
 maximum workweek limits through collective bargaining. In practice almost all
 unionized workers receive salaries considerably higher than the nonunion minimum
 wage. The minimum workweek for full-time employment is 40 hours and is, in prac-
 tice, the normal workweek. The law requires 2 days of annual leave per month of
 service.
 The law also regulates minimum health and safety standards in industry. The De-
 partment of Mines is responsible for enforcement. Factory safety is handled by the
 Ispctor of Factories under the Minister of Labor, but staffing problems chronically
 limit enforcement effectiveness. There are no legislative provisions to protect a
 worker who refuses to work on safety grounds.
