 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy with a democratic parliamentary form
 of government. Executive authority is exercised by the Prime Minister. The role of
 the Grand Duke, the titular Head of State, is largely ceremonial. The Chamber of
 Deputies, a unicameral legislature, encompasses the full political spectrum; an ap-
 pointed body, the Council of State, reviews legislation before it is given final ap-
 proval by the Chamber.
 The police and gendarmerie maintain order throughout the country and are subor-
 dinate to governmental and judicial authority. Judicial and penal systems are open,
 efficient, and fair.
 Luxembourg has a prosperous free market economy with active industrial and
 services sectors. Its standard of living and its level of social benefits are high.
 Human rights are valued and safeguarded throughout Luxembourg. Individual
 rights are protected by law and respected in practice by both the Government and
 the populace. Luxembourg's large foreign population (almost 30 percent) is well inte-
 grated into the society and the economy. National practices in apparent conflict with
 human rights are quickly and publicly addressed.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Due process is provided by law and ob-
 served in practice. Except in cases of hot pursuit, judicial warrants are required for
 arrests. Detainees must be charged and must appear before a judge within 24 hours
 of arrest. Prisoners are not held incommunicado, and immediate access to an attor-
 ney is granted. Those who are charged are held pending trial or released on bail
 at the judge's discretion. Exile is never imposed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Luxembourg has an independent and fair judicial
 system with the right of appeal. Civilians are not tried in military courts. All de-
 fendants have access to legal counsel, at public expense if necessary. All charges are
 formally and publicly stated. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty
 in a court of law. They have the right to public trial, cross-examination of witnesses,
 and presentation of evidence. Either the defendant or the prosecutor may appeal a
 ruling. An appeal results in a completely new judicial procedure, with the possibility
 that a sentence may be either increased or decreased. There are no political pris-
 oners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy is protected by law and respected in practice. A judicial warrant
 is required to enter a private residence, to monitor private correspondence, or to
 conduct electronic surveillance. Freedom of choice in private matters is respected.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedoms of speech and press are legally pro-
 tected and respected in practice. Print media are privately owned and free of gov-
 ernmental interference. The privately owned national radio and television company
 has exclusive rights for television broadcasting within Luxembourg, but a newly in-
 stituted permit system will allow establishment of other private radio stations. The
 company is subject to governmental oversight but functions independently. Radio
 and television broadcasts from neighboring countries are legally and freely avail-
 able.
 Censorship is not legally imposed, but societal consensus on propriety largely pre-
 cludes dissemination of extreme pornography or of sensitive information concerning
 national security or the royal family. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association is provided by law and exists in practice. No limitations are imposed
 on orderly public meetings or demonstrations. Permits for public demonstrations are
 routinely issued.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion, and full freedom of religious
 choice exists. There are no restrictions on maintaining places of worship, religious
 training or instruction, publication of religious material, or participation in chari-
 table activities. Foreign clergy practice freely. The State pays the salaries of Roman
 Catholic Protestant, and Jewish clergy. Local governments often provide and main-
 tain facilities. Luxembourg's population is about 95 percent Roman Catholic.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is full freedom of domestic and foreign travel, emigration, and re-
 patriation. Luxembourg asylum policy grants asylum seekers due process and full
 consideration of their cases.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Luxembourg is a fully functional multiparty democracy. There is universal suf-
 frage for all citizens aged 18 and above. Policy is freely debated within the Govern-
 ment and the society. There is no risk in dissent; opposition groups and political
 parties operate without fear-,of government repression. National elections are held
 every 5 years, and local elections occur every 6 years. Representatives are chosen
 by secret ballots in direct elections which are based on a proportional system. Mul-
 tiple candidates run for most positions. Luxembourg's foreign population may not
 vote but may influence the political process indirectly through membership in labor
 unions and other organizations. Women participate freely in the political process.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights

 Luxembourg consistently supports international and nongovernmental investiga-
 tions of alleged human rights violations.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Racial, social, or sexual discrimination is prohibited by law. In practice, blatant
 discrimination rarely occurs, and relations between groups are good. Approximately
 85 percent of Luxembourg's foreign population comes from European Community
 member states. Luxembourg recognizes a need for foreign workers, and foreigners
 generally are assimilated into the overall society and economy without difficulty.
 Skinheads and ne-Nazis are few, and antiforeigner incidents were infrequent and
 confined largely to harassment.
 Approximately 1,400 refugees fleeing former Yugoslavia entered Luxembourg dur-
 ing 1992 under a program of temporayasylum. erhaps an even larger number of
 Yugoslav refugees entered the Grand Duchy without benefit of formal asylum sta-
 tus. Government and private entities are actively working to ensure that the basic
 needs of this refugee community are being met.
 Women and men enjoy the same property rights, and equal pay for equal work
 is mandated by law. In the absence of a prenuptial agreement, property is equally
 divided upon dissolution of a marriage. Violence against women is not widespread
 and is not tolerated by society or the Government. Several women's rights groups
 are active in Luxembourg, including some that aid battered women.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Ali workers have the right to associate freely, choose
 their own representatives, publicize views, and determine agenda. Approximately 65
 percent of the labor force is unionized. Membership is not mandatory. Unions opr-
 ate free of governmental interference. The two largest labor federations are lied
 to, but organized independently of, the Christian Social and the Socialist parties.
 There are also several independent unions.
 Except for some government workers providing essential services, all workers
 have the right to strike. Those government workers who may strike must observe
 certain conditions, such as preliminary cooling-off periods. Workers rarely strike in
 Luxembourg; no strikes occurred in 1992. Still, the labor federations used a general
 strike threat in the spring to reach agreement on a health insurance system reform
 compromise that averted a cut in government contributions.
 Unions maintain unrestricted contact with international bodies, including the Eu-
 ropean Trade Union Confederation and the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-.
 tected by law and freely practiced throughout Luxembourg. Wages, benefits, and
 working conditions are set in free negotiations between unions and employers. All
 businesses having 15 or more employees must have worker representatives. Busi-
 nesses with over 150 employees must form works councils composed of equal num-
 bers of management and employee representatives. In businesses with more than
 1,000 employees, one-third of the membership of the supervisory boards of directors
 must be employees' representatives.
 Both Luxembourg law and practice promote union activity and protect union lead-
 ers and members from discrimination. Effective procedures exist and are used to ad-
 judicate employment-related complaints.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under the
 age of 15 is prohibited. Children are required by law to remain in school until they
 are 16 years old. Apprentices between 15 and 16 years of age must also attend
 school. Adolescent workers receive additional legal protection, including limits on
 overtime and the number of hours that can be worked continuously. The Ministries
 of Labor and of Education oversee strict enforcement of national child labor and
 education laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The current minimum wage legislation, effec-
 tive as of August 1992, provides for a minimum wage for workers at least 18 years
 of age with no dependents. Lower, tiered minimum wage rates apply to younger
 workers and students between 15 and 18 years of age and increase yearly by ag.
 Minimum wage rates apply, without exception, to all sectors of the economy.  I
 wages and salaries are indexed to the general cost-of-living index. Supplements to
 the minimum wage are added for workers with dependents. Nonetheless supporting
 a family in Luxembourg is difficult on the minimum      wage. in practice,
 Luxembourg's wages are among the world's highest, and most employees receive
 more than the minimum wage.
 National legislation mandates a workweek of 40 hours. Premiumpay is required
 for overtime or unusual hours. Employment on Sunday is prohibited exceot in con-

 tinuous process industries (steel, glass, and chemicals) and for certain maintenance
 and security personnel. All workers receive a minimum of 5 weeks of paid vacation
 yearly, in addition to paid holidays.
 Luxembourg's health and safety standards are among the highest in the world.
 A safe working environment is mandated by law and strictly enforced through an
 ins ection system that provides severe penalties for infractions. Inspections are car-
 rie out by the Labor   spectorate of  e Ministry of Labor and by Accident Insur-
 ance Agency of the Social Security Ministry.
