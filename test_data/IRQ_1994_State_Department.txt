 IRAQ*
 Political power in Iraq is concentrated in a repressive one-party apparatus domi-
 nated by Saddam Hussein. The provisional Constitution of 1968 stipulates that the
 Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party governs Iraq through the Revolutionary Command
 Council (RCC), which exercises both executive and legislative authority. President
 Saddam Hussein, who is also Prime Minister, Chairman of the RCC, and Secretary
 General of the Regional Command of the ABSP, wields decisive power.
 Ethnically and linguistically, the Iraqi population includes Arabs, Kurds,
 Turcomans, Yazidis, and Armenians. The religious mix is likewise varied: Shi'a and
 Sunni Muslims (both Arab and Kurdish), Christians (including Chaldeans and As-
 syrians), and Jews. Ethnic divisions have resulted in civil uprisings in recent years,
 especially in the north and the south. The Government has reacted against these
 peoples with extreme repression.
 The Government's security apparatus includes militias attached to the President,
 the Ba'ath Party, and the Interior Ministry. Security forces have been responsible
 for widespread and systematic human rights abuses. They play a central role in
 maintaining the environment of intimidation and fear on which government power
 rests.
 The Government controls Iraq's oil-based economy and owns all major industries.
 Damaged by the Gulf War and subjected to United Nations sanctions as a result
 of Iraqs 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the economy continues to deteriorate. The sanc-
 tions ban all exports and imports except food, medicine, and materials and supplies
 for essential civilian needs. The Government's failure to comply with U.N. Security
 Council resolutions has led to repeated extensions of the sanctions.
 The Government's abysmal record on human rights did not improve in 1994, and
 worsened in several areas. Systematic violations continued in all categories, includ-
 ing mass executions of political opponents, widespread use of torture, extreme re-
 pression of ethnic groups, disappearances, denial of due process, and arbitrary de-
 tention. Tens of thousands of political killings and disappearances remain unre-
 solved from previous years. Human rights abuses are difficult to document because
 of the Government's efforts to conceal the facts.
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government, and the freedoms of
 expression and association do not exist, except in Kurdish-controlled areas in the
 north under the protection of international forces.
 The regime deliberately targeted civilians in military operations against Shi'a
 Arabs living in the southern marshes. In the north, the regime maintained an inter-
 nal embargo on the importation of food, medicine, and other humanitarian goods to
 Kurdish areas. It imposed additional electricity cut-offs in Dohuk governorate, exac-
 erbating the electrical crisis it had initiated there in late 1993. Elsewhere, the re-
 gime diverted humanitarian supplies to its own supporters and to the military. As
 socioeconomic conditions deteriorated in 1994, the regime introduced new forms of
 torture for persons accused of economic crimes and military desertion.
 In violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, the Government persisted in its
 flagrant interference with the international community's provision of humanitarian
 assistance. It harassed and intimidated relief workers and targeted them for assas-
 sination. A German journalist covering the relief effort and her Kurdish bodyguard
 were shot to death, execution-style. Several other international personnel, including
 United Nations guards and journalists, were critically injured in bomb and shooting
 attacks. New information came to light indicating that the Government offered re-
 wards for killing international relief personnel.

 on non-U.S. Government sources.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The regime has a long record of exe-
 cuting perceived opponents. In his October report to the U.N. General Assembly, the
 U.N. Special Rapporteur (hereafter referred to as the Special Rapporteur) stated
 that the Government's "aim of killing is a political one, with the objective of silenc-
 ing dissent and suppressing opposition."
 As in previous years, there were numerous credible reports that the regime had
 executed a number of persons allegedly involved in plotting against Sadam Hus-
 sein, including some members of his family and tribe. Hig-ranking civilian, mili-
 tary, and tribal leaders were reported among those executed.
 On April 12, an opposition figure, Talib Suhayl Al-Tamimi, was assassinated in
 Beirut, Lebanon. Lebanese security officials arrested two Iraqi diplomats assigned
 to Beirut and charged them with the murder. The suspects admitted their guilt but
 at year's end there was no movement toward a trial.
 The Government continued to provide safe haven and logistical and military sup-
 port to several terrorist groups and individuals. These include the Mojahedin-e
 Khalq, which is opposed to the Government of Iran; elements of the Abu Nia Or-
 ganization, based in Lebanon; Abu Abbas' Palestine Liberation Front (PLF); and the
 notorious bomb-maker Abu Ibrahim. Both Abbas and Ibrahim enjoyed sanctuary in
 Iraq.
 In July the prominent oppositionist, Taki Al-Khoei, and two other members of his
 family and their driver were killed under suspicious circumstances in an automobile
 crash in southern Iraq, near Al Najaf. Strong circumstantial evidence pointed to the
 Government's involvement. The Government had long targeted the Al-Khoei family
 for harassment and abuse. The family is renowned in Shi'a circles for its religious
 leadership and outspoken condemnation of the regime's human rights record (see
 Section 1.b.).
 The Special Rapporteur noted in his February report several cases of political kill-
 ing dating from 1993. These included mass executions of Shi'a Arabs at the Al-
 Radwaniyah and Abu Ghraib prisons in central Iraq. According to the Special
 Rapporteur, some of those killed had been involved in the uprising against the Gov-
 ernment in the spring of 1991.
 In November 1993, the Special Rapporteur reported that the Government had ex-
 ecuted several Turcomans whose bedies were mutilated before being returned to
 their families.
 As in past years, the Special Rapporteur noted the frequent use of the death pen-
 alty for such political offenses as "insulting" the President or the Ba'ath Party. His
 February report summarized several RCC decrees that stipulate the death penalty
 for political and civil offenses (see Section i.e.).
 As in previous years, authorities arrested and placed in detention centers in
 central Iraq numerous Shi'a inhabitants of the south. Shi'a witnesses who survived
 detention later reported that some of their comrades had been executed (see Section
 1.g.). As the Government strictly controls the movement of international personnel
 in the southern marshes, information is not available to confirm the number of per-
 sons killed.
 Political killings and terrorist actions were frequent in the north and directed
 against civilians, foreign relief workers, journalists, and opposition leaders. German
 journalist Lissy Schmidt and her Kurdish bodyguard, Aziz Kader Faraj, were shot
 to death on April 3 in an ambush near Suleymaniya. Kurdish authorities arrested
 several suspects who reportedly confessed that the Government had paid them to
 commit the murders.
 The U.S. Government announced in April it had information indicating that the
 Government of Iraq had offered monetary "bounties" to anyone who assassinates
 United Nations and other international relief workers.
 Amnesty International (Al) reported that three Kurdish political parties in north-
 ern Iraq-the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the Kurdish Democratic Party, and the
 Islamic Party in Iraqi Kurdistan-had committed scores of deliberate and arbitrary
 killings against each other in 1993. Press reports indicated that the Kurdish parties
 continued to commit arbitrary killings against each other in 1994.
 In 1994 additional information came to light concerning the so-called Anfal Cam-
 paig ("Spoils") of 1988, in which tans of thousands of Kurds reportedly lost their
 lves. The campaign is the most prominent example of political killing. During the
 campaign, government forces arrested thousands of Kurds who have never been
 seen again. They are presumed to have been died in custody (see Sections 1.b. and
 1.g.).
 
 
 1086
 In his February report, the Special Rapporteur concluded that the Government's
 policies against the Kurds-in particular, against the Barzani tribe-"raise issues
 of crimes against humanity and violations of the 1948 Genocide Convention." He
 noted "significant similarities" between the Government's past policies toward the
 Kurds and its current policies toward Shi'a civilians living in the southern marshes.
 The Special Rapporteur recommended that "further consideration be given to estab-
 lish the facts and responsibilities associated with atrocities committed against the
 Kurdish population."
 b. Disapfpearance.-In February the Special Rapporteur reported that he contin-
 ued to receive "reports on the widespread phenomenon of disappearance." He stated
 that the U.N. Working Group on Enforcement on Involuntary Disappearances had
 conveyed to the Government 10,570 names of disappeared persons and planned to
 convey another 5,000.
 The United Nations has documented 16,000 cases of disappeared persons. Accord-
 ing to the Special Rapporteur, most of the disappearances occurred uig the Anfal
 Campaign. However, he estimates that the total figure for disappeared Kurds dur-
 ing Anfal could number in the tens of thousands. Middle East Watch estimates the
 total at between 70 000 and 100,000, and AI at more than 100,000. The Special
 Rapporteur noted that persons continue to disappear, mainly in the southern
 marshes, where the Government is conducting counterinsurgency operations.
 New information came to light regarding the Barzani arrests of 1983, in which
 security forces detained thousands of relatives and tribesmen of the late Kurdish
 nationalist hero Mustapha Barzani. None of these detainees were ever seen again.
 The Special Rapporteur observed in February that the regime's treatment of the
 Barzani tribe may constitute violations of the Genocide Convention.
 The Special Rapporteur and various human rights groups continued to make in-
 quiries with the Government regarding its arrest in 1991 of the late Grand Aya-
 tollah Abdul Qasim Al-Khoei and 108 of his associates. The Ayatollah died while
 under house arrest in Al-Najaf, and only two of the persons arrested with him can
 be accounted for. The regime has not responded to queries regarding the others ar-
 rested with AI-Khoei.
 The Government failed to return, or account for, a large number of Kuwaiti citi-
 zens and third-country nationals detained during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. It
 denies having any knowledge of the missing persons. U.N. Security Council Resolu-
 tion (UNSCR) 687 requires the Government to "facilitate" the search for and the re-
 patriation of those still missing. In his October report, the Special Rapporteur noted
 that the Government's failure to account for the missing persons violates provisions
 of the various Geneva Conventions, to which Iraq is a party.
 Middle East Watch estimated that, apart from the tens of thousands of persons
 who have disappeared and are presumed dead, another 10,000 to 12,000 persons
 were being held without charge in prisons and detention centers.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Government is a p arty to international conventions against torture,
 and the Constitution prohibits the practice, the security services routinely torture
 detainees. The Special Rapporteur continues to note the Government's "systematic"
 use of physical and psychological torture. According to former detainees, torture
 techniques include electric shocks administered to the genitals and other sensitive
 areas, beatings, burnings with hot irons, suspension from ceiling fans dripping acid
 on the skin, rape, breaking of limbs, denial of food and water, and threats to rape
 or otherwise harm relatives. The tormentors kill many torture victims and mutilate
 their bodies before delivering them to the victims' families.
 The authorities introduced new forms of torture in September, including the am-
 putation of ears and the branding of foreheads for certain economic crimes and for
 desertion from the military. Large numbers of persons reportedly bled to death from
 such punishments. Opposition media reported that the regime's use of ear amputa-
 tions sparked a large antiregime demonstration in Mosul on September 8. Opposi-
 tion media also reported that the authorities executed several doctors who had re-
 fused to carry out the amputations.
 The regime also introduced the traditional Islamic law punishment for thievery-
 amputation of the right hand. It subsequently stipulated branding of the forehead
 as the punishment for thieves whose hands already had been amputated and the
 death penalty for certain categories of thievery. An official newspaper reported on
 September 9 that the authorities amputated the right hand and branded the fore-
 head of a person convicted of stealing a television set.
 In his October report, the Special Rapporteur condemned the amputations and
 brandings. He stated that the practices constitute "flagrant and determined viola-
 tions of Iraq's international human rights obligations insofar as they prescribe cruel
 and unusual punishments and insofar as implementation of the decrees compounds
 
 
 1087
 these violations by the conduct of torture." The relevant obligation in this regard
 is Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which
 Iraq is a party. The U.N. General Assembly likewise condemned what it termed
 umtilations' in a December resolution.
 Certain prisons are notorious for routine mistreatment of prisoners. AI-Rashidiya
 Prison, on the Tigris River north of Taji, reportedly contains torture chambers in
 its basement. The Al-Shamma'iya Prison, located in east Baghdad, holds the men-
 tally ill and is reportedly the site of both torture and disappearances.
 The Al-Radwaniyah Prison (see Section L.a.) is a former prisoner-of-war facility
 near Baghdad and reportedly the site of torture and arbitrary killings, including
 mass execution by firing squad. This prison was the principal detention center for
 persons arrested following thecivil uprisings of 1991. Many persons taken into cus-
 tody in connection with the uprisings have not been seen since. Middle East Watch
 estimated in 1994 that the A1-Radwaniyah Prison holds between 5,000 and 10,000
 detainees.
 The Special Rapporteur, Middle East Watch, and Al cited the AI-Radwaniyah
 Prison and the Abu Ghraib Prison, located in Baghdad, as principal sites where tor-
 ture and disappearances continue to occur. According to opposition reports, in late
 1994 authorities at the Abu Ghraib Prison amputated the hands of persons con-
 victed of theft.
 The security forces allegedly raped captured civilians during the Anfal Campaign
 and the occupation of Kuwait and the Gulf War. The Special Rapporteur noted m
 his February report that he had interviewed numerous women who continue to suf-
 fer severe depression after they were raped in official custody. The Government has
 never acknowledged or taken any action to investigate reports of rape by its offi-
 cials.
 Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq also employed torture. Al reported in 1994
 that these authorities and Kurdish opposition groups used torture on political oppo-
 nents and criminal suspects in 1993.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution and Legal
 Code explicitly prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, the authorities routinely en-
 gage in these practices. In his February report, the Special Rapporteur described
 1widespread aritary arrest and detention, in violation of Article 9 of the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights," primarily in the southern part of the country. He
 stated that the military and security services, rather than the ordinary police, car-
 ried out most cases of arbitrary arrest and detention.
 Opposition sources reported in July that the regime had detained 320 people dur-
 ing military operations in the A1-Amarah marshes in June (see Section I.g.) The op-
 position conveyed the names of the reported detainees to the Special Rapporteur.
 The Special Rapporteur reported that the regime continued to target the Shi'a
 Muslim clergy for arbitrary arrest and other abuses. In March international news
 media reported that the regime had forcibly expelled from Iraq the families of the
 more than 100 Shi'a clerics who had disappeared in 1991 after their arrests with
 the late Grand Ayatollah aI-Khoei (see Section 1.b.). Many of these clerics and their
 families are of foreign nationality, primarily Iranian and Pakistani.
 According to Al and Middle East Watch, several foreigners arrested arbitrarily in
 previous years remained in detention.
 The Government's refusal to allow tens of thousands of Kurds and Turcomans to
 return to their homes in Kirkuk and Mosul amounts to a policy of internal exile (see
 Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There are two parallel judicial systems: the re~u.-
 lar courts, which try common criminal offenses; and special security courts, which
 try cases involving national security. However, the security courts try many crimi-
 nal cases. The President may override any court decision. There are no checks on
 his power. The Special Rapporteur noted in his February report that the executive
 interferes regularly in "all aspects of normal judicial competence in matters ranging
 from property and commercial law, to family law and criminal law."
 The prlcedural rules applicable in the regular courts theoretically provide many
 basic protections. However, the regime often assigns to the security courts cases
 which, on their merits, would appear to fall under the jurisdiction of the regular
 courts. Trials in the regular courts are public,and defendants are entitled to coun-
 sel--at government expense in the case of indigents. Defense lawyers have the right
 to review the charges and evidence brought against their clients. There is no jury
 system:panels of three judges try cases. Defendants have the right to appeal to the
 Court ofAppeal and then to the Court of Cassation, the highest Court.
 The Special Rapporteur reported that the regular courts often assign penalties
 that are "disproportionate' to the offense (see Setion 1.c.). Decree 13 of 1992 im-
 poses the death penalty for automobile theft. In 1994 the Government announced
 
 
 1088
 the death penalty would be invoked for automobile smuggling, various categories of
 thievery, and solicitation for the purposes of prostitution. As of late 1994, the pen-
 alty for possession of stolen goods was life in prison.
 Similarly, the Government shields certai groups from prosecution for alleged
 crimes. A 1992 decree grants immunity from prosecution to members of the Ba'ath
 Party and the security forces who may cause death while in the pursuit of army
 deserters. A 1990 decree grants immunity to men who kill their mothers, daughters,
 and other female family members who have committed "immoral deeds."
 There are no Shari'a, or Islamic law, courts as such. Regular courts are empow-
 ered to administer Islamic law in cases involving personal status, such as divorce
 and inheritance. In 1994 the regime introduced Shari'a punishments for some types
 of criminal offenses and for military desertion (see Section 1.b.).
 Special security courts have jurisdiction in all cases involving espionage and trea-
 son, peaceful political dissent smu 9ng, currency exchange violations, and drug
 trafficking. According to the Special apporteur, military officers or civil servants
 with no legal training head these tribunals, which hear cases in secret. Authorities
 often hold the defendants in incommunicado detention and do not permit them to
 have contact with their lawyers. The courts admit confessions extracted by torture
 which often serve as the basis for conviction. Although defendants may appeal their
 sentences to Saddam Hussein, many cases appear to end in summary execution
 shortly after trial.
 Because the Government rarely acknowledges arrests or imprisonments, it is dif-
 ficult to estimate the number of political prisoners. Many of the tens of thousands
 of persons who have disappeared or been killed in recent years were originally held
 as political prisoners.
 f Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government frequently disregards the constitutional right to privacy, particularly in
 cases in which national security is alleged to be involved. The law defines security
 offenses so broadly that authorities are virtually exempt from the legal requirement
 to obtain search warrants. In 1994 the authorities subjected the Shi a religious cler-
 gy, Shi'a Muslim inhabitants of the southern marshes, and various ethnic minorities
 to searches without warrants (see Section 1.g.). The regime routinely ignores the
 constitutional provisions safeguarding the confidentiality of mail and telegraphic
 correspondence and telephone conversations.
 The security services and the Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive networks of in-
 formers to deter dissident activity and instill fear in the public. As the Special
 Rapporteur noted in his February re ort "the fear of informers and subsequent se-
 vere reprisals have prevented virtually te entire population from expressing genu-
 inely held opinions which are not consistent with those of the Government."
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-In 1994 as in previous years, the armed forces conducted deliberate artillery
 attacks against civilians in the southern marshes. The marshes historically have
 been inhabited mostly by Shi'a Muslims, but in recent years they have also become
 a refuge for army deserters and displaced civilians. As a result, the marshes are
 the site of guerrilla resistance. The Gulf War allies imposed a "no-fly zone" over
 southern Iraq in 1992. It continues to deter aerial attacks on the marsh dwellers,
 but does not prevent artillery attacks or the military's large-scale burning oper-
 ations.
 Ongoing military operations have destroyed the traditional way of life of the
 marsh Arab Shi'a. Credible reports describe a continuing process of large-scale envi-
 ronmental destruction in the marshes caused by the Government's burning, drain-
 ing, and water-diversion projects. The army has constructed canals, causeways, and
 earthen berms to divert water from the wetlands. Hundreds of square kilometers
 of marsh areas have been burned, imperiling the marshes' ecosystem.
 The Government claims the drainage is part of a land reclamation plan to in-
 crease the acreage of arable land, spur agricultural production, and reduce salt pol-
 lution in the Tigris and Euphrates. However, the evidence of large-scale humani-
 tarian and ecological destruction appears to belie this claim. Aerial and satellite
 photography made public by the U.S. Government in 1994 depicted the almost total
 destruction of the marshes. Moreover, the regime's diversion of supplies in the south
 limited the population's access to food, medicine, drinking water, and transpor-
 tation.
 As the marshes dried, military units launched land-based attacks on villages. On
 March 4, the military began the largest search-and-destroy operation in the marshes
 in 2 years. The offensive included the razing of villages and burning operations con-
 centrated in the triangle bounded by Nasiriyah, Al-Qurnah, and Basrah. The mag-
 nitude of the operation caused the inhabitants to flee in several directions: deeper
 into the marshes, to the outskirts of southern Iraqi cities, and to Iran.
 
 
 1089
 According to opposition sources, military forces in late June attacked several
 marsh villages in Nassiriya province. Sources said that army engineers burned the
 village of AI-Abra, containing about 80 homes to the ground. After the operation,
 the army transported the village's inhabitants from. the scene.
 According to opposition sources, security forces in early July stormed the villages
 of A1-Sjiya and  l-Majawid in Al-Chibaish district, near the main road leading into
 the marshes. Simultaneously armor units supported by heavy artillery attacked the
 village of Al-Kheyout in the district of Al-Madina.
 Als in July the military conducted large-scale artillery bombardment in the
 Jindala area of the Al-Amarah marshes. Opposition sources said the bombardment
 destroyed several homes and injured several individuals. Security forces reportedly
 detained 15 youths and transported them from the area. Simultaneously, the mili-
 tary caused destruction and arrested inhabitants in Al-Hashriya, Al-Wasdiya, and
 Al.Malha.
 In September opposition sources reported that military forces used incendiary
 bombs and launched an armored attack against the area of A1-Seigel in the AI-
 Amarah marshes. The army later set fire to the entire area.
 In 1994 military operations caused an undetermined number of civilian casualties
 in the marshes. More than 10,000 refugees from the marshes fled to Iran, where
 they joined between 50,000 and 60,000 who had fled in previous years.
 In January the European Parliament (EP) passed a resolution characterizing the
 marsh Arabs as a persecuted minority 'whose very survival is threatened by the
 Iraqi Government." The EP resolution described the Government's treatment of the
 marsh inhabitants as "genocde.'
 According to Middle East Watch and US. Government researchers, government
 files captured by Kurdish rebels in 1991 contain a military plan for the destruction
 of the marshes and the people living there. The plan appears to have been approved
 at the highest levels of the Government. It is being implemented by Minister of De-
 fense Ali-Hassan Al-Majid, the military leader who supervised the Anfal Campaign.
 The Special Rapporteur continues to note the similarity between the Govern-
 ment's "genocide-type operations" against the Kurds and its operations in southern
 Iraq. He stated in his February report that the extent of violations against the
 marsh inhabitants 'places the survival of this indigenous population in jeopardy."
 In August the Special Rapporteur dispatched two of his assistants to the Iran-Iraq
 border to interview refugees fleeing the marshes. He reported in October that the
 refugees are generally in poor physical and psychological condition, having suffered
 extreme deprivation of food and medicine. He reiterated his "concern over the sur-
 vival" of the marsh inhabitants "as a community."
 Regarding the Kurds, the Special Rapporteur reported in February that he also
 holds the Government responsible for "serious breaches" of the 1925 Geneva Proto-
 col on the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases,
 and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare. He observed that these breaches may
 demonstrate the Government liable under the 1948 Genocide Convention. According
 to the Special Rapporteur, the activities of the Government during the Anfal Cam-
 paign "left virtually no Iraqi Kurd untouched." He concluded that "serious violations
 of human rights committe against the civilian population of Iraq both in times of
 war and peace involve crimes against humanity committed under and pursuant to
 the commands of Saddam Hussein and All Hassan al-Majid."
 The Special Rapporteur reported that he continued to receive accounts of mass
 graves in southernaq. Observers believe these graves contain the remains of per-
 sons killed following the civil uprising of March 1991. As the Government does not
 permit international visitors into these areas, forensics experts have not yet inves-
 ti gated the grave sites.
 However, forensics experts continued to develop information obtained from mass
 grave sites in northern Iraq. These graves contain the remains of hundreds of per-
 sons presumed killed in the Anfal Campaign. According to opposition sources, a new
 mass grave, containing up to 250 bodies, was found in April near the Al-Sharqat
 district of Mosul. Sources said that the graves were discovered when heavy rains
 washed away the covering soil.
 Based on forensic evidence and government documents seized by the Kurds in
 1991, Middle East Watch and Physicians for Human Rights estimate that between
 70,000 and 100,000 Kurds were killed, and up to 4,000 villages destroyed, during
 the Anfal Campaign. The evidence suggests that government efforts to eliminate
 Kurdish communities were widespread, systematically planned, and ruthlessly im-
 plemented.
 The most flagrant example of current discrimination against the Kurds is the
 Government's ongoing internal embargo on the north, which includes necessities
 such as food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies. Since August 1993, the
 
 
 1090
 
 embargo also has included massive electric power cut-offs in specific areas, causing
 the spoilage of medicines, breakdowns in local water-purification systems, and the
 loss of certain hospital services. A disaster was averted only by the prompt action
 of the United Nations and donor governments, who imported and installed tem-
 porary generators to alleviate the crisis. Additional electricity cut-offs were imposed
 in August 1994. The embargo of the north has impacted not only Kurds but various
 other minorities such as Turcomans, who also live in the area.
 Operation Provide Comfort-the joint US., British, French, and Turkish com-
 mand--continued in 1994 to inhibit government aerial attacks in the northern "no
 fly zone." However, the military forces continued intermittent, sometimes heavy
 shelling of northern villages by long-range artillery. On October 26, opposition
 media reported that shelling of villages in the Shawan region had resulted in sev-
 eral civilian casualties, one fatal.
 Attacks on humanitarian relief efforts in northern Iraq continued throughout
 1994. Two persons were killed in an execution-style shooting (see Section L.a.). Sev-
 eral other international workers involved in the relief effort, including six United
 Nations guards, were injured in bombing and shooting attacks in March and April.
 On March 27, Iraqi security forces permitted a crowd in Mosul to attack and dam-
 age a U.N. helicopter attempting to airlift wounded guards to safety. Two Swedish
 journalists were injured in Aqrah on March 14 when a bomb exploded under their
 automobile.
 Some terrorist incidents pointed to government involvement, but there was insuf-
 ficient information to determine the responsibility for other attacks.
 Innocent civilians were the victims of fighting between the guerrilla forces of the
 two main Kurdish political parties--the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the
 Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). Heavy fighting between the two parties broke
 out in May, in August, and again in December, producing several hundred civilian
 casualties.
 In 1994 civilians near the Turkish border were caught in raids by Turkish mili-
 tary forces on suspected hideouts of the extremist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PK).
 On August 8, Turkish planes bombed a camp near Zakho containing 10,000 Kurdish
 refugees from Turkey. Although the refugees suffered no casualties, 10 Iraqi guards
 were reported killed and 7 wounded. The Turkish Government claimed that PKK
 terrorists were hiding in the camps.
 On August 23, Turkish planes attacking a PKK camp in Zele bombed the nearby
 village of Bidewan village, wounding 7 Iraqi Kurdish civilians. On September 8,
 Turkish planes again bombed the large concentration of Turkish refugees near
 Zakho. No ijuries were reported, but several tents were destroyed.
 Kurdish villages along the Iranian border were subjected to shelling by the Ira-
 nian military, as well as to sporadic Iranian military incursions into Iraqi territory.
 Opposition media reported that Iranian artillery shelled civilian areas in As-
 Suleymaniyah province the night of April 17-18. Iranian forces were also reportedly
 involved in fighting between the two main Iraqi Kurdish parties in August and De-
 cember.
 The Iranian military conducted attacks on Iranian opposition camps based in
 Iraq. On November 6, it launched a SCUD missile attack on a Mojahedin E-Khalq
 base located some 30 miles north of Baghdad. On November 9, Iranian jets bombed
 an Iranian Kurdish Democratic Party base in the town of Koi-Sanjaq in northern
 Iraq.
 Land mines in northern Iraq continued to kill or maim civilians. Many of the
 mines were laid during the Iraq-Iraq War, but the army has failed to clear them.
 The mines appear to have been haphazardly planted in civilian areas. The Special
 Rapporteur has repeatedly reminded the Government of its obligations under the
 Land Mines Protocol, to which Iraq is a party, to protect civilians from the effects
 of mines.
 Based on interviews with victims and eyewitnesses, the U.S. Government has con-
 cluded that the Iraqi regime engaged in war crimes-willful killing, torture, rape,
 pillage, hostage-taking, unlawful deportation, and related acts--directly related to
 the Gulf War. The US. Government urged the U.N. Security Council to create an
 international commission to study evidence of a broader range of war crimes, as well
 as crimes against humanity, and possible genocide.
 At the end of 1994, Middle East Watch was preparing a charge of genocide that
 it hopes governments will bring against the Government of Iraq before the Inter-
 national Court of Justice in the Hague. Middle East Watch reported that its case
 was based on a thorough review of evidence obtained from mass graves, government
 documents, and interviews with eyewitnesses.
 
 
 1091
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and of the press do not exist
 in areas under the Government's control, and political dissent is not tolerated in
 those areas. The Government and the Ba'ath Party own all print and broadcast
 media and operate them as propaganda outlets. They do not report opposition views.
 The Special Rapporteur noted in his February report the extent to which the Gov-
 ernment has criminalized most forms of personal expression. A 1986 decree stipu-
 lates the death penalty for anyone insulti  the President or other high government
 officials. Section 214 of the Penal Code prohibits "singing a song likely to cause civil
 strife." Press Act 206 (1968) prohibits the writing of articles on 12 specific subjects,
 including those detrimental to the President.
 The Government periodically jams news broadcasts, including those of opposition
 groups, from outside Iraq.
 Various Ba'ath Party and presidential decrees define political dissent as encom-
 passing a wide range of activities. Persons suspected of engaging in dissent are rou-
 tinely imprisoned without charge or trial or after trials that do not meet minimum
 standards of fairness.
 In northern Iraq, which is protected by international forces and is administered
 by a local de facto government, several newspapers have appeared over the past 3
 years, as have opposition radio and television broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Except in northern areas
 under the protection of international forces, the citizens may not legally assemble
 or organize for any political purpose other than to express support for the regime.
 By law, the Government controls the formation of parties, regulates their internal
 affairs and closely monitors their activities. Several parties are specifically out-
 lawed, and membership in them is a capital offense. A 1974 law prescribes the
 death penalty for anyone "infltrating" the Ba'ath Part.1..
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government severely limits this freedom. The Provi-
 sional Constitution of 1968 states that "Islam is the religion of the State.* The Min-
 istry of Endowments and Religious Affairs monitors places of worship, appoints the
 clergy, and approves the publication of religious literature.
 Although   'hI'a Musim Arabs, who arebetween 60 and 65 percent of the popu-
 lation, are the largest ethnoreligious group, Sunni Arabs, who comprise only about
 12 to 15 percent of the population, have traditionally dominated economic and politi-
 cal life. Despite legal guarantees of sectarian equality, the Government has in re-
 cent years repressed the Shi'a clergy and followers of the Shi'a faith. Security forces
 have wantonly desecrated Shi'a mosques and holy sites, particularly in the after-
 math of the 1991 civil uprisings.
 The following government restrictions on religious rights remained in effect
 throughout 1994: a ban on the Muslim call to prayer in certain cities; a ban on the
 broadcast of Shi'a programs on government radio or television- a ban on the publica-
 tion of Shi'a books, including prayer books- a ban on funeral processions; and the
 prohibition of certain processions and public meetings commemorating Shi'a holy
 days. Moreover the Government also continued to insist that its own appointee re-
 place the late Grand Ayatollah Abul Qasim AI-Khoei, formerly the highest ranking
 Shi'a clergyman, who died in Government custody in 1992 (see Section 1.b.). The
 Shi'a religious establishment refuses to accept the Government's choice.
 The Government also continued to harass and threaten members of the late Aya-
 tollah Al-Khoei's family. Circumstantial evidence pointed to the regime's involve-
 ment in the July deaths of several members of the Al-Khoei family (see Sections L.a.
 and 1.b.).
 The Special Rapporteur reports that the Government has engaged in various
 abuses against the Christian Assyrian community, which numbers about 350,000.
 Most Assyrians have traditionally lived in the north, and the Government often has
 suspected them of "cllaborating" with Kurds. Military forces destroyed many Assyr-
 ian churches during the Anfal Campaign, and reportedly tortured and executed
 many Assyrians (see Section 4).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government controls movement within the country of citizens and
 foreigners. Persons who enter sensitive border areas and numerous designated secu-
 rity zones are subject to arrest (see Section 1.d.). Police checkpoints are common on
 major roads and highways.
 The Government requires citizens to obtain expensive exit visas for foreign travel.
 Citizens may not make more than two trips abroad annually. The Government re-
 portedly prohibits some citizens from all international travel. Before traveling
 abroad, citizens are required to post collateral with the Government which is re-
 fundable only upon their return to Iraq. There are restrictions on the amount of cur-
 
 
 1092
 rency that may be taken out of the country. Women are not permitted to travel out-
 side Iraq alone; male relatives must escort them.
 The Government continued to pursue its discriminatory resettlement policies, in-
 cluding demolition of villages ani forced relocations of Kurds, Turcomans, and other
 minorities. Middle East Watch reported that the Government was continuing to
 force Kurdish residents of Mosul to move to Kurdish-controlled areas in the north.
 However, the Government directed most of its resettlement efforts in 1994 at resi-
 dents of the southern marshes. According to the Special Rapporteur, security forces
 relocate marsh inhabitants detained during the course of military operations to the
 main southern cities. They were later transferred to detention centers and prisons
 in central Iraq, primarily in Baghdad.
 Opposition sources reported in September that the Government had relocated
 more than 300 families from the marshes to a detention area in Diwaniya province.
 The authorities reportedly returned other families who had taken refuge in Baghdad
 to the province of Amara.
 Large numbers of Shi'a refugees from southern Iraq fled to Iran, particularly after
 the escalation in military activity in March. It was difficult to estimate the number
 of persons displaced by these operations, due to the lack of international monitors
 in the area. However in late 1994 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) estimated tat more than 10 000 refugees from the marshes were in
 camps in Iran. Amar Appeal, a charitable orgamzation operating several of the
 camps, placed the number at more than 35,000. U.S. Government analysts esti-
 mated in September that more than 200,000 of the 250,000 former inhabitants of
 the marshes had been driven from the area since 1991 (see also Section L.a.).
 In February 1994, the Special Rapporteur noted that the Government in 1993 had
 expelled several "Faili," or Shi'a, Kurdish families. Faili Kurds, who have tradition-
 ally lived in the mountainous region bordering Iran, were the victims of mass depor-
 tations in the 1970's and 1980's.
 The Special Rapporteur reported that in recent years the Government may have
 expelled a total of more than 1 million persons suspected of being "Persian sym-
 pathizers." According to the Special Rapporteur, about 500,000 of these displaced
 persons are believed to live in Iran.
 According to the UNHCR, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees remained
 abroad-mainly in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Turkey, Pakistan, and Jor-
 dan. Apart from those suspected of sympathizing with Iran, most fled after the Gov-
 ernment's suppression of the civil uprising of 1991; others are Kurds who fled the
 Anfal Campaign of 1988. The UNHCR assists many refugees, notably in Kuwait,
 Syria, and Turkey.
 Of the 1.5 million refugees who fled following the 1991 uprising, the great major-
 ity, particularly Kurds, have repatriated themselves to northern Iraq, in areas
 where the allies have prohibited overflights by Iraqi aircraft. Several hundred thou-
 sand Kurds remain unsettled in northern Iraq because political circumstances do
 not permit them to return to their former homes in Government-controlled territory.
 Moreover, northern Iraq is host to about 10,000 recently arrived Turkish Kurds,
 who have fled civil strife in southeastern Turkey (see the report on Turkey), in re-
 sponse to the Turkish government's counterinsurgency campaign against the PKK.
 The UNHCR is treating these displaced persons as refugees until it reaches an offi-
 cial determination on their status. In late 1994, the UNHCR relocated the Turkish
 Kurds to protect them from periodic raids by Turkish military aircraft (see Section
 'udents abroad who refuse to return are required to reimburse any expenses
 paid by the Government. Each student wishing to travel abroad must provide a
 guarantor. The guarantor and the student's parents may be liable if the student
 fails to return.
 Foreign spouses of citizens who have resided in Iraq for 5 years are required to
 apply for nationality. The requirement is 1 year of residence for the spouses of Iraqi
 citizens employed in government offices. Many foreigners thus have been obliged to
 accept citizenship and are subject to official travel restrictions. The penalties for
 noncompliance include loss of job, a substantial financial penalty, and repayment for
 any governmental educational expenses.
 The Government prevents many citizens who also hold citizenship in another
 country---specially the children of Iraqi fathers and foreign-born mothers-from
 visiting the country of their other nationality.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. The only free and open
 local elections have been held in Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Iraq. Full po-
 
 
 1093
 litical participation at the national level is confined to members of the Ba'ath Party,
 estimated at about 8 percent of the population. The National Assembly is completely
 subordinate to the executive branch.
 Saddam Hussein wields decisive power over all instruments of government. Al-
 most all powerful officials are either members of the President's family or longtime
 family allies from his home town of Tikrit.
 Opposition political organizations are illegal and severely suppressed. Member-
 ship in certain political parties is punishable by death (see Section 2.b.). In 1991
 the RCC adopted a law tat theoretically authorized the creation of political parties
 other than the Ba'ath, but in practice, the law reinforced the preeminent position
 of the Ba'ath Party by prohibiting parties that do not support Saddam Hussein and
 the present Government. New parties must be based in Baghdad and are forbidden
 to have any ethnic or religious character.
 The Government does not recognize the various political groupings and parties
 that have been formed by Shi'a Muslims, as well as the Kurdish, Assyrian, and
 Turcoman communities. These political groups continued to attract support notwith-
 standing their illegal status.
 In northern Iraq, all central government functions have been performed by local
 administrators--mainly Kurds-since the Government withdrew its forces from the
 area after the 1991 uprising. In May 1992, political parties in the north participated
 in elections to choose representatives to a regional parliament. The elections also
 produced de facto local government administrators, who manage the affairs of the
 security zone-which is protected by allied military forces-and adjacent areas.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit the establishment of independent human rights
 organizations. It operates an official human rights group which routinely denies al-
 legations of abuses. Citizens have established several human rights groups abroad
 and in northern areas not under government control.
 As in 1993, the Government did not allow the Special Rapporteur to visit Iraq.
 It failed to respond to his requests for information on particular human rights cases
 and condemned his recommendation that human rights monitors be stationed
 throughout Iraq. For the third consecutive year, the UNHRC called on the U.N. Sec-
 retary General to send human rights monitors to "help in the independent verifica-
 tion of reports on the human rights situation in Iraq. The U.N. Subcommission on
 Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities adopted a resolution reit-
 erating the UNHRC request for the deployment of monitors. In December the U.N.
 General Assembly once again endorsed the request of the Human Rights Commis-
 sion for monitors for Iraq.
 The Special Rapporteur dispatched members of his staff-in late December 1993
 to Turkey and in August 1994 to Iran-to interview victims of Iraqi human rights
 abuses. The U.N. Human Rights Centre hired another part-time employee in 1994
 to assist the Special Rapporteur who nevertheless asserted that he needs further
 resources to carry out his mandate.
 Several major human rights organizations, including Middle East Watch and AI,
 released new reports on Iraq during the year. The Amar Appeal, a London-based
 charitable organization which assists Iraqi refugees from the southern marshes, is-
 sued a study detailing the ecological destruction of the marshes and its con-
 sequences for the marsh inhabitants. The US. Government also issued a report on
 that subject.
 The Iraqi Government continued to defy various calls from United Nations bodies
 to allow the Special Rapporteur to visit the marshes and interview refugees. In 1994
 the U.N. Human Rights Commission, the U.N. Subcommission on Prevention of Dis-
 crimination and Protection of Minorities, and the U.N. General Assembly all adopt-
 ed resolutions condemning the Government's human rights violations.
 The Government failed to comply with the provision of UNSCR 688, which insists
 that the Government afford immediate, unrestricted access by humanitarian work-
 ers to all those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq. Throughout 1994, the Gov-
 ernment threatened, harassed, and assaulted employees of the United Nations and
 nongovernmental organizations (see Section 1.g.).
 Throughout 1994 the Government refused to implement UNSCR Resolutions 706
 and 712, which would allow it to sell oil and purchase humanitarian goods, the equi-
 table distribution of which the United Nations would monitor. The Special
 Rapporteur noted in his February report that the Government failed to provide for
 the basic humanitarian needs of its civilian population and that it is obligated to
 do so as a signatory to the United Nations Charter. The Special Rapporteur re-
 
 
 1094
 ported that in September the Government cut food subsidies by one-third. He once
 again called on the Government to implement UNSC Resolutions 706 and 712.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4ion, Disabilty, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Government claims that it is committed to equality for women, who
 make up about 20 percent of the work force. It has enacted laws to protect women
 from exploitation in the workplace and from sexual harassment; to permit women
 to join the regular army, Popular Army, and police forces; to require education for
 female children; and to equalize women a rights in divorce, land ownership, taxation,
 suffrage and election to the National Assembly. It is difficult to determine to what
 extent these protections are afforded in practice. Reports indicate, however, that the
 application of these laws has declined as Iraq's political and economic crisis persists.
 Familial violence against women, such as wife beating and rape, is known to
 occur, but little is known about its extent. Such abuse is customrarily addressed
 within the tightly knit family structure. There is no public discussion of the subject,
 and the Government issues no statistics. Spousal violence constitutes groundi for
 divorce and criminal charges, but suits brought on these charges are believed to be
 rare.
 The Special Rapporteur has commented on the high incidence of rape committed
 by the armed forces and security services (see Section 1.b.). He noted that an unusu-
 ally high percentage of the northern population is female, due to the disappearances
 of tens of thousands of Kurdish men in the Anfal Campaign. The Special Rapporteur
 has reported that the widows, daughters, and mothers of Anfal victims are economi-
 cally dependent on their relatives or villages because they may not inherit the prop-
 erty or assets of their missing family members. Other reports suggest that economic
 destitution has forced many women into prostitution.
 Evidence concerning the Anfal Campaign of 1988 indicates that the Government
 killed many women and children, including infants, by firing squads and in chemi-
 cal attacks.
 Children.-No information is available on whether the Government has enacted
 specific legislation to promote the welfare of children. However, the Special
 Rapporteur and several human rights groups have collected a substantial body of
 evidence pointing to the Government's continuing disregard for the rights and wel-
 fare of children.
 The Government failure to comply with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions
 has led to a continuation of economic sanctions. As a result, general economic and
 health conditions throughout Iraq have deteriorated dramatically. Children have
 been particularly susceptible to the decline in the standard of living. Increases in
 child mortality and disease rates have been reported.
 The SpecialRapporteur has observed that, under these circumstances, the Gov-
 ernment has special obligations to ensure that the most vulnerable groups in the
 population have adeqate food and health care. The Special Rapporteur stated in
 his February report that Iraq's refusal to implement U.N. Security Council Resolu-
 tions 706 and 712, which would permit a one-time sale of oil in order to finance the
 import of humanitarian goods, has had an adverse effect on vulnerable populations,
 including children.
 In October the Special Rapporteur reported that "the obvious imbalance between
 military expenditure and resources allocated to the fields of health care and edu-
 cation cleary illustrates the priorities of the Government." The Special Rapporteur
 has repeatedly observed that the ongoing bombardment of civilian settlements in
 the southern marshes has resulted in the deaths of many innocent persons, includ-
 1 nwoamen, children, and the elderly.
 tional/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The cultural, religious, and linguistic diver-
 sity of society is not reflected in the country's political and economic structure.
 Sunni Arabs, a small minority of the population, have effectively controlled Iraq
 since independence in 1932. Shi'a Arabs, the overwhelming majority of the popu-
 lation, have long been economically, politically, and socially disadvantaged. Like the
 Sunni Kurds of the north, the Shi'a Arabs o the south have been targeted for par-
 ticular discrimination and abuse, ostensibly because of their opposition to the Gov-
 ernment.
 The security forces in 1994 reportedly were still encamped in the shrine to Iniam
 Ali at Al-Najaf, one of Shi'a Islam's holiest sites, using it as an interrogation center.
 The former Shi'a theological school in Al-Najaf, which the Government closed follow-
 ing the 1991 uprising, was used as a public market in 1994. Security forces contin-
 ued to expel foreign Muslim clerics from Al-Najaf, under the pretext that the clerics'
 visas had expired. Other aspects of government repression of the Shi'a are discussed
 in Section 2.c. and various parts of Section 1.
 
 
 1095
 The Kurds, who make up approximately 20 percent of the population, historically
 have suffered political and economic discrimination, despite the token presence of
 a small number in the national Government (see Sections l.a., 1.b., and l.g.).
 Assyrians are an ethnic as well as religious group (see Section 2.c.), and speak
 a distinct language-Syriac. Public instruction in Syriac, which was to have ben
 allowed under a 1972 decree, has never been implemented. In 1994 the Special
 Rapporteur stated that in late 1993 the Government dismissed or expelled hundreds
 of Asyrian teachers and students from universities and public positions.
 Citizens considered to be of Iranian origin must carry special identification and
 are often precluded from desirable employment. Over the years, the Government
 has deported hundreds of thousands of citizens of Iranian origin (see Section 2.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-No information is available on the Government's efforts
 to assist people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although Iraq is a party to the 1919 Constitution
 of the International Labor Organization (ILO), which guarantees the freedom of as-
 sociation, trade unions independent of government control do not exist in Iraq. The
 Trade Union Organization Law of June 2, 1987, prescribes a monolithic trade union
 structure for organized labor.
 Workers in private and mixed enterprises and cooperatives-but not public em-
 ployees or workers in state enterprises-have the right to join local union commit-
 tees. The committees are affiliated with individual trade unions, which in turn be-
 long to the Iraqi General Federation of Trade Unions. The General Federation is
 linked to the Ba'ath Party, which uses it to promote party principles and policies
 among union members. The General Federation also is affiliated with the Inter-
 national Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the formerly Soviet-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions.
 The Labor Law of 1987 restricts the right to strike. No strike has been reported
 over the past two decades.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively is not recognized. Salaries for public sector workers (the majority of the em-
 ployed) are set by the Government. Wages in the much smaller private sector are
 set by empoyers or negotiated individually with workers.
 Te Lir Code does not protect workers from antiunion discrimination, a failure
 that has been criticized repeatedly by the ILO's Committee of Experts. There are
 no export processingzones m Iraq.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is theoretically
 prohibited by law. However, the Penal Code stipulates prison sentences, including
 compulsory labor, for civil servants and employees of state enterprises accused of
 breaches of labor "discipline," including resigning from the job. According to the
 ILO, foreign workers in Iraq have been prevented from terminating their employ-
 ment to return to their native countries because of government-imposed penal sanc-
 tions on persons who do so.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under age
 14 is prohibited except in small-scale family enterprises. Many children are encour-
 aged to work to support their families. The law stipulates that employees between
 the ages of 14 and 18 work fewer hours per week than adults.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Theoretically, most workers in urban areas
 work a 6-day, 48-hour workweek. Hours for government employees are set by the
 head of each ministry. In practice, the rate of absenteeism was abnormally high in
 1994, as socioeconomic conditions deteriorated.
 Working hours for agricultural workers vary according to individual employer-em-
 ployee agreements.
 Occupational safety programs are in effect in state-run enterprises. Inspectors
 theoretically inspect private establishments, but enforcement varies widely.
