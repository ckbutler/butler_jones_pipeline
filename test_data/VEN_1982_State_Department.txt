 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela has enjoyed 24 years of democratic government
 and it continues to be a free, multi-racial, and
 pluralistic society. Its democratic institutions remain
 strong despite the economic difficulties of the last
 several years and the problems of enormous social change,
 a massive rural-urban population shift, inflows of illegal
 immigration, and a rising curve of expectations among its
 citizens.
 Some of the principal observations in this report are:
 The voluntary handing over of executive power to an
 elected opposition has been firmly established in
 Venezuela.
 Democratic processes have been institutionalized and
 accepted by all significant elements of the society.
 Venezuela has an energetic, free, and open press and
 media system which operates for the most part without
 government interference.
 The Venezuelan Government maintains both in theory and
 in practice its commitment to human rights, religious
 freedom, and freedom of expression.
 The military respects the President's constitutional
 role as commander in chief and is responsive to the
 freely-elected civilian government. The military seldom
 involves itself in politics.
 The Government of Venezuela is active in promoting and
 supporting democratic governments throughout Central and
 South America.
 The reform of the Civil Code passed by the Venezuelan
 Congress in July 1982 significantly extended women's legal
 rights.
 Venezuelans enjoy a high degree of individual liberty.
 Their civil, personal, and political rights are protected
 by a judiciary which enforces habeas corpus, a free press
 with a history of attention to instances of executive
 mismanagement or human rights abuses, and a political
 system which features constant competition for public
 attention on social issues.
 Successive democratic Governments have pursued policies to
 attract marginal radical political groups into the
 established political process with such success that the
 president of Venezuela's third largest party is a former
 guerrilla who accepted the proffered opportunity to
 renounce violence for legitimate politics. President
 Herrera's amnesty program was the culmination of this
 process. Most of the small armed opposition has accepted
 its benefits and have returned peacefully to the
 mainstream of Venezuelan society.
 Venezuela is South America's largest petroleum producer,
 and has the highest per capita gross domestic product
 (GDP) of any country on the continent, approximately
 $4,781 in 1982. The nationalized oil industry, although
 administered as an independent entity, funnels over one
 half of its gross income to the central Government.
 Despite relatively high employment, income distribution is
 
 
 653
 uneven. Government social programs are designed to reduce
 this inequity and are directed at infrastructure building,
 health care, education, and housing. Nevertheless, these
 programs have been severely hampered by administrative
 problems, including some corruption,. and by massive
 immigration of rural populations to urban areas during the
 past decade. Expenditures in these and most other areas
 are now being cut back somewhat because of budget
 shortfalls caused by falling petroleum revenues.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.  Killing
 The Venezuelan Government does not permit or engage in
 killing for political purposes, although a number of
 deaths have occurred in the conduct of regular police
 operations and in the continuation of the Government's
 anti-guerrilla program. A small group of terrorists is
 still sporadically active in northeastern Venezuela.
 Their activities have included attacks on police and
 security outposts, robberies, and murder of persons who
 they claim are government informants. The Government
 stepped up its anti-guerrilla campaign in 1982 with
 considerable success. About three dozen lives have been
 lost in this process. Some leaders of small leftist
 political parties have expressed concern over possible
 excesses in these anti-guerrilla operations.
 b.   Disappearance
 There have been no charges of disappearances, government
 abductions, secret arrests, or clandestine detention
 during the past year. Enforcement of official
 accountability is effective in the civilian courts, but,
 according to Venezuelan law, it is limited in cases
 subject to military jurisdiction (i.e., crimes against the
 security of the state) which are dealt with by military
 courts.
 c.   Torture
 The 1961 Constitution states that "no one may be held
 incommunicado nor subjected to torture or to other pro-
 ceedings which cause physical or moral suffering. Any
 physical or moral attack inflicted on a person subject to
 restriction of his liberty is punishable." Constitutional
 guarantees of the integrity of the person are enforced.
 There is no approved practice of torture, although there
 have been a few credible reports of prisoners being beaten
 by prison guards.
 d.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Venezuelan laws prohibiting cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment are generally respected Some infractions no
 doubt occur, however, because of inefficiency or excesses
 on the part of local law enforcement officials. Prison
 conditions are spartan, and sometimes violence occurs. In
 Tocuyito prison, conditions were so bad that 15 prisoners
 were killed and 20 wounded by other inmates in a
 one-and-a-half month period in 1982. A subsequent
 investigation found the main problem to be lack of
 supervision, although crowding and poor food contributed
 to the circumstances leading to the violence. Such cases,
 
 
 654
 when brought to the public eye, are rectified. Women
 offenders with small children are rarely imprisoned
 because of a consideration of 'family responsibilities.*
 e.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Since the implementation of the Herrera Government's
 amnesty program in 1979, there have been no claims
 substantiated that any prisoners or detainees have been
 held in serious disregard of their rights under the
 Venezuelan Constitution. The Government maintains that
 those detained or imprisoned have been either convicted or
 formally charged with specified criminal acts. Despite
 claims to the contrary by families and supporters of some
 incarcerated persons, no pattern of arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment appears to exist. Habeas corpus is an
 established practice, and arrested persons cannot be held
 legally for more than eight days without formal charges
 being lodged against them. Occasional local violations of
 this legal limit may occur, but without formal government
 approval. Family members and legal counsel have regular
 access to inmates. Although habeas corpus is not an
 issue, there is one case involving four individuals
 charged with the bombing of a Cuban airliner in 1976 that
 has not been resolved. The four defendants remain in
 prison.
 f.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Venezuelan law and practice provide for fair trials and
 the presumption of innocence until proven guilty beyond a
 reasonable doubt. The criminal court system can be
 described a4 lenient. Rules of evidence are strict and
 convictions are not easy to obtain. A law passed in April
 of 1980 provides for supervised parole, rather than
 imprisonment, of persons either convicted of crimes or
 detained pending trial for crimes whose prescribed
 penalties are five years imprisonment or less. The
 intent--still to be fully realized--is to reduce the
 prison population and eventually to offer probation as an
 alternative to those facing detention for less serious
 crimes.
 There are no political courts in Venezuela. Except in the
 case of civilians tried by military courts for subversive
 or terrorist acts, the civilian judiciary exercises
 complete jurisdiction independent of any other authority.
 Charges in both civilian and military courts must be for
 specific criminal offenses, and the rules of evidence are
 strict. Military justice provides for full access to the
 court by the accused and his lawyers, but third party
 access to the proceedings is left to the judge's
 discretion. Appeals of convictions can be made to the
 Supreme Court. The amnesty granted by the Herrera
 Government early in its mandate greatly reduced the
 numbers of civilians held under the military justice
 system.
 g.   Invasion of the Home
 The Venezuelan Constitution provides that *the home is
 inviolable.'   Court warrants are required for an official
 to enter a private residence. Legal safeguards against
 arbitrary invasion of the home are respected in practice.

 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 Radio, television, and the press in Venezuela are free and
 often highly critical of the Government. Although the
 Government accepts criticism, there are tensions between
 the Government and the media, and occasional
 confrontations do occur. In such cases, the media's
 reaction is inevitably immediate and sharp. In one case
 in late 1981 involving a journalist charged with revealing
 sensitive information about a military training exercise,
 the Supreme Court found in the defendant's favor and
 returned the case to civilian jurisdiction from its
 original venue in military courts. The charges were
 subsequently dropped.
 Censorship and interference in cultural and academic
 fields on political grounds rarely occur, although the
 Government reserves the authority and exercises the
 obligation to protect public morality. Major parties and
 political figures are often the butt of satirical stage,
 television, and press treatment without any evidence of
 government interference. One film, however, was
 suppressed in 1982. The film dealt with the murder of
 three youths in which a police officer was implicated.
 The producer of the film was arrested on charges dealing
 with national security and the film confiscated. While
 the producer has since been released, the film has not.
 Counter-charges of censorship brought by the press are
 still in the courts pending adjudication.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Labor is the *object of special protection' under the
 Constitution and Venezuelan labor unions are free,
 independent, and powerful. Strikes are frequent,
 tolerated, and peaceful. Professional and academic
 associations flourish without interference. Freedom of
 assembly is respected (with some limitations on the
 grounds of public safety) and public meetings of
 opposition groups are frequent.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. While the population is
 overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, other groups are allowed to
 proselytize actively. Adherence to minority religious
 groups carries no social or political disadvantage.
 Members of various Protestant evangelical groups active in
 remote areas of Venezuela have, however, been subjected at
 times to personal harassment by local authorities. This
 harassment does not have the sanction of the national
 Government, which fully supports religious freedom. A
 federal commission has been formed to investigate the
 charges and counter-charges which have been brought
 concerning these missions.
 d.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement, either
 within Venezuela or abroad, with the exception that a
 special permit is required to travel to the Amazon region
 of the country for 'security reasons' that are not clearly
 defined. Venezuelans may emigrate without restriction,
 but few do so. There is also freedom to repatriate
 
 
 656
 without prejudice. Citizenship can be renounced, but not
 revoked. Recovery of nationality requires a residence
 period of two years for Venezuelan-born repatriates.
 Immigrants, both legal and illegal, are assimilated easily
 into society. Venezuela's immigration policies have been
 liberal, but a trend toward tightening them continues. No
 reliable statistics are available regarding the number of
 aliens in the country, although it has been estimated that
 up to 300,000 illegal immigrants -- the majority said to
 be Colombians -- are living in Venezuela. In an effort to
 solve the undocumented alien problem, the Government has
 offered residence documents without prejudice to employed
 illegal aliens'registering with the authorities.
 Venezuela has traditionally been a haven for political and
 other refugees from the Western Hemisphere, as well as
 from Europe, but no statistics are available as most are
 processed under normal immigration procedures. In recent
 years Venezuela has not encouraged the entry of refugees,'
 but seldom are any expelled once they gain entry. A
 special 'family reunification program' exists for the
 close relatives of the 50,000 or more Cuban refugees
 living in Venezuela.
 e.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Venezuela is a multi-party democracy with full citizen
 participation. Elections for president, a bicameral
 congress, and municipal councils are held every five
 years, with voter turnout approximating 90 percent. Two
 major centrist parties, Social Christian (COPEI) and
 Social Democratic (Accion Democratica), have elected
 presidents and held a majority or plurality of the seats
 in the Congress during Venezuela's 24 years of
 uninterrupted democracy and between them account for about
 90 percent of the vote. There is a proliferation of minor
 parties, some of which were outgrowths of former guerrilla
 organizations. They hold approximately 15 percent of the
 seats in the national.legislature. Both major parties
 ..encourage and support the existence of minor parties. The
 electoral process is overseen by an independent Supreme
 Electoral Council, to which representatives of all the
 major and most of the minor political groupings belong.
 National party status is awarded by this body according to
 a series of laws which are strictly and impartially
 enforced. Regional status is frequently granted to those
 groupings which are too small to meet standards for
 qualification as a nationwide party.
 The Venezuelan Constitution prohibits discrimination on
 the basis of sex, and women are accorded equal political
 rights, as well as *special protection' in the workplace.
 The rapid pace of modernization and social change has
 contributed to a continuing re-examination of the role and
 rights of women. There are five women in the Venezuelan
 cabinet, and educated women are increasingly prominent in
 the professions, in the judiciary, and in public
 administration. Women are also increasingly active in all
 political parties. On July 26, 1982, a reform of the
 Venezuelan civil code was passed that extended women's
 rights. Among the changes are: requirement of spousal
 consent for administration and sale of community property,
 shared parental authority over minor children, and a new
 provision permitting separate legal residence. Women are
 still underrepresented in political and economic life,
 although their presence at managerial levels is increasing
 slowly. The female blue collar labor force is also
 growing, but largely at the lower-paying level. A strong
 
 
 657
 cultural bias remains against employment of women in
 "men's jobs.* Even though wage and employment differences
 do exist, there is a trend toward greater equality of
 opportunity in the workplace.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Venezuelan Government has traditionally supported the
 creation of a United Nations mechanism for the monitoring
 of human rights violations as well as the work of the UN
 and Inter-American Human Rights Commissions. (In 1981
 Venezuela ratified the Pact of San Jose accepting the
 jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human
 Rights.) Domestically, the Fiscal General (Attorney
 General) is charged with this function in cases under
 civil court jurisdiction. An Amnesty International office
 operates freely in Caracas, as does the Latin American
 Foundation for Human Rights and Social Development. The
 local press is a major monitor of alleged human rights
 violations in Venezuela, and it does not hesitate to
 accord such allegations headline treatment. Venezuelan
 authorities are sensitive and responsive to approaches by
 recognized human rights organizations. Venezuela is also
 a frequent and vocal critic of governments in Latin
 America and elsewhere that commit or tolerate wide-spread
 human rights violations.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Venezuela has a population of 15,248,000, which is growing
 at an annual rate of 3.3 percent. Life expectancy at
 birth is 67.4 years and the infant mortality rate is 45
 per 1,000 live births. About 83 percent of the population
 is urbanized. Despite the country's tremendous resources
 and potential, and despite the Government's well defined
 development plans, there has been no growth in the economy
 and a decrease in real per capita income over the last
 four rears. Capital outflow due to private sector lack of
 confidence continued in 1982. Investment was also down
 because of high interest rates and poor economic prospects
 in general. A restrictive monetary policy during the last
 year has been instrumental in holding inflation down to
 approximately 11 percent, but it has also depressed
 business activity. There are no restrictions to property
 rights based on sex, race, nationality, and religion or
 social status. There are some limitations, however, on
 foreign participation in business enterprises in Venezuela.
 The Government is making an effort to assist those on the
 lower end of the economic scale. In 1981 the Government
 established a system of low-interest loans to assist in
 the purchase of lower priced housing. The Sixth National
 Plan (1981-1985) was specifically aimed at improving the
 overall quality of life of less advantaged Venezuelans by
 improving education (82 percent of the adult population is
 literate), housing, and public health services, but some
 cutbacks in these social programs are now underway because
 of falling international oil prices and the consequent
 shortfall in expected government revenues. It has also
 been charged that corruption in both the public and
 private sectors is a serious impediment to efficient use
 of limited resources. Little reliable information is
 available on this allegation, however, although legal
 action is sometimes taken and convictions obtained. The
 Venezuelan Government's currently defined poverty level is
 $465 per household per month. A 1979 study revealed that
 
 
 658
 some,81 percent of rural households and 38 percent of
 urban.households in Venezuela fell below this poverty
 level. The ratio of calorie supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements is 99
 percent, and 75 percent of the population has access to
 potable water.
