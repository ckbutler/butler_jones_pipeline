 ALGERIA
 The 1989 Constitution was to have provided for Algeria's transition from a one-
 party Socialist state to a multiparty parliamentary system. However, political power
 remains in the hands of the military leadership and officials of the former ruling
 party. The experiment in democratization came to a halt in 1992 when the regime
 canceled the second round of legislative elections, which the Islamic Salvation Front
 (FIS), a party which seeks to transform Algeria into an Islamic state, was poised
 to win. Subsequently, the regime imposed a state of emergency banned the IS as
 a legal organization, jailed most of its leaders, and created a Ave-man High State
 Committee to serve as Algeria's collective presidency.
 In January 1994 the regime replaced the High State Committee with a former
 general hLamine Zeroual, who assumed the presidency of a "transitional* govern-
 ment. President Zeroua, asserting that the country's crisis should be resolved
 through dialog, made some attempts to consult with legal political parties and
 opened informal contacts with imprisoned FIS leaders. However, the FIS and other
 major parties dismissed his overtures as disingenuous and demanded that the Gov-
 ernment undertake certain actions, such as releasing FIS leaders, lifting the state
 of emergency, and giving the political parties a role in the transitional period lead-
 ngto new elections. In a speech on Novemer 1, Zeroul declared that dialog had
 failed and announced his intention to hold presidential elections in 1995. Also in No-
 vember, the major opposition parties met in Rome to develop a common platform
 for renewed negotiations with the Government, which strongly protested that meet-
 irmed Islamist groups steadily intensified their campaign to overthrow the Gov-
 ernment. Guerrllas mounted daily attacks on security personnel and established
 strongholds in certain Algiers neighborhoods and other parts of the country. Mili-
 tent Islamist groups with more rIical agendas than the FIS have steadyecome
 more active in the insurgency. A climate of fear and intimidation deepened as ex-
 tremists assassinated dozens of political figures, journalists, academics, and thou-
 sands of other civilians, as well as over 78 foreigners. Reprisals by the regime's
 forces have grown bloodier. The Government estimated that 10,000 people had been
 killed by the end of 1993. The figure for 1994 has not been officially released but
 most sources estimate that it will b twice as high.
 The State's security apparatus includes the police, the gendarmerie, and the
 army, all of which are involved in efforts to repress the Isl-amist insurgency and
 combat terrorism. They were responsile for numerous human rights abuses.
 Civil strife has devastated the economy, aggravating the longstanding problems
 of unemployment, inflation, housing shortages, scarcity of foreign exchange, and the
 legacy of years of inefficient state planning. Economic pressures and an mability to
 make service payments on its foreign debt prompted the Government in April to
 sign an agreement with the International Monetary Fund and to begin implement-
 ing market reforms. Nonetheless, conditions for ordinary Algerians only worsened
 in 1994.
 Respect for human rights and the rule of law continued to deteriorate in an in-
 creasingly tense environment. Abuses by all sides multiplied. Using emergency law
 powers,the Government continued to detain, in many cases without due process
 hudesof people suspected of Islamist activities or sympathies. Special
 antiterrrist ourts, createdl under the state of emergency, handed down death sen-
 tences in trials which were unfair according to international standards. There is
 convincing evidene that the security forces carried out hundreds of extrajudicial
 killings, mostly in retaliation for previous attacks by armed groups, and often tor-
 tured and otherwise abused detainees. The Government continued to restrict the
 freedoms of assembly, religion, and the press and to discriminate against women.
 Domestic violence against women remains a serious problem.

 Armed groups, many of which claim to have Islamist objectives, also committed
 escalating abuses and atrocities. Terrorists, often disguised in uniforms of the secu-
 rity forces, killed hundreds of civilians. Some armed groups carried out a campaign
 of violent intimidation aimed at closing down schools and other public institutions.
 As law and order broke down, anti-Islamist vigilante groups engaged in reprisal
 killings of Islamists and their sympathizers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There is credible evidence that secu-
 rity forces committed politically motivated extrjucial killings. Despite President
 Zeroual's assurances to the contrary, there was no evidence that the authorities in-
 vestigated such killings. The National Observatory for Human Rights (ONDH), a
 government body, maintained that it provided the Ministry of Justice with informa-
 tion on 12 cases of suspected extrajudicial killings. In September a group of
 Islamists sent an open letter to President Zerual citing 36 cases of summary execu-
 tions in 1994.
 The Government maintains that the security forces resort to lethal force only in
 the context of armed clashes with terrorists. Nonetheless, security forces are be-
 lieved to have carried out hundreds of extrajudicial killings, mostly in retaliation
 for previous attacks by armed groups. Many victims were reportedly killed by secu-
 rity forces wearing civilian clothes or covering their heads with hoods. The security
 forces reportedly killed victims during curfew hours, at or near the victims' homes,
 or in the presence of the victims' family and friends. The bodies of some victims
 were reportedly discovered clothed in pajamas, indicating that they had been killed
 after they were taken from their homes. Security forces allegedly killed other per-
 sons after they were taken into police custody.
 Security forces were implicated in the deaths of nine students and their teacher
 from the El Oued area-Dahab Omar, Derouiche Abdel Bassat, Rahal Abderrazak,
 Mahadda Salah, Aouniet Abdelkader, Djerad Abdelkader, Arhouma Saad, Maatallah
 Abdelbaki, Nazh Abdelkamel, and Kouider Messaoud, who were arrested on March
 12. The police maintained that the men were arrested to verify their military service
 status. On April 13, the police informed a relative of one detainee that the 10 men
 had been released on April 8, but that they were immediately killed by unknown
 "terrorists" after release. The Government has not provided an adequate expla-
 nation of the deaths.
 On March 19, the body of Kouider Melal was found in the street near his home
 in El Ataf Ouedfoda, alongside the bodies of three men from the same district.
 Melal had been previously seen in police custody 2 weeks before his death.
 In addition to reports of extrajudicial killings outside detention facilities, Islamists
 and human rights activists accused the security forces of causing the unlawful
 deaths of many detainees who succumbed to torture while in custody.
 Armed groups, most notably the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), killed hundreds of
 persons, including members of the security forces and ordinary citizens. Terrorists
 attacked civilians whom they regarded as instruments of the State or whose life-
 styles they considered in conflict with Islamic values.
 Victims included politicians, teachers, tax collectors, hairdressers and beauticians,
 entertainers, veterans of the war of independence, government-appointed Islamic
 preachers, lawyers and magistrates who work with the Special Courts, women who
 refused to veil themselves, industrialists, journalists and intellectuals, and foreign-
 ers. Many victims had their throats cut or their bodies were mutilated after death.
 Often the victims' severed heads would be discovered in one location and the bodies
 in another. According to a February press account, suspected terrorists kidnapped
 and killed a 14-year-old boy from Medea, purportedly because he had befriended
 several police officers. His body was found hanging from a street sign. His head was
 found in a nearby town.
 Armed groups killed at least 18 Algerian journalists and 10 lawyers. On Novem-
 ber 30, gunmen forced two reporters from their homes and shot and decapitated
 them. One of the victims worked for the state television company, the other for a
 state-owned newspaper. Throughout the year the GIA issued death threats to jour-
 nalists, foreigners, and others. Many journalists fled abroad because of threats to
 their lives. In October independent newspapers suspended publication for 3 days to
 protest the killings of journalists.
 Armed groups killed the national secretary for the country's major labor union,
 the Union Generale des Travailleurs Algeriens (UGTA); the president and vice
 president of Islah Wa El-Irchad, the largest private charitable organization; the rec-
 tor of the Houari Boumediene University of Science and Technology; the president
 
 
 1049
 of the Algerian League for Human Rights; the chairman of the Agronomy Institute
 at the University of Blida; a professor of economics at the University of Oran; the
 director of the School of Fine Arts in Algeria; a famous playwriht/actor, the director
 of the National Institute of Islamic Studies in Batna; a popular singer, a leading
 sports personality;, and the husband of the Government's former spokeswoman.
 In October 1993, the GIA announced that foreWi  residents should depart Algeria
 or face death. Since then, terrorist groups have killed at least 90 foreigners, includ-
 ing more than 78 in 1994. Foreign victims included members of the clergy, business
 people, diplomats, and longtime residents of Algeria. Victims were citizens of a num-
 r of European and other foreign countries, although French citizens were the pri-
 mazy tar~ts
 In addition to targeted killings, terrorist groups also resorted to indiscriminate vi-
 olence. In June two grenades were thrown at demonstrators at an Algiers march
 organized by the Movement for Berber Culture, an anti-Islamist group. The gre-
 nades and the return fire from the police wounded 64 persons; 2 died later. Armed
 Islamist groups used car bombs on numerous occasions, killing many passersby. In
 July, five French Embassy personnel were killed by terrorists attempting to place
 a car bomb inside an Embassy residential compound.
 Armed anti-Islamist groups, such as the Organization of Young Free Algerians
 (OJAL)-widely suspected as a front for elements of the regime's security forces-
 carried out reprisals against terrorist groups. Such groups are reportedly active in
 the Berber region of Kabyie. In Marc anti- samists likely killed two veiled high
 school students at a bus stop in an Algiers suburb. The killings may have been m
 reprisal for the killing a month earlier of a 17-year-old high school girl who declined
 to wear a head scarf. In April the OJAL issued a threat to kill 20 women wearing
 a head scarf or 20 bearded men for every woman killed by Islamic terrorists for not
 wearing a head scarf.
 There were many reports of reprisals by vigilante grups for the deaths of mili-
 tary personnel. Vigilantes may have killed 9 persons whose bodies were found on
 a street near an Algiers bread shop on April 12. The killings may have been com-
 mitted in revenge for the murder a day earlier of an army colonel near the same
 bread shop. In September an anti-Islamist group killed as many as 90 people in
 Annaba, apparently in retaliation for the earlier terrorist murder of a gendarmerie
 captain and his daughter. The Government has failed to condemn the violence by
 anti-Isiamist groups.
 b. Disajpearance.--The ONDH claimed it had documented 116 cases of disappear-
 anes believed to have been caused by security force personnel. Each of these cases
 was submitted to the Ministry of Justice or the Ministry of Interior. In some cases,
 the Government responded to the ONDH queries but did not respond in others.
 Armed Islamic groups also kidnaped civilians. Sometimes the bodies were found
 later, but often the victims disappeared and their families have no information on
 their whereabouts.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Knowledgeable sources, including Amnesty International (AI) and all three major
 Algerian human right orgnz"ations--ONDH, LADH, and LADDH-reported that
 the security forces frequently used torture on detainees, especially suspected
 Islamists, to extract confessions or to obtain knowledge about the activities of terror-
 ist groups_. The Government denies that trture is a matter of policy or accepted
 practice, but it states that "excesses" may be committed by individual security offi-
 cials. The Government has failed to condemn publicly the use of trture or to ives-
 tigate allegations seriously. This creates a climate of impunity which encourages the
 continued use of torture.
 The ONDH maintains that some alleged torture victims decline to press charges
 for fear of reprisal by the security forces. ONDH claimed that it submitted several
 torture cases to the Ministry of Justice but did not receive any indication that the
 allegations were investigated. In a statement published in the London newspaper
 -Hayat on September 28, the FIS cited three alleged cases of torture by policy.
 It reported a claim by Professor M. Moulay, who had ieaded a FIS delegation which
 negotiated with the army early in the crisis, of having been tortured in the Chatu
 Neuf police center durin  a  0-day detention. It stated that the Algiers police tor-
 tured Dr. Lamdjadani, a Heath Miisr official during a 60-day detention. Lastly,
 it cited the death in custody of Professor Bouchiagum, whose family had been in-
 formed that he was transferred to the Chatu Neuf station but then discovered that
 his body was in a morgue in Algiers.
 A commonly reported trtre method is the use of the "chiffon," a cloth stuffed
 into the victims mouth and stat ed with dirty water. Other torture techniques re-
 portedly include electric shocks, beatin, , the pullin  out fingernails, burning with
 cigarettes or a blowtorch, and the inserton of objects into the anus.
 
 
 1050
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prisons or detention
 centers by such humanitarian organizations as the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC), although it did allow representatives of AI to visit the country
 in 1994.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. It stipulates that incommunicado detention in criminal cases
 prior to arraignment may not exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect must be
 charged or released. However, under the state of emergency, the security forces
 have arrested and detained thousands of persons. According to the Antiterrorist De-
 cree of 1992, the police may not hold a detainee in prearraignment detention for
 more than 12 days and detainees must be informed of charges against them. In
 practice, the security forces routinely exceed the lawful detention limit.
 When making arrests, the security forces do not obtain warrants and allegedly
 often refuse to identify themselves or to provide detainees' relatives and lawyers
 with information about their whereabouts or well-being.
 In September security forces arrested Farid Khellil, the son of a defense lawyer,
 for subversive activities. The Bar Association accused the Government of holding the
 son as a hostage to intimidate his father. The police granted a provisional release
 to Khelil after 6 weeks without charging him with any specific wrongdoing.
 Under the state of emergency, the Minister of Interior is authorized to detain sus-
 pects in special camps admtered by the army. The Government stated that it
 intends to close these camps. By year's end, some 350 to 600 detainees were held
 without charge at a camp in An M'guel.
 Exile is not a legal form of punishment and is not known to be practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is composed of the civil courts
 which try misdemeanors and felonies; the military courts, which in the past had
 tried civilians for terrorism offenses; and three Special Courts established in 1992
 to try terrorism cases. The President appoints civilian judges on recommendations
 from the Higher Magistrate's Council, composed of the President, the Minister of
 Justice, and various members of the judiciary.
 Defendants are granted due process in the civilian courts. They have the right to
 legal counsel, are entitled to be advised of the charges against them, have the right
 to confront their accusers, may appeal the verdict, and trials are public. Islamic
 Shari'a law provides much of the basis for civil court rulings in social matters in-
 volving family and personal status. The law requires that the Government provide
 lawyers for the indigent.
 Under the state of emergency, military courts are authorized to try civilian de-
 fendants accused of terrorism. Although there were no known military trials of civil-
 ians during the year, such trials took place in 1993.
 The 1992 Antiterrorist Decree established three Special Courts, each composed of
 three civilian judges, to try persons accused of terrorist offenses. Since February
 1993, these courts have tried more than 10,000 persons, of whom 1,100 were sen-
 tenced to death, 6,500 imprisoned, and 26500 a   itted. Executions were suspended
 in 1993, although 26 persons condemned i;y the Special Courts were executed before
 the suspension order.
 Defendants in the Special Courts do not receive due process. The charge of terror-
 ism is defined so vaguely that it often includes the non-violent exercise of speech.
 The judges do not reveal their identities nor exercise independence from executive
 authority. They often restrict the number of observers at the trials and fail to order
 investigations of torture, even after defendants have appeared in court with marks
 and bruises. Judges allow the introduction of confessions allegedly extracted by tor-
 ture and may suspend defense lawyers who use "obstructive methods" for 1 year.
 Defense lawyers must receive authorization to represent their clients in the Special
 Courts. State prosecutors have arbitrarily transferred to the Special Courts cases
 already assigned to the regular courts. Although defendants may appeal verdicts
 handed down by the Special Courts, the Supreme Courthas rejected most appeals
 without consideration and has not overturned any death sentence.
 The Government announced in December that, as part of its review of the Penal
 Code, it was considering closing the Special Courts and transferring jurisdiction for
 cases involving acts of terrorism to the regular court system.
 Between 350 and 600 detainees at the An M'guel detention camp may be consid-
 ered political prisoners. Most were arrested in 1992 for alleged "subversive" activi-
 ties.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, the state of emer-
 gency authorizes regional governors to issue exceptional search warrants at any
 time. Security forces often enter residences illegally. The Government fails to ensure
 that the police adhere to lawful procedures for entering houses or monitoring cor-
 
 
 1051
 respondence. In addition, there were increasingly frequent incidents of entry into
 private homes by armed opposition elements, either to kidnap residents or to steal
 weapons or valuables.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The state of emergency and the Antiterrorist
 Decree of December 1992 gave the regime broad authority to restrict this freedom
 and to take legal action against anyone whose speech is considered a threat to the
 State or public order. Fear of arrest deters many journalists from reporting on inter-
 nal security developments or the Islamist movement. In June an intermimsterial di-
 rective required newspapers to submit for review all news reports on the internal
 security situation. The editor of El Moudjahid El Ousboui, an Arabic-language week-
 ly, was arrested and detained for 1 week in October for publishing an article
 "Breaching National Security."
 Shortly after the Minister of Communications warned editors in November to re-
 spect "professional ethics," the regime suspended several newspapers. Editors were
 not given specific reasons for the closures, beyond vague accusations of undermining
 public order or publishing subversive information. The FIN newspaper El Hiwar
 was suspended for 6 months, the French-language El Oumma and the Arabic week-
 ly El Wadi El Akhar for a month, and El Watan for 2 weeks. The Government sus-
 pendd Le Libre indefinitely and placed the editor and two staff members under ju-
 dicial control. On December 18, the regime shut down L'Opinion for 40 days for pub-
 lishing a draft electoral law.
 The Government further controls the press through its effective monopoly on
 newsprint, printing presses, and the distribution network. Several newspapers
 ceased appearing for financial reasons, which they blamed on the government mo-
 nopoes.
 e Government continues to curtail the public expression of views supportive of
 the FIS. Two FIS publications banned in 1992 remain suspended. However, commu-
 niques and bulletins from various Islamist organizations, such as the GIA or AIS
 (Islamic Salvation Army), circulated clandestinely, and some mosques periodically
 transmitted pro-FIS messages. The Algerian press reported FIS-related news only
 after the Government releases news items (as in a series of letters from FIS leaders
 to the regime); when the news portrayed the authorities gaining the upper hand (as
 in the deaths of GIA leaders); or, in selected cases, when the news had already ap-
 peared in print abroad.
 The press continued to report opinions contrary to those of the Government, in-
 cluding criticism of the Government's political, economic, and social policies. Com-
 mentary on the institution of the military 'was usually self-censored, but at least one
 leading French language newspaper carried several strongly worded editrials with-
 out reprisal.
 Radio and television remained under government control, with coverage biased in
 favor of the government's policies. During attempts at a political dialogue in the fall,
 the legal opposition political parties were invited to present their views on tele-
 vision. Many expressed harsh criticism of the Government. Because of the wide-
 spread accessibility of satellite dish antennas, millions of citizens have access to Eu-
 ropean broadcasts.
 A brutal terrorist campaign against journalists and academics seriously con-
 strained freedom of speech and press. Assailants murdered 18 journalists in 1994.
 In January the GIA issued a specific threat against all journalists and in August
 stated that it had a list of journalists to kill. Newspapers estimated that 200 jour-
 nalists had relocated abroad. Terrorism targeting intellectuals and university edu-
 cators prompted many to flee to neighboring countries. Gunman killed the rector of
 the Houari Boumediene University of Science and'Technology on May 31, the Direc-
 tor of the Institute of Agronomy at the University of Blida on August 6, and a Pro-
 fessor of Economics at the University of Oran on September 26. As a consequence,
 few academic seminars and colloquia took place in 1994.
 Terrorists also targeted primary and secondary schools. The Minister of Education
 stated that 610 schools had been burned between June and October.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Using emergency laws, the
 Government sharply curtails freedom of assembly, although the 1989 Constitution
 provides for the rights of assembly and association. Citizens and organizations must
 obtain a permit from the local governor's office before staging demonstrations. Such
 permits are gnerally granted, after referral to the Ministry of Interior, for dem-
 onstrations against Islaist terrorism or in favor of the Government. The regime
 does not require legal opposition parties to obtain permits to hold internal meetings.
 The regime allowed Berber organizations to hol-d demonstrations as long as they
 took place in the Berber Kabylie region. However, it denied permission for 2 rallies
 
 
 1052
 sponsored by the The Berber Rights Movement (MCB) in the Algiers area. Never-
 theless, the MCB demonstrated repeatedly in Kabylie for the teaching of the Berber
 language i the primary and secondary schools.
 The Ministry of Interior must approve all nongovernmental associations. The Gov-
 ernment regards all associations as illegal unless they are licensed. It may deny a
 iense to or dissolve any group rearded as a threat to the existing political order.
 In 1992 the regme dissolved the.Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) as apolitical party
 as well as Islamic social and charitable groups associated with the F. Membership
 in the FIS is illegal. However, the Government itself has continued to meet periodi-
 cally with detained FIS leaders Abbasi Medani and All Belhadj.
 According to a 1989 law, all citizens may join political organizations, except
 judges, army and security service personnel, and members of the Constitutional
 Council. Most political groups, except the FIS which was banned in March 1992, op-
 erate openly. There were over 5   arties, including some centrist Islamic parties
 such as Hamas, active in 1994.     er associations include specialized groups such
 as human rights and womens' rights groups, social welfare groups, and regionally
 based cultural organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution declares Islam as the state religion but
 prohibits discrimination based on religious belief. The Government permits the
 small Christian and Jewish populations (numbering approximately 1,000 and 200,
 respectively) to practice their faiths without interference.
 However, communiques signed by the Armed Islamic Group declared that the in-
 tention to eliminate "Jews, Christians, and polytheists from Islam's land in Algeria."
 The Christian community, composed mostly of foreigners, curtailed its activities and
 evacuated some church workers because of death threats from terrorists (see Section
 L.a.). Conversions from Islam to Christianity are rare. Because of legal problems
 and social stigma, Muslim converts to Christianity practice their new faith clandes-
 tinely.
 The Ministry of Religious Affairs appoints Islamic preachers in both state and pri-
 vate mosques. The Ministry of Religious Affairs proposes themes for and monitors
 sermons.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of domestic and foreign travel and free-
 dom to emigrate. The Government generally respects these provisions, although it
 imposes some restrictions on men of military age. Under the state of emergency, the
 Minister of Interior and the provincial governors may deny residency in certain dis-
 tricts to persons regarded as threats to public order. A curfew originally imposed
 in 1992 prohibits people from traveling in Algiers and the surrounding provinces be-
 tween 11:30 p.m. and 4 a.m. Police checkpoints in the cities and countryside rou-
 tinely stop vehicles to inspect identification papers and search for evidence of terror-
 ist activity.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum, and the Government
 has granted aslum in a few cases. The United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 uges (UNHCR) estimates that approximately 165,000 Sahrawis, or natives of the
 Sahara desert, live in camps in southwestern Algeria. The Government granted per-
 mission to the ICRC to visit camps holding Saharawi refugees and Moroccan pris-
 oners of war. (See the report on human rights in Western Sahara for fuller treat-
 ment of these issues.) The Government tolerates and provides basic support for an
 estimated 50,000 displaced Tuaregs from Mali and Niger in settlements in southern
 Algeria.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right f Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government's cancellation of electoral process in 1992 effectively denied citi-
 zens the right to change their government. Power remains in the hands of the mili-
 tary leadership and former ruling party officials. Despite President Zeroual's halting
 attem ts to consult with legal political parties and informal contacts with impris-
 oned PIS leaders, there is no democratic process. In a national speech on November
 1, Zeroual declared that the political dialog had failed and announced his intention
 to hold presidential elections in 1995 regardless. The FIS as well as the other major
 opposition parties dismissed this promise of elections.
 Few women are active in government, a reflection of strong social pressures
 against womenparticipating in politics. One woman served in the Cabinet until her
 resignation in October, one woman served as governor of the province of Annaba,
 and fewer than 1 percent of the candidates for Assembly seats in the 1991 election
 were women. The Berbers, an important indigenous minority group, participate free-
 ly and actively in the political process. Berbers hold influential positions in the Gov-
 ernment and the army.
 
 
 1053
 The Tuaregs, a people of Berber origin, do not play as important a role in the na-
 tional political process, due in large part to their small numbers, estimated in the
 tens of thousands, and their nomadic existence. Systemic or government-sanctioned
 barriers to political participation, however, do not exist against any minority group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Two human rights groups are active: the Algerian League for the Defense of
 Human Rights (IADH) and the Algerian League of Human Rights (LADH). Ter-
 rorists assassinated the head of LADH on June 18 near his office in downtown Al-
 giers (see Section l.a.).
 A governmental body, the National Observatory of Human Rights (ONDH), estab-
 lished in 1992, is charged with reporting human rights developments to the Presi-
 dent. In 1994 the ONDH submitted its first annual report to the Government and
 to international human rights groups, but the Government did not make it public.
 In December the head of the LADDH gave a presentation on human rights abuses
 at an internationally publicized meeting of Algerian political parties in Rome.
 Two representatives from Amnesty International (A) visited Algeria in August.
 Security elements guarded them closely, ostensibly for their own protection. Govern-
 ment representatives accused AI of having preconceived ideas and lacking evidence
 to support allegations of official abuses of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on birth, race, sex, be-
 lief, or any other personal or social condition. However, women continue to face legal
 and social discrimination.
 Women.--Some aspects of the law and many traditional practices discriminate
 against women. The Family Code, based on Islamic law, or Shari'a, regards women
 as minors under the legal guardianship of a husband or father. Women do not have
 full legal responsibility for their children because the father must sign all formal
 documents. A woman's testimony in a court of law does not equal a man's. Women
 are nonetheless allowed to work, own businesses, and enter into contracts. The Code
 confirms the Islamic practice allowing a man to marry four wives-a rare occur-
 rence. However, a wife may sue for divorce if her husband does not inform her of
 his intent to marry another wife.
 Under the Code, women need their husband's or father's permission to obtain a
 passport or travel abroad. Only males are able to confer citizenship on their chil-
 dren. The Code prohibits Muslim women from marrying non-Muslims, although men
 are legally free to marry non-Muslims. In cases of divorce,the Code awards guard-
 ianship of the children to the father, even though the mother is usually expected
 to care for them until a son is 13 and a daughter is married.
 Women constitute about 10 percent of the work force and pursue opportunities in
 o vernment, medicine, law, education, the media, and even in the armed forces.
 Nonetheless, social pressure against women pursuing a career is strong. In 1994
 Islamists increased their pressure on women to adopt Islamic fundamentalist views
 and norms. In March terrorist groups posted notices threatening to kill any woman
 who does not cover her head with a scarf. In one case, terrorists killed a 17-year-
 old woman, reportedly because she declined to adopt Islamic dress (see Section l.a.).
 Also in Marhi, suspected terrorists klled a woman in Saoula, reportedly because
 she refused to give up her job outside the home.
 Women's rights a         assert that spousal violence is common, although there
 are no reliabfe studies on the problem. Nonetheless, the central hospital in Algiers
 reported that in 1991 and 1992, it treated more than 4,600 cases of abused women.
 Battered women may file criminal charges or sue for divorce, but women's rights
 advocates maintain that legal actions are rare because the courts are generally le-
 nient with abusive husbands.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to protecting children's
 human rights. Nonetheless, legal experts maintain that the Penal and Family Codes
 do not offer sufficient protection for children. Many hospitals treat dozens of cases
 of child abuse every year, but many cases are unreported. Laws against child abuse
 have not led to notable prosecutions against offenders.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Berbers were the original inhabitants of
 Algeria, and many citizens claim to be of mixed Berber and Arab ancestry. The Ber-
 bers have sought to maintain their own cultural identity and language in the face
 of the Government's emphasis on the development of an Arab identity. Amazight,
 a Berber language, is taught at Tizi Ouzou-University, but the Government does
 not permit its instruction mnthe primary and secondary schools. In September and
 
 
 1054
 October, Berbers in the Kabylie area shut down the public school system. The strike
 continued through the end of December. In response, the Government has estab-
 lished a committee to consider the issue.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. In 1994 the Govern-
 ment established a monthly stipend, albeit meager, for people with disabilities. The
 ONDH is charged with developing programs to provide unspecified "help* for people
 with disabilities, but the project has not been given a high priority. The Government
 also provides limited financial support to several nongovernmental organizations
 that assist people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to establish trade unions of
 their choice. About two-thirds of the labor force belong to unions. Workers are not
 required to obtain government approval to establish a union. Nonetheless, the Gov-
 ernment limits some union activities. For example, the Government dissolved the
 SIT, an Islamist union which was affiliated with the banned FIS. The law prohibits
 unions from associating with political parties, although some unions, such as the
 General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA), maintain party ties. The law also pro-
 hibits unions from receiving funds from foreign sources. The courts are empowered
 to dissolve unions that engage in illegal activities.
 Under the state of emergency, the Government is empowered to require workers
 in both the public and private sectors to stay at their jobs in the event of an unau-
 thorized or illegal strike. According to the 1990 Law on Industrial Relations, work-
 era may strike only after 14 days of mandatory conciliation, mediation, or arbitra-
 tion. This law states that arbitration decisions are binding on both parties. If no
 agreement is reached in arbitration, the workers may legally strike after they vote
 by secret ballot to do so. A minimum level of public services must be maintained
 during public sector service strikes.
 There were numerous local strikes, including work stoppages by public-sector
 workers; most ended quickly following mediation efforts involving government offi-
 cials and labor unions. The Government did not invoke the state of emergency to
 block strikes, nor did it prosecute workers involved in the stoppages.
 Unions may form and join federations or confederations and affiliate with inter-
 national bodies. Several unions, pursued international contacts. The UGTA, for ex-
 ample, has contacts with French unions and the American Federation of Labor-Con-
 gress of Industrial Organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectioely.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining for all unions. The Government permits this right to be practiced.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers and provides mechanisms for resolving trade union complaints of antiunion
 practices by employers. It further permits all unions to recruit members at the
 workplace.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is in-
 compatible with the Constitution's provisions on individual rights. The Penal Code
 prohibits compulsory labor and the Government effectively enforces the ban.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 16 years. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor enforce the minimum employment
 age by periodic or unannounced inspection visits to public sector enterprises, but do
 not effectively enforce it in the agricultural or private sectors. Many children are
 driven by economic necessity into informal employment, such as street vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law defines the overall framework for ac-
 ceptable conditions of work, but leaves specific agreements on wages, hours, and
 conditions of employment to the discretion of employers in consultation with employ-
 ees. The Government fixes by decree a guaranteed monthly minimum wage for all
 sectors. After consultations with the UGTA, the Government in 1994 raised the min-
 imum wage to about $100 (from 3,500 dinars to 4,000 dinars). It met with the
 UGTA in October to negotiate pay raises for 1995. Ministry of Labor inspectors are
 responsible for ensuring compliance with the minimum wage regulations, although
 they enforce these provisions inconsistently.
 Algeria has a 44-hour workweek and well developed occupation and health regula-
 tions codified in a January 1991 decree. However, government inspectors do not en-
 force these regulations effectively.
