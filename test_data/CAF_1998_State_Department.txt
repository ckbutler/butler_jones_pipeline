 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The Central African Republic is a constitutional democracy with a multiparty leg-
 islature. Ange Felix Patasse, the candidate of the Movement for the Liberation of
 the Central African People (MLPC), was elected President in free and fair elections
 in 1993. National Assembly elections held in November and December were gen-
 erally free but marred by irregularities and low voter turnout; the subsequent defec-
 tion of a candidate elected on an opposition ticket gave the MLPC and its political
 allies a one-seat majority. In 1994 a Constitution providing for multiparty democ-
 racy was approved by a national referendum. Although the Constitution provides for
 separation of powers, the legislature is vulnerable to manipulation by the President,
 who dominates the Government. The President can veto legislation, although two-
 thirds of the unicameral legislature can override his veto, and can rule by decree
 under special conditions. The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary;,
 however, the judiciary is subject to executive interference, although it showed' in-
 creasing independence in March by declaring unconstitutional a presidential decree.
 After 2 years of military unrest, the implementation of the 1997 Bangui Accords
 restored peace in the capital. In March representatives of the ruling majority, the
 opposition, civil society, and religious groups signed a pact of national reconciliation
 before African heads of state and representatives of international organizations at
 the end of a Conference of National Reconciliation.
 The National Police under the direction of the Ministry of Interior and Public Se-
 curity, the military forces and the national gendarmerie under the Minister of De-
 fense, and the Special Force for the Defense of the Democratic Institutions
 (FORSDIR), which is responsible for presidential security, share responsibility for
 internal security. The security forces remain under the control of the President and
 the Ministry of Defense. In April the United Nations Security Council deployed
 1,350 troops to replace African peacekeeping forces known as MISAB. The U.N.
 peacekeeping forces, known as MINURCA, have a mandate to assist national secu-
 rity forces in maintaining law and order, to strengthen the national reconciliation
 process, to maintain a climate of security and stability during the legislative elec-
 tions, and to facilitate the disarmament process. The domestic security forces com-
 mitted some human rights abuses.
 The Central African Republic is a landlocked and sparsely populated country. The
 majority of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture. Annual per capita
 gross domestic product is estimated at $310. Principal exports are coffee, cotton,
 timber, tobacco, and diamonds. During military mutinies in 1996 and 1997, many
 small enterprises and factories were looted and destroyed, resulting in a sharp de-
 cline in public revenues and a significant rise in unemployment. Government civil
 servants are owed 8 to 9 months, salary arrears. Misappropriation of public funds
 and corruption in the Government is widespread.
 Although the Government's overall human rights record remained poor, with seri-
 ous problems in several areas, it improved somewhat compared with the previous
 year, due in part to the end of large-scale civil violence. There were credible reports
 of extrajudicial executions of suspected bandits by security forces and the death of
 prisoners due to police abuse. Police torture and beatings of suspects and prisoners
 continued. Other human rights abuses included harsh prison conditions, arbitrary
 arrest and detention, prolonged detention without trial, limits on judicial independ-
 ence, infringements on citizens' rights to privacy, restraints on press freedom to
 
 
 62
 criticize the Government, the suspension of a new political party, some limits on
 freedom of religion, some limits on freedom of movement, a pattern of discrimination
 and violence against women, female genital mutilation, child prostitution, and dis-
 crimination against indigenous people (Pygmies). However, there were signs of
 growing judicial independence, the Government eased some restrictions on freedom
 of assembly, and the criminal court resumed sessions after a hatus of two years.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. There were credible reports that police executed several suspected armed
 bandits and robbers with prior arrest records. The police organized a special Squad
 for the Repression of Banditry in response to the spread of armed robbery through-
 out Bangui following the military mutinies of 1996 and 1997. The Police Commis-
 sioner repeatedly announced on radio and television the crimes of criminals appre-
 hended by this squad, then ordered them executed the following day. The number
 of these extrajudicial killings is unknown. According to the Human Rights League
 Report, the squad executed more than 20 suspected bandits without trial. Some de-
 tainees died after torture (see Section 1.c.). The Government did not prosecute mem-
 bers of the security forces for these or other killings. In order to promote peace and
 national reconciliation in the wake of the 1996 and 1997 military mutinies, the Gov-
 ernment granted amnesty to all members of the armed forces who had participated
 in those mutinies, without either investigating or prosecuting them for the
 extrajudicial killings and other abuses perpetrated in those mutinies.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Penal Code prohibits torture and specifies sanctions for those found
 guilty of physical abuse, the police continued to beat and otherwise abuse criminal
 suspects and prisoners. Family members and the Human Rights League Executive
 Committee reported several deaths of prisoners due to police abuse to the courts,
 but authorities took no action. However, the Criminal Court convicted two police-
 men officers, Daniel Dimanche and Jacques Kpata, charged with brutalizing and
 beating detainees. The 1997 Bangui Accords recommended the abolition of special
 secret police units due to their abusive treatment of detainees and their operation
 as a parallel army outside the normal enforcement structure. President Patasse,
 under pressure from the opposition and the international community, dissolved the
 parallel forces in March, on the eve of the Conference of National Reconciliation.
 However, he immediately created a similar structure under a different name, the
 Security Forces for the Defense of Republican Institutions (FORSDIR).
 Prison conditions are harsh. Bangui's main prison, Ngaragba, was ransacked dur-
 ing the 1996 mutinies; therefore, nearly 300 detainees, half of whom were awaiting
 trial, were still being kept in 10 police stations around the city at year's end. Cells
 are overcrowded, and the basic necessities of life, including food, clothing, and medi-
 cal care, are in short supply and often are confiscated by prison officials for their
 personal use. Prisoners frequently are forced to perform uncompensated labor at the
 residences of government officials and magistrates. Male and female prisoners are
 confined in separate facilities in Bangui but housed together elsewhere. Minors rou-
 tinely are housed with adults and subjected to physical abuse.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors. The national
 Red Cross and religious groups routinely provide supplies, food, and clothes to pris-
 oners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides protection against arbi-
 trary arrest and detention, but security forces often ignored these provisions. The
 law stipulates that persons detained in cases other than those involving national se-
 curity must be brought before a magistrate within 96 hours. In practice authorities
 often do not respect this deadline, in part due to inefficient judicial procedures. Ju-
 dicial warrants are not required for arrest. By law, national security detainees de-
 fined as "those held for crimes against the security of the State" may be held with-
 out charge for up to 2 months.
 In'December 1997, former Minister of Mining Charles Massi, after leaving Presi-
 dent Patasse's ruling coalition to form his own party, was fired and placed under
 house arrest. The Government charged him with corruption in the diamond indus-
 try. His trial lasted about 6 months and frequently was postponed due to lack of
 evidence. The court was unable to adjudicate his case, which his lawyers considered
 political harassment. Ultimately, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional
 the presidential decree under which Massi was charged, ruling that only the Na-
 tional Assembly has the power to levy taxes and impose regulations. Under pressure
 
 
 from the Human Rights League and some magistrates and lawyers, the Ministers
 of Interior and Justice released Massi from house arrest in September.
 Prolonged pretrial detention is a serious problem. Roughly one-half the male pris-
 on population consists of pretrial detainees.
 The law does not permit the use of exile, and the Government has not employed
 it in practice. The Government has stated repeatedly that any person in exile for
 strictly political, rather than criminal, reasons may return without fear of persecu-
 tion.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but there are reliable reports of executive interference. Nevertheless, the judi-
 ciary showed increasing independence of the executive in declaring unconstitutional
 a presidential decree under which a government minister who attempted to form a
 new political party was charged with corruption (see Section 1.d.).
 The judiciary, which consists of regular and military courts, was reorganized in
 the 1994 Constitution, which became effective in January 1995. Legislation imple-
 menting this reorganization was enacted in 1996. New courts of justice were created
 in 1997 in both urban and rural areas. A juvenile court was created in June.
 In criminal cases, the accused are presumed innocent and have the right to legal
 counsel, to public trial, to be present at their trials, and to confront witnesses. The
 Government generally respects these safeguards in practice, but inefficient adminis-
 tration, shortages of trained personnel, and the lack of material resources obstruct
 the process. In June the criminal court opened its first session in 3 years; during
 that session, all persons accused were defended by lawyers. Court proceedings were
 open to the public and broadcast on national radio.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government on rare occasions abused the law that prohibits invasion of homes with-
 out a warrant in civil and criminal cases. However, police did use provisions of the
 Penal Code governing certain political and security cases that allow them to search
 private property without a warrant. As part of the disarmament process, security
 forces continued to carry out warrantless searches for guns and ammunition in pri-
 vate homes. The Government also monitors the telephones of some opposition fig-
 ures and engages in wiretapping without judicial authority.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press; however, the Government at times restricted the freedom of the
 press to criticize the Government.
 Citizens spoke freely and publicly, criticizing the Government and political par-
 ties. Opposition leaders in particular used press statements, manifestos, and copies
 of open correspondence to the Government to circulate their views. The Government
 made no apparent effort to censor, seize, or halt printing and circulation of these
 materials. In May the National Assembly voted a Press Code of Rights and Respon-
 sibilities that rescinded the Government's authority to censor the press while defin-
 ing the responsibilities of the private press.
 The Government owns and controls one newspaper, ACAP Bulletin, which ap-
 pears sporadically, and a wire service news bulletin. More than a dozen private
 newspapers were published over varying intervals; only four were published on a
 regular basis during the year. These newspapers were often outspoken in their criti-
 cism of the President, the Government, government economic policies, and official
 corruption. There were no reports that the Government took action against journal-
 ists following accusations of corruption published in their newspapers. However, the
 editor of one newspaper reported that the Interior Minister harassed him regarding
 his criticism of the Government.
 During the Conference of National Reconciliation in March, security guards ar-
 rested Gabriel Kopessoua, editor of the newspaper Vouma. He was released the fol-
 lowing day under pressure from General Amadou Toumani Toure, chairman of the
 International Follow-up Committee and from opposition parties and delegates to the
 conference.
 In June the National Assembly approved a bill to create the High Broadcast
 Council to regulate the media. Although the President appointed members to this
 council in December, it had not yet been organized by year's end.
 For several years, there has been no legal or institutional structure to regulate
 broadcast media. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Communication has restricted broad-
 casting. In July the Minister of Communication set up a committee to control and
 verify information prior to its broadcast on radio and television. The Association of
 Journalists protested against this decree as a violation of freedom of the press. A
 few days later the Minister revoked the decree establishing the committee.
 
 
 64
 Radio is the most important medium of mass communication, since literacy is not
 universal and newspapers and television are relatively expensive and rarely are
 found outside urban areas. The Government owns and operates a radio station and
 a television station. Programming was dominated by reporting on the activities of
 President Patasse and other senior government officials. Observers noted that the
 ruling majority parties received more coverage on their activities or meetings than
 did opposition parties. In May a public radio journalist was demoted following his
 weekly live editorial broadcast in which he severely criticized President Patasse's
 "entourage" of advisers for mismanagement and corruption.
 Government television and radio roadcasts included weekly programs that pro-
 vided an opportunity for political parties to present their views and discuss their
 progrms. The opposition welcomed this new access to the public media. However,
 in April, during a televised debate organized by a new party called the National
 Democratic Union for Central African People, the Interior Minister interrupted the
 broadcast and suspended the political party for 3 months on charges of sectarianism
 and tribalism (see Section 2.b.). During the legislative elections, political parties had
 access to the public media according to a schedule established by an independent
 electoral commission.
 The Government partially relaxed its monopoly on domestic radio broadcasting.
 A private radio station, Africa Number One, part of a French-owned network based
 in Libreville, Gabon, has been broadcasting in Bangui since 1995. Its programming
 includes national news coverage by a correspondent based in the country. A station
 affiliated with the Catholic CHurch began operations the same year. Its program-
 ming includes national news, debates, legal counseling, and human rights education.
 Radio France Internationale has been broadcasting domestically since 1997. Its pro-
 gramming includes some national news by a correspondent based in, the country. In
 August Radio-MINURCA, the U.N. peacekeeping forces' radio, began broadcasting.
 However, there are no private broadcast media entities owned and operated by citi-
 zens, as distinct from transnational French networks or Catholic Church networks.
 There are no privately owned stations that broadcast domestically produced national
 news or political commentary.
 The Government- continues to monopolize domestic television broddcasting. Pri-
 vate television broadcasting is allowed by law; the High Council on Communication
 is responsible for authorizing private television as well as radio stations. However,
 no applications to establish a private television station have been received; in the
 judgment of domestic investors, the economic preconditions for one do not exist. The
 Government does not restrict domestic receipt or distribution of satellite or cable tel-
 evision, but few citizens can afford it, and it is not widespread even in the capital.
 A private telecommunications company established pursuant to a 1996 law that
 liberalized telecommunications operates a domestic Internet and e-mail service as
 well as cybercafes. Few citizens can afford home access to the Internet, but many
 urban residents rent brief access at cybercafes.
 The Government does not impede foreign journalists in their work.
 The Government respects academic freedom. University faculty and students be-
 long to many political parties and express their views without fear of reprisal.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly; although the Government eased some restrictions on this
 right during the year, some legal restraints remain. A 1992 decree requires organiz-
 ers of demonstrations and pubc meetings to notify the Government 48 hours in ad-
 vance and also prohibits political meetings in schools or churches. The Interior and
 Security Ministry does not prohibit demonstrations or public meetings of which it
 has been notified in advance.
 The Constittion provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice, although the Government suspended a new po-
 litical party. Associations are required to register with the Government in order to
 enjoy legal status. All political parties must register with the Ministry of Interior
 and Public Security in order to participate legy in politics. The Government usu-
 allygrants registration expeditiously.
 here are more than 35 registered political parties and a variety of nonpolitical
 associations. The Government allows them to hold congresses, elect officials, and
 publicly debate policy issues without interference except when parties advocate sec-
 tarianism or tribalism. In April. the Interior Minister suspended for 3 months a new
 party led by El Hadj Mahamat Salle called the National Democratic Union for Cen-
 tral African People, on charges of sectarianism and tribalism (see Section 2.c.). This
 party, which is Islamic in orientation, resumed its activities after the period of its
 suspension ended.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion but es-
 tablishes fixed legal conditions and prohibits what the Government considers rei-
 
 
 gous fundamentalism or intolerance. The constitutional provision prohibiting reli-
 gious fundamentalism is widely understood to be aimed at Muslims. There is no
 state religion, and a variety of religious communities are active. Most of the popu-
 lation is Christian, although there are large Muslim and animist minorities. Reli-
 gious organizations and missionary groups are free to proselytize, worship, and con-
 struct places of worship. However, religious groups must register-with the Govern-
 ment. Any group that the Government considers subversive remains subject to sanc-
 tions, although the authorities imposed no sanctions during the year.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Persons are free to move about within the country, but police, security
 forces, and other officials harass travelers unwilling or unable to pay bribes at
 checkpoints along major intercity roads and at major intersections in Bangui. Some
 citizens, when attempting to leave the country, were informed by immigration au-
 thorities that their names were on unspecified official lists that prohibited their de-
 parture. Former Minister of Mining Charles Massi was forbidden to travel even be-
 fore his house arrest; also, the Ministry of Interior confiscatedhis passport. Attacks
 by bandits on major routes to the north and east sometimes occur, even though
 travelers move in convoys with military escorts.
 The 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Proto-
 col have the force of law, and the Government treats refugees in accordance with
 its provisions. The Government continued to work with the office of the United Na-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees in hosting Chadian, Sudanese, Rwandan, and
 Congolese (Zairian) refugees. Almost all refugees were registered with the National
 Commission for Refugees. Most Chadian refugees returned to their country. Some
 Rwandans were moved to other countries after having been accused of criminal ac-
 tivity in the Central African Republic. Applicants for asylum generally are well
 treated and often are accepted. The question of first asylum did not arise during
 the year. There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where
 they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised their constitutional right to change their government by demo-
 cratic means in 1993 through presidential and parliamentary elections. Inter-
 national observers deemed the elections free and fair. Legislative elections, origi-
 nally scheduled for September were delayed due to logistical problems. However,
 they were held in two rounds on November 22 and December 13. These elections
 for the unicameral legislature were free but marred by low rates of voter participa-
 tion and by many irregularities in voter registration and distribution of electoral
 materials. Opposition parties won 55 seats; the ruling MLPC.party of President
 Patasse and its allies won 54 seats. However, the subsequent defection of one oppo-
 sition National Assembly member gave the ruling coalition a one-seat majority. The
 opposition parties strongly protested this defection and boycotted the inauguration
 of the new session of the legislature. An independent electoral commission is in
 charge of the organization and the supervision of elections. The MINURCA electoral
 unit provides technical support to the commission.
 The President's term expires in October 1999; he is constitutionally and legally
 eligible for a second term.
 The Constitution provides for multiple political parties. In April the Interior Min-
 ister suspended a new political party (see Section 2.b.).
 The State is highly centralized. The central Government appoints all subnational
 government officials, and subnational government entities have no significant fiscal
 autonomy. The Government did not schedule local elections in recent years due to
 budgetary restrictions. Prodemocratic groups charge that the Government is reneg-
 ing on the constitutional requirement to hold local elections. The Government has
 appointed four successive mayors of Bangui.
 There are no laws that restrict the participation of women or minorities in the
 political process. However, there are very few women in prominent government posi-
 tions. Of the National Assembly's 109 members, only 8 are women. Three of the 25
 cabinet members are women. There is only one Muslim in the Government, and
 there are only four Muslims in the National Assembly. President Patass is a mem-
 ber of the Sara-Kaba ethnic group. Northern ethnic groups, including the Sara and
 Baya, are over represented both in the Presidential cabinet and in the Prime Min-
 ister's cabinet, as well as among the President's advisors.
 Pygmies (Ba'aka), the indigenous inhabitants of the southern part of the country,
 who represent from 1 to 2 percent of the population, are not represented in the Gov-
 ernent and have little political power or influence, although they voted in large
 numbers in the 1993 election.
 
 
 66
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Central African Human Rights League (LCDH) publicizes human rights vio-
 lations-and pleads individual cases of human rights abuses before the courts. The
 LCDH distributed to prisons, police stations, courts, -schools, and to other non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's), pamphlets describing human rights and infor-
 mation on judicial access.
 In a 1997 letter to the President and government authorities, the LCDH criticized
 the Governmenes harassment of the press, excessive pretrial detentions-in violation
 of the law, summary executions of suspected bandits and deaths of suspects while
 in police custody in Bangui. Several other NGO's, including the Movement for the
 Defense of Human Rights and Humanitarian Action and some religious groups, ac-
 tively monitor human rights problems. The Government welcomed the role that
 some of these NGO's played in mediating its negotiations with military mutineers
 in 1996 and 1997, but-resented their criticism of the process by which the Govern-
 ment formed a slender majority coalition in the National Assembly in December (see
 Section 3).
 International observers including U.N. Human Rights monitors from MINURCA
 observed the legislative elections. With this exception, no international human
 rights organizations are known to have sought to visit the country during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution stipulates that all persons are equal before the law without re-
 gard to wealth, race, sex, or religion, but the Government does not enforce these
 provisions effectively, and significant discrimination exists.
 Women.-Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs although inad-
 equate data make it impossible to quantify the extent. Victims seldom report inci-
 dents. The courts try very few cases of spousal abuse, although litigants cite these
 abuses during divorce trials and civil suits. Some women reportedly tolerate abuse
 in order to retain a measure of financial security for themselves and their children.
 The Government did not address this problem during the year.
 In daily practice, women are treated as inferior to men economically and socially.
 Single, divorced, or widowed women, even with children, are not considered to be
 heads of households. Only men are entitled to family subsidies. Women in rural
 areas generally suffer more discrimination than do women in urban areas. Sixty to
 70 percent of urban women have attended primary school, whereas only 10 to 20
 percent of their rural counterparts did. At the primary level females and males
 enjoy equal access to education, but the majority of young women drop out at age
 14 or 15 due to social pressure to marry and bear children. Only 20 percent of the
 students at the University of Bangui are women. There are no accurate statistics
 on the percentage of female wage earners. Women's access to educational opportuni-
 ties and to jobs, particularly at upper levels in the professions or in government
 service, traditionally has been limited. There are numerous active women's groups
 that organize workshops and seminars to promote women's and children's rights.
 Polygyny is legal, although this practice faces growing resistance among educated
 women. The law authorizes a man to take up to four wives, but a prospective hus-
 band must indicate at the time of the first marriage contract whether he intends
 to take additional wives. In practice many couples never marry formally because
 men cannot afford the traditional bride payment. Women who are educated and fi-
 nancially independent tend to seek monogamous marriages. Divorce is legal and
 may be initiated by either partner. The law does not discriminate against women
 in inheritance and property rights, but a welter of conflicting customary laws often
 prevails. A family code designed to strengthen women's rights was enacted in May.
 The Association of Central African Women Lawyers advises women of their legal
 rights. The organization also publishes pamphlets in conjunction with the Ministry
 of Social Affairs on the dangers, of female genital mutilation (FGM) and on food ta-
 boos.
 Children.-Although there is no official discrimination against children, the Gov-
 ernment spends little money on programs for children. Churches and NGO's have
 relatively few programs for youth. The failure of the education system, caused by
 a meager budget and salary arrears, resulted in a shortage of teachers and an in-
 crease in street children. Education is- compulsory beyond the age of 5 years, but
 parents rarely are prosecuted for their children's truancy. Many Bangui street chil-
 dren survive by begging and stealing. Several charitable organizations strive to as-
 sist them. In some rural areas, school children are used as labor on farms by their
 teachers or principals.
 
 
 Child prostitution is on the rise in the capital. Some girls are forced into prostitu-
 tion by their parents to earn money for the survival of the family. The presence of
 international peacekeeping forces in the capital has aggravated the problem of teen-
 age prostitution. The Government did not address these problems during the year.
 Courts interpret the Penal Code as forbidding parental abuse of children under
 age 15. The family code was designed to strengthen children's rights. Illegitimate
 children now have the same rights as those born in wedlock. A juvenile court was
 set up in June but lacks the means to function.
 A 1996 ordinance banned female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned
 by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological
 health. However, girls continued to be subjected to this traditional practice in cer-
 tain rural areas, and to a lesser degree in Bangui. Approximately 45 to 50 percent
 of adult females have undergone FGM. A campaign of awareness organized by the
 Ministry of Social Welfare and NGO's reduced the incidence of FGM in some rural
 areas. This campaign was still ongoing at year's end.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no codified or cultural discrimination against
 the disabled. There are several government-initiated programs designed to assist
 the disabled, including handicraft training for the blind and the distribution of
 wheelchairs and carts by the Ministry of Social Services. There are no legislated or
 mandated accessibility provisions for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Despite constitutional protection, there is societal discrimina-
 tion against Pygmies (Ba'aka), the known earliest inhabitants of the rain forest in
 the southern part of the country, who make up about 1 to 2 percent of the country's
 population. In general, Pygmies have little input in decisions affecting their lands,
 culture, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources. Indigenous forest-dwell-
 ing Pygmies in particular are subject to social and economic discrimination and ex-
 ploitation, which the Government has done little to correct. Pygmies often work for
 villagers at wages lower than those paid to members of other groups.
 Religious Minorities.-The population is believed to be about 50 percent Christian,
 15 percent Muslim, and 35 percent traditional, animist, or non-religious. Muslims,
 particularly Mbororo (also known as Peulh or Fulani) herders, claim to be singled
 out for harassment by authorities, including extortion by police, due to popular re-
 sentment of their presumed affluence. Muslims play a preponderant role in the
 economy.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population of about 3.5 million includes
 about 90 ethnic groups; many of these groups speak distinct primary languages and
 are concentrated regionally outside urban areas. The largest ethnic groups are the
 Baya (more than 30 percent), the Banda (more than 25 percent), the Mandja (more
 than 20 percent) and the Sara (about 10 percent). The Mbororo make up about 5
 percent of the population but play a preponderant role in the economy. They are
 involved in mining development and remain the most important cattle breeders in
 the country.
 Until 1993 there was little ethnic balance at the higher levels of government.
 Under the regime of Andre Kolingba, who ruled from 1981 to 1993, members of
 Kolingba's ethnic group, the Yakoma subgroup of the Banda, held a disproportionate
 number of senior positions in government, the armed forces, and state-owned firms.
 President Patasse is a member of the Sara ethnic group, which is linked to the
 Baya. The Patasse Government has brought about a more representative ethnic bal-
 ance in the Government However, observers note that members of the Sara and
 Baya northern ethnic groups close to the President are a majority in Patasse's Cabi-
 net and also receive favorable treatment in government appointments. In the wake
 of a 1994 civil service reform, Yakomoa no longer hold a disproportionate number
 of positions in the civil service, but the armed forces still are being restructured to
 achieve greater ethnic balance.
 Major political parties tend to have readily identifiable ethnic or ethnic-regional
 bases. The results of the November and December legislative elections confirmed
 that the MLPC of President Patasse has strong support in the north, especially
 among the Sara and Baya ethnic groups, while the Movement for Democracy and
 Development Party of former president Dacko is strong in the western part of the
 country and the Central African Democratic Rally Party of Kolingba is popular in
 the south-east, in the Oubangui River basin.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Labor Code, all workers are free to form
 or join unions without prior authorization. A relatively small part of the workforce
 has exercised this right, chiefly wage earners such as civil servants. There are five
 recognized labor federations; the two most important are the Organization of Free
 
 
 68
 Public Sector Unions and the Labor Union of Central African Workers (USTC),
 which have successfully maintained their independence from the Government.
 Unions have'the right to strike in both the public and private sectors. To be legal,
 strikes must be preceded by the union's presentation of demands, the employer's re-
 sponse to these demands, a conciliation meeting between labor and management,
 and a finding by an arbitration council that union and employer failed to reach
 agreement on valid demands. The union also must provide 8 days' advance written
 notification of a planned strike. The Labor Code states that if employers initiate a
 lockout that is not in accordance with the code, the employer is required to pay
 workers for all days of the lockout. Other than this, the code does not provide for
 sanctions on employers for acting against strikers. No employer actions against
 strikers are known to have occurred during the year.
 Labor federations are free to affiliate internationally. The USTC is affiliated with
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code grants trade
 unions full legal status, including the right to sue in court. It requires that union
 officials be employed full-time in the occupation as a wage earner, but they may con-
 duct union business during working hours. The code does not provide specifically
 that unions may bargain collectively. While collective bargaining has taken place in
 some instances, the government usually is involved in the process.
 Wage scales are set by the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service and were being
 revised at year's end. Large salary arrears dating from previous years persisted and
 increased. During the year, average salary arrears for government employees in-
 creased from 10 months' salary to 11 months' salary. They were reduced but not
 fully paid, and continued to be a major complaint of the unions.
 The law expressly forbids discrimination against employees on the basis of union
 membership or union activity. The Labor Code does not state whether employers
 found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for
 union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by the
 Labor Code, and there were no reports of forced or bonded labor, except for pris-
 oners who were forced to work without compensation for government officials or
 magistrates (see Section 1.c.). The Labor Code also applies to children. However, the
 Government does not have sufficient resources to enforce the prohibition effectively.
 In some rural areas, teachers or principals use school children as labor on farms
 (see Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Employ-
 ment of children under 14 years of age is forbidden by law, but the provision is en-
 forced only loosely by the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service. In practice child labor
 is common in many sectors of the economy, especially in rural areas.
 The Labor Code prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but the Govern-
 ment does not enforce its provisions effectively (see Section 6.f.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code states that the Minister of
 Labor and Civil Service must set minimum wages by decree. The minimum wage
 varies by sector and by kind of work. For example, the monthly -minimum wage is
 $15 (7,800 CFA) for agricultural workers and $36 (18,000 CFA) for office workers.
 The minimum wage enables a worker and family to afford the basic necessities but
 is barely adequate to maintain a decent standard of living. Most labor is performed
 outside the wage and social security system, especially by farmers in the large sub-
 sistence agricultural sector.
 The law sets a standard workweek of 40 hours for government employees and
 most private sector employees. Household employees may work up to 55 hours per
 -week. The law also requires that there be a minimum rest period of 48 hours a
 week.
 There are also general laws on health and safety standards in the workplace, but
 the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service neither precisely defines nor actively en-
 forces them, a matter about which the International Labor Organization has ex-
 pressed concern to the Government for many years. The Labor Code states that a
 labor inspector may force an employer to correct unsafe or unhealthy work condi-
 tions, but it does not provide the right for workers to remove themselves from such
 conditions without risk of loss of employment.
