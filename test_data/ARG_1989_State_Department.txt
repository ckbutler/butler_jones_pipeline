 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a federal, constitutional democracy with a
 president elected through an electoral college for a single
 6-year term, a bicameral legislature, and an independent
 judiciary. Traditionally, the executive is the dominant
 branch in the Argentine Government. Since the end of military
 rule in 1983, there have been four national elections. In the
 most recent, on May 14, 1989, the voters elected Justicialist
 Party candidates Carlos Menem and Eduardo Duhalde as the
 nation's President and Vice President. A rapidly
 deteriorating economic situation and an evident lack of public
 confidence due to the prolonged period before the scheduled
 December inauguration caused former President Raul Alfonsin to
 negotiate an early turnover of the reins of government to
 Carlos Menem. The inauguration of Menem on July 8 marked the
 first constitutional turnover of the presidency from one
 democratically elected President to another from an opposing
 party since 1916. Candidates in the May elections represented
 the political spectrum from conservative to far left.
 The President is constitutionl Commander-in-Chief, while a
 civilian Defense Minister oversees the armed forces. The
 federal police report to the Interior Minister; provincial
 police are organized under provincial constitutions and report
 to locally elected provincial governors.
 Argentina is beset by inflation, which averaged well over 100
 percent annually during 1986-88 and which escalated to
 hyperinflation during 1989, with the consumer price index
 increasing by 4,923 percent for thd year. Argentina has
 significant arrears on an external debt of more than $60
 billion and requires fresh infusions of external capital. The
 state-owned enterprises are generally unprofitable, foreign
 investment is weak, and capital flight is a problem. The
 Menem administration moved quickly to introduce such measures
 as privatization, economic emergency legislation, and a tax
 reform bill, which attempt to confront the problems of deficit
 financing and lack of investor confidence. These and other
 steps resulted in a rapid drop in the level of inflation
 beginning in August 1989, but the trend reversed itself in
 November and December as financial markets lost confidence in
 the Government's ability to control deficit spending.
 Human rights concerns in 1989 focused more on accounting for
 abuses during military rule (1976-83) than on the policies of
 the civilian Government. The courts continued the painful
 task of deciding custody of the children of people who
 disappeared during the military Government's rule. In October
 President Menem pardoned military officials accused of human
 rights violations or mutiny against the army high command, an
 action widely criticized by human rights and political
 organizations. An attack in January by members of the "All
 for the Fatherland Movement" (MTP) against the La Tablada
 military compound resulted in an estimated 38 deaths and 80
 injuries. Twenty MTP members implicated in the attack were
 tried and sentenced to prison by a civilian court; a separate
 civilian court commenced criminal investigations into charges
 that some attackers were killed or disappeared after they had
 surrendered. In late May a series of attacks against food
 stores and other businesses took place in several Argentine
 cities. Police efforts to contain these riots resulted in 14
 deaths, 80 injuries, and hundreds temporarily detained. The
 Government declared a 30-day state of siege, with curfew and
 other restrictions applied in those areas where rioting had
 occurred. Legal challenges to this state of siege were heard

 by the courts but eventually rejected. In general, the
 Government continued its efforts to protect human rights, but
 thi2use of excessive force by the police remained a concern.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Ektrajudicial Killing
 There were no credible reports of politically motivated
 killings carried out by the Government in 1989. However,
 survivors of the January attack against the La Tablada
 military compound charged that several of those who carried
 out this attack were killed by police and military forces
 after they had surrendered. A civilian judge was assigned to
 investigate these charges, and this investigation was still
 under way at year's end. Human rights organizations,
 political groups, and the press criticized police for several
 deaths which appeared to involve excessive use of force in
 dealing with criminal suspects. Critics charged that police
 routinely shoot to kill. Courts investigating instances in
 which police officers were charged with specific unjustifiable
 killings ordered the arrest and sentencing to prison of
 several police officials, reportedly for terms of from 6 to 9
 years. Sources could not confirm whether any police officers
 are actually serving time for such killings, as the judicial
 process is- slow and complicated.
 Politically motivated bombings continued but on a markedly
 reduced scale from last year. Most were small explosions late
 at night, causing little damage and few injuries. Targets
 through the year included national political parties;
 military, church, press, and judicial officials; trade union
 leaders; political figures of both the extreme right and left;
 and public buildings. The perpetrators never claimed
 responsibility for these bombings, and police have yet to make
 any arrests in these cases.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known abductions, secret arrests, or
 disappearances linked to or condoned by the Government during
 1989. A civilian judge is investigating charges by the
 survivors of the La Tablada attack that three or four of the
 attackers disappeared or turned up dead after surrendering to
 the police.
 The independent judicial system continued the painful process
 of determining custody of children whose parents disappeared
 during military rule (1976-1983). In a related development,
 the Government of Paraguay returned to Argentina children
 tentatively identified as offspring of Argentines who
 disappeared during military rule. These cases remain under
 court investigations. In one instance a medical examination
 failed to confirm the paternity of two children.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and the criminal code
 provides penalties for torture which are similar to those for
 homicide. Argentina has ratified the U.N. Convention Against
 Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 
 
 Punishment. However, human rights groups and critics accuse
 police of mistreatment of prisoners. They charged the police
 with misuse of force and at least 18 instances of torture
 linked to efforts by the security forces to control the
 looting which took place in late May. According to a
 publication of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights (APHD),
 charges were made before the courts in September in these 18
 cases. Other complaints of mistreatment of minors were either
 dropped by the courts or lost in the legal system. In one
 case a court sentenced three police officers to what
 reportedly were 3-year prison terms after finding them guilty
 in a 1986 torture case. Investigations of claims of
 mistreatment are handled by the Undersecretariat of Interior
 for Human Rights and through judicial review. Several formal
 claims of mistreatment were filed in 1988 before the Interior
 Ministry. Human rights officials believe these are included
 among the cases considered by the courts during 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Argentina has a well-developed legal code containing explicit
 protections of individual rights and controls on police arrest
 and investigatory powers. Arrests require probable cause or a
 judicial order, and the law provides for a judicial
 determination of the legality of detention. However, the
 penal code gives the courts authority to detain persons
 without notice or charges for up to 8 days during
 investigations. Even in the case of minor offenses, holding
 suspects without charges for several days is not uncommon.
 Involuntary exile is not permitted or practiced.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Argentina's judicial system is widely recognized as fair and
 independent, albeit slow and cumbersome. The Constitution and
 penal code provide for trials before judges and appellate
 review of all judicial rulings, including those of military
 courts. Federal courts interpret constitutional protection
 against "arbitrary" trial process to permit wide-ranging
 review of criminal prosecutions. As in most civil law
 countries, trial by jury does not exist; judges render
 verdicts.
 The police have legal authority to adjudicate misdemeanors,
 which are often settled by senior police officials. The legal
 system provides public defenders, but 1989 caseloads exceeded
 their capacity. The right to bail is provided by law and
 observed in practice.
 The pardon granted by President Menem provided for the release
 of those few persons considered by human rights groups to be
 political prisoners. Some human rights activists are
 beginning to focus on some of the La Tablada defendants as
 political prisoners. The Government rejects this contention,
 however, on the basis that none of these persons fall within
 the accepted definition of political prisoners.
 The human rights community continued to criticize the Supreme
 Court's broad interpretation of the "Due Obedience" Law as it
 had earlier criticized passage of the law itself. Court
 proceedings against several military officers not covered by
 President Menem's pardons, the "Due-Obedience" doctrine, or
 the "Punto Final" (Final Point) continue in the federal
 
 
 456
 ARGENTINA
 appellate courts.
 .Retired General Orlando Agosti, who had served 3 years and 9
 months of a 'sentence for human rights violations committed
 during the period of military rule, was released in May.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is constitutional protection against unreasonable search
 and seizure. No cases of arbitrary intrusion by the State
 into the private lves of persons were reported in 1989.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Under both the Alfonsin and the new Menem administration,
 Argentina continued to enjoy a free and relatively independent
 press, which covers a wide range of political viewpoints.
 Criticism of the Government and opposition viewpoints are
 vigorously expressed. The State owns 55 of'170 AM radio
 stations outright and other governmental entities own 11 more,
 while the Federal Broadcast Authority licenses and thus
 controls the'franchises of the remainder.' The Federal
 Government owns one of the four nationally syndicated Buenos
 Aires television stations (two others were privatized in
 December 1989), and two radio stations.
 The Government plans to continue operating the official news
 agency, TELA4, which has more than 300 clients throughout the
 country and serves as the exclusive agent for all government
 advertising. With more than 40-percent of the Argentine
 economy in the hands of the State, TELAM wields formidable
 political influence to authorize or refuse government
 advertising to media outlets.
 At both of its general assemblies in 1989, the Association of
 Newspaper Editors of Argentina (ADEPA) declared that freedom
 of the press did exist in Argentina, with only few exceptions.
 The group issued a detailed report of the various legislative
 and judicial acts which have impaired freedom of the press in
 recent years. For example, ADEPA denounced the house arrest
 of journalist Raul L. D'Altri, editor of the newspaper
 La Arena, for having refused to reveal a source of information,
 and deplored several provincial laws that imposed financial
 burdens on the press. ADEPA also reported other cases of
 judicial proceedings impairing freedom of the press, including
 the prohibition of an advertisement on behalf of former
 President Videla. The publicity generated by these cases
 indicates that the few exceptions to the prevailing freedom of
 the press received wide public attention.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All groups and political parties are free to organize and
 assemble. The law requires political parties to support the
 Constitution and a democratic, representative, republican, and
 federal form of government in order to register for
 elections. At present, no party is denied registration.
 During the campaigns leading to the presidential elections in
 May, all major political parties held mass rallies without
 interference. The labor movement, human rights organizations,
 
 
 457
 ARGENTINA
 ethnic communities, and other groupings held frequent
 demonstrations and rallies without interference or incident.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 but also establishes Roman Catholicism as the state religion.
 The Government provides financial support to the Roman
 Catholic Church, and the Constitution requires the President
 and Vice President to be Roman Catholics. Other religions
 must complete a pro forma registration with the Government to
 obtain legal recognition. Missionaries from any religion are
 permitted to enter Argentina and proselytize, and the
 non-Catholic population is growing. Argentina's Jewish
 community (at an estimated 300,000, the largest in Latin
 America) practices its religion without official interference
 or legal restriction. In June the Government introduced
 legislation which would make those found guilty of mocking or
 ridiculing religious ceremonies subject to prison sentences.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 International and internal travel as well as emigration are
 unrestricted. Refugees are not forced to return to countries
 from which they have fled.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since September 1983, Argentina has held four national
 elections to choose federal, provincial and local officials.
 The elections were free, fair, and democratic, with universal
 suffrage. The Justicialist (Peronist) Party currently
 controls the executive and legislative branches of
 government. Political parties ranging from left to right are
 represented in Congress as a result of the 1987 and 1989
 elections. Additional parties hold office in individual
 provinces. From the powerful Radicals to miniscule provincial
 movements, Argentina's opposition parties operate without
 hindrance.Women and minorities have full political rights by
 law.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperates fully with international human
 rights organizations, which enjoy unrestricted access in
 Argentina. Eleven domestic human rights organizations
 operated openly in 1989, despite occasional and anonymous
 bombings, death threats, and harassment. Since 1983 the
 domestic human rights community has strongly and continuously
 opposed all efforts to limit military accountability for
 abuses committed during military rule. Despite these forceful
 protests, a pardon was issued in October by President Menem
 absolving most military personnel from prosecution for human
 rights violations committed during the "Dirty War."
 Argentina plays an active role in both the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), whbre it chairs an important
 subcommittee of experts, and the Organization of American
 
 
 458
 ARGENTINA
 States' Inter-American Human Rights Commission. The
 Government has facilitated efforts by domestic human rights
 organizations to address both of these international bodies in
 opposition to the government's judicial policies towards the
 military, and has cooperated with UNHRC efforts to investigate
 cases involving missing children from the 1976-83 period of
 military rule. Argentina has ratified the American Convention
 on Human Rights (1984) and the U.N. Conventions on Torture,
 Civil and Political Rights, and Economic, Social and Cultural
 Rights (all in 19a6) and accepted compulsory jurisdiction by
 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 I    Language, or Social Status
 Congress passed a law in 1988 that authorizes criminal
 penalties for, discrimination on the basis of race, sex,
 religion, and other categories. Although there is no official
 policy of discrimination against them, Argentine women have to
 contend with bias rooted in the sociocultural traditions of
 the country. Argentina adheres to the U.N. Convention for the
 Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.
 According to the-Foreign Ministry's Undersecretary for Human
 Rights and Women, violence against women is not considered to
 be a major problem in Argentina. Such abuse, including
 domestic violence such as wife beating, exists, but because of
 inadequate statistical data, the true extent of the problem is
 difficult to determine. Because victims are frequently
 reluctant to file reports or to press charges, the likelihood
 is that cases are significantly undbrreported., There is an
 apparent increase in the number of.cases being brought before
 the courts because there are now three police stations
 established to handle reports of violence against women. This
 increase may also be due to greater-public awareness of this
 problem caused by extensive publicity given specific cases.
 Enhanced media interest in the issue is credited'with bringing
 about a greater awareness of this type of violence, giving the
 appearance that it is on the rise. Neither society nor the
 Government condone yiolence against women.
 There is a history of anti-Semitism in Argentine society,
 which produces occasional anti-Semitic incidents. In the
 course of,1989, the Delegation of Argentine Jewish
 Associations (DAIA), Argentina's umbrella Jewish organization,
 condemned anonymous threats and anti-Semitic public statements
 by public figures (none of them government officials). For
 example, an instructor at the La Plata Police School was
 dismissed for distributing anti-Semitic papers to students.
 Senior government and political officials have condemned such
 acts. There has also been an unofficial but systematic
 exclusion of Jewish Argentines from certain institutions such
 as the armed forces.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There isfree right of labor association in Argentina. The
 labor movement, which includes about one-third of the national
 work force, is a major independent economic and political
 force. Although trade unions are independent of the
 Government, the vast majority of union leaders are allied to
 the ruling Justicialist Party-and are active in the Peronist
 movement, while retaining their freedom of decisionmaking
 
 
 459
 ARGENTINA
 outside of party control. Congress passed legislation in 1987
 and 1988 which reinstituted laws governing labor relations and
 other trade union rights which previous military governments
 had suspended. The right of association was enhanced by these
 laws. Trade unions are free to associate with international
 organizations, and many Argentine unions are affiliated with,
 and active in, international trade union groups.
 In 1989 the international Labor Organization (ILO) Committee
 of Experts on the Application of Conventions and
 Recommendations expressed satisfaction with the legislation
 passed in 1987 and 1988, but questioned whether the membership
 requirements for legalizing alternative trade unions were too
 stringent.
 Unions have the right to strike, subject to compulsory
 conciliation and arbitration by the Labor Ministry. Workers
 have the right to receive their salaries while on strike until
 the Labor Ministry orders compulsory conciliation. Strikes by
 teachers, state-owned enterprise employees, and civil servants
 dominated the strike scene in 1989.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 By law, labor and management have a binding collective
 bargaining process which sets wage levels on an industrywide
 basis. The State's involvement in this process is limited to
 ratifying the agreements, which provides them with legal
 status. The Government continues to offer wage guidelines
 under its economic emergency adjustment program, and directly
 sets wages in state-owned enterprises. Antiunion
 discrimination is prohibited by law and well-developed
 mechanisms are in place and functioning to resolve
 complaints. Some provinces provide rights and obligations
 additional to those in federal legislation.
 There are no officially designated export processing zones in
 Argentina.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal in Argentina and is not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law prohibits the employment of children under 14 years of
 age, except in the family. Minors of ages 14 and 15 may work
 in restricted types of employment, but not more than 6 hours a
 day or 35 hours a week. The same law applies to minors 16 to
 18 years of age, although competent authority may allow
 exceptions. Violations are tried before the appropriate
 courts. Enforcement of child labor laws is hampered by the
 severe economic crisis in Argentina, which forces many
 families to have as many members as possible working in order
 to survive. Laws are enforced to the extent possible by the
 authorities, but it has proven almost impossible to control
 this type of illegal labor activity under circumstances where
 economic necessity forces children to seek work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Argentina offers comprehensive protection of workers' rights.
 The maximum workday is 8 hours; the.workweek is 48 hours.
 Premiums must be paid for work beyond those limits. Rules
 
 
 -460
 ARGENTIA-
 governing vacations, minimum wages, and occupational health
 and safety are comparabie-to thbse in Western industrial
 nations'And-are enforced by the Government and labor unions in
 the formal economy. Argentina, however, has a large
 underground'ecOnomy which employs an undetermined number of
 people, including children. This sector is difficult to
 police, and workers can be denied basic rights and benefits
 because they fear losing their jobs if they report labor code
 violati6n8. Governmentand labor unions find it difficult to
 police small employers bn the fringes of this underground
 economy.
 The official mihimum wige in Argentina, eroded by
 hyperinflation in 1989, is currently set at about $15 per
 month. 'Government and trade union officials agree this is not
 sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and his family, but they differ on how soon it should be
 changed.  It was subject to monthly revision during the first
 6 months of 1989, but remained steady since July as the
 Government attempted to bring inflation under control.
 Government officials argue that few workers are paid at the
 minimum wage level and that wages have improved under the
 collective bargaining process, without the necessity of
 boosting the minimum wage level. Union leaders accept the
 need for restraint on wages but argue for an increase in the
 minimum wage, t6 provide protection, and a wage floor to lower
 paid workers. Special salary-bonuses were provided to all
 workers in December.
