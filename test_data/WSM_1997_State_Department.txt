 SAMOA
 Samoa, a small Pacific island country with a population of approximately 162,000,
 is a parliamentary democracy but with certain concessions to Samoan cultural prac-
 tices. The Constitution provides for a Samoan head of state, a unicameral legisla-
 ture composed of "matai (family heads) elected by universal suffrage, an independ-
 ent judiciary, protection of Samoan land and traditional titles, and guarantees of
 fundamental rights and freedoms. Executive authority is vested in the Head of
 State, with the Government administered by the Cabinet, consisting of the Prime
 Minister and 12 ministers chosen by him. Alllaws passed by the Legislative Assem-
 bly need the approval of the Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili II, who holds the
 position for life. His successors will be elected by the Legislative Assembly for 5-
 year terms.
 The country does not have a defense force. The small national police force is firm-
 ly under the control of the Government but has little impact beyond Apia, the cap-
 ital city. Enforcement of rules and security within individual villages is vested in
 the fono" (Council of Mata), which settles most internal disputes. Judgments by
 the fano usually involve fenes or, more rarely, banishment from the village.
 Samoa is a poor country with a market-based economy in which over 60 percent
 of the work force is employed in the agricultural sector. Coconut products and kava
 are the principal exports. The small industrial sector is dominated by a Japanese
 factory which assembles automotive electrical parts for export. The Governrment has
 initiated a major push for tourism. Per capita gross domestic product is $1,100 per
 year. The country is heavily dependent on foreign aid and on remittances sent to
 family members by the more than 100,000 Samoans living overseas, mostly in Aus-
 tralia, New Zealand, and the United States.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. Principal
 human rights abuses arise out of political discrimination against women and
 nonmatai, and violence against women and children. Societal pressures and cus-
 tomary law may interfere with the ability to conduct fair trials. Those who do not
 conform to accepted societal values may face pressure, threats, and violence. There
 are some restrictions on freedoms of speech, press, and religion.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There re e no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Puns hment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials practiced
 them. However, villages are controlled by customary law, and the fono may mete
 out banishment when deemed necessary. This is one of the harshest forms of pun-
 ishment in this collective society.
 Although jail conditions are fairly basic so far as food and sanitation are con-
 crned, there have been no reports of abuses in prisons. While there are human
 rights groups, the question of monitoring of prison conditions by them has not aris-
 en. Prison visits by family members and church representatives are permitted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law assures the right to a fair public trial,
 and this is honored by the official court system. However, many civil and criminal
 matters are not handled by courts but by village fono, which differ considerably both
 in their decisionmaking style and in the number of matai involved in the decisions.
 The Village Fono Act o 1990 gives legal recognition to the decisions of the fono and
 p rovides or limited recourse of appeal to the Lands and Titles Courts and to the
 supreme Court. In a 1993 court case, a village fno ordered the property of a vil-
 lager to be burned after he had disobeyed an    s flouted village rules  an ar mob
 killed the villager and burned all his belongings. The villager who actually shot the
 victim was tried in 1994 and sentenced to death by the Supreme Court. The six
 mata members of the fono, although originally charged by the Supreme Court with
 inciting murder, were subsequently charged only with willful damage and received
 
 
 892
 a minimal fine and no jail sentence. The Attorney General lodged an appeal in 1994
 on the grounds that the sentence was "inadequate and inappropriate, but the ap-
 peal was not heard. Similarly, a civil case by the spouse of the deceased against the
 matai involved was dropped. In both the criminal appeal and the civil suit, tradi-
 tional reconciliation measures were used by the parties to settle the matter.
 In March 1997, in another village on Savai'i, the village fono threatened to burn
 at the stake a villager who refused to accept a banishment order issued as a result
 of a disagreement over land being donated for a church. Intervention by police and
 religious authorities prevented the threatened burning from being carried out. The
 man subsequently left the village for a time but was eventually allowed to return.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for protection from invasion of the home or seizure of proprty without sub-
 stantive and procedural safegards, including search warrants , which are issued by
 hjudicial branch. Practicay, however, there is little or no privacy in the village.
 While village officials by law must have permission to enter homes, there can be
 substantial social pressure to grant such permission.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 However, the Government's ban on press coverage of the leader of the opposition
 on state-run radio and television stations generated controversy in 1997. In practice,
 however, the Government's ban is. largely symbolic. Statements by the leader of the
 opposition receive prominent coverage in the private news media.
 The Newspapers and Printers Act and the Defamation Act require journalists to
 reveal their sources in the event of a defamation suit against them. There has been
 no court case requiring that these acts be invoked.
 Two English-language newspapers and numerous Samoan-language newspapers
 are printed regularly in the countr. The Government operates a radio station and
 the country's sole television station. There are two private radio stations. Television
 from American Samoa is readily available.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, along
 with freedom of thought and conscience. Nearly 100 percent of the population is
 Christian. While the Constitution grants each person the right to change religion
 or belief and to worship or teach religion alone or with others, in practice the matai
 often choose the religious denomination of the alga (extended family). There is
 strong societal pressure to support church leaders and projects financially. Such con-
 tributions often total more than 30 percent of personal income.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of internal movement, but in
 practice some citizens have been banished either from village activities or com-
 pletely from the village. The Government actively supports emigration as a "safety
 valve" for pressures of a growing population, especially for potentially rebellious
 youths, andbecause it generates foreign income through remittances. The Govern-
 ment does not restrict foreig travel arbitrarily or the right of citizens to return
 from abroad.
 Samoa has not had any refugees or asylum seekers, and it is not a party to any
 international protocol on them. However, the authorities have indicated that they
 would conform to international norms if such cases should arise.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have te right to change their government through direct, multiparty
 elections, but women's political rights are restricted by the act that few of them
 are matai. While all citizens above the age of 21 may vote, the right to run for 47
 of the 49 seats in the Legislative Assembly remains the prerogative of the approxi-
 mately 25,000 matai, 95 percent of whom are men. The remaining two seats are re-
 served for citizens not of Samoan heritage. While all adult Samoans may vote for
 the Legislative Assembly, matai continue to control local government through the
 village fono which are open teachem alone.
 The political process is more a function of personal leadership characteristics than
 of party. In the April general elections, the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP)
 le iby Pime MinisterTofilau Eti Alesana, retained the majority of seats in the Leg-
 islative Assembly. Tofilau and the HRPP have dominated the political process, win-
 
 
 893
 ning five consecutive elections since 1982. Although candidates are free to propose
 themselves for electoral office, in practice, they require the blessing of the vlage
 high chiefs. Those who ran in the 1996 elections in spite of fono objections faced
 ostracism and even banishment from their village. Following the elections there
 were multiple charges of fraud and bribery. Four elections were subsequently over-
 turned by the Supreme Court, and by-elections were held.
 Women occasionally reach high public office. The 12-member Cabinet has 1 female
 member, and women hold 3 of the 49 seats in Parliament. The first female judge
 was named in 1994, and the first female Attorney General was appointed in 1997.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operated without government restriction. Gov-
 ernment officials are usually cooperative.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, or social status. This is a homogeneous society with no significant ethnic
 minorities. Politics and culture are the product of a heritage of chiefly privilege and
 power, and members of certain families have some advantages. While there is dis-
 crimination against nonmatai and women, women (and particularly female matai)
 play an important role in society and may occasionally reach high office.
 Women.-The traditional subordinate role of women is changing, albeit slowly, es-
 pecially in the more conservative parts of society. While abuse of women is prohib-
 ited by law, social custom tolerates physical abuse of women within the home. The
 role and rights of the village fono and tradition would prevent police from interfer-
 ing   instances of domestic violence, barring a complaint from the victim-which
 village custom strongly discourages. While police do receive some complaints from
 abused women, domestic violence offenders are typically punished by village coun-
 cils, but only if the abuse is considered extreme. ("Extreme abuse" would be visible
 signs of physical abuse.) The village religious leader may also intervene in domestic
 disputes.
 Many cases of rape may still go unreported because tradition and custom discour-
 age such reporting. In spite of this, the authorities note a greater number of re-
 orted cases of rape, as women are slowly becoming more forthcoming with the po-
 lice, Rape cases that do reach the courts are treated seriously. Convicted offenders
 are often given relatively stiff sentences of several years' imprisonment.
 The Ministry of Women's Affairs oversees and helps ensure the rights of women.
 Children.-The Government has made a strong commitmnt to the welfare of chil-
 dren trough the implementation of various youth programs by the Ministry of Edu-
 cation and the Ministry of Health. Law and tradition prohibit severe abuse of chil-
 dren, but tradition tolerates corporal punishment. The police noted an increase in
 reported cases of child abuse, attributed to Samoans becoming more aware of the
 need to report physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has passed no legislation pertaining to
 the status of handicapped or disabled persons or regarding accessibility for the dis-
 abled. Samoan tradition dictates that han dicapped persons be cared for by their
 family, and this custom is widely observed in practice.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have legally unrestricted rights to establish
 and join organizations of their own choosing. To date, two trade unions have been
 organized. The Samoa National Union, organized in 1994, is a six-member associa-
 tion which includes workers from the three major banks. A second union represents
 members at the sole factorf in the country. oth unions are independent of the Gov-
 ernment and political parti~es. There are no laws specific to union activity. The Com-
 missioner of Labor would adjudicate any cases of retribution against strikers or
 union leaders on a case-by-case basis.
 The Public Service Association, representing government workers, an increasingly
 important sector of the work force, also flunctions as a union. The Supreme Court
 has upheld the right of government workers to strike, subject to certain restrictions
 imposed principally for reasons of public safety. Workers in the private sector have
 the right to strke, but in 1997 there were no strikes. The Public Service Association

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While workers have the legal
 right to engage in collective bargaining, they have seldom practiced it, due to the
 newness of union activity and the inexperience of union leaders. However, the Pub-
 
 
 894
 lic Service Association engages in collective bargaining on behalf of government
 workers, including bargaining on wages. Minimum wages are set by an advisory
 commission to the Minister of Labor. Wages in the private sector are determined
 by competitive demand for the required skills. Any antiunion discrimination case
 would be reported to and adjudicated by the Commissioner of Labor. Arbitration and
 mediation procedures are in place to resolve labor disputes, although these rarely
 arise.
 Labor law and practice in the one export processing zone are the same as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-While the Government does not
 demand compulsory labor, and it is prohibited by law, in this collective society peo-
 ple, including minors, are frequently called upon to work for their villages. Most
 people do so willingly, but if not, the matai can compel them to do so.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Under the
 Labor and Employment Act (LEA) of 1972 as amended, it is illegal to employ chil-
 dren under 15 years of age except in "safe and light work.' The Commissioner of
 Labor refers complaints about illegal child labor to the Attorney General for enforce-
 ment. Children are frequently seen hawking goods and foodstuffs on Apia street cor-
 ners. Although a violation of the LEA, localofficials mostly tolerate and overlook
 the child vendors. There are no reports of bonded labor by children, but the LEA
 does not apply to service rendered to the matal, some of whom require children to
 work for the village, primarily on village farms (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conition of Work.- The LEA established for the private sector a
 40-hour workweek and an hourly minimum wage of $0.50 (Tala 1.25). This mini-
 mum wage suffices for a basic standard of living when supplemented by the subsist-
 ence farming and fishing in which most families engage. The act provides that no
 worker should be required to work for more than 40 hours in any 1 week.
 The act also establishes certain rudimentary safety and health standards, which
 the Attorney General is responsible for enforcing. Independent observers report,
 however, that the safety laws are not strictly enforced except when accidents high-
 light nonompliane. Many agricultural workers, among others, are inadequately
 protected from pesticides and other dangers to health. Government education pro-
 g amns are addressing these concerns. The act does not apply to service rendered to
 e matai. While the act does not specifically address the righ of workers to remove
 themselves from a dangerous work situation, a report of such a case to the Commis-
 sioner of Labor would prompt an investigation, without jepardy to continued em-
 ployment. Government employees are covered under different and more stringent
 regulations, which are adequately enforced by the Public Service Commission.
