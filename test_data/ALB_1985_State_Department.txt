 ALBANIA*
 Albania is a one-party State ruled by a Marxist-Leninist
 dictatorship. Ramiz Alia officially replaced the first
 Albanian Communist ruler, Enver Hoxha, as Albania's leader on
 April 13, 1985, two days after Hoxha's death. Like Hoxha, he
 exercises personal leadership through the 125,000-member
 Albanian Party of Labor (Communist party).
 A large, effective security service, known as the Sigurimi,
 assists the party in maintaining repressive controls over the
 Albanian people, who enjoy only very limited civil and
 political rights.
 Albania has a centrally controlled command economy under which
 the State owns the means of production and the Government
 directs all significant economic activity. Within a strategy
 of economic self-reliance, the Government emphasizes a policy
 of rapid industrialization and development. In recent years,
 however, the rate of economic growth has declined.
 There is no substantial evidence that the human rights
 situation, which appeared to be exceptionally bad in 1984,
 improved significantly in 1985. The new leader, Alia, has
 pledged continuity with Hoxha's policies while calling for
 greater political "vigilance." Some Western visitors,
 however, have reported a somewhat more relaxed social
 atmosphere during 1985.
 Albania is a member of the United Nations but has not signed
 the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
 Europe.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In the past, the Communist rulers have indulged in political
 killing of their opponents, as Enver Hoxha did in disposing of
 four principal supporters of Mehmet Shehu, his former close
 associate who reportedly committed suicide under suspicious
 circumstances in 1981. There is no evidence of political
 killing since Alia's rise to the top.
 b. Disappearance
 Persons who have escaped from Albania report that
 disapearances occur, but specific corroboration is not
 available.
 * The United States has not had diplomatic relations with or
 official representation in Albania since World War II. It is
 difficult therefore to comment authoritatively on conditions
 in Albania.

 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Criminal Code prohibits the use of physical or
 psychological force during investigations. Nevertheless,
 former political prisoners have often alleged that they were
 beaten and ill-treated during interrogations to force them to
 make "confessions." Although some of the worst abuses of the
 past may have ended, it appears that interrogators still
 resort to threats and beatings to obtain detainees'
 "confessions" or collaboration. In the absence of independent
 investigations of these charges, it is difficult to corroborate
 such reports, but the pattern of allegations suggests there is
 at least some truth to them.
 Private international humanitarian organizations have reported
 extremely harsh prison conditions in Albania, including a
 severe forced-labor regime with inadequate food and clothing,
 long-term solitary confinement, cramped cells without room to
 lie down, and unheated, unfurnished cells lacking any sanitary
 facilities. The Burrel prison and Spac and Ballsh labor camps
 have been singled out for special mention in this regard.
 Eye witnesses have reported the exhibition of bodies of dead
 prisoners as a means of intimidating the populace. It is
 impossible to say how widespread this practice may be.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, of Exile
 The Constitution provides that no one may be arrested without
 court or prosecutorial approval or be sentenced to jail
 without a court verdict or for an act which is nct a crime.
 The Criminal Code, however, is explicitly ideological, and has
 been officially characterized as a "weapon in the class
 struggle." The loose formulation of its provisions defining
 political offenses facilitates their broad interpretation by
 the courts.
 The Criminal Code lists 34 crimes, 12 of which are political
 offenses, for which the death sentence may be imposed. Among
 these are such nonviolent political offenses as: unauthorized
 departure or "flight" from Albania, agitation and propaganda
 against the State, creation of a counterrevolutionary
 organization or participation therein, concealment of a person
 who commits a crime against the State, activity against the
 revolutionaTy movement of the working class, and refusal to
 carry out a duty or coercing others to refuse. The Criminal
 Code also provides that banishment (generally to a state farm
 or enterprise) or internment may be administratively imposed,
 without trial, for up to 5 years on persons whom the
 authorities consider a threat to the social system and on the
 families of fugitives. There are numerous reports that
 families of escapees from Albania have been imprisoned as a
 deterrent to other potential illegal emigrants. In its 1985
 Report (covering the year 1984), Amnesty International notes a
 number of such cases in recent years, but another source
 claims that close relatives of recent escapees are no longer
 interned.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system in Albania includes the Supreme Court and
 regional and district courts. Like all organs of government
 and state authority, it appears to be under the total control
 
 
 911
 ALBANIA
 of the Albanian Party of Labor. There is virtually no chance
 a court would render an independent verdict in conflict with
 the wishes or policies of the political authorities.
 Reports of the number of persons in prison range from 4,000 to
 40,000, including 300 members of the pre-World War II elite,
 as well as pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese, and other political
 prisoners. Many persons are serving sentences for expressing
 dissatisfaction with conditions in Albania or for trying to
 flee the country. Amnesty International reports that it has
 the names of almost 400 political prisoners held in Albania
 during the 1970's and 1980's, but it believes this is only a
 fraction of the true figure. Former political prisoners
 report that about 1,200 political prisoners each were being
 held in Ballsh and Spac labor camps during the early 1980's.
 Some 300 more were imprisoned at Burrel, and others were held
 in Tarovic, Kosove, and Tirana prisons. Although the last
 amnesty was approved on November 15, 1982 (Albania's national
 day), there is no independent confirmation of the number of
 persons amnestied, and there are reports of further political
 arrests since then.
 Amnesty International reports that political detainees lack
 legal safeguards during both pretrial investigations and trial
 proceedings. By law, investigations into crimes against the
 State must be completed within 3 months, but extensions may be
 easily obtained and no effective maximum period of
 investigation is enforced. Most investigations into political
 offenses have been completed within 3 to 4 months, but Amnesty
 International charges that some investigations have dragged on
 up to 13 months. Political detainees have been held under
 harsh conditions for up to 6 months in solitary confinement
 during pretrial investigations without access to lawyers or
 relatives. The Criminal Code provides that accused persons
 must be informed when investigation of their cases is
 concluded and allowed to examine all the evidence to be
 brought against them. Usually, however, they are not allowed
 to examine all the materials and are shown only copies of the
 indictments. In sum, there do not appear to be any effective
 controls on the powers of those in charge of investigations in
 political cases.
 Defendants at political trials have usually been denied
 defense counsel and have had to conduct their own defense.
 Major political trials of state officials are closed when it
 suits the purposes of the regime, but most political trials of
 ordinary citizens are held in open court. Most such trials
 last no more than 1 day, and there are no known acquittals of
 political defendants.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution proclaims the inviolability of the home and
 the privacy of correspondence but at the same time provides
 that these and other civil rights are subordinate to the
 "general interest" and may not be exercised in opposition to
 the Communist system. It is generally accepted that the
 authorities can and do violate the privacy of the home
 whenever and to the extent necessary to achieve their ends.
 The Government uses its pervasive informer network to report
 on, among other things, the private lives of its citizens.
 Children are taught to report on their parents' activities in
 the home, such as whether they practice religion or speak
 
 
 912
 ALBANIA
 against the Government. Contact with the outside world is
 carefully monitored. Members of the Greek minority who have
 escaped report that they had difficulty while in Albania in
 receiving mail or telephone calls from relatives in Greece.
 Packages of food, medicine, and clothing sent to them were
 returned by Albanian authorities to Greece without their
 knowledge.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Albanian Constitution states that citizens enjoy
 freedom of speech and press, it provides that these rights may
 not be exercised in opposition to the Communist system.
 Consequently, the Government has imposed rigid restrictions on
 freedom of speech and press. The government-controlled press
 never criticizes the leadership or its policies, and any
 citizen who does so publicly is subject to swift and severe
 reprisals under Article 55. In the past, persons found
 listening to foreign radio broadcasts or having unauthorized
 contacts with foreigners have been reprimanded or jailed,
 although there is some indication that these restrictions may
 have been relaxed lately. Information from abroad is
 carefully controlled. Art and literature are deemed to be
 weapons of revolutionary change and are subject to rigid state
 control and censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The security apparatus deals severely with group activities
 that do not have government sanction or that might appear to
 be in opposition to the leadership. There are no independent
 associations or organizations.
 Nearly all Albanians belong to trade unions that are part of
 the United Trade Unions of Albania, an arm of the party. The
 unions have no significant voice in the field of labor
 relations. Their assigned tasks include raising productivity,
 indoctrinating and propagandizing the workers, maintaining
 labor discipline, and organizing periods of so-called
 "voluntary" manual labor in which all Albanians are expected
 to take part. In practice, workers have no rights independent
 of the wishes of the State.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religious activity in Albnaia is expressly prohibited by
 the Constitution and by government policy. Historically about
 70 percent of all Albanians were Muslim, nearly 20 percent
 were Orthodox, and a little more than 10 percent were Roman
 Catholic. However, in 1967 the Government proclaimed Albania
 the first atheist State in the world, abrogated all laws
 dealing with church-state relations, and began an active
 campaign to eradicate all vestiges of religion. More than
 2,100 mosques, churches, monasteries, and other institutions
 were closed, their fixed assets seized without compensation by
 the authorities, and many religious leaders persecuted,
 imprisoned, or even executed for continuing their religious
 functions. All religious literature was banned, as were any
 personal manifestation of religious belief or practice.
 The authorities continue to suppress religious activity by
 threatening harsh penalties for believers who practice their
 
 
 913
 ALBANIA
 faith and by obliging citizens to inform on believers.
 Nevertheless, there have been some signs, beginning in 1982,
 that the regime was quietly toning down its shrill
 antireligious campaign as it tried to improve relations with
 Italy, Greece, and Turkey. There has been, however, no
 official assertion that religious practice is once again
 allowed. Despite years of antireligious pressure, it is
 reported that some Albanians have continued to practice their
 faith in the privacy of their own homes, particularly in
 villages and in more remote mountainous areas. Tourists have
 also reported seeing Muslim Albanians faithfully kneeling in
 prayer along roadsides with apparent impunity.
 In November 1983, the Vatican publicly condemned religious
 persecution in Albania and claimed that a number of priests,
 members of holy orders, and seminarians had died in prison.
 It also reported that two priests had been executed for
 baptizing children. The official press denies that believers
 have been persecuted, and maintains that religious belief is
 opposed only by argument.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution does not guarantee freedom of movement.
 Movement within the country and travel abroad are controlled
 very strictly, and those who violate the laws are severely
 punished. The Criminal Code states that flight from the State
 or refusal to return to the fatherland on the part of a person
 sent abroad on service or allowed to leave the State is
 considered "treason" and punishable by imprisonment for not
 less than 10 years or by death. Despite this, Albanians
 continue to risk their lives to cross the heavily guarded
 border into Greece and Yugoslavia. Albanians reportedly are
 allowed to leave the country legally only on official business
 or, very rarely, for family reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 No such right exists in theory or in practice in Albania. The
 State is ruled by a totalitarian dictatorship, headed by Ramiz
 Alia in his capacity as First Secretary of the Albanian Party
 of Labor (APL) and Chairman of the Presidium of the People's
 Assembly. The Constitution establishes the APL as the sole
 political entity and Marxism-Leninism as the only political
 ideology. The APL is governed internally by the principle of
 "democratic centralism" under which decisionmaking power is
 concentrated in the hands of a small elite. Any attempt by
 individual citizens, or even by ordinary party members, to
 criticize policy or change the form of government or its
 leaders is dealt with severely.
 The Constitution provides that the People's Assembly
 (unicameral parliament) is the supreme organ of national
 government in Albania, and similar bodies, people's councils,
 exist at the local level. Candidates for these assemblies are
 first indicated by the party and then "elected" without
 opposition by universal suffrage. During the last quadrennial
 election for the People's Assembly in 1982, the Government
 announced that 100 percent of eligible voters had participated
 and that the official slate of candidates had been elected
 with only one negative vote from the entire electorate.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government denies any violations of human rights and
 refuses to cooperate with any investigation of allegations to
 the contrary, including one by the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission during 1985. Amnesty International's 1985 report
 detailed numerous concerns about the human rights situation in
 Albania: imprisonment of prisoners of conscience; lack of
 legal safeguards for political detainees; allegations of
 ill-treatment of detainees; and harsh prison conditions.
 Freedom House rated Albania as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 With a population of about 2,960,000 and limited natural
 resources, Albania is the poorest country in Europe. Per
 capita gross annual income is estimated to be about $850
 according to the best available figures. Albania has the
 least amount of arable land per capita in Europe and the
 youngest, fastest growing population on the continent,
 increasing at an annual rate of 2 percent (four times the
 European average). In view of the country's poor resource
 base and the Government's self-imposed isolation, including
 its refusal to accept foreign credits (which are forbidden
 under the 1976 Constitution) to finance trade transactions,
 the leadership has achieved significant economic development
 since World War II.
 Albania has a centrally controlled, command economy, under
 which the State owns the means of production. Despite the
 Government's policy emphasis on rapid industrialization, the
 economy remains based largely on agriculture and the
 production of raw materials, especially minerals.
 Food supply is generally adequate, and there are no reports of
 chronic food shortages or rationing. The population receives
 more than the minimum daily per capita caloric intake (119
 percent of the minimum), but it is one of the lowest in
 Europe. Life expectancy is estimated at 71.75 years, and the
 infant mortality rate is about 40 per 1,000 births. Nearly
 all children are educated, but the overall literacy rate for
 all ages is estimated at about 75 percent. Housing costs are
 low, but there is a chronic housing shortage, particularly for
 young couples.
 The Constitution states that women shall enjoy "equal rights
 ,with men. in work, pay, holidays, social security, education,
 in all social-political activity, as well as in the family."
 Information on the extent to which these rights are exercised
 is not available, but there are indications that the regime
 has advanced the status of women. Women are said to
 participate equally in the obligatory labor and military
 service programs. There are several women in the party and
 government leadership.
