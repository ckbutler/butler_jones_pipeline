 CAMBODIA
 Control of Cambodia has been contested since January 1979 when
 tne Vietnamese army drove the Khmer Rouge Communist regime of
 Democratic Kampuchea out of Phnom Penh and installed its own
 puppet regime, the People's Republic of Kampuchea under a
 former Khmer Rouge division commander, Heng Samrin. Vietnam
 maintains its control over most of Cambodia, including all
 major cities and towns, by force of arms. The fundamental
 source of most human rights abuses in Cambodia at the present
 time is the occupation of the country by at least ten
 Vietnamese army infantry divisions and associated supporting
 units which maintain the Heng Samrin regime and its leader in
 power. However, this control is challenged by a three-part
 Knmer resistance movement, the Coalition Government of
 Democratic Kampuchea , which maintains base areas in that part
 of Cambodia close to the Thai border and which holds
 Cambodia's seat at the United Nations.
 Since 1979, Vietnam has attempted to develop political and
 economic institutions following the Vietnamese model in the
 areas under its control. Power is restricted to the
 Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, which is dominated by
 the Communist Party of Vietnam. Vietnam seeks popular support
 for the Heng Samrin regime and acceptance of its own military
 occupation by highlighting the brutality of the former Khmer
 Rouge regime and warning that the Khmer Rouge would return to
 power if Vietnamese troops left Cambodia. However, despite
 fear of the Khmer Rouge, Vietnamese domination of Cambodia is
 unpopular, and Hanoi's client regime is maintained through
 Vietnamese armed force.
 The Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea opposing
 Vietnamese domination of Cambodia and contesting the authority
 of the Heng Samrin regime was formed in 1982 when two
 non-Communist resistance groups joined the Khmer Rouge, which
 now has perhaps 35,000 armed men. While in power from 1975 to
 1979 the Khmer Rouge compiled one of the worst records of
 human rights violations in history in a thorough and brutal
 attempt at restructuring Khmer society and individual
 personality. The number of Khmer who died as a result of the
 Khmer Rouge policies may have been over a million. Since
 being overthrown by Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge claim to have
 abandoned their radical ideology and policies. They are
 attempting to gain the following of the Khmer people by
 support for traditional institutions such as Buddhism and by
 publicizing their links with the popular former ruler, Prince
 Sihanouk. The Khmer Rouge formally dissolved the Communist
 Party of Kampuchea in 1981. However, the Khmer Rouge top
 leadership under Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan remains
 unchanged, as does their brutal treatment of opponents.
 The Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) with
 approximately 15,000 men under arms, is the larger of the two
 non-Communist resistance groups. It is led by former Prime
 Minister Son Sann and espouses parliamentary ideals of
 government. It was formed in 1980 with the merger of several
 existing non-Communist resistance groups, many led by former
 soldiers from the period of the pre-1975 Khmer Republic.
 The third group in the coalition is the National United Front
 for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative
 Cambodia, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who ruled as
 hereditary king and later head of state until 1970. The
 
 
 722
 CAMBODIA
 appeal of this organization centers on the Prince's
 international stature and his popularity within Cambodia. The
 Sihanoukist National Army has approximately 8,000 armed
 soldiers.
 Cambodia's economy is based on subsistence-level agriculture.
 In theory, all land is owned by the state, and the Heng Samrin
 regime is attempting to impose a collective economic system in
 Cambodia. In practice, however, lack of planning and
 administrative capacity have resulted in continued reliance on
 decentralized agricultural production in which rudimentary
 forms of collectives or individual family groups are the main
 units of production.
 Light industry had begun to develop in Cambodia by 1970, but
 civil war, invasion, and the Khmer Rouge destroyed most of the
 industrial infrastructure. After six years of Vietnamese
 control, Cambodian industry remains of marginal importance.
 Light industry consists of approximately 80 factories
 employing 50,000 workers. Most other non-agricultural
 employment is in small family-run services or handicrafts.
 During 1984, systematic violations of human rights continued
 in Cambodia, as Vietnam has continued to rely on force to
 maintain its client regime in power against popular will. A
 group from the New York Lawyers Committee for International
 Human Rights visited Cambodia in November 1984. It was not
 permitted to visit Heng Samrin-controlled areas. Its summary
 of findings states that the 'rule of law is not respected in
 any serious sense in the People's Republic of Kampuchea
 (Cambodia). For the hundreds or perhaps thousands of
 political prisoners who inhabit its jails, beatings are
 commonplace and more sophisticated forms of torture usual.'
 The scope and intensity of military and para-military activity
 and associated violence by both Vietnam and the Khmer
 resistance groups have increased. In their fight against the
 Vietnamese, the Khmer Rouge have employed terrorist tactics
 against Khmer civilians, including murder and destruction of
 economic resources. Indications of deliberate starvation of
 Vietnamese prisoners held by the Khmer Rouge also became
 available in 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reports of political killing in the Vietnamese-controlled
 areas of Cambodia declined after an intensive Vietnamese/Heng
 Samrin internal security campaign against suspected opponents
 in the middle of 1983. Khmer resistance groups continue to
 report instances of Vietnamese and Heng Samrin officials
 killing suspects during interrogations, but this has not been
 confirmed by independent sources. In 1984, U.S. Government
 specialists in chemical warfare investigated a number of
 reports of the use of lethal chemical or biological agents by
 the Vietnamese against the Khmer resistance. However, no
 proof of such use during this period was developed from these
 investigations.
 
 
 723
 CAMBODIA
 The Khmer Rouge increased the use of terrorist tactics during
 1984. In addition to attacks on Heng Samrin or Vietnamese
 armed forces, civilian officials and common citizens have been
 killed. Khmer arrivals on the Thai/Cambodian border reported
 that in early September the Khmer Rouge stopped a train from
 Phnom Penh to Kompong Som and killed many of the civilian
 passengers. In November 1983, eight Soviet agricultural
 experts were reportedly taken from a bus and killed by the
 Khmer Rouge.
 Summary executions have been reported in non-Communist
 controlled areas for offenses against military discipline such
 as unauthorized selling of weapons.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been reports from Phnom Penh that Heng Samrin
 security officals have been responsible for the disappearances
 of persons suspected of being opponents of the regime.
 Although most of those who have disappeared apparently have
 been imprisoned, others reportedly have been executed.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Physical torture has been reported both from rural areas and
 from Phnom Penh prisons. The Lawyers Committee for
 International Human Rights reports from its November 1984
 visit that persons suspected of resistance activity are
 'routinely tortured' in the early weeks of detention by
 Vietnamese and Heng Samrin officials. Beatings during
 interrogation to uncover resistance sympathizers are the most
 common form of torture.   There have also been reports of
 suffocation with plastic bags, burning with boiling water,
 deprivation of food and sleep, and degrading treatment such as
 removing clothing during interrogation. Psychological
 pressures such as the threat of indefinite confinement without
 trial are employed during interrogation. Khmer resistance
 organizations have charged that techniques such as hanging
 suspects upside down are also used by Vietnamese and Heng
 Samrin military and internal security services.
 Conditions in prisons in the Heng Samrin areas are harsh. An
 inmate at the T3 central prison in Phnom Penh from September
 1980 to January 1983 reported that he was kept shackled in a
 dark cell for six months and given a subsistence diet of corn
 and wheat. After 1981, he reported, the prison diet improved
 to about 500 grams of rice per person per day, supplemented by
 fishbroth mixed with bindweed. He said malnutrition and
 dysentery were common, resulting in occasional deaths of
 prisoners. Prisoners slept on a concrete floor. No medical
 care was provided, according to this source.
 Little information is available about treatment of prisoners
 in areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge. However, a number of
 Vietnamese prisoners who had been in Khmer Rouge hands ended
 up in Thailand following Vietnamese attacks on Khmer Rouge
 bases in early 1984. Press photographs of the Vietnamese
 indicated that they were close to starvation. In contrast,
 treatment of Vietnamese and Heng Samrin prisoners by the
 non-Communist resistance groups has been generally good.
 
 
 724
 CAMBODIA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Suspected resistance sympathizers are detained, interrogated
 and often jailed for extended periods of time with neither
 formal charges nor other legal procedure. Regulations of the
 Heng Samrin regime call for the arrest and "reeducation' of
 'any person carrying out propaganda campaigns to sabotage
 internal unity and Kampuchea-Laos-Vietnam solidarity.' Such
 .reeducation' means indefinite detention to force a change in
 political values. The 1984 Amnesty International Report
 expressed concern about the detention without trial of persons
 suspected of anti-regime activities.
 Approximately 700 supporters of the pro-Sihanouk resistance
 group were captured by the Vietnamese army during an attack on
 the Sihanoukist base at O-Smach in April 1983. These
 individuals were confined for interrogations and political
 indoctrination for several months before being released.
 Although living conditions were harsh, there were no reports
 of torture or other forms of unusual punishment during this
 confinement.
 During 1984 the Heng Samrin regime instituted a formal program
 of amnesty and resettlement for resistance members who
 surrender. This program includes a period of political
 rehabilitation. No information has become available on the
 implementation of this program.
 In Vietnamese-controlled areas, forced labor is common.
 According to refugee accounts, the Vietnamese have
 systematically conscripted thousands of Khmer civilians from
 throughout Cambodia for work on military-related projects in
 or near combat areas along the Thai-Cambodian border. Their
 forced participation places their lives at risk when
 Vietnamese or resistance military actions occur nearby. The
 Khmer Rouge also require labor from individuals under their
 control and prevent them from leaving, either to return to
 areas controlled by the Vietnamese or to join the
 non-Communist Khmer resistance groups.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Political prisoners under the Heng Samrin regime are regularly
 denied the right to a trial. There are no reliable figures on
 the numbers of political prisoners in Cambodia.
 The Heng Samrin regime has reestablished courts and begun to
 develop a legal system. However, little information is
 available about trials. There have been only a few instances
 where trials have been reported, and details of customary
 court procedure are not available. In general, the formal
 legal system is not an important part of the Heng Samrin
 regime structure. Arrivals on the border have little
 knowledge of the workings of the Heng Samrin legal system,
 either in theory or practice.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Heng Samrin authorities search whenever and wherever they
 wish. Networks of informers report to the secret police, and
 Vietnamese personnel are assigned to monitor all levels of the
 Heng Samrin internal security apparatus. Vietnamese and Heng
 
 
 725
 CAMBODIA
 Samrin authorities have forced people to relocate into
 fortified villages or 'strategic hamlets' in order to prevent
 contact with resistance forces.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In Vietnamese-controlled areas the press and radio are wholly
 controlled by Hanoi and its client regime. Criticism of the
 regime is not tolerated, nor are foreign books and periodicals
 admitted, except those officially distributed. There have
 been reports of arrests for listening to foreign radio
 broadcasts. A similar situation exists in the Khmer Rouge
 areas. Foreign publications are permitted to enter freely
 into non-Communist areas.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only associations permitted in Heng Samrin areas are those
 created by the regime for groups such as farmers, women, and
 youth. Organized labor is totally under the regime's control,
 and industries have organized branches of the official Trade
 Union for National Salvation. The Khmer Rouge do not have
 associations or trade unions. The non-Communist groups
 encourage women's associations which have both educational and
 social functions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 When in power in Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge disestablished
 Buddhism as the state religion. They defrocked some 70,000
 monks, forcing many to marry and all to labor, and turned
 pagodas into warehouses. Since being driven from power, the
 Khmer Rouge have tried to give the impression of reform. In
 1983 a foreign journalist traveling with the Khmer Rouge
 within Cambodia photographed Khmer Rouge soldiers paying their
 respects to Buddhist monks. However, defectors from the Khmer
 Rouge zone in 1984 continued to report that Buddhism is
 discouraged by Khmer Rouge authorities. Christianity and
 Islam were even more ruthlessly suppressed by the Khmer Rouge
 when they controlled the country and are not known to have
 been revived in Khmer Rouge zones since.
 The Heng Samrin regime has permitted the return of religious
 practices but has not reinstated Buddhism as a state
 religion. At the second Buddhist monks' conference in Phnom
 Penh on July 4, 1984, a resolution was passed which dedicated
 Buddhism to the 'two strategic tasks of the party--namely, to
 defend the fatherland and build it through the period of
 transition step-by-step toward socialism." In general the
 Heng Samrin authorities attempt to use Buddhism as one of a
 number of organizations for *mass mobilization,* to implement
 party policies. Christian groups are harassed by the Heng
 Samrin regime. The Protestant and Roman Catholic communities
 in Phnom Penh are reportedly not authorized to meet. Muslims,
 most of whom are ethnic Chams rather than Khmer, have been
 encouraged by the Heng Samrin regime to renew their religious
 community, and Muslims have spoken out in public in support of
 the Heng Samrin regime and against the excesses of the former
 Khmer Rouge regime.
 Non-Communist resistance camps afford freedom of religion.
 
 
 726
 CAMBODIA
 Both Buddhist and Islamic places of worship exist in most
 non-Communist camps.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Heng Samrin regime tries to control tightly all travel
 within the areas under its control. Passes are required for
 internal movement between villages. Checkpoints are
 ubiquitous, and bribes as well as passes are required to pass
 them, although checkpoints can often be dodged by avoiding
 roads. A system of neighborhood surveillance, modeled after
 the Vietnamese system, was introduced in 1981. Nevertheless,
 thousands of Khmer continue to move around inside the country
 and to the Thai border to trade, look for family members, or
 join the resistance. Only top Heng Samrin officials travel
 abroad. Other Khmer seeking to leave the country flee to the
 border where many try to enter Thailand. The Heng Samrin
 regime has agreed in principle to accept refugees back from
 camps in Thailand but has taken only a handful so far because
 it has put off reaching an agreement with the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees on the mechanics of
 repatriation. Thousands of Khmer have returned informally to
 Cambodia from the Thai Border. Many of the 45,000 Khmer still
 in holding centers in Thailand have already been approved for
 resettlement in Western countries.
 The Khmer Rouge also tightly control movement within their.
 zones and attempt to prevent the non-Communists from operating
 in or crossing what they consider their "liberated areas.' In
 one 1984 instance, a group of approximately 500 Khmer escaped
 from Khmer Rouge control and joined a non-Communist group.
 The Khmer Rouge and the non-Communist groups have accepted
 people back from refugee camps in Thailand.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The fundamental right of self-determination is denied to the
 Khmer people. The Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, a
 Communist party of probably fewer than 1,000 members and
 directed by a very small group of leaders, controls political
 life in the Heng Samrin regime areas. Major policies are
 established by Vietnam and many day-to-day administrative
 decisions, especially in internal security matters, are made
 unilaterally by Vietnamese officials. Both Hanoi and Phnom
 Penh have rejected any change in the system imposed following
 the Vietnamese invasion, calling the situation "irreversible.'
 Political aspirants in Heng Samrin areas must study the
 current political dogma, which centers on acceptance of the
 Vietnamese explanation for Hanoi's dominant position in
 Cambodia. Miqdle- and high-level Heng Samrin officials must
 attend political indoctrination courses taught by Vietnamese
 at political schools in Phnom Penh and in Vietnam. Relatively
 few Heng Samrin officials are considered reliable by the
 Vietnamese. Khmer loyal to Hanoi prior to 1975 are afforded
 the highest positions of trust, followed by pre-1978 defectors
 from the Khmer Rouge, other former Khmer Rouge cadre,
 non-political "intellectuals' (including many pre-1975 school
 teachers), and low-ranking officials of pre-1975 governments,
 in that order. While attempting to build an indigenous party
 and government structure in Cambodia, Vietnam itself maintains
 
 
 727
 CAMBODIA
 complete control. Elections in Heng Samrin areas do not allow
 genuine political participation but rather are staged by the
 regime to demonstrate legitimacy through voter activity, and
 to underscore the relative status of leaders by varying
 percentages of the 'vote.' Reports suggest that in the 1981
 national elections, percentages were "rigged,* and some
 victors were named regardless of the number of votes they
 received. Vietnamese district level advisors were reliably
 reported to have picked candidates for lower level elections.
 The next national election is scheduled for 1986.
 The Khmer Rouge Communist Party of Kampuchea was formally
 dissolved in December 1981, but it continues in Khmer Rouge
 areas as a clandestine entity. In fact, the party, in which
 power is concentrated in the hands of fewer than 10 people,
 controls all political, economic, and military life in those
 areas. No opposition is possible. Defectors from the Khmer
 Rouge areas in 1984 reported that power continues to be held
 by the pre-1979 leadership.
 The non-Communist political fronts are less disciplined and
 control their areas more loosely.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights violations in Cambodia have been the subject of
 intense international attention since 1978, when the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission and its Subcommisson on the
 Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities
 began investigating the problem when Cambodia was ruled by the
 Khmer Rouge. In February, 1984 the Commission adopted the
 latest in a series of resolutions on Cambodia. The 1984
 resolution noted the increasing effectiveness of the
 resistance coalition with Prince Sihanouk as President of
 Democratic Kampuchea, reiterated its "condemnation of
 persistent occurrence of gross and flagrant violations of
 human rights in Cambodia," and reaffirmed "that the continuing
 occupation of Cambodia by foreign forces deprives the people
 of Cambodia from exercise of their right to self-determination
 and constitutes the primary violation of human rights in
 Cambodia at present." The Amnesty International 1984 Report
 expressed concern about reports of the detention without trial
 of persons opposing the policies of the Heng Samrin regime,
 reported conditions in the Phnom Penh central prison, and the
 1983 arrests in Siep Reap-Oddar Meanchay province. Freedom
 House considers Cambodia "not free* and , in its 1983-84
 report, assigned its lowest ratings, with the observation that
 "Cambodians continue to be one of the world's most tyrannized
 peoples." Authorities in the Heng Samrin and Khmer
 Rouge-controlled areas have not permitted investigation of
 charges of human rights violations. The Heng Samrin regime
 declined to permit the New York Lawyers Committee For
 International Human Rights to visit areas it controls. The
 Heng Samrin regime and the Khmer Rouge areas have Red Cross
 organizations, but neither they nor any other groups in those
 areas have a role in the protection of human rights.
 The non-Communist camps along the Thai/Cambodian border have
 substantial daytime presence of voluntary and international
 organization staff who have intervened to secure better
 treatment of minorities, such as Vietnamese refugees. The New
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 47
 
 
 728
 CAMBODIA
 York Lawyers' Committee For International Human Rights visited
 two non-Communist areas during its November trip.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 After years of fighting within Cambodia, statistics about the
 economic, social, and cultural situation are unreliable. The
 population in 1984 is estimated to be 6.1 million, close to
 the 1962 census figure o$ 5,729,000, with a growth rate of 2.1
 percent. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 44.2
 years. The Heng Samrin regime has tried to restore some parts
 of the traditional cultur , reversing Khmer Rouge efforts to
 completely restructure the society and remold individual
 personality. The regime has promoted traditional music and
 dance and has reopened many primary schools and selected
 university faculties, such as medicine and dentistry. It
 claims a total primary and secondary school population of 1.8
 million.
 Cambodia is now, even more than before 1970, an agricultural
 country. Earlier trends toward urbanization were reversed
 when the Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire urban
 population in 1975 with great hardship and loss of life.
 Since the Vietnamese invasion, urbanization has resumed, but
 many of the former city people, including Chinese merchants,
 died during the Khmer Rouge years or have since fled abroad.
 Khmer peasants have entered Phnom Penh in search of food and
 work. The embryonic Khmer enterpreneurial class faces
 overwhelming competition from Vietnamese who have flowed into
 commercial activities in market towns through'eastern Cambodia
 and in Phnom Penh itself.
 There have been reports of Vietnamese taking advantage of
 their privileged status to force Khmer out of desirable
 occupations or land. Khmer arriving on the border in 1984
 reported that newly instituted commercial taxes in the cities
 are driving out Khmer and Chinese merchants whose places are
 being taken by Vietnamese who are able to avoid taxation. In
 1982, the Heng Samrin regime issued party and government
 directives facilitating Vietnamese settlement in Cambodia.
 The Heng Samrin regime has claimed that only 56,000 Vietnamese
 have settled in Cambodia, while Mr. Willibald Pahr, former
 Austrian Foreign Minister and President of the International
 Conference on Kampuchea, estimated 500,000 as a minimum
 figure. Resistance groups have reported the total to be as
 high as 700,000, and they believe a calculated policy of
 "Vietnamization' is being pursued. Reports from border
 travelers indicate that many new Vietnamese have moved into
 Camuodia to join returning residents who had fled or been
 expelled during the Khmer Republic or Khmer Rouge periods.
 Most are traders or fishermen, but beginning in late 1981 a
 large group of Vietnamese farmers settled on rich marshland in
 Takeo Province.
 In rural areas, the Heng Samrin regime has instituted a system
 of agricultural collectivization to till the larger rice
 fields. Heng Samrin officials claim that 90 percent of Khmer
 peasants have been organized into more than 100,000 *solidarity
 production' teams. The Constitution permits families to
 occupy a small plot on which a house and garden exist. Other
 land is farmed collectively, although in practice most farm
 production is still on an individual family basis. Forced
 labor was a regular feature of rural life in Cambodia under
 
 
 729
 CAMBODIA
 the Khmer Rouge and remains common under the Heng Samrin
 regime. Some reports indicate that the scale of such corvee
 labor on Vietnamese military projects increased significantly
 in 1984.
 By 1984 there were reports that Vietnamese were increasingly
 dominating the fishing industry, especially on the Mekong
 River and the Tonle Sap. As a result of overfishing and
 exports to Vietnam of at least 17,000 tons, there has been a
 reported decline in the availability of fish protein.
 The health, medicine and nutrition deficiencies of recent
 years are only slowly being overcome. An inadequate number of
 Khmer medical personnel at all levels has been supplemented by
 foreign medical teams. Foreign teams from non-Communist
 countries are increasingly restricted to Phnom Penh and other
 cities in eastern Cambodia. Despite the presence of these
 teams and a reportedly large number of Vietnamese health
 cadre, medical care even in the best hospitals in Cambodia is
 not adequate. Most Khmer have no access to medical care at
 all. Cambodia is subject to many kinds of tropical diseases
 and to an especially virulent strain of malaria. Preventive
 measures for mosquito-borne diseases no longer exist. The
 emergency relief needs that led to the massive international
 food relief operation beginning in 1979 have been essentially
 fulfilled. Nevertheless, the nutritional situation remains
 precarious. In the most severe food deficit provinces of the
 country, up to 60 percent of children under 13 years old are
 reported to suffer from moderate or severe malnutrition.
