 CAPE VERDE
 Led by President Aristides Pereira, Cape Verde is ruled by the
 African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV), the
 country's sole political party. Most government Ministers are
 senior members of the party and participated in the
 revolutionary movement to free Cape Verde from Portuguese
 rule. Active party members currently number 6,000, or 4
 percent of the voting population. The Constitution adopted in
 1980 declares the supremacy of the party. Members of the
 Popular National Assembly are elected from a slate of
 candidates which is proposed to the electorate by the party.
 Security responsibilities, which had been divided among the
 military, the security, and the police forces, were given to a
 single government department in February 1986. The
 reorganized Ministry of Defense and Security operates under
 legal guidelines and leadership approved by the party.
 The Cape Verde archipelago (10 islands) is located some 380
 miles off the African mainland. The country's economic
 development has been steady despite an 18-year drought which
 has severely affected employment possibilities for the largely
 rural population. This progress can be largely attributed to
 generous foreign donor assistance, remittances from Cape
 Verdean emigrants, and efficient management by the
 Government. The Government is the largest nonagricultural
 employer. It also controls banking, the import of basic
 commodities, airlines, the press, and schools. Private
 property rights are respected. There is a substantial and
 growing private sector which includes various types of shops,
 hotels, farms, fishing, small industries such as tuna canning,
 and the professions.
 Human rights were generally respected in Cape Verde during
 1986. There were no reports of political killings,
 disappearance, torture, or arbitrary arrest. Within the
 one-party system elections at the end of 1985 provided an
 opportunity for some expanded participation in the political
 process by all persons over 18 years of age. There is little
 sign of hostile opposition to the Government, and the
 longstanding Cape Verdean tradition of emigration provides an
 escape valve for discontent.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported instances of politically motivated
 deaths.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported instances of officially inspired
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports alleging torture or cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment and unusual punishment of prisoners and
 detainees. However, conditions in prisons are poor and
 detention facilities are antiquated.

 CAPE VERDE
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Cape Verdean law requires that those arrested, unless caught
 in the act, be charged before a judge within 48 hours, and
 this law appears to be observed in practice. In exceptional
 cases, and then only with the concurrence of a procurator or
 judge, the formal charge process may be delayed up to 5 days.
 Cape Verdean law requires counsel to be present for the
 accused, who then may be held in custody, released on bail, or
 released unconditionally. In cases of alleged crimes against
 state security, persons may be detained upon a judge's ruling
 for up to 5 months without trial. There is a functioning
 system of bail, and the right of access to a lawyer seems to
 be observed in practice.
 There were no instances of forced exile for political or other
 reasons. Forced labor is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There were no known political prisoners held in Cape Verde
 during 1986.
 In the regular court system, trials are conducted without jury
 by one judge; a public prosecutor presents the case against an
 accused, who is defended by counsel. Appeal is possible to
 Sub-Regional and Regional Tribunals and, ultimately, to the
 Supreme Tribunal. Trials appear to be handled expeditiously.
 The Autonomous Institute for Judiciary Support, to which all
 private lawyers belong, exists to provide counsel in cases of
 need.
 There is also a system of popular tribunals to ajudicate minor
 disputes on a neighborhood or local level in rural areas.
 The"judges" are usually prominent local citizens without legal
 training, who are appointees of the Ministry of Justice.
 Their decisions can be appealed within the regular court
 system.
 The judiciary does not have the authority to determine the
 constitutionality of legislation. Although, according to the
 Constitution, judges are independent, one former judge now
 living outside the country has claimed that one-party rule in
 practice has hampered the functioning of a truly independent
 judiciary. Most evidence suggests, however, that the courts
 protect individual rights in criminal cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution recognizes citizens' rights to the
 inviolability of domicile, correspondence, and other private
 means of communication. The law requires warrants issued by a
 judge before searches of homes may be conducted. There were
 no known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy, family,
 home, or correspondence. The Constitution also contains a
 provision stating that every citizen has the right and the
 duty to participate in the political, economic, and cultural
 life of the country. This provision theoretically could be
 used to force participation in activities against the
 individual's will. In practice, there is no evidence to
 suggest that this provision has been so used.

 CAPE VERDE
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:'
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution proclaims freedom of speech and intellectual
 creativity, including the rights of authorship, but it also
 stipulates that none of these rights and freedoms may be
 exercised "contrary to national unity." Thus, a law adopted
 in 1985 assures citizens the right to express their thoughts
 in the press, but at the same time the party underlined that
 this right should be exercised responsibly. Given the
 circumstances, people are generally cautious in exercising
 their right of free speech.
 The weekly newspaper and the radio are government owned, and
 follow government policies. Occasional articles critical of
 some aspects of government policy are printed or broadcast,
 but this is probably done with prior authorization from the
 Government. Local radio broadcasts carry items from Western
 agencies as well as from Communist countries. International
 periodicals generally circulate freely in Cape Verde even when
 they contain articles critical of or unflattering to the
 Government, as is sometimes the case with Portuguese
 newspapers. International radio broadcasts are received
 clearly, without interference. Censorship of movies is
 practiced, although it is not known if the criteria are
 political or moral. The Catholic Church's newspaper, which
 occasionally carries moderate criticism of some aspects of
 life in Cape Verde,* seems to be tolerated without interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to meet, to associate freely, and to demonstrate
 is guaranteed in the Constitution. As a practical matter,
 however, no organizations opposed to government actions or
 policies are permitted. Private associations other than
 sports clubs or religious youth groups do not exist. The
 establishment of such associations would be subject to
 government authorization. Party-sponsored "mass
 organizations" of women and youth are prominent.
 Workers in several sectors are organized into unions which are
 members of the National Union Confederation (NUC). The
 Confederation is affiliated with the PAICV and headed by a
 high-ranking member of the party. Perhaps one-third of the
 active work force are nominal union members. Although the NUC
 claims to be independent of the party, the two are closely
 linked. Individual unions bargain for their members, perform
 other traditional trade union functions, and also act as party
 affiliates. The right to strike is guaranteed but is rarely
 exercised, even though union leadership has taken positions on
 specific issues opposed to government policies in state
 enterprises. The NUC participates in the International Labor
 Organization and is affiliated with the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity, but has not taken positions
 independent of those officially sanctioned by the Government.
 It maintains contact and receives assistance from both
 Communist and non-Communist national unions abroad.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution requires separation of church and state.
 Freedom of worship is respected by the Government, and members
 
 
 51
 CAPE VERDE
 of all faiths practice their religion without harassment. At
 least two-thirds of the population, probably including most of
 the government leadership, are nominally Catholic, but the
 dominance of Catholicism does not appear to affect adversely
 other faiths. Evangelical Protestants and Seventh Day
 Adventists are the two other principal religious communities.
 At least two faiths, the Baha'i and Christian Rationalism,
 which were formally banned or suppressed under the Portuguese,
 have been permitted to reestablish themselves since
 independence. There are no restrictions on religious
 practices, teaching, or contacts with coreligionists outside
 Cape Verde. A few foreign missionaries are active in Cape
 Verde.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no extraordinary legal or administrative
 restrictions on either travel or residence within the
 country. All resident Cape Verdeans wishing to leave the
 country, either temporarily or permanently, must obtain exit
 permission from the Government. Such permission has not been
 denied for political reasons. Emigration has long been an
 important and a recognized escape valve from prevailing harsh
 economic conditions. The Government goes to considerable
 effort to maintain close contact with emigre communities and
 provides every opportunity for Cape Verdeans living abroad to
 maintain their ties with the homeland, including making
 provision for them to vote in elections and to own propery in
 Cape Verde. Repatriation is a constitutional right of the
 citizen, and the Government does not discourage intending
 repatriates.
 The law allows for revocation of citizenship on several
 grounds, including activities contrary to the interest of the
 country. However, there are no known cases of the Government
 instituting proceedings to deprive persons of citizenship for
 political reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The PAICV's monopoly of power in Cape Verde is inscribed in
 the Constitution. Opposition parties are illegal and, in
 fact, do not exist. The small group of men who actually led
 the struggle for independence occupy positions of leadership
 in both the party and the Government. The Secretary General
 of the party is President of the Republic; the Deputy
 Secretary General is Prime Minister; and the third-ranking
 party official is President of the National Assembly. Five
 others of the party's nine-member Political Commission are
 also Ministers; the ninth member manages the day-to-day
 activities of the party.
 In 1983 there were 5,860 party members, about 4 percent of the
 total population, which represented a doubling of party
 membership since independence in 1975. Within this elitist
 party, there exists a modest scope for meaningful political
 activity. The delegates to the Second Party Congress in 1983,
 and the leadership itself, were elected by secret ballot with
 some unexpected changes in the order of precedence of the
 various Ministers. The party leadership has also made an
 obvious effort to give women and individuals possessing less
 solid revolutionary credentials more prominent roles.
 
 
 52
 CAPE VERDE
 However, women, who constitute 14 percent of the total party
 membership, are underrepresented. The party membership is
 also young (47 percent under 30 years of age),
 disproportionately urban (50 percent in a nation which is more
 than two-thirds rural), and heavily representative of the
 bureaucracy (25 percent of party members are civil servants or
 employees of state enterprises).
 Formally, the National Assembly is the supreme organ of the
 Government. The Assembly sessions serve to ratify earlier
 party/government decisions, but issues are debated openly,
 with critical interventions reported in the media. Deputies
 who believe that the interests of their constituencies are
 being harmed by government policies or decisions feel free to
 criticize them, and in fact do so. In the Assembly elections
 of December 1985, the party approved all candidates, but the
 list of candidates for each constituency contained from 1-1/2
 to 4 times as many nominees as the number of deputies to be
 elected from that constituency. There were three stages of
 local consultations, and the final candidates were selected by
 secret ballot. Several prominent nonparty candidates were
 elected to the Assembly as a result.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In the past, the Government has permitted visits by private
 organizations to check on conditions of persons convicted for
 political or related offenses. There are no known instances
 in which the Government has been the subject of resolutions,
 investigations, or other human rights actions by international
 human rights organizations. A few Cape Verdean emigrants
 living abroad have alleged human rights violations. These
 charges may have affected internal policies, given the
 Government's major effort to maintain close relations with the
 large communities of Cape Verdean emigrants around the world.
 There are no known official or nongovernmental human rights
 organizations in the country, although the Lawyers'
 Association for the Provision of Judicial Support performs
 some of the functions of such an organization.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Racial discrimination is not a problem in Cape Verde, where
 the vast majority of the total population of 300,000 shares
 various proportions of Portuguese-African ancestry. Sex
 discrimination exists, although it is banned by the
 Constitution. Many of the traditional, male-oriented values
 of the Portuguese and African ancestors of today's Cape
 Verdeans are still part of the country's culture. Women have
 been customarily excluded from certain types of work and are
 often paid less than men forcomparable work. However, the
 Government has included women in the labor-intensive economic
 development projects financed by foreign grants. Both the
 Government and the party are making efforts to bring women
 into various economic and social activities from which they
 traditionally have been excluded. The Organization of Cape
 Verdean Women was founded in 1980, with party encouragement,
 to sensitize the Government and Cape Verdeans in general to
 issues affecting women.

 CAPE VERDE
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Code of the Family, enacted in October, 1981, prescribes
 the full legal equality of men and women, including equal pay
 for equal work. Minimum wages are established by government
 decree. As of January 1, 1986, the minimum age for civil
 servants (the basis for minimum wages for all other forms of
 nonrural employment) is approximately $72 per month. In rural
 areas, the daily minimum for the least skilled types of labor
 is about 83 cents. The minimum age for employment is 14, and
 children under 16 are prohibited from working at night, more
 than 7 hours per day, or in establishments where toxic
 products are used. There does not appear to be an overall
 safety and health code for the workplace, although there are
 particular regulations such as those prohibiting the
 employment of children where toxic products are used. The
 normal work week for adults is 44 hours over 5 1/2 days. A
 worker is entitled to at least one full day (24 hours) of
 leisure per week. These regulations seem to be respected in
 practice.
