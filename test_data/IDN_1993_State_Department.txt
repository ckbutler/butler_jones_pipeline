 INDONESIA
 Despite a surface adherence to democratic forms, the Indonesian political system
 remains strongly authoritarian. President Soeharto, now in his sixth 5-year term,
 dominates the Government. The President, a small group of advisors, and the mili-
 tary dominate the political, economic, and social life of this heavily populated and
 disparate nation. The Government requires allegiance to a state ideology, known as
 "Pancasilan, which includes belief in a supreme God, a just and civilized humanity,
 national unity, democracy, and social justice.
 The military justifies its role in political and social issues, including an automatic
 unelected presence in national and local parliaments, through a "dual function" con-
 cept pving it special civic rights and responsibilities in addition to its defense and
 security roles. The armed forces, including 165,000 police, total about 445,000 and
 regard their primary role aa maintaining internal security. They act quickly to sup-
 press what they regard as threats to security, whether separatist movements, crimi-
 nal acts, or alleged subversive activity. The validity of this "security approach,"
 which often leads to human rights abuses, was again the subject of open debate in
 1993. Security forces continued operations against separatist groups in Aceh, Irian
 Jaya, and East Timor. The police also continued to use excessive force in apprehend-
 ing suspected criminals.
 contrast to its restrictive political system, Indonesia has an increasingly de-
 regulated and dynamic economy which has produced significant material gains for
 a wide segment of Indonesian society. Indonesia nevertheless remains a poor coun-
 try. Agriculture and extractive industries, especially oil and gas, remained impor-
 tant sectors of the economy. But a broad and expanding manufacturing sector ac-
 counted for a growing percentage of exports. Gross domestic product growth for 1993
 was expected to be 6.] percent, and inflation appeared under control. Corruption
 and influene peddling are endemic and continued to distort the economy.
 Although progress was made in a number of human rights areas, serious abuses
 continued. In East Timr, where largely cosmetic changes in the force structure re-
 suited in minimal reductions in troop presence, no significantprogress was noted
 in the search for the a-ut 60 persons still missing from the November 12, 1991,
 shooting incident in Dil. Extrajudicial arrests and detention, torture of those in cus-
 tody, and excessively violent techniques for dealing with suspected criminals or per-
 ceived troublemakers continued in many areasof Indonesia. Legal safeguards
 against arbitrary arrest and detention are frequently ignored. The armed forces con-
 tinued to be responsible for the most serious human rights abuses. The current mili-
 tary leadership in several specific instances showed a greater willingness to admit
 misconduct publicly and take action against offenders, although such steps contin-
 ued to be relatively rare. The judiciary remained largely shackled by the executive
 branch and military, although progress was made in the area of judicial review.
 Widespread corruption in the legal system continued to be a serious problem.
 The year 1993 saw a bolder and more assertive press, which suffered less official
 censorship and which was less willing to submit itself to self-censorship; a liberal-
 ized public dialog on human rights; the selection late in the year of members for
 a National Human Rights Commission, although its autonomy remains in question;
 and a sharp reduction in the number of Indonesians forbidden from traveling
 abroad. Fewer Indonesians were tried under the harsh and arbitrary antisubversion
 law, and several long-term convicted subversives were released. The Government
 maintained its open Lnd humane policies toward Indochinese refugees.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-Political or extrajudicial killings
 occur most often in areas where separatist movements are active and when law en-
 forcement is involved. Punishments for security force members who commit
 extrajudicial killings seldom correspond to the crimes committed. All police and mili-
 tary personnel tried for killing or mistreating prisoners, or for any other criminal
 activity, are tried by military courts; the sentences, when imposed, are rarely heavy.
 Security forces often employ harsh measures against separatist movements (espe-
 ciaily in East Timor, Irian Jaya and Aceh), including extrajudicial killings of civil-
 ians. In 1993, however, while occasional clashes were reported between separatist
 groups and security forces in these areas, confirmed killings of civilians by govern-
 ment or vigilante forces continued to be far lower than in the recent past. The Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) judged the situation in Irian Jaya im-
 proved to the point where it no longer needed an office in Jayapura and couldcover
 that province adequately from Jakarta. The ICRC is, however, seeking to open an
 
 
 639
 office in Aceh because it judges the situation there serious enough to warrant a con-
 stant presence in the province. While accepting responsibility for the military shoot-
 ing of civilians in Dill, East Timor, on November 12, 1991, the Government made
 little progress in accounting for those missing in the incident (see Section 1.b.). The
 Government has not officially acknowledged or accounted for thousands of civilians
 killed during military operations against separatist guerrillas in Aceh during 1989-
 91.
 The armed forces made several public pledges in 1993 to reduce by stages the
 number of troops in East Timor a move expected to reduce tensions and the inci-
 dence of human rights abuses. The first pullout of two battalions was to take place
 in October, although by early December the status of this pullout was not clear. In
 April the Special Operational Military Command for East Timor was disbanded and
 replaced with a command structure similar to that in the other 26 provinces. The
 composition of troops was reportedly changed to emphasize civic action over combat
 missions, although civic action troops also carry weapons and conduct patrols. De-
 spite these changes, most sources in East Timor continued to report an oppressive
 military presence throughout the province.
 In law enforcement, excessive force is sometimes employed in apprehending sus-
 pects or coping with alleged criminals. In Jakarta, for example, police continued to
 employ deadly force against suspects who reportedly were fleeing or resisting arrest,
 killing 13 in January 1993 alone. Human rights monitors estimated between 60 and
 70 people had been shot by police in the  ae end of the year, although
 exact statistics were not available. In the province of North Sumatra, a policy of
 shooting criminal subjects in the legs, sometimes repeatedly, continued. rss ac-
 counts indicate that t      earl December police in North Sumatra had shot 74
 suspects, 8 fatally, who were allegedly resisting arrest. Human rights groups pro-
 tested that the methods used are unjustifiably harsh and violate due process. Police
 have generally asserted that those killed were dangerous criminals, and have denied
 a repetition of the officially sponsored "mysterious killings" of the mid-1980's di-
 rected against criminal elements. In a few instances, official action was initiated
 against police for using excessive force. Press accounts indicate that five policemen
 were detained in June in North Sumatra in connection with the death of Syamsul
 Bahri, who was shot earlier that month while allegedly resisting arrest.
 A military court in Medan began hearing testimony in August against a police-
 man who went to a house where a dispute was under way and shot a suspect in
 the head when he tried to surrender. The policeman was charged with murder. Au-
 thorities declined to reveal the disposition of this case.
 Four members of a religious sect were shot dead and a dozen others wounded by
 police in late July in West Java. The police began shooting after members of the
 sect attacked two policemen with farm implements, killing one and wounding the
 other. The policemen were attacked after they approached the sect's compound seek-
 ing to arrest two members for a previous assault. The sect and its leader, who was
 killed in the attack, had rejected contacts with the outside world. Various religious
 leaders condemned the attack as excessively violent and urged security forces to ex-
 ercise greater restraint. Several of the sect's survivors were tried and convicted on
 assault charges and received sentences of between 3 and 12 months.
 Four persons, including a 55-year-old woman and a teenage boy, died in Septem-
 ber when security forces opened fire on a demonstration in Madura, East Java. The
 demonstrators were villagers protesting the construction of a dam, who had raised
 their concerns over the project without success at several meetings with local offi-
 cials a few days before. Security forces initially reported the crowd, which numbered
 some 500, had acted in a threatening manner and continued to advance on them,
 despite several warning shots fired by the troops. Human rights groups decried the
 use of what they called excessive force and conducted their own investigation, which
 found no evidence of warning shots and placed the demonstrators at a considerably
 greater distance from security forces. Armed Forces Commander Feisal Tanjung in
 mid-October publicly acknowledged a breakdown in military discipline had occurred.
 He relieved the commanders of the police and army units involved, and remanded
 the two dozen military and police personnel involved to Armed Forces headquarters
 for possible further disciplinary action. No criminal proceedings had been initiated
 against them by year's end.
 A 24-year-old labor activist, Marsinah, was murdered in May in East Java shortly
 after leading a labor action at the factory where she worked. Nine civilian employ-
 ees of the company were arrested in October in connection with her murder, and
 trials were begun in November. At least one Army officer was also arrested and a
 second relieved of his post, although the status of their cases was unclear in early
 December. Testimony and press stories alleged collusion existed between company
 
 
 640
 officials and security forces in Marsinah's abduction and murder. Security forces
 often intrude in labor matters and intimidate labor activists (see Section 6).
 b. Disappearance.-In general, politically motivated abductions are not common in
 Indonesia. Security forces in areas with active guerrilla insurgencies often hold sus-
 pects for long priods without formal charges, but these cases usually end with offi-
 cial acknowledgement of detention (see Section 1.d.). The Government vigorously
 prosecuted a case against an official of the Democratic Party of Indonesia, (PDI),
 the smallest of the three allowed political groupings, who was accused of kidnaping
 members of a rival pE:,rty faction in 1991. The trial, however, was widely regarded
 as an effort to undermine the PDI leadership, and the accused party official was
 subsequently acquitted. A labor activist was abducted and killed in East Java after
 leading a strike at the watch factory where she worked (see Section l.a.).
 Government efforts to account for the missing and dead from the November 12,
 1991, military shooting of civilians in Dii East Tinior, remained inadeguate. In
 April military officials in East Timor turned over to a representative of Asia Watch
 a list of 66 names of people they believed were still missing from the incident. Since
 then, various officials have claimed that a handful of these people have been located
 alive, having hidden from authorities since the incident. In a related case, authori-
 ties claimed that two of four Timorese who sought asylum in the Swedish Embassy
 in Jakarta in June were among the missing from the Dili incident, although the
 names of the two Timorese were not on the military's list. Government spokesmen
 broadly implied that their failure to locate those missing was primarily due to the
 success of those persons in evading detection. Many knowledgeable observers, how-
 ever, continued to believe that most of the missing are dead and that the military
 knows where their bodies are.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is against the law in Indonesia. In practice, while the situation has im-
 proved in recent years, torture and other forms of mistreatment remain widespread,
 and legal protections are both inadequate and widely ignored. The Criminal Proce-
 dures Code (KUHAP) provides that statements from witnesses or suspects must be
 elicited without pressure of any" kind, and establishes pretrial procedures to give
 suspects or their families the nght to challenge the legality of an arrest or deten-
 tion. The Indonesian Criminal Code (KUHP) makes it a crime punishable by up to
 4 years in prison for any official to use violence or force to elicit a confession.
 Nonetheless, torture continues, with the highest incidence occurring in cases
 which are judged to affect national security such as those involving areas of separat-
 ist activity. According to the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, methods of tor-
 ture include electrocution; slashing with razor blades and knives (including inside
 of the mouth); beating on the head, shins, and torso with fists, batons, iron bars,
 bottles, rocks, and lengths of electric cable; sexual molestation and rape; kicking
 with heavy military boots; burning with lighted cigarettes; threats and deliberate
 wounding with firearms; immersion for long periods in fetid water; isolation and
 sleep deprivation. Use of torture is particularIy frequent in Aceh. Reliable reports
 suggest that a majority of Acehnese still held in 1993 in connection with the Aceh
 Merdeka (Free Aceh) movement had undergone some form of torture at some time
 during their incarceration. An Acehnese parliamentarian convicted of subversion in
 July, Haji Usman Mohammed Al, claimed during his trial he was beaten during
 his interrogation and fored to sign statements incriminating himself. Several of the
 witnesses called to testify in the trial of East Timor separatist leader Jose "Xanana
 Gusmao were also  rl     eported to have been mistreated while in custody.
 Police often resort to physical abuses even in minor incidents, and prison condi-
 tions are harsh, with violence among prisoners and mistreatment of inmates by
 guards reportedly common. However, the incidence of mistreatment by pnison offi-
 cials drops sharply once a prisoner has been transferred from police or military cus-
 tody into the civilian prison system, and prison conditions generally have improved
 in recent years. Officials have publicly condemned police brutality and harsh prison
 conditions and occasionally instigate disciplinary action, including transfer, dismis-
 sal, and trials leading to prison, but such actions are an exception to the rule of
 general impunity.
 Political prisoners are usually mixed with the general prison population, although
 in the Cipinang prison in Jakarta high- profile political prisoners are held together
 in a segregated area. In 1993 the I   an  several foreign parliamentary delega-
 tions were allowed to visit prisoners in Cipinang in Jakarta and described the facil-
 ity as Spartan but adequate. The ICRC was also granted access to other prisons in
 Java, Sumatra, East Timor, Aceh, and other provinces, although it suspended prison
 visits in Aceh and East Timor at various times when itet authorities were violat-
 ing agreed-upon terms for the visits. These disagreements were all eventually set-
 tled, and the visits resumed.
 
 
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Criminal Procedures Code contains
 protections against arbitrary arrest and detention which are routinely violated in
 practice. The code specifies the right of prisoners to notify their families. Warrants
 must be produced during an arrest except under specified onditions, such as when
 a suspect is caught in the act of committing a crime. Warrants are issued by police
 investigators to assist in their investigations or if sufficient evidence exists that a
 crime has been committed. Despite these requirements, arrests are often made with-
 out warrants, such as in the Marsinah murder case in which several suspects were
 held for 18 days without warrants or notification of their families.
 Defendants are p resumed innocent and may be granted bail. They or their fami-
 lies may also challenge the legality of their arrest and detention in a pretrial hear-
 ing and are entitled to sue for compensation if wrongfully detained. The code also
 contains specific limits on periods of pretrial detention and specifies when the courts
 must get involved to approve extensions, usually after 60 days.
 In areas where there are active guerrilla movements such as East Timor and
 Aceh, people are routinely detained without warrants, charges, or court proceedings.
 Bail is rarely granted, especially in political cases. The authorities frequently inter-
 fere with access to defense counsel. Extensions of periods of detention are routinely
 approved. Pretrial proceedings are rarely initiated. In addition, suspects charged
 under the 1963 Antisubversion Law are subject to special procedures outside the
 Criminal Procedures Code which allow, for example, the Attorney General on his
 own authority to hold a suspect up to a year before trial. This 1-year period is re-
 newable without limit. Special laws on corruption, economic crimes, and narcotics
 are similarly exempt from the code's protections. The Agency for Coordination of As-
 sistance for the Consolidation of National Security (BAKORSTANAS) operates out-
 side the code and has wide discretion to detain and interrogate persons thought to
 threaten national security.
 National estimates on the number of arbitrary arrests or detentions without trial
 are not available. In Aceh 73 people accused of being members of Aceh Merdeka
 were released without charges or trials in 1993 after periods of detention that some-
 times exceeded 2 years. Added to those released in 1991 and 1992, some 906 persons
 had been held, often incommunicado and without knowing the charges against
 them, in connection with the 1989-91 Aceh insurgency. Many of those released were
 required to report back to the authorities at regular intervals. Some 100 Acehnese
 were believed to be awaiting trial at year's end.
 In East Timor military authorities continued the practice of detaining people
 without charges for short periods and then requiring them to report daily or wee ly
 to police after their release. There were credible reports of scores of people being
 detained without charges at various times during the year for enforced civics train-
 ing" in areas outside the capital of Dili. This particularly occurred during the visits
 ofhigh profile guests, such as the April visit to East Timor of the U.N. Secretary
 General's Special Envoy, Amos Wako, and the August-September visits of two U.S.
 Congressional staff delegations. Two former leaders of the armed East Timor resist-
 ance, Jose "Mauhudu" da Costa and Antonio Gomes '"lauhunu" da Costa, remained
 under tight military control in 1993 although charges had not been formally filed
 against either man. Mauhudu was arrested in January 1992 and Mauhunu in April
 1993. They were in East Timor in August-September 1993 making speeches on the
 merits of integration with Indonesia. Despite public announcements that they had
 been granted an "amnesty" and were therefore "free," they were required to spend
 each night at the home of military officers.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is subordinate to the executive and
 the military, and procedural protections, including those against coerced confessions,
 are inadequate to ensure a fair trial in many cases. A quadripartite judiciary of gen-
 eral, religious, military, and administrative courts exists below the Supreme Court.
 The right of appeal from district court to high court to Supreme Court exists in all
 four systems of justice. The Supreme Court, with a current backlog variously esti-
 mated at 13,000 to 17,000 cases, does not consider factual aspects of a case, only
 the lower courts' application of law. Initial judgments are rarely reversed in the ap-
 peals process, although sentences are sometimes increased or reduced. A three-judge
 panel conducts trials at the district court level, poses questions, hears evidence, de-
 cides guilt or innocence, and assesses punishment.
 Defendants have the right to confront witnesses. An exception is allowed in cases
 where distance or expense is deemed excessive for transporting witnesses to court,
 in which case sworn affidavits may be introduced. In cases tried under the 1963
 Antisubversion Law, trials in absentia are permitted, and an Acehnese accused of
 separatist activities, Dharma Bakti, was condemned to death in absentia April 6.
 The use in trials of forced confessions and limitations on the presentation of de-
 fense evidence is common. The defense in the subversion trial of Haji Usman Mo-
 
 
 642
 hammed Ali, for example, claimed that witnesses it tried to call were too afraid of
 retribution by the authorities to testify on his behalf. The defense attorneys in the
 case of two students tried in Semarang, Central Java, noted that while the prosecu-
 tion called 15 witnesses, a defense motion to call 8 was rejected by the judges, who
 said they had the right to be selective in who could testify. One defense witness was
 eventually allowed. Defendants do not have the right to remain silent and in several
 cases in 1993 were compelled to testify in their own trials.
 The Criminal Procedures Code gives defendants the right to an attorney from the
 moment of their arrest through the investigation and trial. In capital cases and
 those involving a prison sentence of 15 years or more, a lawyer must be appointed.
 In cases involving potential sentences of 5 years or more a lawyer must be ap-
 pointed if the accused desires an attorney but is indigent. Destitute defendants can
 obtain private legal help, such as that provided by the Legal Aid Institute (LBH).
 In practice, however, defendants are often persuaded not to hire an attorney, or ac-
 cess to an attorney of their choice is impeded. East Timor separatist leader Jose
 "Xanana" Gusmao, for example stated in his final defense statement that his efforts
 to engage an attorney from L]IH were thwarted by authorities, who "forced" him
 to hire an attorney known to the police. In the trial of Haji Usman Mohammed Ali
 the defendant did not meet his Legal Aid Institute attorney until the day his trial
 began.
 The judiciary is not independent. The Supreme Court does not have the right of
 judicial review over laws passed by Parliament. Although the Supreme Court has
 since 1985 had the power to review ministerial decrees and regulations, the court
 has not yet used this power. Chief Justice Purwoto Gandasubrata in early 1993 laid
 out procedures under which limited judicial review cases could be brought to the
 court, a move that was hailed as a significant step toward greater judicial independ-
 ence. While judges receive guidance from the Supreme Court on legal matters, they
 are civil servants employed by the executive branch which controls their assign-
 ments, pay, and promotion. They are subject to considerable pressure from military
 and other governmental authorities. Such control often determines the outcome of
 a case. The Chief Judge of the State Administrative Court in Medan, for example,
 issued a restraining order in January 1993 against the military commander in
 Medan after the commander intervened in the leadership struggle of the Batak
 Protestant Church (HKBP) (see Section 2.c.). The commander publicly criticized the
 judge, whose home was vandalized shortly after he handed down his decision. A few
 days later the judge was suddenly told he had been assigned to attend a 2-week
 legal workshop far from Medan. While he was gone, his deputy took over the case
 and vacated the restraining order.
 Corruption permeates the Indonesian legal system. In civil and criminal cases, the
 payment of bribes can influence prosecution, conviction, and sentencing. Public un-
 rest concerning the implementation of a new traffic law with stiffer fines was partly
 driven by fears that police, many of whom are poorly paid, would be even more ag-
 gressive in demanding bribes from motorists. Vanous public officials have cam-
 p aigned against corruption by police and judicial officials, but public respect for the
 ea system remainedlow.
 The 1963 Antisubversion Law, which carries a maximum penalty of death, re-
 mained a focus of legal concerns in 1993, although the number of cases prosecuted
 under the law dropped sharply. The law makes it a crime to engage in acts that
 could distort, undermine, or deviate from the state ideology or broad outlines of
 state policy, or which could disseminate feelings of hostility or arouse hostility, dis-
 turbances or anxiety among the population. It has been attacked as excessively
 vague and harsh, and inappropriate to Indonesia's current level of stability and de-
 velopment. While the law continued to be defended by public officials such as the
 Attorney General, the Government showed greater discretion in its application. For
 example, Fretilin leader Jose "Xanana" Gusmao was charged under felony statutes
 of the criminal code rather than under the Antisubversion Law. Sentences in several
 of at least eight subversion trials held in 1993-six of them in connection with Aceh
 Merdeka-were far lighter than in the past.
 The most prominent political trial of 1993 was that of East Timor resistance lead-
 er Jose "Xanana" Gusmao, who was charged under felony statutes with attacking
 the Indonesian State, leading a rebellion, and illegal possession of firearms for his
 role in leading the armed East Timorese resistance. Authorities allowed access to
 his trial in Dili by a wide range of observers, including diplomatic missions, foreign
 and Indonesian journalists, and foreign human rights organizations such as the
 International Commission of Jurists and Asia Watch. Although Gusmao may not
 have freely chosen his defense attorney (see above), he was represented by an able
 group of lawyers who conducted a vigorous defense and had frequent access to their
 client. Nonetheless, the trial's conduct appeared to violate several provisions of the
 
 
 643
 Criminal Procedures Code and to many observers did not meet international stand-
 ards for a fair trial. For example, many of the witnesses who testified against him
 were themselves in custody, and their testimony was either hearsay or possibly co-
 erced. Gusmao was prevented from reading aloud his own defense statement on the
 grounds it was irrelevant to the charges against him, even though the Criminal Pro-
 cedures Code places no such limits on the contents of a defendant's final statement.
 Access to the trial by outside observers was briefly restricted toward its end when
 Gusmao became less cooperative. Gusmao was found guilty and sentenced to life in
 prison. He subsequently asked for and was granted Presidential clemency, which re-
 duced his sentence to 20 years. On August 12, he was transferred at his request
 from Dili, East Timor. At year's end he was in Cipinang prison in Jakarta.
 The Government does not make available statistics on the number of people cur-
 rently serving subversion sentences or sentences under the felony hate-sowing or se-
 dition laws. Informed estimates of the number of people serving sentences for sub-
 version in 1993, including members of the banned Communist Party of Indonesia
 (PKI) Muslim extremists, and those convicted of subversion in Irian Jaya, Aceh
 and East Timor were about 300. Scores, and possibly hundreds, more were believed
 to be serving sentences under felony hate-sowing or sedition laws. At least some of
 these persons advocated or employed violence, but many are political prisoners who
 were convicted for attempting to exercise such universally recognized human rights
 as freedom of speech or association or who were convicted in manifestly unfair
 trials. Several persons convicted of subversion were granted early releases in August
 and September, including Islamic preacher A.M. Fatwa, who was convicted and sen-
 tenced to 18 years in 1985 for allegedly instigating the 1984 riot in Tanjung Priok.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Judicial
 warrants for searches are required except for cases involving suspected subversion,
 economic crimes, and corruption. However, forced or surreptitious entry by security
 agencies occurs regularly. Security agelcies intimidate by conducting surveillance of
 persons and residences and selectively monitoring local and international telephone
 calls without legal restraint. Government security officials monitor the movements
 and activities of former members of the PKI and its front organizations, especially
 persons the Government believes were involved in the abortive 1965 Communist-
 acked coup. The Government stated in late 1990 that this latter group then totaled
 1,410,333 people. These persons and their relatives sometimes are subject to surveil-
 lance, required check-ins, periodic indoctrination, and restrictions on travel outside
 their city of residence. Their legally required identification cards carry the initials
 "e.t." which stand for "ex-tapol, or former political prisoner, which readily identifies
 them to prospective employers or government officials. For the first time, various
 groups in 1993 made public pleas to end these official and unofficial restrictions on
 former political prisoners.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-A significant increase in the amount ard qual-
 ity of public debate on sensitive issues occurred in 1993. Think tanks, newspapers,
 and academic institutions mounted seminars on a wide range of previously taboo
 topics such as human rights and democracy. The printed media in particular pub-
 lished factual stories and editorials reflecting a wide range of opinions, many of
 them critical of the Government. These improvements in the print media, including
 the nation's 273 daily newspapers which are largely privately owned, came despite
 continued government controls over publishing permits, the amount of advertising
 permitted, and the number of pages allowed in newspapers. While the practice of
 telephoning editors to caution against publishing certain stories continued-the so-
 called telephone culture-its incidence was sharply lower. Self-censorship, however,
 continued to be a publicly acknowledged brake on free expression. Military authori-
 ties continued in some cases to issue orders to local journalists on what they could
 print. Journalists in East Timor, for example, were instructed in March not to re-
 port details of an outburst in favor of East Timorese independence by a witness in
 the trial of resistance leader Jose "Xanana" Gusmao. Also in March, Medan news-
 papers were told they needed prior military approval to report on developments in
 the Batak Protestant Church leadership struggle (see Section 2.c.).
 While public dialog was generally more open, the Government still imposed exces-
 sive restrictions on free speech. For example, in contrast to a generally more permis-
 sive attitude toward public demonstrations, police reacted harshly in breaking up
 a peaceful demonstration on December 14 at the Parliament, arresting 21 people
 and injuring more than a dozen in the process. The 21 were charged with hate sow-
 ing and insulting the President and were still in custody at year's end. Two students
 arrested prior to the June 1992 parliamentary elections for criticizing the election
 process and advocating the casting of blank ballots or staying away from the polls
 
 
 644
 were brought to trial in Semarang on charges of insulting and sowing hatred
 against the Government (see Section i.e.). The distribution of a September edition
 of the Far Eastern Economic Review that carried a story about the trial was delayed
 nearly 2 weeks. The students were found guilt in  ovember and sentenced to 4
 months in prison.
 Human rights monitor Adnan Buyung Nasution was blocked by university au-
 thorities from addressing a seminar in early December at the University of Indo-
 nesia, as was the outspoken poet W.S. Rendra. A prominent Muslim intellectual,
 Arief Budimanz was barred from appearing in June at a conference on the disabled
 in Surakarta, dentral ,Java, and a well-known poet, Emha Ainun Najib, was banned
 by authorities from performing in the same city in May, ostensibly because they
 posed thrats to security.
 _The electronic media remained far more cautious than the printed media. The
 Government operates the nationwide television network, which in Jakarta and Su-
 rabaya includes a second channel. Private and educational television companies
 broadlcasting in Jakarta and Surabaya continued to expand to other areas. Some
 586 private radio broadcasting companies exist in Indonesia in addition to the Goev-
 ernent's national radio network. New regulations were promulgated in 1993 that
 will allow private radio stations greater latitude in producing their own news pro-
 grams.
 Foreign television and radio broadcasts are readily accessible to those who can af-
 ford the technology, and satellite dishes have sprouted all over the archipelago. No
 efforts are made to restrict access to this programming.
 The Government closely regulates access to Indonesia, particularly to certain
 areas of the country, by visiting and resident foreign corres vondents, and occasion-
 ally reminds the latter of its prerogative to deny requests for visa extensions. For-
 eiin journalists, for example were unable to get permission to visit East Timor
 pror to the February start of the trial of resistance leader Jose "Xanana" Gusmao,
 and several requests were denied after the trial ended in May. The importation of
 foreign publications and video tapes, which must be reviewed by government con-
 sfors, requires apermit. Importers sometimes avoid foreign materials critical of the
 Government or dealing with topics considered sensitive, such as human rights. For-
 eign publications are normally available, although several issues were delayed or
 embargoed in 1993 when they carried sensitive stories, especially those dealing with
 the business activities of the President's famil4.
 While academic freedom is provided for in aw,
 of scholars. They sometimes refrain from producing materials that they believe
 might provoke government displeasure. Publishers are sometimes unwilling to ac-
 cept manuscripts dealing with controversial issues, although a number of books on
 controversial topics were published in 1993, such as human rights activist Adnan
 Buyung Nasution's revisionist look at Indonesia's early experiment with representa-
 tive democracy. The Attorney General banned at least seven books in 1993, most
 dealing with religious to p ic.
 b. Freedom of Peacefu[Assembly and As ciation.-Freedom of assembly and asso-
 ciation are recognized by the Constitution. Nonetheless, significant controls are
 placed on citizens who attempt to exercise this freedom. All organizations must have
 government permission to hold regional and national meetings. Local jurisdictions
 often require prior approval for smaller gatherings as well. While obtaining such ap-
 lreval is fairry automatic, the authorities occasionally withhold permission. The
 Government did not permit the Indonesian Workers Welfare Union (SBSI) to hold
 its July 29 annual congress (see Section 6.a.). On August 12, Surabaya police re-
 fused a permit for the Surabaya Arts Council to open an art exhibit and ~poetry
 reading celebrating the life and memory of a murdered labor activist (see Section
 l.a.). Student gatherings have often been the target of disapprovals, and political
 activity at universities, while no longer formally banned, remained tightly con-
 The 1985 Social Organizations Law (ORMAS) requires all organizations, including
 recognized religions and associations, to adhere to the Government's official ideology
 of Pancasila. This provision, which limits political activity, is widely understood as
 being designed to inhibit activities of groups which seek to make Indonesia an Is-
 lamic state. The law empowers the Government to disband any organization it be-
 lieves to be acting against Pancasila and requires prior government approval for any
 organization's acceptance of funds from foreign donors, hinering the work of many
 local humanitarian organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Consttiton provides for religious freedom and belief
 in one supreme God. The Government recognizes Islam, Christianity, Buddhism,
 and Hinduism, and permits practice of the mystical, traditional beliefs of 'Aliran
 Keperayaan." Although the population is overwhelmingly Muslim, the practice and
 
 
 645
 teachings of the other recognized faiths are generally respected. Various restrictions
 on certain types of religious activity exist.
 Accordin to official statistics, nearly 400 "misleading religious cults" are banned,
 including Jehovah's Witnesses and Baa'i. West Java authorities banned an Islamic
 sect in late July after a violent confrontation with police that left five dead (see Sec-
 tion l.a.). Because the first tenet of Pancasila is belief in a supreme being, atheism
 is forbidden. The legal requirement to adhere to Pancasila extends to all religious
 and secular organizations. The Government strongly opposes Muslim groups which
 advocate establishing an Islamic state or acknowledging only Islamic law.
 In December 1992, the Northern Sumatra regional mil itary commander inter-
 vened in an internal leadership dispute within the Huria Kristen Batak Protestan
 (HKBP), Indonesia's largest Protestant church. Citing the failure of church members
 to agree on a new bishop at a church conference the month before and the possibil-
 ity that the church dispute could affect public order, the military commander named
 an interim bishop to replace the incumbent, whose 5-year term was due to end in
 February 1993. Although the Government stated the military became involved only
 after a request from the church's Central Leadership Council, past criticism of the
 Government by the former bishop may have been a factor. The military intervention
 sparked demonstrations in several cities, and some 150 church members were de-
 tained in January. On several occasions security forces assisted supporters of the
 new leadership to take control of church buildings by force. Tensions reached a peak
 in May when some 70 people were detained in Tebing Tinggi, North Sumatra, fol-
 lowing outbreaks of violence between church members. Most were released, but
 trials were expected for the dozen or so still in custody.
 There is no legal bar to conversion between faiths, and conversions occur. How-
 ever, proselytizing by the recognized religions or in areas heavily dominated by one
 recogized religion or another is considered potentially disruptive and is discour-
 aged. Foreign missionary activities are relatively unimpeded, although in East
 Tinor and occasionally elsewhere missionaries have experienced difficulties in re-
 newing residence permits on unspecified "security grunds." Laws and decrees from
 the 1970's limit the number of years foreign missionaries can spend in Indonesia,
 with some extensions granted in remote areas like Irian Jaya. Foreign missionary
 work is subject to the funding stipulations of the ORMAS Law (see Section 2.b.).
 Indonesians practicing the recognized religions maintain active links with coreli-
 gionists inside and outside Indonesia and travel abroad for religious gatherings. The
 Government organizes the annual hajj pilgrimage, and more than 100,000 Indo-
 nesians made it in 1993.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel Emigration and Re-
 patriation.-Though the early part of 1993 the Government drastically reduced the
 number of people barred either from entering or departing Indonesia. From a pub-
 licly announced figure of 8,897 "blacklisted people in January, the total fell to a
 few hundred by Augut. Several prominent human rights figures, including Haji
 J.C..IPrincen, Adnan Buyung Nasution, and General Abdul Harns Nasution were per-
 mitted to travel abroad, and military spokesmen said no one was banned any longer
 from foreign travel for political reasons. Seven East Timorese who had unsucess-
 fully souh aslum at two Western embasies in June were allowed to leave the
 country under ICRC auspices in late December. At the same time the authorities
 banned foreign travel by some 300 Indonesians who had defaulted on loans to state
 banks. A 1992 law designed to regularize travel restrictions appeared responsible
 for the overall reduction in the number of blacklisted persons, although not all its
 provisions were implemented, especially the requirement to notify banned travelers
 in writing and review existing cases every 6 months.
 Restrictions exist on movement by Indonesian and foreign citizens to and within
 parts of Indonesia. Permits to seek work in a new location are required in certain
 areas, primarily to control further population movement to crowded cities. Special
 permits are required to visit certain parts of Irian Jaya. Security checks affecting
 transportation and travel to and within East Timor olcurred sporadically in 1993,
 and curfews in connection with military operations were occasionally imposed.
 Former political detainees, including those associated with the abortive 1965 coup,
 must notify authorities of their movements and may not change their place of resi-
 dence without official permission (see Section 1.f.).
 Indonesia continue dits generous attitude toward Indochinese asylum seekers in
 1993 and continued to carry out its rerponsibilities under the Comprehensive Plan
 of Action. It has granted first asylum to over 145,000 Indochinese asylum seekers
 since 1975 and continued to operate a refugee facility on Galang Island. Screening
 of all asylum seekers was completed in September, and plans were being made to
 repatriate some 8,000 asylum seekers and resettle some 2,000 refugees. The Govern-
 ment stressed that these movements must be handled humanely and in cooperation
 
 
 646
 with international organizations such as the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR). Indonesia also continued its cooperation with the UNHCR and the ICRC
 regarding the return of residents of Irian Jaya who had fled to Papua New Guinea
 during separatist violence in the eastern portion of the province. Acehnese who fled
 to Malaysia during the height of separatist violence in 1990-91 continued to return
 to Aceh. Others continued to seek asylum in Malaysia, including a group who en-
 tered the UNHCR compound in Kuala Lumpur in 1992 claiming their lives would
 be threatened if they returned to Indonesia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government through democratic
 means. Under the Constitution, the highest authority of the state is the 1,000-mem-
 ber People's Consultative Assembly (MPR). It meets quinquennially to elect the
 President and Vice President and set the broad outlines of state policy. Half of its
 members come from the national Parliament, 80 percent of whose members are
 elected. The other half are appointed, giving the Government control of the MPR
 and selection of the President. In March the MPR elected Soeharto to his sixth
 uncontested 5-year term as President. While in theory, the President is subordinate
 to the Assembly, in fact, he and a small group of active duty and retired military
 officers and civilian officials exercise governmental authority.
 The military, under a "dual function" doctrine, is assigned a role in both security
 and sociopolitical affairs. Members of the military are allotted 20 percent of the
 seats in national, provincial, and district parliaments, and occupy numerous key po-
 sitions in the administration. The other 80 percent of national and local parliamen-
 tary seats are filled through elections held every 5 years. All adult citizens are eligi-
 ble to vote, except active duty members of the armed forces, convicted criminals
 serving prison sentences, and some 36,000 former PKI members. Voters choose by
 secret ballot between the three government-approved political organizations, which
 field candidate lists in each electoral district. Those lists must be screened by the
 Agency for Coordination of Assistance for the Consolidation of National Security
 (BAKORSTANAS) (see Section 1.d.), which determines whether candidates were in-
 volved in the abortive 1965 Communist coup or pose other broadly defined security
 risks. Critics charge these screenings are unconstitutional, since there is no way to
 appeal the results, and note that they can be used to eliminate critics of the Govern-
 ment from Parliament.
 Strict rules establish the length of the political campaign, access to electronic
 media schedules for public appearances, and the political symbols that can be used.
 GOLKAR, a government-sponsored organization of diverse functional groups won
 68 percent of the seats in the 1992 elections. Two small political parties, the United
 Development Party and the Democratic Party of Indonesia (PDI), split the remain-
 ing vote. By law all three political organizations must embrace Pancasila, and none
 is considered an opposition pIarty. The leaders of all these organizations are ap-
 proved, if not chosen, by the Government, and their activities are closely scrutinized
 and often guided by government authorities. The Government disrupted the July
 national congress of the PDI in Medan and refused to ratify its reelection of Soerqadi
 as general chairman, helping instead to form an alternate "caretaker" council to
 elect a general chairman. In December the Government finally succumbed to popu-
 lar pressure within the PDI and allowed Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of
 Indonesia's first president, to become the PD's top officer.
 GOLKAR maintains close institutional links with the armed forces and KORPi],
 the nonunion association to which all civil servants automatically belong. Civil serv-
 ants may join any of the political parties with official permission, but most are
 members of GOLKAR. Former members of the PKI and some other banned parties
 may not run for office or be active politically. The 500 members of the national Par-
 liament (DPR) consider bills presented to them by government departments and
 agencies but do not draft laws on their own, although they have the constitutional
 right to do so. The DPR makes technical and occasionally substantive alterations
 to bills it reviews. It remains clearly subordinate to the executive branch.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally ignores calls by domestic human rights groups and ac-
 tivists for investigations of alleged human rights incidents, although the armed
 forces did conduct its own review of the September Madura incident which resulted
 in disciplinary action against four officers. While various domestic organizations and
 persons interested in human rights operate energetically, some human rights mon-
 itors face government harassment such as frequent visits by police or agents from
 
 
 647
 military intelligence, interrogations at police stations, or cancellations of private
 meetings (see Section 2.b.). The Government considers outside investigations of al-
 leged human rights violations to be interference in its internal affairs and empha-
 sizes its belief that linking foreign assistance to human rights observance is unac-
 ceptable.
 Nonetheless, the Government in 1993 showed itself far more receptive to inter-
 national human rights groups and concerns. It hosted along with the United Na-
 tions, an Asia-Pacific workshop on human rights in January, and allowed a rep-
 resentative of Amnesty International (AI) to attend, the first time in 15 years that
 Al was officially allowed to enter Indonesia. A representative of Asia Watch was al-
 lowed to visit Jakarta and East Timor during the trial of Jose "Xanana" Gusmao
 and was given wide access to government and nongovernmental organization (NGO)
 officials. Three different representatives of the International Commission of Jurists
 were also allowed to attend Gusmao's trial. The ICRC continued to operate in East
 Timor, Irian Jaya, and Aceh, and to visit prisoners convicted of participation in the
 abortive, Communist-backed coup in 1965 as well as convicted Muslim extremists.
 Although the ICRC experienced problems in conducting prison visits in May in Aceh
 and in ay and June in East Timor, the problems were resolved for the time being.
 A special envoy of the U.N. Secretary General, Amos Wako, was allowed to visit
 Jakarta and East Timor in April, and other U.N. officials attended sessions of
 Gusmao's trial. Indonesia was a vigorous participant in the June World Conference
 on Human Rights in Vienna and joined the consensus on the concept of the uni-
 versality of human rights. Just prior to the conference, the Government announced
 the formation of a National Human Rights Commission headed by former Supreme
 Court Chief Justice Ali Said. The names of the other commission members were an-
 nounced in December. Although skepticism existed about the commission's inde-
 pendence from the Government, and virtually all the private human rights monitors
 who had been asked to join refused, many of those appointed were viewed by human
 rights activists as credible spokesmen for human rights and democracy.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Although President Soeharto and other officials periodically affirm that
 women are equal to and have the same rights, obligations, and opportunities as men
 under Indonesian law, this is only partly true. Women often find it more difficult
 to exercise their legal rights. For example, in divorce cases women often bear a
 heavier evidentiary burden than men, especially in the Islamic-based family court
 system. Although some Indonesian women enjoy a high degree of economic and so-
 cial freedom and occupy important midlevel positions in the civil service, edu-
 cational institutions, labor organizations, the military, the professions, and private
 business, the overwhelming number of Indonesian women do not experience such so-
 cial and economic freedoms.
 Although women constitute one-quarter of the civil service, they occupy only a
 small fraction of the service's top posts. They make up about 40 percent of the over-
 all work force, with the majority in the rural sector. Despite legal guarantees of
 equal treatment, women seldom receive equal pay for equal work and disproportion-
 ately experience illiteracy, poor health, and inadequate nutrition. There is a com-
 mon belief that women will work for a lower wage, will do work a man would not
 do, and will not complain. Women are often not given the extra salary that is their
 due when they are the head of household. Women workers also have complained of
 being sexually victimized by foremen and factory owners. Although several vol-
 untary, private groups work actively to advance women's legal, economic, social, and
 political rights and claim some success in gaining official cognizance of women's con-
 cerns, traditional attitudes which limit women's aspirations, activities, and status
 undercut state policy in some areas.
 The Indonesian National Police reported 1,341 rape cases for 1991 and 1,356
 cases for 1992. However, women's rights activists believe rape is grossly
 underreported in Indonesia, shame being one of the primary reasons. Some legal ex-
 perts state that if a women does not go immediately to the hospital for a physical
 exam which produces semen or other physical evidence of rape, she will not be able
 to bring charges. Anecdotal evidence also suggests some women fail to report rape
 to police out of fear of being molested again by the police themselves.
 A common belief, even among women of the upper classes, is that women who
 walk alone at night will be perceived as "fair game." Many women go to great
 lengths to avoid being in public alone in the evenings. The danger inherent in re-
 turning home alone in the evenings is acknowledged by government regulations re-
 quiring employers to provide transportation for women workers who are required,
 through either overtime work or shift work, to return home at night. However, this
 
 
 648
 regulation is often honored only in the breach, as are provisions granting women
 maternity and menstrual leave.
 The Government has acknowledged the problem of domestic violence in Indo-
 nesian society, which some say has been aggravated by recent social changes
 brought about by rapid urbanization. However, longstanding traditional beliefs that
 the husband may "teach" or "control" the wife through several means, including vio-
 lence, also contribute to the problem. The Government provides some counseling,
 and several private organizations exist to assist women. Many of these organiza-
 tions focus mainly on reuniting the family rather than on providing protection to
 the women involved. There are no battered women's shelters in Indonesia. Many
 women rely on extended family systems for shelter during cooling-off periods. In
 general, the problem of violence against women remains poorly documented.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by health experts as both
 physically and psychologically dangerous to women's health, is widely practiced in
 Indonesia. In Java it usually occurs within the first year after birth and is per-
 formed either at a hospital or by a local shaman or dukun, especially in rural areas.
 Usually a small section of the tip of the clitoris is cut. Total removal of the clitoris
 is not the objective of the practice, although it does occur if ineptly performed.
 Children.-Indonesia is a signatory of the Convention on the Rights of the Child
 and was on the organizing committee of the World Summit for Children. The United
 Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and NGO's active in child welfare are also ac-
 tive in Indonesia, and UNICEF in particular has praised government efforts to im-
 prove the lives of children through poverty alleviation and improvements in primary
 education, maternity services, and family planning. Law No. 4 of 1979 on children's
 welfare guarantees certain rights to children and defines the responsibility of the
 State and parents to nurture and protect them. Implementing regulations have
 never been developed, however, and the law's provisions have yet to go into effect.
 Although child sexual and other physical abuse is known to occur in Indonesia,
 especially cases of incest between stepfathers and stepdaughters, some experts in
 child care believe its incidence in Indonesia is relatively low. Laws exist which pro-
 tect children from indecent activities, prostitution, and incest, although the Govern-
 ment has made no special enforcement efforts in these areas.
 Indigenous People.-The Government recognizes several indigenous population
 groups in Indonesia, based largely on criteria relating to isolation. The Government
 recognizes these groups' rights to participate fully in Indonesian political and social
 life; considerable efforts, for example, were made to insure that isolated groups par-
 ticipated in the 1992 elections. It is widely believed, however, that the Government's
 approach is basically paternalistic and designed more to bring these groups into the
 Indonesian family than to protect traditional ways of life. Where indigenous groups
 clash with development schemes, the developers almost always win. Concerns have
 also been raised about the Government's transmigration programs, which frequently
 disrupt the social and   economic life in the recipient communities when
 transmigrants are relocated from populous Java to less populated outer islands.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Indonesians exhibit considerable racial and
 ethnic tolerance, with the important exception of official and informal discrimination
 against ethnic Chinese, who comprise about 3 percent of the population. Since 1959
 noncitizen ethnic Chinese have been denied the right to run businesses in rural In-
 donesia. Regulations prohibit the operation of all Chinese schools for ethnic Chinese,
 formation of exclusively Chinese cultural groups or trade associations, and public
 display of Chinese characters. Chinese-language publications, with the exception of
 one officially sanctioned daily newspaper, may neither be imported nor produced do-
 mestically. Private instruction in Chinese is  scouraged but takes place to a limited
 extent. State universities have no formal quotas that limit the number of ethnic
 Chinese. No laws prohibit speaking Chinese, but the Government lays heavy stress
 on the learning and use of the national language, Bahasa Indonesia. Ethnic Chinese
 were forbidden in 1993 to celebrate the Chinese new year in temples or public
 places. Despite these limitations, many people of Chinese ancestry have been suc-
 cessful in business and the professions, and the enforcement of restrictions is often
 haphazard. Some ethnic Chinese have enjoyed particular government favor. Social
 and religious groups exist which are, in effect, all Chinese and not proscribed. Chi-
 nese is spoken in businesses and by the public at entertainment events.
 People with Disabilities.-The disabled in Indonesia do not receive special pro-
 grams or attention, and no national law specifically addresses their status. Virtually
 no public buildings or public means of transport are designed specifically for access
 by the handicapped, and the handicapped face considerable discrimination in em-
 ployment and education. The press, for example, reported in 1993 the case of a uni-
 versity student confined to a wheelchair who was told in the fourth year of a 5-year
 biology degree that she would not be permitted to complete her course of study be-
 
 
 cause university rules forbade the admission of handicapped students in her depart-
 ment. Public outcry and debate of the issue was significant; she was permitted to
 obtain her dege, and issues of the handicapped received considerable public dis-
 cussion. A 1992 traffic law implemented in 1993 notes specifically the right of the
 handicape d to special transportation services such as specifically designed tools
 and facilities, special regulations for obtaining drivers' licenses, andappropriate ve-
 hicles.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Private sector workers, including those in export
 processing zones, are free to form worker organizations without prior authorization.
 However, only a union can bargain on behalf of employees or represent workers in
 the Department of Manpower's labor courts. Private sector firms without unions are
 required to issue company regulations covering terms of employment. Workers are
 supposed to be consulted prior to the issuance of these regulations. Department of
 Manpower approval is also required for company regulations (see Section 6.b.).
 In order to be recognized as a union, a workers' organization must register as a
 social organization with the Department of Home Affairs under the ORMAS Law
 (see Section 2.b.) and meet the requirements for recognition by the Department of
 Manpower, namely: union offices in at least 5 of the country's 27 provinces, branch
 offices in at least 25 districts, and 100 plant-level units. If, because the industry or
 type of work is localized, with the result that a union is confined to only a few loca-
 tions, e.g. mining, the union needs 10,000 members for registration purposes. These
 requirements were introduced by Ministerial Regulation per-03/men/1993, signed by
 the Minister of Manpower in February 1993.
 While the current recognition requirements are lower than those specified pre-
 viously, they still constitute a significant barrier to recognition and the right to en-
 gage in collective bargaining. In addition, Ministerial  eglation per-Ome   993
 requires that a union be set up "by and for workers" (Article l.a.). The Ministry of
 Manpower interprets this clause to deny recognition to groups in which what it con-
 siders nonworkers, such as lawyers or human rights activists, are involved as orga-
 nizers.
 In September 1993, the Serikat Pekerja Seluruh Indonesia (SPSI, All Indonesian
 Workers Union), the only recognized union, began a transformation from a unitary
 (centralized) to a federative (decentralized) structure. As of October 1993, 12 of its
 13 industrial sectors were registered as independent unions. This change was made
 possible by regulations, kep-438/men/1992, signed by the Minister of Manpower in
 October 1992, and per-03/men/1993 of February 1993. The former removed the re-
 quirement that a (plant-level) union be a component of the SPSI while the latter
 lowered the requirements for (nationwide) union recognition. However, to become
 final, the SPsrs constitution must be altered. This can only be done at a SPSI con-
 gress; the next one is scheduled for 1995, or a special congress could be convened
 ore then.
 As of September, the SPSI had 11,184 units out of roughly 26,000 organizable
 work sites. It claims a membership of about 1.9 million dues-paying members, about
 2.5 percent of the total work force. However, if agricultural workers and others in
 categories such as self-employed and family workers who are not normally union
 members are excluded, the percentage of union members rises to approximately 6
 percent.
 There is, de facto, a single union system, and it is the Government's stated policy
 to seek to improve effectiveness of the recognized SPSI unions rather than ease the
 process for the formation of alternative organizations. The only unions recognized
 bythe Department of Manpower are those which previously constituted the SPSI's
 industrial sectors. The Minister of Manpwer has stated that any unions which form
 in the future should affiliate with the SPSI federation and that the Government will
 not recognize any unions outside the federation.
 The Government has indicated that it is looking at the possibility of permitting
 nonunion plant-level worker associations to conclude legally binding labor agree-
 ments with employers.
 Two other labor groups, Setia Kawan (Solidarity), also known as Serikat Buruh
 Merdeka (SMB, Free Trade Union), and Serikat Buruh Sejahtera Indonesia (SBSI,
 Indonesian Workers Welfare Union), have been organized but are not registered. In
 existence for 2 years, Setia Kawan is essentially moribund while the SBSI, created
 in 1992, continues to attempt to form the necessary number of factory-level units
 to meet the requirements of the new registration regulation. The SBSI has twice
 attempted to register with the Department of Home Affairs as a social organization,
 on October 28, 1992, and August 10, 1993. In the first instance no action was taken
 on its application, and in the second an official of the Department of Home Affairs
 
 
 650
 refused to accept the SBSrs documentation. Registration under the ORMAS Law is
 required for all organizations in order to function legally (see Section 2.b.). Although
 the ORMAS Law does not specify any requirement for approval from other govern-
 ment bodies, a spokesman for the Department of Home Affairs stated his depart-
 ment could not accept the SBSI's re stration without a positive recommendation
 from the Department of Manpower. In line with its policy that only unions orga-
 nized "by and for workers" can be recognized, the Department of Manpower has re-
 fused to recommend the registration of the SBSI as a social organization under the
 ORMAS Law on the grounds that its founders were not workers but human rights
 activists and lawyers. According to the SBSI, only two members of its executive
 board are lawyers, and the rest are workers. Government officials have said that
 if the SBSI reconstitutes itself as an NGO, it would be registered under the ORMAS
 Law. The SBSI, however, has refused to accept this offer.
 Until October 1992, when it was replaced by Ministerial Regulation kep-438/men/
 1992, Minister of Manpower Decision 1109/men/1986 defined the procedures for es-
 tablishing an SPSI factory unit. This regulation enjoined workers to consult with
 the employer during the process of setting up an SPSI branch. In practice this often
 meant obtaining the employer's consent for the establishment of a unit. While this
 regulation was in effect there were numerous reports that employers would agree
 to the organization of S11SI units only if they were allowed to select the units' offi-
 cials. Employers justified this action under the terms of Ministerial Decision 1109
 which also specified the requirements for union officials including "high educational
 background" and possession of "certain qualities: reliable, highly disciplined ...
 Employers argued that they were in the best position to know which employees pos-
 sessed those characteristics. Because of this, many current SPSI factory units are
 led by individuals selected by employers and who have little credibility with their
 units members. The new regulation states that employees must only notify their
 employer that they wish to form a union and that they may proceed if they do not
 receive a response from their employer within 2 weeks. Despite this new provision,
 strikes continue to occur because employers attempt to prevent the formation of
 union branches. These strikes are invariably successful and the formation of an
 SPSI unit follows shortly thereafter.
 Civil servants are not permitted to join unions and must belong to KORPRI, a
 nonunion association whose central development council is chaired-by the Minister
 of Home Affairs. Teachers must belong to the Teachers' Association (PGRI). While
 technically classed as a union (its status was changed from association similar to
 KORPRI in April 1990), PGRI has continued to function more as a welfare organiza-
 tion and does not appear to have engaged in trade union activities. State enterprise
 employees, defined to include those working in enterprises in which the state has
 a 5-percent holding or greater, usually are required to join KORPRI, but a small
 number of state enterprises have SPSI units.
 Unions may draw up their own constitutions and rules and elect their representa-
 tives. However, the Government has a great deal of influence over the SPSI and its
 federated unions. The head of the SPSI is a senior member of GOLKAR, and he and
 two other senior SPSI officials are members of Parliament representing GOLKAR.
 With one exception, all members of the executive council are members of GOLKAR.
 These persons have been given positions in the new federated industrial sector
 unions. The Minister of Manpower is a member of the SPSI's Consultative Council.
 Numerous regional officials also are GOLKAR members, sometimes serving in re-
 gional legislatures. According to credible reports, the Government interferes in the
 selection of SPSI officers, especially by placing retired military officers in mid-level
 SPSI positions. The Government has stated that it intends to cease the practice of
 placing military officers in union positions and eventually to remove the officials
 with significant GOLKAR connections.
 Under the Criminal Code, police approval is needed for all meetings of five people
 or more of all organizations outside offices or normal work sites. This provision also
 applies to union meetings. Permission is routinely given to the SPSI. In October
 1992, police and the military halted an SBSI meeting, for which a permit had not
 been requested, and briefly detained its organizers for questioning. On June 19, po-
 lice halted a seminar on freedom of association being held in the SBSI's offices while
 an International Labor Organization (ILO) official was present. In July the police
 and military prevented the SBSI from holding its first congress because the Govern-
 ment had not granted the union's request for a permit for the meeting. A union may
 be dissolved if the Government believes it is acting against Pancasila, but there are
 no laws or regulations specifying procedures for union dissolution. There have been
 no actual cases of dissolution.
 The SPSI maintains international contacts but is not affiliated with any inter-
 national trade union organizations except the Association of Southeast Asian Na-
 
 
 tions (ASEAN) Trade Union Council. Some elements of the SPSI, now registered as
 industrial sector unions, maintain links with international trade union secretariats.
 The SPSI still has its application pending for membership with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 While Pancasila principles call for labor-management differences to be settled by
 consensus all organized workers, with the exception of civil servants, have the right
 to strike. however, state enterprise employees and teacher rarely exercise this right.
 Before a strike can occur in the private sector, the law requires intensive mediation
 by the Department of Manpower and prior notice of the intent to strike. However,
 no approval is required.
 In practice, dispute settlement procedures are not followed fully, and formal notice
 of the intent to strike is rarely given. The Department of Manpower procedures are
 time consuming, and decisions are handed down usually only after a prolonged pe-
 riod has elapsed. These processes have little credibility with workers and are mostly
 ignored. Strikes, therefore, tend to be sudden, the result of longstanding grievances
 or recognition that legally mandated benefits or rights are not being received. While
 strike leaders are not arrested for illegal strikes, they often lose their jobs. The
 number of strikes has continued to increase over the last few years, most of them
 over failure of companies to pay legally mandated minimum wages or because com-
 panies are resisting the formation of a factory-level union. In 1992 there were 112
 illegal" strikes officially recorded by the Department of Manpower, but the actual
 number most likely was larger.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 vided for by law, but only recognized trade unions may engage in it. As note  in
 Section 6.a. above, the Government is considering permitting plant-level workers as-
 sociations (non-SPSI groups) to conclude legally binding agreements with employers.
 The Department of Manpower promotes collective bargaining as an instrument of
 industrial relations in the context of the national ideology, Pancasila. The majority
 of the collective bargaining agreements between the SPSI and employers are nego-
 tiated bilaterally.
 Once notified that 25 employees have joined a registered union, an employer is
 obligated to bargain with it. As a transitional stage to encourage collective bargain-
 ing, regulations require that every company with 25 or more employees issue com-
 pany regulations defining the terms and conditions of employment. Before a com-
 pany can register or renew its company regulations it must demonstrate that it con-
 sulted with the union or in its absence, a committee consisting of employer and em-
 ployee representatives. In companies without unions, the Government discourages
 workers from utilizing outside assistance, such as from NGO's, during consultations
 with employers over company regulations. The Department of Manpower prefers
 that workers seek its assistance and believes that the Department's role is to pro-
 tect workers. There are credible reports that for some companies consultations are
 perfunctory at best and usually with management-selected workers. There are also
 credible reports to the contrary from U.S. companies.
 Only about half of the factory-level SPSI units have collective bargaining agree-
 ments. The degree to which these agreements are freely negotiated between unions
 and management without government interference varies. By regulation, negotia-
 tions are to be concluded within 30 days. If not, the matter is submitted to the De-
 partment of Manpower for mediation and conciliation or arbitration. Most negotia-
 tions are concluded within the 30-day period. Agreements are for 2 years and can
 be extended for 1 more year. According to Indonesian and non-Indonesian NGO's
 involved in labor issues the provisions of these agreements rarely go beyond the
 legal minimum standad established by the Government, and the agreements are
 often merely presented to worker representatives for signing rather than being ne-
 gotiated.
 Regulations expressly forbid employers from discriminating or harassing employ-
 ees because of union membership. There are credible reports from union officials,
 however, of employer retribution against union organizers, and the SPSI claims that
 some employers discriminate against its members and workers who wish to form
 SPSI units. A significant number of strikes during the last year were the result of
 employers' refusals to permit the establishment of SPSI units. In nearly all of these
 cases, employers consented to the establishment of an SPSI branch following the
 strike. Some employers reportedly have warned their employees against contact
 with union organizers from the unrecognized SBSI organization.
 Charges of antiunion discrimination are adjudicated by administrative tribunals.
 However, many union members believe the tribunals generally side with employers.
 Because of this perceived partiality, many workers reject or avoid the procedure and
 present their grievances directly to Parliament and other agencies. Administrative
 decisions in favor of fired workers tend to be monetary awards; workers are rarely
 
 
 652
 reinstated. The provisions of the law make it difficult to fire workers, but the law
 is often ignored in practice. The ILO Conference report in 1993 regretted that Indo-
 nesian legislation was contrary to the requirements of ILO Convention 98 with re-
 gard to protection against acts of antiunion discrimination.
 Workers may organize without restriction in a private enterprise, even if it is des-
 ignated vital by the Government. If the state has a partial interest, the enterprise
 is considered to be in the public service domain, but this does not always legally
 limit organizing. There are a number of joint ventures between government and pn-
 vate enterprise which have SPSI units and which bargain collectively.
 The military, which includes the police, has been involved in a number of labor
 disputes. Workers have charged that members of the security forces have attempted
 to intimidate union organizers and have beaten strike leaders. In June, two officials
 from the SBSI in Medan were detained by police and physically abused as a result
 of their attempt to organize a union in a factory. In May a woman union activist
 in Surabaya was murdered. In addition to several officials and employees of the fac-
 tory at which she worked, the commander of a local military unit was arrested in
 connection with the murder, and a second officer was relieved of his post (see Sec-
 tion L.a.). Members of military intelligence also attended and monitored trade union
 education seminars run by the Asian-American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI), even
 though these programs were approved by the Department of Manpower. The mili-
 tary commandin Surabaya also halted an AAFLI-SPSI-Department of Manpower-
 approved rogram designed to organize new SPSI units. Police and military in a
 number of    tances have been present in significant numbers during strikes even
 when there has been no destruction of property or other violence. Military olfficials
 occasionally have been reported present duringnegotiations between workers and
 management. Their presence has been described as intimidating by plant-level
 union officials.
 Labor law applies equally in export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is strictly forbidden
 and enforcement is generally adequate. The Government, however, is ofn sow t
 investigate allegations of forced labor. Press reports and NGO's have alleged that
 there have been cases of fraudulent recruitment of Timorese workers for employ-
 ment in Java and forced labor by logging companies in Irian Jaya.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chdren.-Child labor continues to be a seri-
 ous problem in industrial areas. The Government acknowledges that there is a class
 of children who must work for socioeconomic reasons, and in 1987 the Minister of
 Manpower issued reulation per-ol/men/1987, "Protection of Children Forced to
 Work," to rehlate thi situation. This regulation legalizes the employment of chil-
 dren under the age of 14 who must work to contribute to the income of their fami-
 lies. It requires parental consent, prohibits dangerous or difficult work limits work
 to 4 hours daily, and requires employers to report the number of children working
 under its prvisions. It oes not set a minimum age for children in this category,
 effectively superseding the colonial-era government ordinance of December 17, 1925,
 on "Measures Limiting Child Labour and Nightwork of Women," which is still the
 current law governing child labor and sets a minimum age of 12 for employment.
 The 1987 regulation is not enforced. No employers have been taken to court for vio-
 lating its restrictions on the nature of employment for children, and no reports are
 collected from establishments employing children. There are no statistics available
 to determine whether child labor is a significant factor in export or any other indus-
 tries.
 The Government sometimes refers to Act No. 1 of 1951, which was intended to
 bring into force certain labor measures, including provisions on child labor which
 would replace those of the 1925 legislation. However, implementing regulations for
 the child labor provisions have never been issued. Thus the child labor prvisions
 in the 1951 At have no validity.
 In September the Government announced it would review its child labor regula-
 tions with the intention of tightening enforcement of restrictions on child labor. At
 year's end, the review was not completed, nor had any change in practices been im-
 plemented.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.--In the absence of a national minimum wage,
 area wage councils working under the supervision of the National Wage Council es-
 tablish minimum wages for regions. These councils are quadripartite bodies consist-
 ing of representatives from labor, management, government, and universities. They
 also establish a basic-needs figure for each province-a monetary amount considered
 sufficient to enable a single worker or family to meet the basic-needs of nutrition,
 clothing, and shelter. While Indonesia has succeeded in dramatically lowering the
 level orpoverty throughout the country, the minimum wage rates have lagged be-
 hind the basic needs figures. However, effective January 1, 1994, the minimum
 
 
 653
 wage for most provinces will be raised to the basic-needs figure, with the minimum
 wage in the remaining areas being adjusted as of April 1, 1994. Labor law and min-
 isterial regulations provide workers with a variety of other benefits, such as social
 security, and workers in more modern facilities often receive health benefits and
 free meals.
 The law establishes 7-hour workdays and 40-hour workweeks, with one 30-minute
 rest period for each 4 hours of work. The daily overtime rate is 1/2 times the normal
 hourly rate for the first hour, and twice the hourly rate for additional overtime. Reg-
 ulations allow employers to deviate from the normal work hours upon request to the
 Minister of Manpower and with the agreement of the employee. Observance of mini-
 mum wage and other laws regulating benefits and labor standards varies from sec-
 tor to sector and by region. Employer violations of legal requirements are fairly com-
 mon and often result in strikes and employee protests. The Minister of Manpower
 continues publicly to urge employers to comply with the law. However, in general,
 government enforcement and supervision of labor standards are weak.
 Both law and regulations provide for minimum standards of industrial health and
 safety. In the largely Western-operated oil sector, safety and health progrs func-
 tion reasonably well. However, in the country's 100,000 larger registered companies
 in the nonoil sector, the quality of occupational health and safety programs varies
 greatly. The enforcement of health and safety standards is severely hampered by
 the limited number of qualified Department of Manpower inspectors as well as by
 the low level of employee appreciation for sound health and safety practices. Allega-
 tions of corruption on the part of inspectors are not uncommon. Workers are obli-
 gated to report hazardous working conditions; and while employers are prevented
 by law from retaliating against those who do, such retaliation does occur since the
 law is not effectively enforced.
 It is also important to note that government policy has had the direct and in-
 tended effect of markedly improving the material condition of the Indonesian labor
 force both in terms of per capita income and income distribution.
