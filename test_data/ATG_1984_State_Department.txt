 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Antigua and Barbuda, which celebrated its third anniversary of
 independence from the United Kingdom on November 1, 1984, is a
 member of the British Commonwealth. The observance of human
 rights practices is both supported by law and reinforced by
 the democratic political values and traditions that evolved
 prior to independence.
 The Constitution, which came into effect with independence,
 establishes a parliamentary system of government based on
 majority rule, and requires general elections at least every
 five years.
 The country's political development has continued along
 democratic lines. Its population has a literacy rate of 88
 percent, supports democratic values and practices, and can
 express dissent openly, aided by a free press.
 Security forces consist of the police and a small infantry
 unit, the Antigua Defense Force. The police are organized,
 trained, and managed along British lines. The security forces
 generally have a good reputation for respecting human rights
 in law enforcement.
 The country is still developing economically, and poverty is
 widespread despite active development efforts centered on
 increasing investment. Although the state holds equity in
 some enterprises, the private sector is strong and individuals
 are free to pursue private interests and hold private
 property. However, some political opponents of Prime Minister
 Vere C. Bird, Sr. complain that their businesses have suffered
 from government retaliation for their political activities.
 In 1984, the state of human rights in this newly independent
 democracy continued to be good.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No instances of political killing were reported in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances, extra-legal detentions or
 politically-motivated abductions were reported in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are constitutional prohibitions against torture and
 cruel or inhuman treatment of prisoners or detainees. These
 prohibitions are respected in practice. Prison conditions are
 adequate, and regular visits by a prisoner's family and
 attorney as well as by members of the clergy are permitted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and detention is constitutionally prohibited,
 and does not occur. The right of habeas corpus is legally
 guaranteed, and anyone detained must be brought before a court
 within 48 hours. There have been no reported cases of exile.

 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Accused persons are guaranteed a fair, open, and public
 trial. The judiciary is independent and is widely respected
 for its fairness and professionalism. The highly regarded
 regional West Indies Court of Appeal serves Antigua and
 Barbuda. Persons without means to retain a private attorney
 are guaranteed legal assistance at government expense.
 There are no political prisoners in Antigua and Barbuda.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Arbitrary police or government actions against a person's
 home, family, or privacy have not been reported. A warrant
 must be obtained prior to the initiation of any search of
 private premises. There have been charges of mail tampering
 from left-wing elements, but no evidence has been produced and
 no cases brought to court.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press, and
 other forms of communication. However, the electronic media,
 which are the only source of daily local news, are dominated
 by the Government (ABS radio and ABS-TV are state-owned, and
 the only privately-owned station, ZDK radio, is controlled by
 the Prime Minister's family). Opposition politicians have
 complained that they have almost no access to air time for the
 presentation of their positions. The situation is different in
 the print media. Weekly newspapers representing the
 opposition can and do publish a variety of opinions and
 attacks on the Government. Religious organizations also
 publish their own newspapers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures the right of peaceful assembly.
 Peaceful public meetings and organized demonstrations are held
 without police interference. Probably less than a majority of
 workers belong to unions, but labor organizations are free to
 organize and bargain on behalf of members. The right to
 strike can be limited depending on the involvement of the
 industrial court in a given dispute. Unions are free to
 affiliate with international labor bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The free exercise of religious beliefs is fundamental in
 Antiguan life. While the population is overwhelmingly
 Protestant, adherents to other religious denominations
 proselytize openly without stigma or government interference.
 Some foreign members of the Bahai faith in previous years have
 claimed they have been warned to refrain from involvement in
 politics and to limit their evangelical activities, or risk
 the revocation of work permits and residency status. The
 evidence indicated that this harassment probably resulted from
 the prejudices of individual officials involved. The Ministry
 of Legal Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General have
 been monitoring the situation, and no complaints were received
 in 1984.

 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Members of the small Rastafarian cult have in the past
 complained of harassment, resulting in part from their
 reputation for using, cultivating, and selling marijuana, and
 most of those subjected to police searches for drug dealers
 and smugglers have been Rastafarians. However, there were no
 reports of such problems in 1984.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on the movement of citizens within
 Antigua and Barbuda. Travel outside the country is generally
 unrestricted, although a few political opponents of the Bird
 Government have had their passports confiscated to ensure
 their attendance at legal proceedings which they claimed were
 politically motivated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Antigua and BarDuda has a multiparty political system which
 accommodates widely divergent views. All citizens 18 years of
 age and older may vote if registered. Individual parties
 conduct voter registration drives free from government
 interference. The Government is obligated by law to hold
 voter registration during a fixed period each year.
 Early elections held in April 1984 (they were not required
 until the following April) gave the present government an
 overwhelming victory. The Antigua Labor Party won every
 constituency in Antigua. In Barbuda, the sole seat was won by
 an independent, who thus became the Government's only
 parliamentary opposition. However, there are no allegations
 that the elections were other than fair and open.
 One of Prime Minister Bird's sons is Minister of External
 Affairs, Economic Development, Tourism, and Energy; another is
 Minister of Public Utilities and Communications. The
 opposition energetically attacks the Bird government, in
 particular over the issue of alleged corruption. Separatist
 feeling in the smaller island of Barbuda (with an estimated
 1,200 of the country's entire population of 81,000) remains a
 problem with which the Government must deal.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Internationally recognized human rights organizations have not
 expressed particular interest in Antigua and Barbuda; there
 have been no requests for investigations or inquiries into
 alleged violations. The Government is sensitive to human
 rights issues, and it has joined international condemnation of
 human rights abuses elsewhere, especially those in South
 Africa and Central America.
 Amnesty International did not mention Antigua and Barbuda in
 its 1984 report. Freedom House describes the country as
 'free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Tourism dominates the Antiguan economy. Latest figures
 indicate that half of the country's gross domestic product
 (GDP) is derived directly or indirectly from tourism. The per
 
 
 403
 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 capita GDP was estimated at $1,537.60 for 1982. There has
 been little growth in the economy over the past two years.
 The decline of agriculture after 1967, when Antigua and
 Barbuda became semi-autonomous, caused the countryside to lose
 its population to the city. With agriculture now accounting
 for less than 15 percent of the GDP, the Government is
 promoting a "back to the land' movement, providing financial
 incentives to young men and women willing to work in the
 agricultural sector.
 Manufacturing accounts for another 15 percent of GDP, but
 recent economic decisions by other Caribbean Community members
 have limited growth in this sector. Factory closings and
 bankruptcies have led to increased unemployment and government
 budgetary shortfalls, as tax revenues from manufacturing dry
 up. Efforts to attract foreign investors continue, but the
 primary problem remains the identification of potential
 foreign markets for domestically manufactured goods.
 The Government has continued its capital development program
 for education and health. Adult literacy approaches 90
 percent, and enrollment of eligible children in primary
 schools has risen to 85 percent since 1981. The Government
 has earmarked funds to upgrade secondary and higher
 education. Infant mortality has dropped to 27.3 per thousand
 live births, and annual population growth is 1.3 percent.
 There are no legal restrictions on the role of women. The
 traditional perception of the role of women, particularly in
 rural areas, confines them to home and family, but this is
 changing. The Government has instituted programs, including
 the enhancement of educational opportunities for both sexes
 and family planning, which are expected to lead to further
 opportunities for women.
 Currently, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda has two
 female senators, (an increase of one following the April 1984
 elections), the highest ranking female political figures in
 the country. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of
 Health and the Chief Establishment Officer (equivalent to a
 director of personnel for the entire government] are both
 women. A woman also heads the Department of Tourism. There
 is a "woman's desk" in the Government to monitor complicance
 with the laws and statutes regarding women and to safeguard
 their legal rights. Ninety percent of the Assistant Permanent
 Secretaries in the Government are women. Six out of ten
 personnel in the Civil Service of Antigua are women. Women
 receive equal pay for equal work by law.
