 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy with a democratic
 parliamentary form of government. Executive authority is
 exercised by the Prime Minister. The role of the Grand Duke,
 the titular Head of State, is largely ceremonial. The Chamber
 of Deputies, a unicameral legislature, encompasses the full
 political spectrum, and an appointed body, the Council of State,
 reviews legislation before it is submitted to the Chamber.
 The police and gendarmerie maintain order throughout the country
 and are subordinate to governmental and judicial authority.
 Judicial and penal systems are considered open, efficient, and
 fair.
 Luxembourg has a prosperous free maiket economy with active
 industrial and services sectors. Its standard of living and
 its level of social benefits are high.
 Human rights are valued and safeguarded throughout Luxembourg.
 Individual rights are protected by law and respected in practice
 by both the Government and the populace. Luxembourg's large
 foreign population (28 percent) is well integrated into society
 and the economy at large. National practices in apparent
 conflict with human rights are quickly and publicly addressed.

 right of appeal. Civilians are not subject to military courts.
 All defendants have access to legal counsel, at public expense
 if necessary. All charges are formally and publicly stated.
 Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court
 of law. They have the right to a public trial, cross-
 examination of witnesses, and presentation of evidence. Either
 the defendant or the prosecutor may appeal a ruling. An appeal

 possibility that a sentence may be either increased or
 decreased. There are no political prisoners.

 Correspondence
 The right to privacy-is protected by law and respected in
 practice. A judicial warrant is required to enter a private
 home, to monitor private correspondence, or to conduct
 electronic surveillance. Freedom of choice- in private matters
 is respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press is legally protected and
 respected in practice. Print media are privately owned and
 free of governmental interference. A privately owned national
 radio and television company has exclusive rights for radio and
 television broadcasting within Luxembourg, although broadcasts
 from neighboring countries are freely and legally available.
 The company is subject to governmental oversight but functions
 independently.
 Censorship is not legally imposed, but the societal consensus
 on propriety largely precludes dissemination of extreme
 pornography or of sensitive information concerning national
 security or the Royal Family. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is provided for by
 law and exists in practice. No limitations are imposed on
 orderly public meetings or demonstrations. Permits for public
 demonstrations are routinely issued.

 There is no state religion, and full freedom of religious
 choice exists. No restrictions exist on the maintenance of
 places of worship, religious training or instruction,
 publication of religious material, or participation in
 charitable activities. Foreign clergy practice freely. The
 State pays the salaries of Roman Catholic, Protestant, and
 Jewish clergy. Local governments often provide and maintain
 facilities. Luxembourg is nominally about 95 percent Roman
 Catholic.

 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation

 emigration, and repatriation. Luxembourg asylum policy grants-

 is no risk in dissent--opposition groups and political parties
 operate without fear of government repression. National
 elections are held every 5 years; local elections occur every 6
 years. Representatives are chosen by secret ballots in direct
 elections based on a proportional system. Multiple candidates
 run for most positions. Luxembourg's foreign population may
 not vote but may indirectly influence the political process
 through membership in labor unions and other organizations.
 Women participate freely in the political process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The activities of local and international human rights groups
 are not restricted. There were no requests to investigate
 human rights abuses in Luxembourg in 1991  Luxembourg
 consistently supports international and nongovernmental
 investigations of alleged human rights violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Racial, social, or sexual discrimination is prohibited by law.
 In practice, blatant discrimination rarely occurs, and relations
 between groups are good. The vast majority of the foreign
 population (28 percent of the total) comes from within the
 European Community. Luxembourg recognizes a need for foreign
 workers, and foreigners generally assimilate into the overall
 society and economy without difficulty.
 Women and men enjoy the same property rights, and equal pay for
 equal work is mandated by law. Without a prenuptial agreement,
 property is equally divided upon dissolution of a marriage.
 Violence against women is not widespread and is not tolerated
 by society or the Government. Several women's rights groups
 are active in Luxembourg, including some that aid battered
 women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers have the right to associate freely, choose their
 own representatives, publicize views, and determine agendas.
 Both Luxembourg law and practice promote union activity and
 protect union leaders and members from discrimination. About
 65 percent of the labor force is unionized. Membership is not
 mandatory. Unions operate free of government interference.-
 The two largest industrial unions are linked to, but organized
 independently of, the Christian Social and the Socialist
 parties.
 Except for some government workers providing essential
 services, all workers have the right to strike. Those
 government workers who may strike must observe certain
 conditions, such as cooling-off periods. Strikes rarely occur
 in Luxembourg. In 1991 there were two 1-day demonstrations by
 farmers and a 1-day work stoppage by bank employees. No other
 strikes occurred.
 Unions maintain unrestricted contact with international bodies,
 including the European Trade Union Confederation and the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is protected by law and freely practiced
 throughout Luxembourg. Wages are-set in free negotiations
 between unions and employers. All businesses having 15 or more
 employees must have worker representatives. Businesses with
 over 150 employees must form work councils composed of equal
 numbers of management and employee representatives. In
 businesses with more than 1,000 employees, one-third of the
 membership of the boards of directors must be employees'
 representatives. Effective procedures exist and are required
 to adjudicate employment-related complaints. There are no
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The employment of children under the age of 15 is prohibited.
 Children are required by law to remain in school until they are
 16 years old. Apprentices between 15 and 16 years of age must
 also attend school. Adolescent workers receive additional
 legal protections, including caps on overtime and the number of
 hours that may be worked continuously. The Ministries of Labor
 and of Education oversee strict enforcement of national child
 labor and education laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The current minimum wage legislation, dating from April 1,
 1991, provides for a minimum wage for workers at least 18 years
 of age with no dependents. Lower, tiered minimum wage rates
 apply to younger workers and students between 15 and 18 years
 of age and increase yearly by age. Minimum wage rates apply,
 without exception,, to all sectors of the economy. All wages
 and salaries are indexed to the general cost-of-living index.
 Supplements to the minimum wage are added for workers with
 dependents. Nonetheless, supporting a family in Luxembourg is
 difficult on the minimum wage. In practice, Luxembourg's wages
 are among the world's highest, and most employees receive more
 than the minimum wage.
 National legislation mandates a workweek of 40 hours. Premium
 pay is required for overtime or unusual hours. Employment on
 Sunday is prohibited except in continuous process industries
 (steel and chemical) and for certain maintenance and security
 personnel. All workers receive a minimum of 5 weeks of paid
 vacation yearly, in addition to paid holidays.
 Luxembourg's health and safety standards are among the highest
 in the world. A safe working environment is mandated by law
 and strictly enforced through an inspection system which
 provides severe penalties for infractions.
