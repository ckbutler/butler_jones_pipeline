 MALAWI
 Effective control of virtually all aspects of government in
 Malawi is exercised by life President H. Kamuzu Banda as
 Chief of State and as head of the sole political party, the
 Malawi Congress Party (MCP), which interacts closely with
 the government. At the heart of the country's political
 system is a widespread recognition of President Banda as
 leader of the country's drive for independence, achieved in
 1964, and as the architect of the country's regionally
 unique record of steady economic growth and development.
 Neither Malawi's colonial period nor its traditions and so-
 cial customs have permitted the country significant pract-
 ical experience in institutionalizing or tolerating politi-
 cal dissent or other challenges to established authority.
 Accordingly, the country's achievements in realizing econ-
 omic and social rights have been accompanied by violations
 of civil and political rights when perceived challenges to
 the government have occurred. Indeed, a broad consensus
 apparently is shared by government and populace alike that
 restraints on individual rights have been necessary to
 achieve the political stability required for the country's
 economic development. Such political opposition as exists
 is not believed to enjoy widespread popular support. It is
 legally proscribed and therefore its active members are con-
 fined primarily to small numbers of exiles abroad.
 The general trend of liberalization that began in early
 1977 with the release of 2,000 detainees has continued dur-
 ing the past year. Although arbitrary detentions, provided
 for under broad executive powers, still occur, such powers
 are exercised with greater restraint than in the past and
 with increased official observance of legal provisions for
 administrative review. The 25-30 persons presently estimat-
 ed to be in detention are believed to include individuals
 detained for corruption and economic offenses. The confirm-
 ed instance in late 1979 of an arrest and detention on ap-
 parent political grounds was resolved by the persons's re-
 lease in the first half of 1980. There may have been other
 unpublicized releases of some long-term political detainees.
 A former minister, however, has been in detention since early
 1980 for alleged political offenses.
 The situation of Jehovah's Witnesses continues to be greatly
 improved over that of the mid-1970's, when large-scale de-
 tentions and harassment occurred. There has been no recur-
 rence of such mistreatment.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 * a. Torture
 Although there is no specific reference to torture under
 Malawian law, there is no evidence that it occurred in 1980
 or previous years.
 
 
 158
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Malawi prisons are generally adequate, reflecting official
 efforts to provide humane conditions for prisoners, condi-
 tions that are not significantly worse than those enjoyed
 by the citizenry at large. There are occasional reports
 of rough handling of detainees but these have not extended
 to allegations of a policy or general practice of cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment. There was physical mis-
 treatment, including some killings, of Jehovah's Witnesses
 by villagers in the early 1970's at the local level. Abuses
 of power by local officials were halted and punished, and
 no instances of mistreatment of Jehovah's Witnesses are
 known to have occurred since the early 1970's.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no known instances of abductions, secret
 arrests or clandestine detentions carried out or sanction-
 ed by the Malawi government during the past year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There has been a steady decline since 1976 in instances
 of arbitrary detention authorized by public security re-
 gulations. Rumored but unpublicized releases of those
 detained on political grounds suggest that such arrests
 that occur increasingly are subjected to administrative
 review as provided for under Malawi law. While long-term
 detainees continue to include political dissidents, most
 notably the associate of an ex-official tried and execut-
 ed for treason in 1976, quiet releases may have reduced
 their number. Arrests in 1980 of persons on charges of
 corruption and other economic crimes connected with abuse
 of official position, however, may keep the numbers of es-
 timated long-term detainees at 25-30 persons. Instances
 apparently still occur of detention for short periods u-
 sually for questioning by authorities, but these periods
 rarely result in long-term inprisonment. A notable excep-
 tion to this trend was the removal from office in early
 1980 and continuing detention of a minister charged with
 alleged political crimes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Individuals arrested and charged with criminal offenses
 generally are dealt with promptly and fairly in the
 modern court system, while civil cases are handled simil-
 arly in traditional courts. Occasionally, instances of
 administrative delay occur, but these are not known to be
 deliberate. Legal counsel and fair public trial are af-
 forded to both criminal and civil defendants. In polit-
 ical cases there is provision only for periodic admini-
 strative review of the grounds for detention. Although
 such procedures are now believed to be more frequently
 observed, there are no means available to a defendant to
 ensure that this procedural requirement is respected.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 While police and security officials enjoy a special entry
 authority, there have been no instances in which this
 authority is known to have been invoked outside of normal
 legal processes during the past three years.

 2. Government Policies RelatIng to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Malawi is among the twenty-five poorest developing countries.
 Malawi is a landlocked country which is predominantly   ag-
 ricultural and possesses no known mineral wealth. Neverthe-
 less, the country has achieved a real economic growth aver-
 aging 6.7 percent annually since independence in 1964. Per
 capita gross domestic product has increased from $143 in
 1976 to an estimated $221 in 1980.As a result of government
 agricultural policies, Malawi has been largely self-
 sufficient in food production. The country's most important
 development plan, the National Rural Development Program,
 has focused on improvement of all aspects of rural living
 conditions. The results achieved are reflected in the stable
 rural population and correspondingly small influx of people
 into urban areas. The government has attempted to offset base
 wage controls with limits on pricing, but success in this
 area over the years is now under a serious threat from exter-
 nal inflationary trends. In sum, the Malawi government has
 made a consistent and, relative to a low resource base, a
 successful effort to permit its citizens to enjoy the econ-
 omic rights cited in the Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights. Nonetheless, its economic progress is threatened by
 external factors, especially soaring costs of fuel imports.
 Both the expansion and Africanization of the economy have
 led to the creation of a relatively small and affluent
 class of Malawians since 1964. Corruption is not a serious
 problem but, when uncovered, it is punished. Extended
 family ties have prevented the growth of large social gaps.
 Moreover, the chances for upward mobility for youths has
 been increased as a result of official focus on technical,
 vocational and practical training of Malawians for jobs in
 the private and public sectors.
 Women enjoy a generally favorable status. There is no le-
 gal discrimination against women in terms of property or
 other civil rights. Women are increasingly evident in gov-
 ernment and some commercial sectors as a result of govern-
 ment policies to expand their access to opportunities for
 education and employment. Women enjoy a privileged status
 in the traditional customs of several major ethnic groups
 observing matrilinear descent of tribal rulers. On the
 other hand, reflecting traditional social emphasis on the
 priority of education for males, women are under-represent-
 ed in public office. The League of Malawi Women enjoys
 favorable status and political influence among the organiz-
 ations comprising the Malawi Congress Party.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The exercise of these freedoms is restricted. In practice,
 Malawian laws and regulations serve to prohibit any open
 criticism of government officials and policies. All media
 are under direct or indirect government control. The state
 radio network broadcasts releases directly authorized by
 the government information agencies. The sole national
 newspaper operates under informal self-censorship guidelines.
 Media coverage of international issues during the past two
 years has broadened, and there has been increasing liberal-
 
 
 160
 ization in the application of censorship controls over mate-
 rials meant for broad public distribution. Nevertheless,
 the government continues to proscribe all material which it
 deems sexually immoral.
 There is freedom of inquiry into the natural and social sci-
 ences at the university level, including examination of pol-
 itical ideologies at variance with government policies,
 provided this does not extend to explicit criticism of the
 government. Association for the purpose of expressing pol-
 itical opposition is prohibited. Apart from businessmen's
 groups there are no significant professional organizations.
 Sectoral unions function under the umbrella of a national
 trade union congress which is subordinate to the Malawi
 Congress Party. While strikes are legally permitted, none
 have ever occurred, and organized labor negotiates wage in-
 creases with the government at the latter's sufferance.
 However, wage increases have been authorized in several key
 sectors and actual wages in key trades have been permitted
 to go well above fixed minimum levels in response to market
 demands. Government controls on food staples and other es-
 sential goods are a generally effective compensation for
 controls on wages.
 Freedom of worship is permitted in law and practice to all
 faiths and denominations. There is no legal or practical
 discrimination against any religion. Although, as reported
 above, there was repression of the Jehovah's Witnesses when
 its members were deemed to be engaged in political activi-
 ties in the mid-1970's, there has been no recurrence since
 agreement was reached with the government regarding members'
 payment of tax obligations and curtailment of activities of
 a political nature.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The only known restrictions on movement within Malawi are
 legal provisions restricting the movement of persons con-
 victed of criminal or political offenses. Passports for
 travel abroad have been denied to a few persons on political
 grounds.
 While residents of Asian origin are free to move within the
 country, they were required during 1975-78 to restrict their
 places of residence and business to the three main urban
 centers of the country. The government defended these
 measures as necessary to permit Malawians to enter the re-
 tail sector. While many Asians have left Malawi, the sub-
 stantial number that remain continue to be prominent in the
 private commercial sector and hold some offices in municipal
 bodies.
 Malawi does not accord official refugee status to foreign-
 ers but in practice has accorded haven to small numbers of
 nationals from neighboring countries. Few Malawians are
 believed to have fled the country seeking refugee status
 elsewhere. The country's travel regulations do not specif-
 ically discriminate against women or other groups.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 /
 Malawi's political processes are authoritarian. Many Mala-
 wians attribute this to deeply ingrained values favoring
 hierarchical social relationships, respect for authority,
 and a widely shared perception that tolerance of formal pol-
 
 
 161
 litical dissent would be unworkable. Organized political
 opposition is prohibited.
 Malawian citizens participate in the political process
 through the Malawi Congress Party, the sole political party
 permitted under the constitution. The party has an exten-
 sive and active organization which seeks broad popular par-
 ticipation. The various party organizations serve as chan-
 nels for opinions to reach decision makers and to transmit
 top-level decisions to the local level. Local party organ-
 izations interact closely with the government in public
 service activities and projects. Women exert political in-
 fluence through the League of Malawi Women and have special
 rights of access to top-level officials. Although women are
 still in the minority in party and governmental positions,
 their representation is increasing. Party membership is
 limited to indigenous Africans and only party members may
 seek election to parliament.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1980 the United Nations Economic and Social Council, on
 the recommendation of the United Nations Commission on Hu-
 man Rights, adopted a resolution in regard to the situa-
 tion in Malawi of alleged persecution of Jehovah's Witnes-
 ses. The resolution regrets the failure of the Government
 of Malawi to cooperate with the Commission on Human Rights
 in its examination and expresses hope that the human rights
 of all citizens in Malawi have been fully restored and that
 adequate measures are being taken to provide remedy to those
 who may have suffered injustices. The government had pre-
 viously rejected the charges of persecution of Jehovah's
 Witnesses in Malawi but took measures to correct the problem.
 No further complaints have been placed with the United
 Nations Commission on Human Rights. There are no organiza-
 tions based within Malawi to report on human rights condi-
 tions. However, the government has freely admitted foreign
 journalists into Malawi, including several over the past
 three years who previously had written articles critical of
 human rights violations in the mid-1970's.
