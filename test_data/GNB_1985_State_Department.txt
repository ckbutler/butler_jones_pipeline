 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Despite a return to a form of constitutional government in
 1984, effective political power in Guinea-Bissau remains
 concentrated in the hands of the Council of State and President
 Joao Bernardo Vieira, who currently serves as Head of State,
 Head of Government, Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief, and
 Secretary-General of the only legal party, The African Party
 for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde. The Council of
 State includes five military men and four former members of the
 now defunct Revolutionary Council. All Council members are
 also members of the party's political and/or central committee.
 Opposition political activity is not permitted. Under the May
 1984 Constitution, the party is "the guiding political force of
 Guinea-Bissau society and the state." Elections at the
 district, regional, and national level, such as the 1984
 election of the 150-member National Assembly, are controlled by
 the party. The armed forces remain the dominant element in
 state security and in the new Constitution are responsible for
 the maintenance of internal security and public order.
 Guinea-Bissau's colonial heritage and statist economic,
 financial, and commercial policies have severely restricted
 growth and the exploitation of natural resources. All economic
 activity is supervised by the Government through a system of
 state-owned business and commercial entities. There is a small
 private retail sector.   Direct foreign grant assistance is
 required to cover a large portion of the Government's current
 operating budget.
 The human rights situation in Guinea-Bissau changed little in
 1985. The one-party state limits the political freedom of
 Guinea-Bissauans, and there is little visible civilian
 opposition to the Government. However, First Vice President
 Paulo Correira, Secretary of State for Culture and Sports Joao
 da Silva, and an undetermined number of military personnel were
 arrested in November for allegedly plotting to overthrow the
 Government of President Vieira. Efforts to reduce the degree
 of arbitrariness in the system continued following the return
 in 1984 to a Constitution which stresses the equality of all
 citizens before the law, as well as freedom of thought,
 assembly, association and religion. The integrity of the
 individual is normally respected, except in cases involving
 alleged national security offenses. The alleged plotters
 arrested in November remain imprisoned, 'i.th the exception of
 Secretary of State da Silva, who was reportedly killed while
 attempting to escape.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no cases of government-ordered or -sanctioned
 assassinations in 1985, nor were there any terrorist incidents.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearance in 1985.

 GUINEA-BISSAU
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reported cases of torture in 1985. The May 1984
 Constitution prohibits such treatment. Prison conditions are
 poor and unsanitary. Interrogation methods are, at times,
 harsh, involving intimidation and, occasionally, solitary
 confinement. Medical treatment, medicines, and food for
 prisoners are in short supply. Military security and police
 officials are poorly trained. According to some observers,
 severe beatings routinely accompany arrests.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests in Guinea-Bissau are frequently arbitrary. There is no
 published civil or criminal code. Habeas corpus: (as a carry
 over from the Portuguese penal code) does exist in practice in
 urban areas but is not generally observed in rural areas where
 traditional law prevails. In national security cases, arrests
 and detentions frequently take place without normal
 safeguards. Bail procedures do not appear to exist. There
 were no known cases of government-imposed exile in 1985. The
 new Constitution, however, does recognize the state's right to
 expel and extradite Guinea-Bissauan citizens "in some cases."
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Guinea-Bissau.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In rural areas, nonpolitical offenders in other than the most
 important criminal and civil cases are often tried outside the
 formal court system, under traditional law. The private.
 practice of law is prohibited. Defendants are assigned -legal
 assistance from the Ministry of Justice when available. The
 judiciary is not independent. Regional military courts have
 jurisdiction over military, militia, and security personnel on
 military missions. The civilian court system is essentially a
 continuation of that which existed under Portuguese colonial
 rule. The Supreme Court is the highest civilian court of
 appeal and has jurisdiction over serious crimes, such as acts
 against state security, attempts against the lives of party
 members, treason, and piracy. It also serves as an appeals
 court for the regional military courts. The interval between
 arrest and trial may be lengthy. The creation of special
 tribunals is constitutionally prohibited except for military
 courts established todeal with military offenses. An
 undetermined number of individuals remain in prison following
 the November 1985 coup plot arrests and have yet to be tried;
 and two members of the Government led by President Luis Cabral,
 which was overthrown in 1980, continue under house arrest.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile,
 person, and correspondence. These rights are not always
 respected in the case of serious crimes or matters involving
 state security, where the observance of legal protections such
 as the need for search warrants and the definition of who can
 issue and serve them are considered less important than
 results. In the absence of an independent judiciary and a
 published criminal code, there is no established or guaranteed
 protection against intrusion by the State into the private
 lives of individuals. International and domestic mail and
 other forms of communications are considered insecure.

 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government owns and controls the information media in
 Guinea-Bissau. Independent reporting or editorial comment on
 domestic and international affairs does not exist. There are
 no independent journals or newspapers. No expression of
 political opposition to the party or the Government is
 permitted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All organizations and associations in Guinea-Bissau are
 integral parts of the State or the party.
 The national labor union is a "mass action" organ of the
 party. It claims 20,000 members. It is forbidden to organize
 public employees, a prohibition dating from colonial days.
 Strikes, while not technically illegal, have not occurred, and
 the vast majority of salaried workers are employees of the
 State. There are no nongovernmental or nonparty associations
 affiliated with international bodies. The national union is a
 member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and is
 affiliated with the Communist-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no religious discrimination and religious freedom is
 constitutionally guaranteed. The majority of the population is
 animist, but other religious groups exist and their worship is
 unimpeded. Conversion is permitted. Religious missions
 operate secular activities throughout the country. Parochial
 schools, for example, operate openly. The adherence to a
 particular faith appears to be neither an advantage nor a
 disadvantage to individuals in their secular activities.
 Muslims account for approximately 30 percent of the active
 religious community, and they are permitted to make pilgrimages
 to Mecca.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no routine restrictions on movement within the
 country. Police roadblocks are often on the main highways, and
 travel is restricted when smuggling of agricultural products is
 suspected. Guinea-Bissauan nationals and many foreign
 expatriate workers must obtain exit permits to travel abroad.
 The principal constraints on foreign travel are economic.
 There are no known bars to emigration. Since the country's
 borders are not rigidly controlled, there is a considerable
 unauthorized cross-border movement. There are no significant
 refugee groups in Guinea-Bissau. The Government is generally
 sympathetic to the principle of asylum. Guinea-Bissau is a
 signatory to the UN Convention and Protocol Relating to the
 Status of Refugees. There were no known repatriation problems
 in 1985.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guinea-Bissau is governed by a small elite group of party
 leaders and military authorities, led by President Joao
 
 
 146
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Bernardo Vieira. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau returned to a
 form of constitutional government in 1984. The armed
 forces-dominated Revolutionary Council, which had ruled the
 country since the 1980 coup d'etat, was abolished. Following
 legislative elections controlled-by the country's only legal
 political party, the 150 member National Popular Assembly
 reconvened for the first time since 1980. -The Assembly
 approved a new Constitution, elected General Vieira to a
 five-year term as President of the Council of State, and chose
 the other members of that Council. By the terms of the 1984
 Constitution, all political activity must take place within the
 party/state structure. The 1984 electoral slates at the
 district, regional, and national levels were party-prepared
 lists. Write-in or opposition candidates were not permitted.
 The President, members of the Council of State, and National
 Popular Assembly deputies are elected to five-year terms.
 There are provisions for revision of the Constitution and
 national referendums. In rural areas, popular criticism of
 regional government authorities has forced the Government to
 replace some officials. No single ethnic group dominates
 party-government positions. There are no female Ministers, but
 the President of the National Assembly and the Mayor of Bissau
 are both women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Guinea-Bissau has not been active in international or regional
 human rights bodies, and it has no record of sustained
 involvement with outside bodies concerned with human rights.
 In July 1985, the regional International Committee of the Red
 Cross delegate visited Guinea-Bissau. Amnesty International in
 its 1985 Report expressed concern about the house arrest of
 former political leaders. Freedom House rated Guinea-Bissau as
 "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Guinea-Bissau is among the least developed countries in the
 world. The current population is estimated at 858,000, with a
 population growth rate of 1.9 percent. The average family size
 is 5.3 persons. Of a labor force of approximately 450,000,
 only 25,000 are salaried wage earners. Most of these are civil
 servants. Per capita gross national product is estimated at
 $170 a year..
 Although the country is extremely fertile, less than one-half
 of the arable land is currently under cultivation.
 Guinea-Bissau's principal natural resources include fish,
 lumber, some minerals and, possibly, petroleum. The economy is
 dominated by traditional subsistence production of agricultural
 commodities. The rural and modern sectors operate, to a large
 extent, independently of one another. Foreign economic
 assistance to Guinea-Bissau is substantial, averaging $60-80
 million annually.
 Life expectancy at birth is 38 years, and the infant mortality
 rate is approximately 137 per 1,000 live births. At most, 10
 percent of the population has access to safe water.
 Eighty-seven percent of the population lives in communal
 villages (Tabancas), which are the country's basic economic and
 social unit. The remaining 13 percent of the population is
 
 
 147
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 concentrated largely in and around the capital city of Bissau.
 The Government estimates that there is I hospital bed for every
 650 inhabitants and 1 doctor per 10,000 inhabitants. Adult
 literacy is estimated at 19 percent. Primary school enrollment
 of eligible children is estimated at 55 percent.
 The new Constitution is silent on labor issues, including the
 question of a minimum age for the employment of children.
 Guineau-Bissau presently has several European technicians,
 funded by the World Bank, reviewing and updating the laws
 covering workers' rights inherited from the Portuguese colonial
 regime. Detailed regulations covering such matters as vacation
 rights and job-related disabilities are on the books.
 Enforcement, however, is uneven. Since there are no
 independent unions, lawyers, or judges, workers must depend
 completely on the Government to protect their rights.
 Official discrimination against women in the modern sector of
 society does not exist. In the rural sector, however,
 traditional male-dominant sociological practices prevail. The
 party and Government actively encourage the participation of
 women in society, public life, and development. The National
 Women's Movement, a party organization, is active nationally
 and women hold some senior government and party positions. By
 statute, party organizations must have a stated proportion of
 women office holders.
