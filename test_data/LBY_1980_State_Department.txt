 LIBYA *
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya describes its
 form of government as "popular democracy"! The governing
 principles of the society are expressed in Colonel Mu'ammar
 al-Qadhafi's "third universal theory" -- the Green Book --
 rather than in a constitution. The Libyans have created a
 government which they regard as being based heavily on Islamic
 teachings, and which ostensibly emphasizes full participation
 of the people in the decisions which affect their daily lives.
 This participation comes through a system of increasingly
 active people's committees which not only operate local govern-
 ment but also control virtually every local enterprise, rang-
 ing from farming and manufacturing to the educational and
 social institutions of the country. These committees are
 extremely powerful in terms of local decisions but Colonel
 Qadhafi -- though now holding no formal government position --
 still remains the single arbiter of all important issues in
 Libya.
 Since Colonel Qadhafi came to power in 1969, Libya has supported
 a wide range of terrorist groups in every area of the globe.
 The country's oil revenues, which in 1980 will probably exceed
 $24 billion, enable Libya to provide this support and build up
 a vast arsenal of weapons, many of which have been acquired in
 Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. This revenue also has
 financed an active internal development program (new schools,
 hospitals, roads) to benefit its population of 2.8 million.
 Since 1969 the regime has prided itself on its "white" br blood-
 less) revolution. 1980, however, has seen a considerable change
 for the worse in Libya's human rights picture with reports of
 torture and abuse increasing markedly.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Torture
 Since the beginning of 1980 there have been numerous reports of
 a wide-spread campaign of arrests and trials and allegations of
 torture and mistreatment of prisoners. International press
 accounts allege that the regime of Colonel Mu'ammar Qadhafi has
 arrested more than 2,000 persons and executed or tortured to
 death hundreds of them. While credible reports indicate that
 torture frequently occurs, abuses of this magnitude have not
 been confirmed.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Detainees in criminal and security cases reportedly are fre-
 quently beaten during interrogation, a practice which appears
 to be condoned by government officials. The number of reports
 of cruel treatment of prisoners, including credible eye-witness
 The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli was attacked by a mob on December 2,
 1979; thereafter, the staff was drastically reduced and Embassy
 operations were suspended. On May 2, 1980 the Embassy was
 closed and there is no plan to reopen it in the immediate future.
 Because of the absence of a United States Mission in Libya, this
 report draws heavily on unofficial sources.
 
 
 1040
 accounts, has increased considerably during 1980. In some
 prisons conditions are tolerable, but in others -- particu-
 larly where political prisoners are held -- reports suggest
 that beatings and other forms of degrading treatment are
 commonplace. Thereare no confirmed reports of recent judicial
 executions, but in April AmnestyInternational (AI) expressed
 concern about the large number of offenses punishable by
 death under Libyan law, including a number of political offenses.
 Reports persist of summary executions or deaths by torture of
 some of those arrested during 1980. There are, for example,
 credible reports of summary executions of participants in an
 abortive military, mutiny in Tobruk in August.
 In May Amnesty International (AI) issued a bulletin which
 stated that it had "received reports that many of those detained
 incommunicado have been subjected to torture and mistreatment"
 and that there had been "reports of several deaths in custody
 in Libya.! A separate May lR80 Amnesty publication cited the
 case of Amer Tahar Deghayes, described by Al as the co-founder
 of the Ba'ath movement in Libya, who "died in detention in
 February of 1980 after being summoned by the police for ques-
 tioning; an autopsy was refused by the authorities."
 A new human rights development in 1980 concerns assassinations
 of Libyan dissidents living abroad. As part of the implemen-
 tation of Colonel Qadhafi's political theories, the people's
 committees in the past several years have grown in power and
 .authority. Their growth and activity accelerated during 1980.
 In February at the Third Conference of the Revolutionary
 Councils, a resblution was.adopted which charged the committees
 with the "liquidation of the elements that hinder the revolu-
 tion." Specifically, the declaration of the Council stated
 that:
 "Physical liquidation becomes the final stage in the revo-
 lutionary struggle in its final conclusion, if by that stage
 the breakdown of the economic, political and social structures
 of the committee forces had not been complete..."
 In the months that followed this declaration, at least 11
 expatriate Libyan dissidents were assassinated by hit squads
 made up of young militant supporters of Colonel Qadhafi. Some
 of the apprehended assailants boasted of their mission on be-
 half of the revolutionary committees. The head of the Libyan
 Diplomatic Mission in London -- in a much publicized press
 conference -- justified these assaults and warned that more
 were planned. The British government expelled the diplomat-
 in question. Concurrently, evidence mounted of a campaign of
 threats and intimidation aimed at Libyan dissidents in the
 United States. In responding to these increasingly credible
 allegations, the United States government, in the spring of
 1980, expelled six Libyan diplomats. In October, a Libyan
 graduate student in Colorado was shot and seriously wounded.
 There were wide-spread, but so far unconfirmed, allegations
 that this assault represented a continuation of the assassina-
 tion campaign; the case continues under investigation by the
 Federal Bureau of Investigation.
 c. Disappearances
 There are a growing number of credible reports that Libyan
 businessmen, former government officials, and political acti-
 vists have been taken into custody by the government with no
 further information available as to their condition, where-
 abouts, or charges lodged against them. Referring to the
 
 
 1041
 problem of disappearances in Libya, AI reported in April 1980
 that "Some of those detained are believed to be held incommuni-
 cado by branches of the Intelligence Services, where torture
 and maltreatment frequently occurs."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Libya declared three years ago that "there are currently no
 political detainees on any charge in its prisons." Credible
 reports suggest, however, that Libyan prisons contain increased
 numbers convicted of political offenses. AmnestyInternational
 in 1979 estimated the number to be 80. In the wake of the
 arrest campaign which began in early 1980, that number probably
 is now far higher.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Responding to charges by Amnesty International that individuals
 are not always provided access to legal counsel, the Libyan
 authorities claimed that they "guarantee prisoners all neces-
 sary means of defense and safeguards of justice adequate to the
 principles contained in the declaration of human rights." The
 accused may contact their lawyers and families "as soon as
 possible with respect to the exigencies of interrogation." In
 routine civil or criminal cases, these government claims appear
 to reflect accurately the prevailing situation. In security
 cases there are many reports of prisoners being held incommuni-
 cado and without trial for long periods. While undergoing
 interrogation -- sometimes for periods of several months -- they
 are given no access to legal representation.
 As part of the recent arrest campaign, the normal court struc-
 ture in Libya has been by-passed by the recently created People's
 Courts. This parallel legal system has far fewer safeguards
 built in, and the trials are frequently held in camera or in
 absentia. Another aspect of the recent arrest campaign was the
 large number of show trials of prominent officials and heads of
 state-owned corporations. These trials were televised every
 evening for several months and were used as a warning to others
 in the government and the corporations to hew closely to the
 government line.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Residences usually are searched only after extensive surveil-
 lance by the authorities. The legal stipulation that warrants
 must first be obtained is often disregarded.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The government has made substantial efforts to fulfill vital
 human needs. The transition to a basically socialist economic
 system has resulted in the reduction of disparities among social
 classes. Earlier economic measures, such as the confiscation of
 property and larger privately owned businesses, were aimed pri-
 marily at the upper end of the economic scale. Recent moves by
 the government have had negative effects upon the middle class
 and small shop keepers as well. Because of mismanagement, food
 staples are sometimes in short supply, but many are subsidized
 by the government. Expensive agricultural projects funded by
 petrodollars reflect Libya's desire to achieve agricultural
 self-sufficiency. Education is provided at no cost to all
 Libyan youth, including thousands of university students study-
 ing in America and Europe. Medical clinics, staffed by Libyan
 and foreign medical personnel, have been established through-
 out the country and dispense basic medical care at minimal
 
 
 1042
 cost. The government has responded to complaints about the
 housing shortage with a massive building effort. It also
 decreed that an individual may own only one residence. That
 decree stimulated a continuing and disorderly wave of hous-
 ing repossessions. Corruption, while pervasive, has not
 affected significantly the government's performance in satis-
 fying vital needs.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Colonel Qadhafi's government increasingly has restricted basic
 civil and political freedoms during 1980. Libyans are most
 circumspect about uttering dissident views toward the regime's
 policies. Token criticism of the government is permitted dur-
 ing people's committee meetings and at the annual General
 People's Congress. The right of association is granted only to
 those institutions affiliated with the apparatus of the regime.
 The media are controlled rigorously, and newspapers do not
 print editorials. Libya, which is overwhelmingly Muslim, allows
 a few Christian churches to operate.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is unrestricted for
 Libyan citizens, with the exception of security areas. An
 exit permit isrequired for travel abroad.- Military conscrip-
 tion regulation' have led to some restrictions on the issuance
 of exit permits to potential inductees. At several points
 during the past year, tight restrictions were placed on the
 issuance of all exit permits and it is increasingly difficult
 for Libyan nationals suspected of inadequate revolutionary
 zeal to travel abroad. Information concerning current Libyan
 policy with regard to emigration or voluntary repatriation is
 unavailable.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Libya describes itself as the world's only Jamahiriya, or
 "Republic of the Masses." It does not fit readily into estab-
 lished political categories. Political parties have been out-
 lawed, but a significant degree of participation inthe system
 of popular committees and General People's Congresses is
 encouraged by the regime. On local issues these committees
 have considerable authority in the routine operations of the
 government. Major decisions, however, still are made by the
 senior leadership. Efforts have been made to recruit women
 and members of the Berber minority into this political struc-
 ture. Trade and professional unions are integrated into the
 popular committees. Colonel Qadhafi has urged workers to take
 over the business firms which employ them. Many have done so
 and the pattern now is for the workers to elect their own
 management, subject to the control of the local committee.
 Collective bargaining no longer occurs.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged violations of
 Human Rights
 An Amnesty International mission went to Libya in early 1980.
 Following the mission, Al issued a memorandum "setting forth
 its concerns to the authorities in which it called upon the
 Libyan authorities to put an end to 'physical liquidation' and
 
 
 1043
 to implement fully the provisions of the international instru-
 ments guaranteeing human rights which they had ratified."
