 BRUNEI
 Brunei is a small, wealthy, Islamic monarchy located on the
 north Coast .of-%oYi1o." Alth6ugh there are substantial Chinese
 and otherminorities, it is predominantly Malay in population.
 Brunei is a hereditary and traditional Sultanate that has been
 ruled"by th 6same faimfly for over 500 Vears. A British
 protectorate until'Jaizary 1," 1984, it ha! been internally
 self-governing sA64 1959%     "
 The Conilstitution  rohiul~atdf in i959 provided f6r the first
 zharilg of political power by the Sultan, who since

 Since 19 62*theie'have ben no. dipturbances bi agitation in
 Brunei. Ec6pbmit factors have muqh to do with the'general
 sense of w!ll -being. Brunei has only about'225;000 people,
 but produces about 155,000 barrels of oil per~day and slightly
 over 5 million tons of liquified natural gas (LNG) per year.
 It has onelof the highest per capita grost national products
 in the world. Brunei has no debts, and one leading weekly
 economic newspaper estimated the nation's reserves at $20
 billion'in mid-1986. The oil'and LNG revenues allow the
 Government to provide free medical care,'schools, and
 university training to its citizens. A large proportion of
 the Malay population is employed by the*Government at generous
 salaries which permit a higher standard of living than in
 surrounding cotntrids.'" Governmeht dmployees are eligible for
 low-inltr st'bt'- ib-hterest 'foans to purchase homes, "

 employer, BrUnei Shell; pr6vide  similiar benefits'to its
 Vmploybes; -Brunei has no income tax. There are several
 substantial, low,ost housing plans designed to provide homes
 for the landless.
 There were no major human rights developments during the year.
 Section I--ReSpbct-for the Integrify of the Person, Including
 .Freedom from"
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings by the
 Government or any other organization.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearancds, nor was there evidence of
 persons having been abducted, secretly arrested, or
 clandestinely detained.

 BRUNEI
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was no evidence of people having been subjected to
 torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment. Prison conditions are considered good.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution has no provision for habeas corpus. The
 right exists, however, as the Application of Laws Act states
 that the Law of England (1951) applies except where Brunei has
 passed its own law. Under normal circumstances, a magistrate
 must "endorse" a warrant. On rare occasions, warrants are
 issued without this endorsement.
 There were no allegations or known instances of people
 detained, tried, or punished for the expression of views
 critical of or different from those of the Government in
 1987. In July the Sultan released from detention five men who
 had recently returned to Brunei after having fled the nation
 in the mid-1970's. These men hope to obtain jobs with the
 Government. In 1986 six detainees, imprisoned after the
 insurrection of 1962 or as a result of antigovernment
 activities in the mid-1970's, were released after taking an
 oath of allegiance to the Sultan. It is estimated that a
 small number of detainees are still being held without trial,
 including some detained after the 1962 uprising. Amnesty
 International reports they are believed held in virtual
 isolation. Several leaders from the 1962 insurrection live
 abroad. They have not been sentenced in exile, a punishment
 that is not practiced in Brunei, but may fear imprisonment if
 they were to return to Brunei.
 Brunei does not permit forced or compulsory labor, and there
 have been no reports of this practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system in Brunei is derived from the British
 system. Those suspected of common crimes are detained, tried,
 and punished according to the law. Lacking a senior judiciary
 of its own, the Brunei High Court has for its Chief Justice a
 judge seconded from Hong Kong. There were no known instances
 of interference with the judiciary by the Government in 1987.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Government is empowered by law to intrude into
 the privacy of individual persons, families, or homes, in
 practice it does not do so.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although a political party was organized in 1985 with
 government approval, there have been no challenges which might
 have tested the degree of government tolerance in the
 political arena.
 Brunei's only television station is government owned (two
 Malaysian stations can also be received). It usually avoids
 controversial issues, as do newscasts on the radio stations.

 BRUNEI
 While the single weekly newspaper generally avoids
 controversial issues, it did cover two of the year's most
 sensitive issues in Brunei, the $10 million donation by the
 Sultan to the Nicaraguan armed resistance and reports of oil
 sales by. Brunei to South Africa. Publications banned in
 Singapore and Malaysia in 1987 because of "offensive" articles
 encountered no problems in Brunei.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government pelmits the formation of associations for many
 kinds of private economic, recreational, or other purposes
 without interference, but it requires their registration.
 There are no repoxts that registiation has been denied by the
 Government. There are private clubs, chambers of commerce,
 churches, and a variety of social and cultural organizations.
 In 1985 the Government allowed establishment of the Brunei
 National Democratic Party (BNDP),'the first political party
 since party activity was prohibited in 1967. Just before its
 first public meeting, the Government announced that government
 employees could not attend party meetings, become members of
 political parties, or otherwise-engage in organized political
 debate. Few members of the public were attracted to the BNDP's
 launching assembly (the local press reported fewer than 100
 people attended), and its longer term prospects are unclear.
 There have been no other known instances of government
 interference with party membership drives. 'In 1986 the
 Government approved the establishment of a second political
 party, the Brunei National United Party (BNUP); however, the
 organizers never announced its formation, and nothing further
 has been heard of it.
 Trade unions, while legal, do not play any significant role.
 The Department of Labor lists four trade unions, with a total
 membership of only 1,125 members. Conditions in Brunei are
 not conducive to the development of trade unions. There is a
 severe shortage of native Brunei citizens (Bumiputras) relative
 to the labor market. This has created a situation where about
 one-third of all jobs are held by expatriate workers. Wage
 and benefit packages far exceed those of neighboring nations;
 there is a lack of those kinds of industries in which unions
 have traditionally developed; and there is a long cultural
 tradition of trying to achieve consensus rather than cause
 confrontation.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official state religion, but the Constitution
 provides for freedom of worship for other religions. There
 are several Christian churches in the country. There are also
 missionary schools in Brunei, including one attended by members
 of the Royal Family.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement in the country
 for its citizens, permanent residents, and expatriates. Some
 restrictions on travel abroad are placed on certain expatriates
 as part of contract obligations to the Government of Brunei.
 Travel to Communist nations is restricted, and travel to China
 by Brunei's ethnic Chinese citizens and ethnic Chinese
 residents is tightly controlled. Brunei has not been willing
 to accept refugees.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the continuing state of emergency there are no
 representative bodies at the national or local level. In the
 circumstances, there is no way in which citizens can change
 their government through established democratic processes.
 However, citizens may effect changes in government by working
 through appointed village headmen and district officers, who
 meet regularly with their constituents. They may also attempt
 to effect change by petitioning the Sultan directly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations in Brunei
 which deal specifically with the protection of human rights.
 Amnesty International reports it has appealed to the Sultan
 for the release of a number of political prisoners on several
 occasions but has received no reply.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women are widely employed in the Government and private
 sectors, generally in clerical and secretarial jobs, although
 some hold senior level professional positions. As the number
 of women university graduates increases, the ranks of women in
 professional positions are expected to grow. There are no
 separate pay levels for men and women. However, for reasons
 of Muslim traditions and practices, women are not as likely to
 find fast track positions in the civil service. Women are not
 put under pressure to observe strict Muslim standards of dress,
 but many Muslim women do observe these standards. Non-Muslim
 women generally dress conservatively.
 The majority of the substantial Chinese minority in Brunei are
 not citizens (those having no claims to other nationalities
 were "British-protected persons" prior to independence and are
 now either stateless permanent or temporary residents).
 Permanent residents cannot own land but usually resolve this
 problem through 7-year leases, the maximum amount of time for
 lease agreements in Brunei. The process of obtaining
 citizenship in Brunei is long and difficult. In general, the
 Chinese community has prospered in Brunei and much of the
 country's commercial activity is in Chinese hands. While the
 Chinese have done well economically, many are now reevaluating
 their position in Brunei, especially the prospects of their
 children in a society where Malay citizens are favored in such
 areas as government employment. Some are emigrating to other
 nations, especially Australia and Canada.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Working conditions are subject to inspection by the Labor
 Commission on a routine basis, at the time of immigrant worker
 quota renewal, and in response to complaints. These
 inspections are carried out to determine adherence to minimum
 safety and health standards and compliance with compensation
 plans as filed with the Labor Commission. Brunei does not
 have a minimum wage law, but the Labor Department determines a
 "prevailing wage" for each employment sector. Employers are
 required to pay at least the prevailing wage to obtain approval
 for a worker quota. In practice, given the shortage of labor,
 
 
 639
 BRUNEI
 market forces allow most citizens of Brunei to command high
 wages. Employment of children below the age of 16 is
 prohibited, and belo the age of 18 requires the consent of
 the chi'ld'sparent or guardfan, and approval of the Labor
 Commissioh." Women under the age of 18 may not work at night
 or on offshore oil platforms. Work in excess of 48 hours
 requires3'payment of overtime. Double tine' must be paid for
 work performed on legal holidays. These regulations are
 effectively enforced by the Labor Commission.
 At least one-thirdlbf Brunei's work force is inade up of
 expatrates. Expatriate workers tome to the country under
 contracf,'and Bruneian employers must post~bonds with the
 government authorities tp guarantee the departure of the
 workers when their contracts are finished. Expatriates~work
 as teacher s, governmlent empioyees', business managers,
 engineers,'sixrveyors, construction yorkers, laborers, and
 maids. There 'are also  undocumentei workers in Brunei, many of
 whom wtotk ln co'nstruction'. While these'tie not formall'y
 discriminated against,] they usuaily'find themselves competing
 for the type of low-paying jobs which Bumiputras ho longer are
 willing to aCcept.'
