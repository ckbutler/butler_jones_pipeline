 HONDURAS
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy with a President and
 unicameral Congress elected every 4 years. In January 1990,
 National Party candidate Rafael Leonardo Callejas was
 inaugurated President following free and fair elections held
 in November 1989, marking the first time in Honduran history
 that an incumbent party peacefully turned over power to an
 opposition party. While the historically dominant military
 plays a less intrusive role in the country's civilian
 democratic Government, the Callejas administration was unable
 to ensure punishment of members of the Armed Forces who
 committed human rights abuses.
 Domestic security is the responsibility of the Armed Forces,
 including'its police branch, the Public Security Force
 (FUSEP). Major FUSEP elements include the Transit Police, the
 Customs-Police, the Order and Security Police, the Cobra
 Paramilitary Unit, and the National Department of
 Investigation (DNI). Iin addition to security, the Armed
 Forces play an important role in national political and
 economic affairs. Although they are constitutionally
 responsible to the President, the Armed Forces operate with a
 great deal of -institutional and legal autonomy, particularly
 in the realm of security and military affairs.
 With a largely agrarian economy, Honduras is one of the
 poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. Per capita
 income in 1989 was estimated to be $483, combined unemployment
 and underemployment 50 percent, illiteracy approximately 29
 percent, and inflation- over 30 percent. In March the
 Government implemented economic reforms. which are designed to
 turn the economy around in the long run, but the short term
 effects of which have been painful recession and more severe
 levels of deprivation.
 As in past years, there were credible reports that members- of
 the Armed Forces, especially, persons in the FUSEP and the DNI,
 were responsible for extrajudicial killings and the torture of
 detainees. The potential for improving the human rights
 performance and professionalization of the police is limited,
 partially because military officers are appointed to command
 positions in the police forces. The civilian Government has
 not confronted the military on these issues, as evidenced by
 the Government's appointment of a military commission to
 investigate the murder of a labor activist and a student union
 leader. The U.S. Government registered formal protests at the
 highest civilian and military levels regarding the Honduran
 Government's unwillingness to investigate and prosecute these
 cases, and cancelled FUSEP participation in a scheduled
 antiterrorism course. Leftwing terrorists were also
 responsible for human rights abuses, wounding and killing
 several-persons in two major incidents during the year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were numerous cases of extrajudicial killing in 1990
 committed by members of the police and security forces. While
 there was no evidence to suggest the complicity of either
 high-ranking administration or military officials in these
 
 
 666
 HONDURAS
 cases, when evidence pointed to military or security force
 personnel as the perpetrators, the military often tried to
 cover up the violations and failed to prosecute.
 Despite the fact that FUSEP moved toward becoming a more
 professional police force in recent years, serious
 institutional problems remain. FUSEP is still commanded by
 career army officers lacking police training who are inclined
 to condone the use of excessive force,
 By way of example, on February 17, three men who identified
 themselves as members of the Army's Special Tactical Group
 tried to murder a young couple, Jacinto Mantilla Matin and
 Ruth Idalia Zepeda Castillo. Zepeda was raped and the couple
 was then shot and left for dead. Zepeda survived and
 implicated an ex-member of the Special Tactical Group who,
 frustrated in his efforts to woo her, had been threatening to
 kill her and Mantilla. Judicial sources reported in April
 that the ex-soldier had been detained by the military, but
 FUSEP denied that any suspects had been arrested. DNI
 Director Flores stated in October that the case remained open,
 but it was unclear how actively the investigations were being
 pursued.
 On September 2, DNI agents detained merchant Jose Victoriano
 Castillo in San Lorenzo for suspicion of murder. Castillo
 spent the next 5 days in DNI cells in Choluteca where he was
 apparently tortured by two DNI agents. Upon release, he was
 put under the jurisdiction of a criminal court, held for 6.
 days in a penal center there, and then freed for lack of
 evidence. His family then took him to a medical clinic where
 they were advised to get him to a hospital in Tegucigalpa
 because of the seriousness of his injuries. He died in a
 hospital 18 days after first being detained in the DNI cells.
 In a September 21 press conference, FUSEP announced it would
 investigate charges of torture made by Castillo's stepfather.
 As of early December, there were no indications that such an
 investigation had begun.
 The ability of the Callejas administration to investigate
 human rights abuses fully and impartially was further called
 into question by its handling of two murder investigations.
 On May 31, labor leader Francisco Javier Bonilla Medina,
 former president of the Union of Workers of the Honduran
 Social Security Institute (SITRAIHSS), was gunned down by an
 unknown assailant on a Tegucigalpa street. On June 3, the
 body of Ramon Antonio Briceno, 28 year-old leader of the
 leftist University Reform Front (FRU), was discovered in a
 vacant lot in Tegucigalpa. His body bore eleven bullet
 wounds, four in the face, and showed obvious signs of
 torture. President Callejas appointed five colonels to a
 military commission to investigate the murders. The
 commission's report identified Martin Pineda Garcia, leader of
 the leftist University Revolutionary Front, as the
 intellectual author of the crime. The commission's report was
 completely and publicly discredited when the courts released
 Pineda for lack of evidence. Nevertheless, a FUSEP spokesman
 stated that the Bonilla case would remain closed: the
 commission had not reported on the Briceno case by year's
 end.
 The 1988 murder of Miguel Angel Pavon, of the nongovernmental
 Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH),
 and the 1990 murder of Jesus Ruiz Maradiaga, former CODEH
 legal advisor and activist in the National Innovation and
 
 
 667
 HONDURAS
 Unity-Social Democratic Party, remained open but unsolved at
 the end of 1990.
 Terrorists also wounded and killed several people in 1990.
 The Cinchonero People's Liberation Movement (MPL), a small
 radical leftist guerrilla group, was involved in two major
 incidents. On March 31, the MPL staged an ambush on a busload
 of U.S. Air Force engineering personnel on a highway 13 miles
 north of Tegucigalpa in which six airmen were wounded, two of
 them seriously. On August 15, the MPL assaulted a bank in El
 Zamorano. Thirteen persons were killed and four wounded in
 the gunfire exchanged between the guerrillas and the Armed
 Forces.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in 1990. Local human rights groups continued to press for an
 investigation of the more than 100 disappearances which they
 charged occurred from 1981-84 during the regime of General
 Gustavo Alvarez Martinez. These cases remain unsolved, but on
 December 1G President Callejas ordered that an in-depth
 investigation be conducted into all cases of disappearances
 that have occurred since 1980.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture and authorities
 have expressed their intention to stop the practice, physical
 abuse of detainees and prisoners continued in 1990. The most
 common form of torture was physical beating, but credible
 charges of more sophisticated techniques were also made.
 The following is illustrative of incidents in 1990 involving
 allegations of torture by security forces.
 In mid-March DNI agents arrested two of their colleagues for
 having tortured three suspected criminal offenders, including
 a woman. DNI Director Flores stated in October that both
 agents had been relieved of their duties for stealing from the
 victims and were turned over to the Military Court of First
 Instance. However, it appears they were not charged with the
 more serious crime of torture.
 Lucas Aguilera, a 58 year-old regional secretary for the
 National Campesino Union (UNC) and member of the Christian
 Democratic Party, made credible allegations that DNI'agents
 had tortured him with a "capucha" on May 13. (In the
 "capucha" method of interrogation, a hood is placed over the
 head and tightened until the prisoner, fearing suffocation,
 responds to the interrogator.) DNI authorities subsequently
 released Aguilera and apologized to him, telling him that the
 police had actually been looking for another Lucas Aguilera.
 Colonel Juan Alvarado, head of DNI at the time of Aguilera's
 detention, did not deny that torture had occurred but did
 assure the public that, if indeed Aguilera had been tortured,
 it was against police operating procedures and contrary to his
 standing orders. However, there was no indication that DNI
 authorities investigated the matter further.
 On May 29, lawyer Francisco Lagos Hollman accused the DNI of
 torturing him and holding him incommunicado for 5 days. Lagos
 said that he had been beaten, forced to walk continuously at
 night, and subjected to electric shocks. After local
 newspapers pictured Hollman displaying his bruises, a FUSEP
 
 
 668
 HONDURAS
 spokesman stated he was beaten with a gun when he resisted
 arrest.
 On October 15, two DNI agents were accidentally televised
 manhandling accused assassin Jose Manuel Guzman Martinez when
 he tried to surrender voluntarily outside the doors of the
 First Criminal Court in Tegucigalpa. In response, the
 National Congress approved a motion on October 16 calling for
 restructuring of the DNI and for acceleration of the process
 to approve legislation creating a judicial police. On
 November 15, the head of DNI's homicide section declared in
 civilian court that although he had ordered the agents to
 detain Guzman and deliver him to DNI headquarters, the two
 agents had taken his instructions too far. As of the end of
 December, the agents were being prosecuted by the civilian
 court, but only after their dishonorable discharge from the
 DNI.
 Charges of other forms of abuse following arbitary detentions
 by security forces continued to circulate during 1990,
 including credible reports of routine sexual abuse of women.
 One press report related the experience of Rosa Vitalina
 Trochez, who apparently committed suicide in February.
 Earlier she told friends and family that, after being detained
 arbitrarily by police, she was jailed and repeatedly raped for
 3 days before she was finally released.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Honduran law stipulates that a person may be arrested only
 with a court order and that he must be clearly informed of the
 grounds of arrest. Within 24 hours he must be turned over to
 the court that is to review the evidence against him. That
 court is then obligated, within 6 days, to order either the
 detainee's release or remission to a penal center to await
 trial. Bail is both available and widely used.
 Police and other security force elements continued to ignore
 these provisions in a substantial number of cases in 1990.
 Detainees were often held for much longer than the stipulated
 24 hours. Credible reports of incommunicado detention (see
 Section l.c.) and failure to comply with writs of habeus
 corpus also continued during the year. At times authorities
 avoided compliance with writs of habeus corpus by moving
 detainees between detention facilities. As in 1989, agents of
 FUSEP and DNI were responsible for most of the violations of
 the laws and regulations governing arrest and detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Honduran law provides accused persons the right to a fair
 trial, which includes the right to an initial hearing by a
 judge, to bail, to an attorney provided by the State if
 necessary, and to appeal. A defendent is considered innocent
 until proven guilty. Defendants in the military tribunals
 have the same due process rights as those being tried under
 the civilian system, with the exception of bail. The military
 tribunals have jurisdiction in cases where members of the
 Armed Forces are charged with a crime. Appeals of the
 military court's decision must be taken to the civilian
 courts. In both the civilian court system and the Armed
 Forces' separate system of military tribunals, trials are
 publicly open for the filing of evidence, but actual
 proceedings are closed. Prosecution in cases involving crimes
 by military and police force personnel is inhibited by the
 
 
 HONDURAS
 conflict between the civilian judiciary.and the military
 command. The civilian courts insist that the Constitution
 gives them the right to try such cases, but the Armed Forces
 cites the 1906 Military Code to assert exclusive jurisdiction
 over such matters. In practice, this has usually meant that
 only well-publicized military and police cases are tried by
 civilian courts, and then only after the suspects have been
 discharged from the military.
 The civilian court system in Honduras is ineffective because
 of political interference, lack of resources, and lack of
 cooperation between the police and the courts. Most members
 of the judiciary are politically appointed and are subject to
 substantial political pressure. The judiciary has only 1760
 employees' and receives just 1.6 percent of government
 revenues, about half of what it is entitled to receive under
 the Constitution. Judicial salaries are low and judges are
 poorly trained. As of June 1990, about 25 percent of
 Honduras' prison population had not been sentenced. Although
 FUSEP's investigative ability has improved in recent years,
 the evidence gathered by it in criminal cases often does not
 find its way to court. Military commanders charge that the
 courts often release common criminals through bribery or fear,
 -while the courts charge that police do not conduct proper
 investigations or fail to provide the courts- with sufficient
 evidence.
 Some progress in improving the system is being made. The
 Public Defender Program finances the hiring and training of
 law graduates to serve as public defenders. In 1989
 approximately 300 detainees were processed and released
 following intervention by a public defender. The Government
 is also hiring and training persons with law degrees to serve
 as justices of the peace and (in 1991) as judicial
 prosecutors, and is working to improve judicial procedures and
 to implement the Judicial Career Law. This 1980 law, and its
 implementing regulations, establish the merit selection and
 promotion of judicial sector employees with the exception of
 the politically appointed nine-man Supreme Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no known violations in- 1990 of the constitutionally
 protected rights to personal and family privacy and the
 inviolability of home and private communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and
 these freedoms are largely respected in practice. However,
 there have been allegations of intimidation byauthorities,
 instances of self-censorship, and payoffs to journalists. It
 is an accepted practice for the ministries and other
 government agencies to have journalists on their payroll. On
 September 5, President Callejas openly admitted that a group
 of select journalists receive an unspecified small sum of
 money in payment for facilitating publicity about his
 administration, a situation which he termed completely legal.
 In early August the Committee to Protect Journalists informed
 President Callejas of its concern about threats against
 Cadelario Reyes Garcia, a dramatist and actor who ran a weekly
 
 
 670
 HONDURAS
 radio program broadcasting news and cultural material in Santa
 Barbara. (Mr. Reyes also conducts acting workshops with
 peasant groups which at times involve themes of economic and
 social hardship in the countryside.) The Committee told
 President Callejas that Mr. Reyes had received anonymous phone
 calls in which he was told he would be killed if he did not
 stop his work. In late August, Reyes dropped the program and
 received no further calls, the source of which was never
 determined.
 The Government respects academic freedom and has not attempted
 to curtail political expression on the campus. A wide
 spectrum of political beliefs is represented both in the
 universities and in secondary schools. In 1990, after several
 years of relative calm, political confrontations on university
 campuses, especially at the National Autonomous University of
 Honduras (UNAH), increased because of internal conflict among
 rival rightwing factions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to peaceful assembly
 for political, religious, or other purposes. Generally, no
 prior authorization or permits are needed, but outdoor
 assemblies may require a permit for the purpose of
 .guaranteeing public order." Throughout 1990, demonstrations
 and rallies routinely took place without obstruction. While
 there have been a few reports of plain-clothes Public Security
 Force agents monitoring political rallies, opposition
 viewpoints are normally discussed freely and without
 consequence throughout all sectors of Honduran society.
 The Government places no restriction on the right of
 association.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While most Hondurans are Roman.Catholic, Honduras has no state
 religion and the Constitution protects all forms of religious
 expression. Foreign missionaries, many of whom belong to
 various protestant sects, are free to work and proselytize in
 all parts of the country. While the Catholic Church's
 relations with the military are considerably better than in
 the early 1980's, they are still strained, and there have been
 several reported incidents of intimidation by the military.
 There are charges that the military still intimidates the
 missionary Jesuits in El Progreso and the Passionist Order in
 Santa Rosa de Copan. In May the Presbytery of Comayagua asked
 civil and military authorities to investigate alleged death
 threats being made against several priests, robberies of
 church properties, and military investigations of the work of
 two priests. In late May the parish priest of Valle de
 Angeles reported that he was receiving death threats from
 unknown persons and that his church had been vandalized. Also
 in late May Catholic bishops from the Department of Comayagua
 condemned a military assault against the Church's radio
 station in Marcala, and another assault against a priest whose
 parked car was riddled with bullets while he was visiting a
 parish house in Opatoro. In early August the parish priest of
 Santa Rosa de Copan, Father Fausto Milla, held a press
 conference to announce that elements of the Armed Forces were
 threatening to kill him. He said that these threats first
 began in 1980 as a result of his participation in a commission
 investigating the Sumpul River massacre of May 1980, in which
 
 
 671
 HONDURAS
 approximately 300 to 600 Salvadorans were allegedly killed by
 members of the Honduran Armed Forces. While Milla stated he
 could not positively identify who was behind the current death
 threats, he suspected that it was a security agent of'the
 Armed Forces who had once threatened to kill him.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens normally enter and exit Honduras without impediment;
 exit visas are only denied when the applicant is wanted in
 connection with a crime or has not paid his taxes. Travel is
 freely permitted within the country's national borders.
 There have been no known instances of revocation of
 citizenship for political reasons.
 The refugee situation improved considerably during 1990, as
 Salvadoran refugee repatriations continued and massive
 Nicaraguan repatriations began. By March 4, close to 11,000
 Salvadorans had returned to their country of origin,
 completing the largest repatriation in the history of Central
 America. Two of the three Salvadoran camps were closed,
 leaving only Mesa Grande camp which housed approximately 2,200
 Salvadoran refugees at year's end.
 By mid-May 7,000 Nicaraguan Ladino refugees had registered for
 repatriation. On June 7 the first group of 233 Nicaraguan
 Ladino refugees left Honduras for Nicaragua, signaling the
 start of twice-weekly repatriations which continued for the
 remainder of the year. By December 4, the date of the final
 Ladino refugee repatriation, only 40 persons had chosen not to
 return to Nicaragua. Of the total 24,000 Nicaraguan refugees
 in Honduras at the beginning of the year, under 200 have
 decided not to return, requesting either permanent
 resettlement in Honduras or resettlement in a third country.
 The Government of Honduras is not expected to deny requests
 for resettlement in Honduras as long as appropriate legal
 formalities are fulfilled.
 The Nicaraguan Resistance (RN), which functioned for close to
 11 years as a guerrilla opposition force to the Sandinista
 regime, also has left. Repatriation of RN members began on
 July 5. As of November 28, the date of the last RN
 repatriation, 17,947 persons had left Honduras. Of RN members
 registered for humanitarian assistance--some 36,000--only half
 returned to Nicaragua under official auspices. As best as can
 be determined, those not registered to repatriate have already
 left on their own or have been integrated into the Honduran
 economic and social fabric.
 A few isolated instances of refugee abuse were reported. At
 the beginning of the year, a private voluntary organization
 (PVO) working in the Salvadoran camps reported that Honduran
 Armed Forces personnel harassed a truck convoy returning
 Salvadoran refugees to their country of origin. According to
 the report, the trucks were searched, refugees and
 accompanying PVO personnel were menaced, and some items were
 stolen from PVO personnel. The Government of Honduras
 attributed the incident to overly zealous local Armed Forces
 personnel. On February 28 two Nicaraguan refugees were
 deported to Nicaragua by Honduran immigration authorities.
 The refugees had been accused of damaging a vehicle belonging
 to a military official. The U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) sent a note of protest to the Honduran
 Government concerning the manner in which the case was
 
 
 672
 HONDURAS
 handled. On July 25 immigration authorities deported six
 RN-related persons who were registered under the UNHCR's
 International Commission of Support and Verification program
 in Honduras after a dispute between the six and their Honduran
 army officer landlord.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Hondurans have and exercise the right to change their
 government through democratic and peaceful means. More than
 75 percent of Honduran voters participated in the November
 1989 national election. Although international observers
 overwhelmingly judged the election to be free and fair,
 complaints from the then-ruling Liberal Party that the
 National Elections Tribunal and the National Registry of
 Persons were manipulated led to renewed calls for major
 reforms of both of these bodies. The Congress was considering
 reform legislation during the year.
 The Constitution gives the people the right to choose national
 and municipal governments by free, secret, direct, and
 obligatory balloting every 4 years. Suffrage is universal. A
 president may serve only one term, and any vice president who
 serves as acting president, even on an interim basis, is
 prohibited from running for the office of president. Except
 for members of the clergy and the Armed Forces, any citizen
 born in Honduras has the right to hold office. A new
 political party can-gain legal status when its organizers
 present a petition showing at least 10,000 member signatures;
 legal status is lost if the party fails to win at least 10,000
 votes in any election in which it participates.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperates with. local and international human
 rights organizations, both governmental and private. For
 example, U.S. members of a newly created human rights group
 named "Hondunet" visited the Central Penitentiary in
 Tegucigalpa on June 14. Honduras has agreed to accept full
 jurisdiction by the Inter-American Human Rights Court.
 The governmental Inter-Institutional Commission on Human
 Rights (CIDH), established in 1987, responds to both domestic
 and international inquiries and receives international
 visitors interested in human rights questions. Members are
 drawn from the Supreme Court, the Armed Forces, the Foreign
 Ministry, the Ministry o Government and Justice, and the
 National Congress. Because of scant resources, CIDH is
 severely limited in its ability to maintain records and to
 carry out its investigative function. Under law it can ask
 the Supreme Court to assure trial of a particular case and can
 then present judicial evidence. There are credible reports
 that it has not received full cooperation from military and
 judicial authorities.
 Best known of the local nongovernmental human rights
 organizations are the Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights in Honduras (CODEH) and its Central American-wide
 affiliate CODEHUCA. Despite a number of genuine efforts on
 behalf of human rights, CODEH's charges frequently have been
 exaggerated and ill-documented, and in some cases false.
 There were a few incidents of harassment against members of
 
 
 HONDURAS
 nongovernmental human rights organizations in 1990, but there
 was no evidence of high-level government or military
 involvement.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution expressly bans discrimination against
 citizens for reasons of race, sex, class, or any other basis.
 Strongly held cultural views and attitudes generally limit
 career opportunities for women, although women are represented
 in small numbers in most of the professions. Women have equal
 access to educational opportunities and are paid equal wages
 for equal work.
 Physical abuse of women occurs in Honduras, especially in the
 home, and reflects the male-dominant culture. There are no
 shelters expressly maintained for battered women. Although
 Honduran law offers legal redress, few women take advantage of
 the legal process. This reluctance stems from a lack of
 education and the perception that judges would be unwilling to
 apply the law vigorously. There are several women's
 organizations-in Honduras. one of the most active is the
 Confederation of Honduran Women's Clubs, which was founded in
 195L. Its goals include helping destitute women improve their
 economic situation, educating women'about their rights and the
 availability of legal resources, obtaining necessary legal
 reforms to achieve effective equality with men, and teaching
 women how to improve both their family and community lives.
 Despite the constitutional ban of discrimination for reasons
 of class, only Hondurans from the poorer class are forcibly
 recruited into the Armed Forces. In May, commenting on
 remarks made by an Armed Forces spokesman about a
 congressional initiative to eliminate the military draft, a
 high-level military official stated that the sons of the rich
 were not drafted because they could not tolerate military life
 and that the military budget did not provide for the
 life-styles to which the rich are accustomed. His remarks,
 which generated wide discussion throughout Honduran society,
 were condemned by both government and military authorities. A
 joint military/congressional commission was named to study
 forced recruitment under the Obligatory Military Service Law.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 . a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to organize themselves into labor unions.
 Labor unions have been active in Honduras- over the past 37
 years and continue to exert considerable influence, both
 economically and politically. Unions frequently participate
 in public rallies against government policies and also make
 extensive use of the media to advance their views. Urban slum
 communities are organized into community organizations, known
 as "patronatos," which have formed federations closely
 associated with the trade union movement. There were some
 incidents of violence against union members in 1990.
 The right to strike, along with a wide range of other basic
 labor rights, is provided for by the Constitution and honored
 in practice. Even though the Civil Service Code stipulates
 that public workers do not have the right to strike, no public
 or private sector strikes were declared illegal in 1990.
 
 
 HONDURAS
 The Medical Workers' Union (SITRAMEDHYS) and Chiquita
 plantation workers were the focus of labor unrest during
 1990. SITRAMEDHYS has had over 50 strikes in the last 4
 years. A 25-day medical workers' strike in July was over the
 privatization of housekeeping and related services in
 hospitals. The labor problems of Chiquita International
 culminated in a 42-day strike over demands for higher wages to
 keep up with inflation, but was also fueled by the fear that
 the company was attempting to replace the union with a
 company-sponsored "solidarity" organization. The strike ended
 when the President issued a decree permitting the company to
 hire temporary workers and ordered the military and police to
 ensure the workers' safety.
 There were four possibly politically-motivated killings of
 trade unionists during the year; all remained unsolved at
 year's end. In January an ex-leader of the National Central
 of Farm Workers (CNTC), Reynaldo Zuniga Cruz, was murdered.
 There were allegations that Zuniga was killed by authorities,
 speculation that he was a victim of an internal union dispute,
 and claims that he may have been assassinated because of a
 land dispute. In March, Denis Hernan Rodriguez Nunez of the
 Peasant Organization of Honduras was found dead. Some peasant
 leaders believe he was the victim of a fight over land, but
 the press reported that the DNI may have been involved.
 Francisco Javier Bonilla Medina, former president of the Union
 of Workers of the Honduran Social Security Institute, and
 student leader Ramon Antonio Brioeno who was also a member of
 the Central Bank Union were assassinated by unknown assailants
 in June (see Section l.a.).
 During the Chiquita strike the military specifically targeted
 the military-age children of union members for forced
 recruitment. The youths were released when the union refused
 to negotiate. Two trade unionists were arrested during the
 strike, but were released when charges against them were
 dropped. The Government was accused of meddling in the
 internal affairs of the Public Workers' Union (ANDEPH) by
 forming a progovernment parallel union board. The Government
 backed away from its intervention after a series of
 ministrikes by public workers and the threat of a general
 strike by the labor union movement.
 There are three large peasant associations directly affiliated
 with the trade unions. After decades of open hostilities, the
 Cattle Raisers' Association and several peasant organizations
 have signed an "agrarian conciliation" intended to lead to
 greater tranquility in rural areas and increased agricultural
 production. Several important peasant organizations spurned
 the accord because it does not pledge the parties to seek
 abrogation of the Anti-Terrorist Law, which is commonly used
 to evict peasant squatters. An unknown number of peasants are
 arrested annually as "subversives" under the Anti-Terrorist
 Law when in actuality they are squattbrs. President Callejas
 proposed on December 10 that the law be reformed and that some
 20 peasants now incarcerated for land seizures be granted
 amnesty. Many of those arrested complain about harsh
 treatment meted out by the FUSEP. In one instance, Lucas
 Aguilera, a well known peasant labor leader, was falsely
 accused of subversion and brutally tortured by the DNI (see
 Section i.c.).
 Honduras' trade union movement maintains close ties with
 international trade union organizations. The largest union
 group, the Confederation of Honduran Workers, is an affiliate
 
 
 HONDURAS
 of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU). The second largest, the General Workers' Central, is
 affiliated with the World Confederation of Labor. The third
 major organization, the Communist-controlled Unitary
 Federation of Honduran Workers, is affiliated with the World
 Federation of Trade Unions. The three labor organizations
 claim to represent about 20 percent of all Honduran workers,
 including a substantial number of peasants and rural
 laborers.
 A number of private firms have instituted labor/management
 "solidarity"-associations. Organized labor, including the
 American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations and the ICFTU, expresses strong opposition to
 these associations on the grounds that they do not permit
 strikes and have inadequate grievance procedures.
 Nevertheless, the membership of such associations continues to
 increase. Solidarity organizations are not formally
 recognized by the Ministry of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and to bargain collectively is protected
 by law, but not always observed in practice. Retribution by
 employers for trade union activity is not uncommon, in spite
 its prohibition in the Labor Code. There are instances where
 important companies have threatened to close down if
 unionized. Some workers claim they have been harassed and, in
 some cases, fired because of their efforts to form a trade
 union. Relatively few workers are actually dismissed for
 union activity; these cases, however, served to discourage
 other workers from attempting to organize. Workers who are
 fired may apply to the Ministry of Labor or the courts for
 redress.
 Collective bargaining agreements are the norm for companies
 where the workers are organized. In nonunionized companies,
 workers are under the protection of the Labor Code, which
 gives them right of redress to the Ministry of Labor. Wages
 in nonorganized companies are determined by labor supply and
 demand, within the constraints of the minimum wage law.
 The free trade zones are governed by the same labor
 regulations as the rest of private industry, and conditions in
 these export processing zones are generally considered
 superior to those prevailing in the rest of the country.
 Unions are active in the free trade zones, one of which is
 completely unionized. There were no strikes in the zones
 during the year, although there was unrest in one factory when
 competing labor federations vied for control of the union.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Honduras; such
 practices are prohibited by law and the Constitution. In its
 1990 report, the Committee of Experts of the International
 Labor Organization renewed a request to the Government to
 ensure that military conscripts be called upon to perform only
 work or services of a purely military character, except in
 cases of emergency.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Constitution and the Labor Code prohibit the employment of
 children under the age of 16 years. Violations of the Labor

 HONDURAS
 Code frequently occur in rural areas or in small companies.
 The Ministry of Labor has the responsibility for enforcing
 child employment laws, but it lacks the resources necessary to
 carry out the task. High unemployment and underemployment
 have resulted in many children supplementing the family income
 by working in small family farms or as street vendors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Constitution and the Labor Code require that- all labor be
 fairly paid.   Minimum wages, working hours, vacations, and
 occupational safety are all regulated, but the Ministry of
 Labor lacks the staff and other resources for effective
 enforcement. The minimum wage, revised as of October 1,
 varies by occupation and ranges from $1.20 to $2.30 per day.
 The new minimum wage is considered insufficient to provide a
 decent standard of living. Many households must pool family
 members' salaries to survive.
 The law prescribes an 8-hour day and a 44-hour workweek. The
 Labor Code provides for a paid vacation of 10 workdays after 1
 year, and 2a workdays after 4 years. The regulations are
 frequently ignored in practice as a result of the high level
 of unemployment and underemployment.
