 INDONESIA
 Indonesia, the fifth most populous country'in the world and
 the largest nation in Southeast Asia, has a population of
 around 180 million. Its "New Order" Government came to power
 in 1966 after an abortive Communist Party-backed coup.
 Authority is concentrated in a small group of retired and
 active-duty military officers and civilian technocrats under
 the leadership of President Soeharto. A partly elected,
 partly appointed Parliament serves as a forum for consultation
 on and promulgation of legislation proposed by the executive
 branch.. In reaction to the legacy of political and economic
 turmoil from the pre-1966 Sukarno days, the Government has
 established priorities of stability, economic development, and
 social equity. It has achieved some successes in each area,
 particularly in the rural sector; nevertheless, efforts to
 achieve wider distribution of economic benefits have yet to
 bridge the enormous disparities in wealth and access to
 economic advantages that development has brought. The
 Government has effectively reduced religious tensions by
 encouraging legally recognized religions to coexist in -peace.
 Faced with a diversity of ethnic, social, linguistic, and
 religious groups, Indonesian governments have sought to create
 a unique national identity and develop a governing system
 which can accommodate this diversity while assuring internal
 security and strengthening national unity. In meeting this
 challenge, the Soeharto Government has made "Pancasila" the
 national social and political ideology and the centerpiece of
 its political program. Pancasila, a centrist and eclectic
 formulation, consists of five principles: belief in one
 supreme god, belief in a just and civilized humanity,
 Indonesian national unity, democracy, and social justice. To
 accommodate the country's diversity, the Government emphasizes
 social harmony and the traditional Indonesian process of
 consultation and consensus as a major element in
 decisionmaking.
 Indonesia's mixed economy involves the State in nearly all
 sectors. Last year's collapse in world oil prices, combined
 with only modest growth in nonoil sectors of the economy kept
 real gross domestic product growth at an estimated 3 percent
 in 1987, a level at which too few new jobs are created for the
 2 million new workers who enter the workforce yearly. Ethnic
 Chinese in Indonesia are heavily represented in the small but
 economically important modern private sector, but they continue
 to face official discrimination in certain areas such as
 government employment.
 In 1987 the Government continued efforts to consolidate its
 control, to promote development, and to improve living
 standards in East Timor. Periodic skirmishes between Fretilin
 guerrillas and the army occurred with unknown but relatively
 small numbers of casualties on both sides. The Government
 continued to permit selective access to the province,
 primarily through escorted diplomatic visits.
 In Irian Jaya, Organization for a Free Papua (OPM) rebels
 continued isolated acts of violence, against both fellow
 Irianese villagers and Indonesian Government forces. The
 Government of Indonesia reported that several hundred Irianese
 who had fled to Papua New Guinea earlier returned to Irian
 Jaya.
 In 1987, though human rights abuses continued, modest
 improvements were made in several areas. These included the

 release from detention of many East Timorese previously
 suspectedofsupporting a small-scale insurgency. %On the
 negative side, reports continued of police-abuse of prisoners
 in some cases leading-to death, a-policy of "shooting to wound"
 suspected criminals in Meda, allegations of disappearances,
 and restrictions-on-thefreedoms of the press and of movement.
 Nationwide general-elections in April, while more peaceful and
 open than any in the past -15 years, were characterized -by

 a. Political Killing , ,
 In 1987 there weream reportsjof alleged "mysterious killings"
 or summary executions-of suspected criminals;,which were
 prevalent from 1982 to 1985. In Medan the local governor
 recently reaffirmed a policy of, shooting to wound',criminal
 suspects, which has in many-cases resulted in crippling.

 provinces.-,,---
 b. DisapRearance   - -  - . .      ,
 Observers believe the number bf disappearances is very small,
 but no exact figures-are -available., -Disappearances in 1987 in
 East Timor and Irian jaya are widely-believed to be at the
 hands of security or military authorities operating under
 special legal provisions exempting them from the criminal
 code. Reports are-often.-unspecifi-c and virtually impossible
 to confi-rm as the Government -rarely if ever responds to
 inquiries concerning.disappearances. One international human
 rights group-reported-in-March 1987 that 10 Timorese - . .

 Other uncohf-irmed reports .Claim several Timorese disappeared

 several .hundred disappearances ,in past years in that province
 which have never been solved. . Regularized International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) access to prisons in East
 Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia has helped to locate some
 missing persons..
 -  oxture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 'Treatment or Punishment
 While the Government afficially -does not not-condone torture
 and mistreatment, there are frequentreports that they occur.
 In 1987 tHere was at least one instance in which the
 Government discipl"ed police or security personnel for
 engaging in police brutality. Standard police treatment of
 detainees, even in-minor incidents, often results in physical
 abuse.- One international-human rights- groupts reports cite
 torture of suspected rebel sympathizers in East Timor at the
 hands of. military forces. A policy of "shoot-to-wound"
 practiced against alleged criminals allegedly attempting to
 elude arrest, instituted in North Sumatra in 1985-, continued
 throughout 19a7. According to local press reports of several
 
 
 703
 INDONESIA
 such incidents each month, all were allegedly shot in the
 legs, several repeatedly. Occasionally victims have died from
 their wounds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 While December 1981 Criminal Procedures Code (KUHAP) contains
 protections against arbitrary arrest and detention and
 specifies the right of prisoners to legal counsel and
 notification of family, in practice these safeguards
 frequently are not respected. Emergency security provisions
 permit exceptions under which arrests and detentions may be
 made by the Command for the Restoration of Security and Order
 (KOPKAMTIB). The provisions of KUHAP are honored more often
 in urban areas than in small towns or remote'provinces. The
 authorities are known to make arrests for intimidation or to
 inhibit activities they do not wish to take place. Such
 arrests may have little or no legal basis, but there are no
 legal mechanisms for redress of grievances.
 Indonesian law does not provide for the right of habeas corpus
 or its equivalent. KOPKAMTIB has wide powers to detain and
 interrogate persons thought to endanger national security.
 These special powers supersede the criminal code provisions
 and apply particularly to what KOPKAMTIB considers cases of
 suspected subversion, sabotage, secession, Qr corruption.
 Arrests or detentions made under these powers are rarely, if
 ever, made public. Persons arrested and held under KOPKAMTIB
 provisions have no legal right to protection or legal aid.
 Precise numbers of persons detained without trial are
 unavailable. Human rights observers believe there may be as
 many as 500 throughout Indonesia. In 1Y87 the last remaining
 Timorese held on Atauro Island for suspected support of
 Fretilin were returned to their villages, where they remain
 under the close supervision of local authorities. Other
 Timorese exiled from their villages several years ago were
 permitted to return to their original homes in 1987. No
 reports charge the use of forced labor in Indonesia in recent
 years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As government employees, judges in Indonesia come under the
 jurisdiction of the executive branch, which greatly affects
 the independence of thi judiciary. The Minister of Justice
 announced in 1987 that local prosecutors will have authority
 in their district to discipline attorneys whose behavior is
 deemed inappropriate. Corruption also permeates the Indonesian
 legal system. In criminal proceedings, defendants are
 frequently able to buy their way out of prosecution at various
 stages of the proceedings. In civil cases, court decisions
 are sometimes influenced by the payment of bribes. In response
 to these abuses, the Government from time to time has taken
 action against particularly flagrant offenders, but by and
 large these practices continue unchecked.
 In cases involving what could be defined broadly as "security"
 issues, particularly instances in which persons are being
 tried under the subversion provisions of 1963, the accused are
 rarely, if ever, found innocent. In all such security-related
 cases, it is widely believed the Government will ensure
 conviction irrespective of the evidence presented in court;
 such convictions are aided by the court's ability to restrict
 evidence presented by the defence. Although thb Government
 
 
 704
 INDONESIA
 has not announced-data on the number of persons serving
 sentences for subversion, one reliable estimate suggests there
 may be several hundred. Several subversion trials took place
 in 1987, most related to alleged Muslim extremist activity.
 The accused were always found guilty.
 As a result of increasing crime rates and shortages of
 judicial personnel, trials are frequently delayed. A three-
 judge panel conducts trials,-hearing evidence, deciding guilt
 or innocence, Ond~assessing punishment. Although the right of
 appeal .is not absolute, it is observed in most cases. Initial
 judgments  re rarelyoreversed, although sentences are
 occasionally..reduced. Most court sessions are open to the
 public, and mosf defendants, if they can pay, have access to
 counsel. -If-destitute, defendants can find private legal help
 such as that .provided by the Legal Aid-Institute, but no direct
 system exists for public funding of court-appointed attorneys
 for those unable-to afford legal
 assistance.
 In May. the Government revoked for 1-year the lawyer's license
 of well-known human riqhtA activist Adnan.Buyung Nasution for
 alleged contempt of-court duriug t ie 1985-86 trial-of retired
 General H.R. Dharsono. "Tbe Government acknowledges that there
 was no contempt of court law at-the time, but based its actions
 on law 2 of  986 which empowers the Minister of Justice to-
 discipline members of -thelegal.,profession.

 blotted out of foreign-news. photos and advertising. No laws
 prohibit skeaking Chinese, but the Government lays heavy
 strens, on-the learning and- use of the national language,
 Bahasa Indonesia, to promote nationa. unity.
 Section 2 'Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a-. Freedom of Apeech and Press          .        �
 There are significant restrictions on, freedom of- speech and
 press-. The Constitution gives Parliament the authority td
 legislate these.-estrictions.- In recent years, Parliament has
 helped create  ,body.of law delimiting the rights of
 individiali.-and of4 the Government. In the absence of
 implementing-.regulati-ons for many of these laws, different
 
 
 705
 INDONESIA
 government agencies frequently interpret them as they choose.
 The result is that these agencies have considerable
 discretionary authority in the field of civil liberties, e.g.,
 freedom of the press and speech. Governmental concern about
 public statements or publications which could be perceived as
 critical of the Government, and therefore threatening to the
 nation's stability, is a major factor inhibiting the exercise
 of free speech and press. Opposition groups are generally
 free to meet privately and formulate views, but they are
 inhibited from disseminating them publicly because of media
 reluctance to risk official disapproval or because of informal
 government instructions not to publish the opinions of or news
 about prominent opposition figures. As in past years,
 authorities provided general topic guidelines to Muslim
 speakers during the Muslim holidays, when preachers addressed
 large gatherings. In a few instances, preachers who went
 beyond these guidelines were arrested.
 The general lack of specific, clear guidelines on what is
 permissible has generated a significant degree of
 self-censorship both in public speaking. and in the press.
 School faculties sometimes refrain from producing materials,
 including dissertations, which they believe might provoke
 government displeasure. Publishers also are unwilling to
 accept manuscripts dealing with controversial issues. Foreign
 books critical of the Government or dealing with sensitive
 topics, such as human rights, similarly are avoided by
 importers. Foreign periodicals, readily available in
 Indonesia, are scrupulously censored by their private
 importers in order to avoid government confiscation of the
 materials. With few exceptions this self-censorship is
 thorough and effectively responds to government concerns.
 The press is largely privately owned. While espousing a
 "free" press, the Government expects the media to be
 "responsible" by supporting national economic development
 goals and domestic stability. The Government closely monitors
 the media for material it finds unacceptable. In such
 instances, editors or journalists routinely receive oral
 instructions from government officials about news which cannot
 be reported. Articles and editorials do address sensitive
 issues, however, and journalists sometimes have wide latitude
 within the vaguely defined limitations.
 Nonetheless very real limits exist. In June 1987 the
 Government closed down a relatively new and bold daily,
 Prioritas, for speculative reports which the Government said
 could cause unrest. Other journals received oral warnings to
 avoid printing "speculative" articles which could "create
 uncertainty and confusion among the public." The Government
 permitted Suara Pembaruan, the successor to Sinar Harapan, a
 Jakarta daily banned in 1986, to begin publishing with much of
 the same staff as the earlier paper.
 The Government established highly stringent regulations for
 foreign correspondents wishing to report on the general
 election campaign in 1987. Visas for correspondents to cover
 the campaigns were either late in coming or, in some instances,
 refused. In the spring of 1987, the Government declined to
 issue a visa to a New York Times correspondent. In mid-1987
 the Government refused to renew the residence visas for two
 correspondents of the Far Eastern Economic Review, the third
 year in a row that that journal's correspondents have not been
 able to remain in Indonesia. One Australian journalist was
 
 
 706
 INDONESIA
 permitted into. the country, the first since Australian
 journalists were banned in April 1986-
 The Attorney General banned several books, both foreign and
 Indonesian. A singlb government-operated television network
 broadcasts, although television signals from neighboring
 countries are- received in some parts of Indonesia. The more
 than 400 ,private radio stations may use only government-
 provided programs for news.,-
 b. 8Freedom of- Peaceful Assembly. ani' Association
 Regional and ,.tional meetings of virtually all organizations
 must have government permission, and local jurisdictions often
 require prior-approval, for smaller  gatherings as well. While
 such approval, is usually -granted local aithorities -can and do
 withhold permission. Student gatherings, are, frequently the
 target of such disapprovals. In East Timor the local
 Government usually-authorizes public assembly. for social and
 ceremonial events and, as-long as. there is no perceived
 security risk. .grants political parties permission to meet
 publicly.
 The 1985 "social -organizations" law <known as the "Ormas
 Law")t Mhich requires .al -organlzations, including religious
 orders and- assciations; 'to adhere to-the state ideology of

 INDONESIA
 is initiated, criteria for establishing the qualifications of
 union officers, and procedures and safeguards for union
 elections. It is now explicitly forbidden to prejudice or to
 harass any employee because of his union membership. Strikes
 in the private sector are permitted by law, though officially
 discouraged. Notification to the Government of a strike call
 is required, but not prior government approval. Some 90,000
 man-hours were lost through strike action in the first half of
 1986. In a series of significant strikes during 1987, no
 punitive action was taken against striking workers.
 The SPSI provides representation in the Workers' Delegation to
 the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The constitutional guarantees of religious freedom apply only
 to those religions recognized by the State--Islam, Buddhism,
 Christianity, and Hinduism. Although the Indonesian population
 is overwhelmingly Muslim, the practice and teaching of the
 other recognized faiths are permitted. A plethora of mystical
 and folk religions and sects also exists; a number of these
 have been banned, affecting perhaps 20,000 adherents, while
 government leaders actually encourage others. While the
 Government tolerates private practice of banned religions,
 local authorities occasionally harass adherents of such
 groups. The legal requirement to accept Pancasila as
 governing ideology extends to all religious, as well as
 secular, organizations.
 A 1972 letter of the Supreme Prosecutor reiterated a
 presidential decree of 1962 banning membership in Jehovah's
 Witnesses and the Baha'i Faith. From time to time authorities
 harass or discriminate against Baha'is for their religious
 beliefs, and several have been strongly pressured to convert
 to Islam. Because the first tenet of Pancasila specifies
 belief in a supreme being, atheism is forbidden. Some
 animists in remote parts of Indonesia have reportedly been
 pressured to convert to Islam or Christianity to fulfill the
 requirement of belief in a supreme being. No legal bars
 forbid religious conversion, and conversions between faiths do
 occur. However, proselytizing in heavily Islamic areas is
 seen as potentially disruptive and is.discouraged. The
 Government restricts activities of foreign missionaries, some
 of whom face difficulty in obtaining or renewing visas or
 residence permits, to encourage the employment of Indonesian
 citizens. Their work is also subject to the funding
 stipulations of the Ormas Law discussed above. In other
 areas, missionary activities are relatively unimpeded and in
 fact are welcomed in remoter districts, where government
 resources in fields such as education and health are
 insufficient.
 Official holidays include Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist, as
 well as Muslim holy days. Indonesian Muslims, Christians, and
 Buddhists maintain active links with coreligionists inside and
 outside Indonesia. Travel to religious gatherings is
 permitted. Hajj trips to Mecca are available only through
 government-organized and priced tours. The Government permits
 a set number of pilgrims to make the hajj annually.
 
 
 708
 INDONESIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the-Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are some restrictions on movement within Indonesia. The
 Government requires' permits to change residence in certain
 areas, primarily to control the further shift of population
 from rural to urban locations. Since 1958-59, noncitizen
 ethnic Chlnes have-been'denied the right to-live in rural
 areas of Java. 'Restrictions exist on movement to and within
 East Timor and within parts of Irian Jaya. The Government has
 relocated many rural East Timorese living in the central and
 eastern parts of the province since 1979 to isolate them from
 Fretilin rebels and, according to the Government, to 'acilitate
 their access to health, education, and other government
 services. Most Timorese require permission to travel outside
 their home districts (Kecamatan). In some areas of East Timor
 residents-may-not':ftrm beyond their immediatevillage area,
 and are restticted to their village itself during military
 openations in the area.
 Former political detainees.associated-with thed'abortive 1965

 movements, may not change their place of residence without
 official permission, and have restrictions placed on their
 employment.- ;Members!-or alleged supporters of the Communist

 of the PKI and some 20 million members of its front groups.

 and reconfirmed Indonesia's policy of asylum. Observers
 believe, however, that "push offs" continue to take place.
 No reports in 1987 cited large numbers of residents of the
 province of Irian Jaya crossing into Papua New Guinea.

 Several hundred Irianese who had crossed into Papua New Guinea
 in past years returned to Irian Jaya voluntarily.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government's authority is largely concentrated in the
 hands of a small group of active-duty and retired military
 officers and civilian technocrats led by President Soeharto.
 This system ensures the continued preeminence of the military
 in all fields of governmental activity. The Parliament,
 political parties, and the general public have little ability
 to influence government decisions or to change the system or
 its leadership.
 Parliament considers laws presented to it by government
 departments and agencies but does not draft laws on its own.
 The Government seeks to resolve any potential parliamentary
 concerns before the bills are officially presented.
 Parliament can and does change the text and occasionally the
 intent of bills it reviews. Bills of major significance are
 often passed with little or no alteration.
 A 1975 law allows three political parties. One of these is
 -made up of four former Muslim political parties, and another
 of former nationalist and Christian parties. Party leaders
 are approved or named by the Government, and party activities
 are closely scrutinized and often guided by government
 authorities. These factors weaken the parties' election
 prospects and diminish their ability to represent effectively
 their constituents' concerns to the Government. The third,,
 Golkar, is a longstanding, government-sponsored organization
 of functional groups which -serves a role similar to that of a
 political party. The two parties and Golkar are prohibited
 from organizing and operating officially below the district
 level except during election campaigns. This system gives
 Golkar an advantage, since its civil service members have
 constant access to small towns and villages because of their
 official duties. In the 1987 general election, Golkar won 73
 percent of the vote.
 Elections for Parliament, held every 5 years, took place on
 April 23, 1987. All adult citizens, except active-duty
 members of the armed forces and convicted criminals serving
 prison sentences, are eligible to vote. Voters cast ballots
 for party lists of candidates for national, district, and
 local assemblies. Voting is not mandatory, but strong social
 pressures ensure participation. Protest votes take the form
 of blank or deliberately spoiled ballots. Allcivil servants
 and employees of government-owned institutions, such as the
 large state banks, and their families, must join Golkar. In
 addition, students in public schools and universities, as well
 as the general public, are strongly urged to support Golkar.
 All government employees are expected to vote for Golkar.
 Polls are set up outside government offices, government-owned
 institutions, and schools, and civil servants and students are
 expected to vote at their place of employment rather than in
 their home neighborhood. The two political parties formally
 complained of polling irregularities including multiple voting
 by Golkar supporters, incorrect vote tallies, and obstacles to
 voting faced by non-Golkar supporters. Many observers
 reported coercion or intimidation, especially in government
 organizations, to ensure votes were cast for Golkar. The
 Government has not announced its response to or investigation
 of claims of voting irregularities.
 
 
 710
 INDONESIA
 All candidates for election we're required to pass tigorous
 government scrutiny -f their suitability, and many proposed
 candidates were dropped from the final approved list. Golkar
 and the two parties headed their Candidates list with
 "votegetters," popular or well-known figures who agreed to be
 candidates to attract votes, but who, should they be elected,
 would not srv6'but turn their seat over to the next candidate
 on the list. While the public is awsare of this system;'at no
 time were votegetters identified to enable voters to determine
 who in 'iact might' reptesdnt them ii a ceitixr district.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Some women enjoy a high degree of economic and social
 freedom. Women occupy important midlevel positions in the
 civil service, educational institutions, labor unions, the
 military, the professions, and private business and the 1983
 Cabinet included two women. However although legislation
 guarantees women equal treatment, women seldom receive equal
 pay for equal work. In addition to a government-sponsored
 women's organization in which membership and participation are
 mandatory, several voluntary, private groups work to advance
 women's legal, economic, and political rights. Chief among
 these is KOWANI (Congress of Indonesian'Women), an umbrella
 organization for Some 55 women's groups.
 Strong official and informal discrimination affects people of
 Chinese ancestry resident in Indonesia. Ethnic Chinese are
 pressured to take Indonesian names. While encouraged to
 become citizens, some Chinese find legal avenues to citizenship
 blocked or are discouraged by the time-consuming and expensive
 task of obtaining citizenship documents. Chinese who have
 been unable to obtain Indonesian citizenship can lose their
 right to residence should they be abroad for a period of more
 than 3 months. Government regulations prohibit the operation
 of all-Chinese schools and institutions of higher learning,
 teaching in Chinese languages, the formation of exclusively
 Chinese cultural groups or trade associations, and the use of
 Chinese characters on signboards or in publications. A 1979
 State Intelligence Coordinating Board letter bans Chinese-
 language courses by private institutions. However, social and
 religious groups which are, in effect, all-Chinese are not
 proscribed and do exist.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 New regulations published in-February 1987 provide protection
 for children between the ages of 7 and 14, who often must work
 to support themselves and their families. The workday for
 these children is limited to 4 hours per day, and their
 employers are required to see that the children are attending
 school. The Basic Labor Law of 1948 established an 8-hour
 day, 48-hour week; 1 rest day per week, and a definite
 vacation period. An extensive body of labor law and
 ministerial regulations provide for minimum standards of
 industrial health and safety, but they are not enforced
 effectively. Indonesian law provides that the Department of
 Manpower office in each region shall, at regular intervals,.
 establish a minimum wage for its particular region. The range
 of regional minimum wages-rose by an average of 13 percent
 from 1985 to 1986. The Departhent of Manpower and the Central
 Statistical Office also report'for each region a minimum
 physical needs figure.
 Wages of many workers in the modern sector exceed minimum wage
 figures, and the Government and labor unions state they are
 working to raise minimum wages to meet minimum physical needs'
 figures. Observance of the minimum wage regulations varies
 from sector to sector and region to region. Reliable figures
 on the total compliance situation do not exist.
