 LATVIA*
 An independent Baltic state between the two World Wars, Latvia
 was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and became a
 constituent republic of the U.S.S.R. The United States does
 not recognize the forcible incorporation of Latvia into the
 U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Latvia is subjected to the same
 centralized rule, the same Constitution and judicial system,
 the same restrictions on civil and political liberties, and
 the same police controls as the republics in the Soviet
 Union. Moreover, Soviet policy toward the Latvian nation
 arouses grave concern because the process of russification
 threatens its survival as a distinct ethnic group. The influx
 of Slavic settlers has reduced the proportion of Latvians in
 Latvia to only 53 percent of the total population.
 Human rights violations continued in 1984 as police harassed
 and imprisoned Latvian national, religious, and human rights
 activists. Any expression of national rights is harshly
 repressed. The state of religious liberty has deteriorated as
 the Soviet authorities harass the clergy and lay leaders of
 several faiths. Latvians active in human rights issues have
 likewise been punished with prison sentences.
 Like the other Baltic states, Latvia is regarded as
 economically better off than most areas of the Soviet Union.
 As an industrial workshop and trading center, it has become a
 significant producer of industrial goods. Key indicators of
 agricultural production have risen in 1984, although shortages
 of food are frequent.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Official responsibility for the deaths of persons involved in
 human rights activities is difficult to establish. Soviet
 persecution of Latvian activists, however, may lead to their
 deaths. During a republic-wide series of raids in 1983 by
 Soviet officials on the houses of Latvian human rights
 activists, six Latvians were arrested, one of whom died of an
 apparent heart attack.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 Throughout the Soviet system, cruel and inhuman treatment of
 political prisoners occurs during both interrogation and
 confinement to labor camp, prison, or psychiatric hospital.
 * Given Soviet control over all aspects of life in Latvia, the
 human rights abuses described in the report on the U.S.S.R.
 apply also to Latvia. This report discusses only instances of
 repression specific to Latvia.

 LATVIA
 Physical and psychological abuse of prisoners is common, as is
 detention under extremely unhealthy or otherwise onerous
 conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet legal provisions are written and interpreted so broadly
 that Latvians may be arrested and convicted for exercising
 what are in effect internationally recognized human rights.
 An example is Zanis Skudra, who is serving a 12-year sentence
 apparently for compiling and disseminating a photographic
 record of Latvia's churches since the Soviet annexation.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As in the Soviet Union, Communist Party control of society is
 exercised in political cases to negate constitutional
 guarantees of the objectivity and independence of the judicial
 process. No rights of a defendant override the
 self-determined compelling needs of the state.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Through the use of informers, mail censorship, electronic
 monitoring of telephones, and other devices, government
 authorities have the ability to interfere in every aspect of
 personal life. Constitutional guarantees to the contrary,
 Soviet investigative agencies do not abstain from forced entry
 and illegal searches. Contacts between Latvians and foreign
 visitors are strongly discouraged, and those who indulge in
 such contacts are subject to official harassment.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for mosf internationally accepted
 political liberties as long as their exercise accords with the
 strengthening and security of the socialist system. In
 practice, the authorities do not tolerate freedom of speech
 and press or any dissident behavior. Six Latvians were
 arrested in 1983 for 'anti-state activities* during searches
 of 50 homes of persons suspected of being dissidents. One of
 them, Lidiya Lasmane-Doronina, was imprisoned for the third
 time. She had been helping the wives and families of
 political prisoners.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of association is provided for in the Constitution,
 but the authorities strictly control all associations and
 organizations. Latvians peacefully celebrating Latvian
 Independence Day are subject to arrest, and foreigners
 visiting their Latvian relatives are frequently interrogated
 and harassed.
 Soviet labor law and practice are enforced in Latvia.
 Although the Constitution guarantees all Soviet citizens the
 right to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise
 this right independently of state-sponsored and controlled
 unions have been brutally repressed. Given Soviet concern
 that the ideas of the Polish Solidarity movement might spread,
 this has been especially true in the Baltic states.

 C. Freedom of Religion
 Despite constitutional guarantees, religious activity is the
 subject of systematic official harassment. Although Soviet
 authorities acquiesced in the elevation of Bishop Julian
 Vaivods, a Latvian, to the College of Cardinals in Rome in
 1983, religious liberty continues to be severely abridged.
 A Roman Catholic priest complained during a sermon in Riga in
 1982 of the restrictions on the number of priests which compel
 some to serve as many as 17 parishes simultaneously.
 Soviet internal security agents are reported to have raided
 several religious congregations in 1983 and interrogated and
 threatened the members. In 1984, groups of Latvian Catholics
 traveling to neighboring Lithuania for the religious festival
 honoring Saint Casimir were harassed and turned back by Soviet
 authorities.
 Members of the Roman Catholic, Baptist, and Adventist churches
 appear to have encountered more difficulties with the
 authorities than the larger Lutheran Church, perhaps because
 of their outspokenness.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Soviet authorities do not respect the right of emigration.
 The granting of permission to emigrate from Latvia is
 arbitrary and subject to increasing restrictions. The
 authorities harass Latvians whose desire to emigrate is known
 and cause their living conditions to deteriorate in order to
 discourage emigration applications. In 1984 Zakhar Zunshaine
 was charged with 'anti-Soviet slander' and sentenced to a
 labor camp when he publicly protested the fact that for
 several years he had been refused permission to emigrate to
 Israel. A Latvian with a claim to U.S. citizenship, Arthur
 Zarins, has been seeking exit permission since 1947.
 Currently there are 60 families on the list of those
 repeatedly refused permission to emigrate to Israel, some of
 whom have been trying to obtain permission for 10 years.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Non-Communist Latvians have almost no opportunity to
 participate meaningfully in the political process. Communist
 Party and governmental authorities in Latvia are severely
 limited in their ability to advance national interests, if
 they should choose to do so. In 1958, a movement within the
 Latvian Communist Party sought to avert further russification
 through educational reforms, replacement of Russian party
 officials by native Latvians, and limits on Latvian industrial
 growth, in order to preclude the need for massive immigration
 by Slavic settlers. Alarmed by this threat to Moscow's
 control, the Soviet authorities removed the movement's
 leadership and carried out a sweeping purge intended to root
 out party members with nationalist tendencies down to the
 level of school principals. In 1972, 17 Latvian Communist
 Party members sent an appeal to West European Communists
 complaining again of the russification of Latvia's political
 and tconomic structure and the submersion of the Latvian
 language.

 LATVIA
 Latvians have the lowest proportion of Communist Party
 membership of the three Baltic states. In 1973, ethnic
 Latvians comprised only 43 percent of all party members in
 Latvia. Latvians are thus a minority in the only legal
 political party in their country. Political activity outside
 the Communist Party is not tolerated. Recently the party has
 acted against persons connected directly or indirectly to the
 Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party, which is based in
 Stockholm and which is descended from the principal leftwing
 political party at the time of Latvia's independence. Among
 the victims of this campaign were Juris Bumeisters and Dainis
 Lismanis, sentenced in May 1981 to 15 and 10 years'
 imprisonment, respectively, on charges of *betrayal of the
 motherland;' Valdis Vinkelis, 70 years of age, who died in a
 prison hospital following his arrest in March 1981; and his
 nephew, Juris Vinkelis, sentenced in January 1982 to two years
 in prison for circulating literature published abroad. In May
 1981, the underground Social Democratic Party distributed a
 leaflet calling for independence, restoration of democratic
 rights, and an end to russification.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government rejects any foreign criticism of its
 human rights record, maintaining that all internationally
 recognized human rights are fully protected. Its attitude
 toward investigation of the human rights situation in Latvia
 is uncompromisingly negative.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Since its annexation, Latvia has become an industrial workshop
 and trading center for the Soviet Union. Soviet authorities
 have emphasized investment in heavy industry, and industrial
 output has increased enormously between 1940 and 1984.
 Because of Latvia's small labor force and very low birth rate,
 the effect of this disproportionate investment in industry has
 been to produce a massive influx of Slavic workers from
 elsewhere in the Soviet Union.
 During the same period, agricultural production has increased
 by a modest one and a half times. The relative
 underinvestment in agriculture has brought about chronic
 shortages of food, particularly meat and dairy products, in a
 country that exported such.products during its years of
 independence. In 1983 and the first 6 months of 1984, meat,
 milk, and egg production increased significantly. However,
 these increases come on the heels of an absolute decline in
 the production of these goods in 1982. Moreover, while meat,
 milk, and eggs were more readily available in local retail
 outlets during 1984, fish and fresh produce sales were sharply
 lower. The average diet remains low in protein. According to
 official data,'investment funds for agriculture grew
 significantly in the last 2 years.
 Although Latviana still appear to be better off than the
 people of the Soviet Union, deterioration in housing, schools,
 roads, hospitals, and factories is readily visible.
 The large proportion of non-Latvians in the population, along
 with cultural censorship and an imposed ideology, has placed
 the Latvian culture and language in jeopardy. With a
 
 
 1031
 LATVIA
 population of 2.5 million, Latvia has absorbed 600,000 Slavic
 settlers, more than the other Baltic states. This
 in-migration, according to Soviet statistics, is continuing at
 the rate of 12,000 a year. Latvians are close to becoming a
 minority in their own land and already comprise less than 40
 percent of the population of their capital, Riga. Lacking an
 internal rallying point, such as the Roman Catholic Church
 provides for Lithuanians, or a nearby external point of
 cultural affinity, as Finland is for Estonians, Latvians face
 worsening difficulties in their efforts to preserve and
 refresh their cultural traditions.
