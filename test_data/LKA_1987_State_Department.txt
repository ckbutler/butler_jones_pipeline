 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka has a multiparty, constitutional, parliamentary form
 of government. Beginning in 1983, it suffered the tragic
 results of accelerating violence between its majority
 Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities. On July 29 Sri
 Lankan President Jayewardene and Indian Prime Minister Gandhi
 signed a Peace Accord aimed at ending the Sri Lankan conflict,
 but radicals from both ethnic communities have refused to
 accept the Accord, and high levels of violence persist.
 Sri Lanka's 1978 Constitution provides for a strong president
 and a unicameral parliament elected by universal adult
 suffrage. The then-Prime Minister and leader of the ruling
 United National Party (UNP), J.R. Jayewardene, became
 President in 1978 and was reelected in 1982. The term of the
 UNP-majority Parliament elected in 1977 was extended 6 years
 by a national referendum in 1982. Under the terms of the
 Accord and its implementing legislation, significant powers
 held by the Central Government are to be devolved to newly
 created Provincial Councils in all Sri Lanka's provinces.
 Sri Lanka has 34,000 servicemen in its army, navy, and air
 force and 16,000 men in its police force, which includes over
 1,200 police commandoes in the Special Task Force (STF).
 Although there are a few Tamils and Tamil-speaking Muslims in
 the security forces, the overwhelming majority are Sinhalese-
 speaking. They and the largely Hindi-speaking IPKF have
 communications problems with residents in Sri Lanka's north
 and east, which are thought to have contributed to human
 rights abuses. Sri Lanka also had about 20,000 Sinhalese and
 Muslim part-time militiamen, known as "home guards", who
 operated in parts of the north and east until the Accord,
 after which all of those in the Northern and Eastern Provinces
 were disbanded. Some 8,000 home guards remained in the other
 seven provinces. Informed observers singled out the home
 guards and the STF commandoes in particular as being
 responsible for numerous human rights abuses again in 1987.
 A developing country, Sri Lanka has achieved a high quality of
 life for its population of 16,400,000 despite low per capita
 income which in 1986 was only $363. Tea and garment exports
 are the largest sources of foreign exchange. Approximately 60
 percent of Sri Lanka's productive capacity is state owned or
 controlled.
 Since Sri Lanka's independence in 1948, the leaders of the
 island's two main ethnic groups have discussed ways to
 safeguard the interests of the Tamil minority while redressing
 the grievances of the Sinhalese majority stemming from the
 colonial period. By the mid-1970's, some Tamil leaders
 concluded that separation of the Tamil-majority areas and
 formation of an independent Tamil state, or "Eelam," was the
 only solution, and some Tamils formed militant groups which
 turned to armed struggle and terrorism to achieve such a state.
 Tensions between the two communities came to a head in 1983
 when Tamil militant attacks in the north produced a backlash
 in Colombo, where at least 387 people, mostly Tamil, were
 killed. These events led to widespread violence and escalated
 military conflict which continued in 1987.
 Discussions involving the Government, Indian mediators, and
 Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) members began in June
 1986 and ultimately resulted in the July 29 Accord. The Tamil,
 militants refused to join these talks. The strongest Tamil
 militant group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE),
 
 
</pre>
<pre>

 SRI LANKA
 refused to accept the Accord or turn in its weapons. This led
 to armed clashes between the LTTE and the Indian Peacekeeping
 Force (IPKF), provided under the Accord at the Sri Lankan
 Government's request, to prevent the Accord from unraveling.
 There continued to be serious human rights abuses in Sri Lanka
 in 1987. Tamil militant groups continued to assassinate Tamil
 opponents and Sinhalese and Muslim civilians to pursue their
 political ends. In the Sinhalese-majority south, Sinhalese
 radicals opposing the Accord assassinated over 100 government
 supporters during the last 4 months of 1987. Also, at year's
 end, there were reports of excesses against civilians resident
 in the north and east by members of the IPKF. Finally, there
 were numerous and credible accusations of human rights
 violations by the Sri Lankan security forces and police against
 Tamils in the north during the first half of the year, and
 against suspected Sinhalese radicals in the south following
 the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord.
 Ironically, during a year marked by the signing of a peace
 agreement aimed at providing a lasting solution to the
 communal problem, m6re Sri Lankans were killed or injured than
 in any year since independence. Many residents of the Northern
 Province were killed or displaced as a result of two military
 offensives, one in May by the Sri Lankan military and another
 in October by the IPKF; many residents of the Sinhalese-
 majority south were killed in terrorist bombings or political
 assassinations; many inhabitants of the Eastern Province were
 killed or driven from their homes by Tamil separatists. There
 continued to be reliable reports of torture and disappearance,
 especially before the Accord. The Prevention of Terrorism Act
 (PTA) and the Emergency Regulations (ER) remained in effect
 throughout 1987. During the first 10 weeks after the July 29
 Accord, about 4,000 persons, out of the 5,400 detained under
 these laws, were released, but the releases were suspended
 when the LTTE failed to release the 8 Sri Lankan soldiers it
 held and refused to turn over its weapons as called for by the
 Accord. In the last few months of the year, the Sri Lankan
 forces and the IPKF detained others, bringing the number held,
 according to nongovernmental estimates, to about 3,000. The
 Government dropped about 500 PTA and ER cases pending under
 the PTA and ER by mid-July, but resumed filing indictments in
 mid-October. There were about 200 persons convicted and
 serving sentences under the PTA or ER at year's end. Press
 censorship was imposed for 48 days in 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Incltding
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Deaths from politically motivated violence arising from the
 communal problem as well as from antigovernment activity rose
 to a new high in 1987. However, extensive military activity
 and disruption of civil administration in the north and east,
 especially during the last few months of the year, made
 collection of accurate statistics difficult. The Government
 estimates that approximately 2,800 people were killed during
 the year. These included 344 members of the security forces
 killed by Tamil militants in the north and east and 7 by
 Sinhalese radicals in the south, 710 Tamil militants killed by
 government forces and 924 killed by the IPKF, and 824
 civilians killed by militants in the north and east and 110 by
 
 
 1302
 SRI LANKA
 Sinhalese radicals in the south. Other observers estimate
 that 4,200 persons were killed, including 300 Sri Lankan
 servicemen, 300 IPKF members, 1,000 Tamil militants, and 100
 Sinhalese radicals. At least twice as many Sri Lankans were
 wounded as were killed in politically motivated violence.
 From A983 to mid-1987, the Government tried to put an end to
 the Tamil insurgency using its armed forces and police.
 Following the July 29 Accord, Indian troops took on this task,
 with the xesults unclear at year's end. Antigovernment
 violence in the south also increased during 1987--by Tamil
 militants before the July Accord and by Sinhalese radicals
 after the Accord was signed. As in previous years, there were
 credible reports of extrajudicial killings by members of the
 government security forces, particularly in the Eastern
 Province., before the July Accord. Following a pattern set in
 19183, no results of official inquiries into these incidents
 were published, nor was disciplinary or judicial action taken
 against any member of the security forces accused of human
 rights abuses.
 b. Disappearance
 There has been continuing concern since 1983 about Tamils,
 usually young men, who have disappeared while in the custody
 of the Government. Amnesty International published in June
 1987 its second special report on disappearances in Sri Lanka.
 Counting the 272 cases documented in its 1986 report, Al
 listed 500 Sri Lankans as having disappeared in the 4 years
 prior to the Peace Accord while in, the custody of the security
 forces. Over 300 disappearance cases were presented to the
 United Nations Human Rights Committee Working Group on Enforced
 or Involuntary Disappearances, which has referred the cases to
 Sri Lanka for investigation. Of these cases, only 27 have
 been resolved satisfactorily.
 The Government cites several factors which -omplicated the
 task of -accounting for disappeared persons. These are that
 (a) arrested persons sometimes gave a felse name to conceal
 from authorities their true identity and affiliations; (b)
 some of the disappeared were possibly among those--whose names
 the Government does not know--seeki-ng-political asylum in
 -Western countries; and (c) many, if not most, of the large
 numbers of young men rounded up by the security forces usually
 were released within a few hours, and some of those probably
 departed Sri Lanka without returning to their homes.
 Local sources reported that well over 200 persons disappeared
 during 1987, almost all of them from the Batticaloa and
 Amparai Eastern Province districts, which brings the total of
 disappeared persons over the past 4 years to over 1,000,
 according to these sources. In many cases, detained persons
 who were subsequently released reported having seen a
 disappeared person in government custody and, in a few cases,
 having seen the corpse. These reports have led local citizens
 to believe that the disappeared persons were killed by the
 authorities while in custody, in reprisal for attacks on
 security forces by Tamil militants.
 Sri Lankan attorneys brought 250 lawsuits during the past 20
 months, asking the Government to inform the court of the
 whereabouts of these so-called disappeared persons whom
 witnesses had observed being arrested by the security forces
 but who were subsequently reported not to be in government
 custody. 'At year's end the subjects of one-third to one-half
 
 
 1303
 SRI LANKA
 of these cases had been located in detention centers; no
 information had been provided about the others. Under normal
 procedures, government authorities have 1 month to respond-in
 such lawsuits. However, in these cases courts have granted
 government requests for delays of 6 to 9 months. In its
 November report, Asia Watch stated that it was not aware of
 any allegations of disappearances since the Accord, but
 criticized the Government for its failure to account for
 previous disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution provides that "no person shall be subjected
 to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment."- However, there were persistent, credible reports
 again in 1987 that the military and police tortured or
 mistreated persons in detention.
 In July 1987, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of one Sri
 Lankan who filed a fundamental rights suit against the
 Government, alleging that he had suffered torture while in
 government custody. The court awarded the plaintiff court
 costs and damages, and directed the authorities to investigate.
 At year's end, police investigators had completed their work
 and submitted their recommendation--that four police officers
 face criminal prosecution for their role in the incident--to
 the Attorney General's office, which has not yet taken a
 decisidn in the case.
 In its 1987 Report, covering 1986, Amnesty International
 reported that it continued to receive credible allegations of
 torture at various police stations and army camps. It said
 that former prisoners stated that they had been beaten, often
 on the soles of their feet, hung upside down, forced to inhale
 burning chili fumes, and burned with cigarettes.
 In his annual report, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture
 and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 singled out Sri Lanka as one of the countries of special
 concern. The report notes that: "The situation in Sri Lanka,
 which finds itself caught in a spiral of violence and where.
 civilians are allegedly tortured in order-to-extract
 information from them about planned acts of violence by the
 insurgents, is also of great-concern.-
 d. Arbitrary.Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution stipulates that no-person "shall be arrested
 except according to procedure established by law" and that an
 arrested person must be informed of the reason for his arrest.
 Within 24 hours an arrested person must be brought before a
 magistrate who may authorize bail or, for serious crimes,
 continued detention. A suspect may be detained up to 3 months
 without bail, or longer if a court so rules.
 However, the PTA, first adopted in. 1979 as a temporary measure
 and made permanent-in 1982. and the-ER, issued.monthly with
 the extension of the state of emergency in effect since May
 1983, give the security forces extraordinary powers in dealing
 with suspected criminals. These laws authorize preventive and.
 incommunicado detention, and.allow the security forces to
 detain a suspect heldunder the ER for up to 3 months before
 he must be presented to a magistrate. Magistrates are not
 empowered to investigate the circumstances leading to a
 
 
 1304
 SKI LAN4KA
 person's arrest Pnd continued detention, but, under the ER,
 "shaUl -Eremand the detainee, to a prison, where he may be held
 indeifinitely. For those held under 'the PTA, a person may be
 detalned without charges for up'po 18 months, but there have
 been ntmerotis cases. of persons held beyond that time period.
 Bail may D4 granted at the discretion'of the Government.
 Visits by family4. access to lawyers, food, and other
 conditions of -incarceration are normally restricted under.
 these extraordfnary laws.
 The PTA and ER were jsed extensively in 1987 to detain large
 numbers of persons, mostly Tamil youths from the north and
 east before the July 29 Accord, and Sinhalese youths allegedly.
 belonging to ra.ical political groups after the signing of the
 Accokd. Some,Sri. Lankans have alleged that there were 5,400
 such pirsons in detention as of mid-1987. Under the terms of
 the Accord, about 4,000 pers6ns were released. At the end of
 1987, the Government reported that there were 903 Tamils in
 detention under the PTA and ER for crimes said to be committed
 in the north apd east. Another 108 Tamils and Sinhalese were
 in custody under the PTA for acts committed outside the north
 and east, and 270 mostly Sinhalese were held under the ER at
 year's end.. The Sinhalese prisoners detaiped for activities
 in. the south are not subject to release under the terms of the
 Accord..o This has led some Sri Lankans to accuse the Government
 of discrimination. Local observers reported that the IPKF had
 detained "n its camps in the north and east over 300 alleged
 Tamil mi itants, as well as Tamil journalists and businessmen
 accused of sympathizing with the separatists.
 Relatives mly write to the Ministry of Defense and ask that
 the case of their family member detained under the PTA be
 reviewed. The review is conducted by a three-man advisory
 board..nhich considers the evidence, interviews the police and
 theIdetainee, and akes a nonbinding recommendation. Advisory
 board reviews frequently take several months, and government
 authorities have refused or delayed carrying out the
 reconmendation of the board in some cases. Persons may also
 challenge the legality of their detention either by filing a
 suit in tbq High Court, or by charging the Government before
 the Supreme Court with illegally violating fundamental rights
 enumerated in the.Constitution. However, the High Courts are
 located only in Colombo, which necessitates costly travel to
 the capital for those seeking this remedy, and fundamental
 rights suits must be brought--complete with necessary
 documentation--within 30 days of the alleged infringement.
 Some observers charge that this 30-day limit makes it
 virtually impossible in practice for persons detained
 incommunicado for prolonged periods or relatives of those
 alleged to have disappeared to bring such suits.
 There is no forced labor in Sri Lanka, but criminals may be
 sentenced to "rigorous imprisonment" (hard labor) under which
 they are required to work.
 e.' Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons accused of criminal acts are generally entitled to a
 fair trial in open court, are informed of the charges and the
 evidence against them, andare represented by counsel of their
 choice. Persons tried in the High Court are provided an
 attorney at government expense if they need one, but the
 Government does not provide attorneys for defendants tried in
 other courts.
 
 
 1305
 SRI LANKA
 Although public trial by jury is the custom, juries are not
 provided in trials under the PTA on the grounds that jury
 members could be intimidated. Like anyone else, those
 convicted under tha PTA or the ER have the right to appeal
 convictions to the Appeals and Supreme Courts. However, most
 people held under this Act are never formally charged and
 therefore do not enter the appeals process.
 In the northern Jaffna.peninsula; the judicial system did not
 function during most of 1987 due to-intimidation by the!Tamil
 militants. Outside the north, Sri;Lanka's judiciary har.
 demonstrated its independence of-the other branches of
 government. All the judges of the Supreme Court, Courts of
 Appeal, and High Courts are appointed by the President. The
 Chief Justice and two Supreme Court judges comprise a judicial
 service commission which appoints, transfers, and dismisses
 all lower court judges.
 The Government brought indictments against 603 persons detained
 under the PTA and the ER during 1987. In the weeks following.
 the peace agreement, the Government withdrew charges in about
 500 of these cases before the trials commenced.
 Estimates of the number of political prisoners vary widely.
 According to Sri Lankan human rights activists, approximately
 200 persons had been convicted of crimes under the PTA and the
 ER and were serving prison terms by the end of 1987.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects individual privacy and the
 sanctity of the family and the home. The judiciary has a good
 record of upholding rights to privacy in those cases which
 reach the High Court. Ordinarily, search and arrest warrants
 are required in order to enter priyate premises.. Under the
 PTA, however, police officers above a certain rank and less
 senior officers authorized by them in writing may enter and
 search any premises without a warrant, and seize "any document
 or thing" when there is a presumption or evidence of support
 for, or involvement with, unlawful activity. Monitoring of
 telephones is not known to be a common practice.
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 Sri Lankan and Indian security forces engaged in armed
 conflict with members of Tamil and Sinhalese militant
 organizations during 1987. These conflicts were often fought
 in heavily populated areas, such as in the north and east, and
 -resulted in significant civilian casualties. In the first 5
 months of the year, the Government blockaded supplies of
 petroleum, resulting in some temporary transportation and food
 distribution difficulties for residents of Jaffna. Before the.
 July 29 Accord was reached, security forces frequently were
 accused of indiscriminately opening fire in civilian areas
 following an ambush or landmine attack by Tamil militants.
 Sinhalese militants in the south claimed responsibility for a
 series of assassinations of civilian government officials and
 supporters. The IPKF was accused of having failed to take
 adequate precautions against the killing of civilians during
 its offensive in Jaffna. There are allegations of several
 instances of Indian troops opening fire on civilians following
 landmine explosions and numerous reports of molestation of
 women by IPKF soldiers. Indian authorities have undertaken
 
 
 1306
 SRI LANKA
 investigations.in many of- these incidents, and four Indian
 soldiers were publicly court-martialed for their misbehavior
 in early 1988.     .
 The tecurity situation underwent a significant transformation
 during 1987., During the early months-of the year, Tamil
 militant forces continued their well-established practice of
 landmine and ambush attacks against government forces, who
 often retaliated by opening fire or conducting search and
 dest'roy missions in civilian areas.- In one such incident on
 January 28,: eyewitnesses stated-that the STF, following a
 landmine blast which-killed 12 of its members near Batticaloa,
 -entere'al earby town, rounded up 83 unarmed local residents,
 inclydihg 22-employees of a sht-imp farm, took them to an
 abanidoned church and killed them. On February 7, lqcal
 residents stated-that LTTE militants killed 28 Sinhalese
 civilians in a remote village of southeastern Amparai district.
 LosS of. divilian life resulting from Sinhalese-Tamil violence
 rose considerably during the second quarter of 1987. At least
 122 pers-ons were killed when-several civilian vehicles were
 stopped by militants 15.miles south of Trincomalee on April
 17. On April 21, 113 people were killed and 295 injured when
 a bomb; believed to have been planted by Tamil militants,
 expl~ded-at ,the.-main bus stand in the Colombo business
 district. Shortly .after these incidents, government security
 forces launche-'ir attacks' against alleged Tamil militant
 targets in the northern Jaffna peninsula which resulted in
 ciVilinidasualtidb.. Subsequently, between May 26 and June 2,
 the Government conducted a full-scale military offensive in
 the northeastern portion of the Jaffna peninsula, resulting in
 at l68 t 60 oivilian casualties. Also on June 2, alleged LTTE
 Tadbilanilitants murdered 32 civilians, .29 of whom were
 Buddhist--monks, at the village of Arawantalawa, south of
 Batlficaloa-on the east coast.
 The signing of the peace agreement on July 29 was marked by
 riots in Colombo-and the-southern part of Sri Lanka by
 Sinhallse opposed to the Accord, resulting in about 100
 deaths. When the responsibility for maintaining the peace in
 the north and east shifted from the Sri Lankan secugity forces
 to Indian troops, these troops intervened in an attempt to
 stop internecine fighting among Tamil militant groups and
 Tamil militant killings of civilians in the Eastern Province.
 In October, when it became apparent that the LTTE would
 neither accept the Accord nor turn in its weapons, the IPKF
 mounted a 2 1/2-week military offensive against the LTTE,
 seizing its stronghold at Jaffna town. There were allegations
 of-indiscriminate shelling and strafing of some civilian areas
 during'this offensive, and Tamil militants were accused of
 using civilians as human shields. At least 100 Tamil
 militants, 200,-Ldian soldiers, and 350 civilians in the east
 and north los teir lives in these actions. At the end of
 the year, the IPKF was continuing its attacks against suspected
 LTTE segaratists in the north and east, and the Sri Lankan
 security forces were deployed in the south to defend against
 attacks by antigovernment Sinhalese radicals against government
 officials and supporters of the Accord.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for "freedom of speech and
 expression including publication," but it also permits these
 
 
 1307
 SRI LANKA
 rights to be restricted "as may be prescribed by law in the
 interests of national security." In practice, opposition
 groups have charged that the Emergency Regulations have been
 used directly and indirectly to restrict free speech. For
 example, persons wishing to post bills advertising meetings of
 any type are required under the ER to get police approval of
 the text. In May 1987, the Supreme Court ruled that this
 clause gave too broad an authority to the police, and that
 they would have to specify a reason for denying a person
 permission to post bills. In September 1987, the UNP-
 dominated Parliament amended the Parliamentary-Powers and
 Privileges Act of 1978, which permits Parliament to impose a
 fine on anyone who criticizes a Member of Parliament. Under
 the 1978 act, fines imposed under this law were limited to
 $160; under the 1987 amendment, Parliament was-empowered to-
 impose unlimited fines and imprison violators-for up to 2
 years.
 The Government controls the country's largest newspaper chain
 and owns the radio and television services. A variety of
 independent newspapers and journals provide a full range of
 viewpoints on foreign policy and most domestic matters. Many
 small circulation periodicals published by opposition
 political parties operate in an unrestricted manner.
 In the wake of violent riots at various places throughout the
 south following the signing of the peace agreement, the
 Government imposed censorship on the press. Critics charged
 that the censorship, which lasted 48 days, was inconsistently
 and inefficiently administered. Some Sri Lankans have also
 claimed that, even without formal censorship, the Government
 practices indirect intimidation of the press. By threatening
 to take over private media which do not operate in'the public
 interest, these observers believe, the Government has prevented
 the media from accepting advertisements from certain
 organizations. In another case which critics have described
 as an attempt to intimidate the press, police in October
 briefly detained incommunicado a journalist who had reported
 on extensive conversations with LTTE Tamil militants.
 Academic freedom is generally respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association and the right to form and join trade unions. Sri
 Lanka has numerous private associations and trade unions,
 which are free to maintain ties with international bodies.
 One radical leftist political party, the Janatha Vimukthi
 Peramuna (JVP), has been proscribed since 1983.
 Under the Emergency Regulations, the President (or his
 designee) is empowered to prohibit public meetings which would
 be "likely to cause a disturbance to public order and promote
 disaffection." In practice, the police issue permits,: at the
 discretion of the police superintendent in each area, for
 outdoor public meetings or processions. Several times in
 1987, opposition political groups were denied permission to
 hold outdoor public demonstrations, which sometimes led to
 violence when the groups gathered anyway. In the largest
 incident of this kind, the traditional annual political and
 trade union May Day demonstrations were prohibited in 1987,
 but several groups assembled anyway, and police killed two
 persons in attempting to disperse the crowds.
 
 
 1308
 SRI LANKA
 Workers' Tights are Tecognized and protected by law. Any
 seven workers-may form a union, draw up their own procedures,
 elect the-ir-own representatives, and, formulate programs.
 Workers are expressly granted the right to bargain
 collectively by the Constituti6n. Department of Labour
 officers may Arbitrate when workers andoemployers are not able
 to resolve a'dispute., These officers-are stationed throughout
 the country' to assurethat employers fulfill their legal and
 contractual'obligations, toworkers and to be available for
 mediation in minor local disputes.
 Except-for public service employees, workers are free to
 strike  and have done so frequently. .Under the ER the
 President may declare any business to be an essential service,
 making a strikq.illegal. As in previous years,-when the
 Government used this power to terminate strikes in. 1987, it
 generally agreed to discuss grievances with labor
 representatives.
 About 1,000 labor Unions and federations together represent
 about-one-third-of the 5.5 million-strong labor force.
 Workets in thexnonplantatio- agricultural sector and most of
 those employed in. small businesses, as well as workers in the
 free trade zone,,are nbt represented by unions.- Employees in
 the zone participate in labor-management company associations.
 Althoughtthereare a few independent unions, most of the.
 largest. worker organizations are affiliated with political
 parti:es4'.requently operate as arms of those paKties,-and play
 a significant role in the political process. Despite
 constraints arising from their political affiliations, Sri
 Lankan unions generally have been vigorous in advocating
 improved conditions for workers.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution' establishes Buddhism as the official religion
 and requires the Government. "to protect and foster" Buddhism,
 but it also guarantees the rights of all others, including
 Hindus, Muslims, and Christians, to practice their religions
 freely. Earlier complaints that Buddhists had an advantage
 over members of other religions in winning senior government
 positions have dissipated, and now members of all religious
 groups can be found in influential positions in government and
 in the full spectrum of political parties.
 Members of all religious groups in Sri Lanka are free to and
 do maintain active ties with coreligionists in other
 countries--including with the Church of England and Catholic
 hierarchies. Many Sri Lankans perform religious travel each
 year. Religious publishing is freely allowed, as is
 proselytizing. Foreign clergy also are permitted to work in
 Sri Lanka.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution grants every citizen "freedom of movement and,
 of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka" and "freedom to
 return to Sri Lanka." Exit visas are no longer required, and
 the constitutional provisions are generally honored.
 However, believing that Tamil militants were frequently
 crossing from southern India to northern Sri Lanka via the
 Palk Straits, the Government adopted a series of measures,
 
 
 1309
 SRI LANKA
 beginning in 1984, which progressively restricted free
 movement in the north. The effect of the maritime
 surveillance and prohibited zones has been to restrict free
 movement considerably and made it virtually impossible for the
 large number of fishermen resident in that area to fish.
 These restrictions were not enforced consistently during 1987,
 but they were strengthened significantly by the IPKF following
 the October offensive in the north and east.
 Movement in the north as well as in the southern parts of the
 country also was restricted by curfews imposed by the
 Government. A curfew was imposed on residents of Jaffna
 during military operations there in May and June. Most of the
 north and east was under daily curfew from October through the
 end of the year, including 12 days of continuous curfew in
 Jaffna during the first part of the Indian offensive in
 October. A few southern districts were under daily curfews
 for over a month in July and August, and cities in the south
 were under curfew several times in October, following
 terrorist incidents and civil disturbances.
 Refugees or displaced persons from other countries are
 generally denied entry to Sri Lanka. The Government does not
 try to help refugees who try to stay in the country while
 seeking permanent residence elsewhere. In 1987 several
 prospective Afghan refugees spent.long periods in police
 detention while awaiting resolution of their cases.
 At year's end, there were approximately 400,000 displaced
 persons in Sri Lanka, and 150,000 Sri Lankans in India and
 Western countries.
 Section 3 Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Sri Lanka has a multiparty, parliamentary form of government
 with universal suffrage and generally high (around 80 percent)
 voter turnout. The extent to which citizens-can exercise the
 right to change their government through free and fair
 elections was called into question by the opposition which
 protested the results of the 1982 referendum that extended the
 life of the Parliament by 6 years.
 Although members of each ethnic community can be found in
 virtually all of the political parties, the most influential
 political parties generally draw their support from one ethnic
 community. The United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka
 Freedom Party (SLFP), both of which draw their following
 mainly from the Sinhalese majority community, have alternated
 in forming governments.
 Tamils have been primarily represented by two parties.- The
 Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF)'claims to speak for
 two-thirds of the Ceylon Tamils and other Tamil-speaking Sri
 Lankans who have for hundreds of years been the majority
 population in the north and parts of the east. In 1983 TULF
 members of Parliament representing the north and parts of the
 east resigned after refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to
 the unity of Sri Lanka as required by a new constitutional
 amendment. Byelections to fill these vacant seats have been
 postponed due to the unsettled security situation, and Sri
 Lankans in those constituencies have been without parliamentary
 representation since the fall of 1983. Indian Tamils, who
 make up about one-third of the country's Tamil population,
 reside primarily in the central hill country, and have not
 
 
 1310
 SRI LANKA
 been involved in the ethnic conflict, are represented by the
 Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC), which is also a trade union.
 The President of the CWC is a member of Parliament and also
 serves as a Minister in the UNP Government.
 Moet opposition parties function freely; several operate their
 own newspapers, and the activities of their leaders are
 covered by the media. The extreme leftist Janatha Vimukthi
 Peramuna (JVP), however, has been proscribed since 1983 for
 its alleged.involvement in the communal riots. Also, the
 civic rights of the leader of the main opposition SLFP, Mrs.
 Sirimavo Bandaranaike, were suspended from 1980 to 1986 on the
 grounds that-she exceeded her authority during her tenure as
 Prime Minister from 197G to 1977.
 The last general election in 1977 brought the UNP Government
 to power with -51 percent of the popular vote.- The UNP
 Goverhment formulated a new Constitution, adopted by Parliament
 in 1978, which established the office of a directly elected
 executive president. In the presidential election of October
 1982, President Jayewardene was elected with 53 percent of the
 popular vote. 'Two months later, in place of the national
 parliamentary. elections which had been scheduled, the
 Government held a referendum to extend the life of'the 1977
 Parliament, from 6 to 12 years. Restrictions were imposed on
 the activities of opposition parties during the referendum
 campaign, and numerous voting irregularities subsequently were
 reported by the elections commissioner. The referendum was
 approved by- 54.5 grcent of the vote.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to adverse reports on its human
 rights situation. Senior government officials have made
 themselve available to visitors looking into human rights
 issues. -.
 In its 1987 Report, covering 1986, Amnesty International noted
 instances in which the Government had not replied to its
 requests for information on human rights concerns, and
 reported that various requests it had made to the President
 and Minister of National Security to visit Sri Lanka to
 discuss its concerns had also received no response. Asia
 Watch received permission in 1987 to visit Sri Lanka and
 issued its human rights report in November.
 In 1987 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 renewed its previous offer to the Government to provide relief
 assistance. At its meeting in February, the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission adopted a resolution calling upon Sri Lanka to
 invite ICRC participation in relief work there. In October
 1987, at the invitation of the Government, ICRC and
 International League of Red Cross Societies' officials visited
 Sri Lanka for exploratory talks. However, no ICRC program has
 commenced.
 Several local nongovernmental organizations monitor human
 rights. They collect information from families of victims or
 members of citizens' committees near the site of alleged
 incidents. Their periodic reports and appeals for change,
 however, are generally not addressed by the Government. Some
 attorneys represent defendants without charging a fee in those
 human rights cases which reach the courts.

 SRI LANKA
 The Government established a Commission for the Elimination of
 Discrimination and the Monitoring of Fundamental Rights in
 late 1986. Charged with investigating individual complaints
 on the basis of race, religion, language, caste, sex, .politicai
 opinion, or place of birth, the Commission received over 500
 complaints during 1987, its first full. year of. operation. Of
 these, about 100 were judged-to have merit after an initial
 investigation and about-50 had been resolved by the end of the
 year-. A majority of the cases charged discrimination in the
 workplace on the basis of a person's political affiliation.
 The Committee has also addressed questions of systematic
 discrimination, killings, and torture but has issued no
 reports nor shown it can effectively deal with these issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Under British colonial administration prior to 1948, ethnic
 Ceylon Tamils held a larger percentage of the influential
 positions in government service, the police, the professions,
 and commerce than the percentage of Tamils overall in-the
 population. With independence, Sinhalese political leaders
 sought to redress what they regarded as an imbalance in favor
 of Ceylon Tamils. Typical of their efforts was the so-called
 "Sinhala-Only" Act of 1956 which made Sinhalese the sole
 official language of the country. For Tamils, the Act stood
 for government-sanctioned discrimination against them.
 In the Constitution of 1978, Tamil was designated a "national"
 language and its use in government, education, and the courts
 was specifically protected. Nevertheless, Tamils have charged
 that these legal protections are-not enforced. Members of the
 Tamil community complain that they suffer from systematic
 discrimination in competition for university entrance,
 employment opportunities, and other matters under government
 control. Government officials have denied charges of
 discrimination against Tamils, pointing out that a number of
 prominent Tamils occupy senior-level civil service positions.
 Many of these'Tamils are approaching retirement age, however,
 and there are fewer Tamils in the lower ranks of the civil
 service and military to take their places. Under terms of the
 Indo-Sri Lanka peace agreement, Tamil as well as Sinhalese
 will become official languages, while English is to be a
 "link" language.
 One group of Tamils which, has suffered particular
 discrimination are Indian Tamils, who are descended from the
 Tamils brought from India in the 19th century to work on the
 plantations. No longer qualifying for citizenship under
 Indian law, they were also denied Sri Lankan citizenship by
 laws adopted after independence. Since then, the Sri Lankan
 and Indian governments have reached several agreements aimed
 at resolving the problem of these stateless Tamils. Under a
 1986 agreement, the Sri Lankan Government agreed to grant
 citizenship to all remaining stateless Tamils. The Government
 began processing these cases during the second half of 1987.
 Sri Lankan women have equal rights under the law, including
 equal property and inheritance rights. The various ethnic and
 religious groups have their own strictures, however, which
 place some limitations on women; Some Tamil families believe
 their women members should not be seen working in public.
 Some Muslim women are discouraged by members of their
 community from seeking higher education or employment. Some
 women fill important posts in the civil service, the
 
 
 1312
 SRI LANKA
 professions, and business, but the majority are found in
 mantial'and semiskilled jobs and in the home. As of 1985,
 women employed in nonagricultural work were paid, on the
 average, 71 percent of the hourly wage rate received by men.
 Womek vote in large numbers, ,but otherwise play a more limited
 role tbh'n'men in the political process. There are currently
 six female members of Parliament, including one female
 minister of cabinet rank. Sri Lanka had the world's first
 female Prime Minister.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Under Sri Lankafi labor laws, employment of children under age
 12 is p&bhibited. Those between age 12 and 14 are called
 child, workers and may not be eipployed in industry or dangerous
 occupations; employment of young persons between 15 and 18 is
 subject to certain restrictions. Employees under age 18
 cannot be required to work outside of specified hours. In
 additioi,' -fploydrs are required to provide annual leave, rest
 periods, and meal breaks. In practice, however, there is a
 child work force, probably numbering at least several
 thousand, who work illegally in Sri Lanka, mostly at jobs in
 rice cdltiv~tion, as domestics, or as street peddlers.
 Effortifto address this problem have been hampered by the fact
 that, in sonib cases, child workers are a major source of
 family income.
 There is no national minimum wage, but wage boards for 35
 different trades set minimum wages and working conditions.
 Actual-ages and working conditions generally exceed these
 minimums, which many trade union leaders consider insufficient
 for "maintaining a decent standard of living. Most permanent
 full-time workers are covered by laws which provide that they
 shall work no more than 45 hours per week, no more than 9
 hours per day, and no more than 5-1/2 days per week, and that
 they will receive a 14-day paid holiday annually. Minimum
 conditions for the protection of safety and health of workers
 are set forth in legislation passed by Parliament and
 impleffented'by the Departmbnt of Labour, which employs a staff
 of engineers and inspectors for this purpose. The Department
 also qducatbs workers about minimum standards for different
 workplaces and encourages the use of safety equipment such as
 earplugs, but trade.union leaders allege that enforcement of
 minimal conditions for worker health and safety by the
 Department inspectors is insufficient. Workers in the
 unorganized agricultural sector are not covered by labor laws,
 although the government may investigate individual complaints.
