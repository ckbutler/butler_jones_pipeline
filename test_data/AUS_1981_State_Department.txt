 AUSTRALIA
 Australia is a parliamentary democracy committed to the
 principles of freedom, justice, and the rights of the
 individual. Political, economic  and social rights are
 guaranteed under the Australian constitution, legislation
 and common law. Australia has accepted in recent years a
 large number of Indochinese refugees as well as immigrants
 from Eastern, Europe.
 The Federal Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits
 all forms of racial discrimination based on color, race,
 ethnic background or place of birth. Under the 1975 Act
 an annual report is prepared by the commissioner for
 community relations, an exercise which has proved an
 effective instrument for achieving greater equality of
 opportunity and enjoyment of human rights for the entire
 Australian community. In 1981 parliament approved the
 creation of an Australian Human Rights Commission. The
 commission is charged with promoting the observance of
 human rights by monitoring Commonwealth laws and regula-
 tions, hearing complaints, and making recommendations to
 the government. The commission is authorized to cooperate
 with state governments on human rights matters under
 state jurisdiction.
 In addition to acting to eliminate racial discrimination
 at home, Australia has also undertaken a commitment to
 combat racism abroad. For example, Australia has been
 an active member of the United Nations Commission on
 Human Rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is neither condoned nor are there any reports that
 it is practiced in Australia. Protection against torture
 and cruel treatment derives from English common law.
 Perpetrators would be punishable under criminal law
 governing assault, battery and malicious wounding.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Australian law prohibits such punishment and this prohibi-
 tion is respected in practice.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of disappearancesin Australia.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 and this prohibition is respected in practice. Writs of
 habeas corpus are available to ensure that persons are
 not arrested without charges being brought against them
 promptly and to guarantee their rights to apply to the
 courts for release pending trial. Preventive detention
 is not practiced.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Australian law guarantees the right to a fair hearing, the
 right to a fair public trial and the unimpeded right of
 counsel. There are no reports that these guarantees are
 denied in practice. Public assistance is available for
 those unable to pay for legal counsel. Defendants are
 informed in advance of charges and have pre-trial access
 to evidence against them. By law defendants are entitled
 to call and cross-examine witnesses and are protected against
 self-incrimination and double jeopardy. Australians are
 protected by law against ex post facto criminal prosecutions.
 The Australian judiciary is independent.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Under Australian law and in actual practice, no search may
 be conducted without a judicially issued warrant.
 2.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These basic rights are guaranteed in law and respected in
 practice. Private enterprise plays the dominant role in
 the media and there is no press censorship. Members of
 all religious sects are free to observe their rites without
 governmental interference. In Western. Australia, the Police
 Act, as amended, requires that advance permission be obtained
 from the commissioner of police or an authorized officer
 before a procession or a public meeting can be held in a
 public place. The commissioner may not withhold permission
 unless he has reasonable grounds to believe the meeting will
 peril public safety. Only infrequently has permission to
 hold a meeting at a specific place been denied because of
 concern about public safety. Upon several occasions, however,
 individuals, mostly trade unionists, have been arrested and
 fined for holding meetings without obtaining permission in
 advance.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or out of
 Australia including the right of emigration and repatri-
 ation. Race is barred as a criterion for approval of
 rejection of application to immigrate to Australia.
 Australia continues to be a major recipient for permanent
 settlement of Indochinese refugees, having accepted 51,000
 such persons over the past six years.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Commonwealth and individual state laws guarantee this
 freedom, which is respected in practice. Under the Common-
 wealth Electoral Act of 1918, persons 18 years of age and
 over who have lived in Australia for six months continuously
 and who are British subjects (including, of course,
 Australian citizens) are entitled to vote. Complaints have
 been made that certain amendments relating to enrollment
 and voting procedures to state electoral laws of Western
 Australia have the effect of restricting the right of
 aborigines to vote. However, the Government of Western
 Australia points out that these amendments apply equally to
 all electors.

 Women have enjoyed political and civil rights in Australia
 since the turn of the century. Australia has participated
 fully in international fora devoted to women's affairs,
 and was among the first to sign in Copenhagen the
 United Nations Convention on Elimination of Discrimination
 Against Women. The Australiangovernment established the
 National Women's Advisory Council in 1978 and has increased
 steadily funding for social programs benefiting women.
 in Australia's most recent federal election, three women
 were elected to the 125 member lower house, their highest
 such representation in history. Approximately 15 percent
 of the upper house (the Senate) are women.
 Australian trade unions are strong, well organized and active
 both in politics and in industrial relations. Approximately
 54 percent of the Australian work force is unionized. The
 rights to organize, strike, bargain collectively and lobby
 are guaranteed in law and exercised in practice (including
 by government employees).
 3.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 It is the government of Australia's policy to respond to
 all communications transmitted by the United Nations
 Secretary General which allege violations of human rights
 in Australia. The government has also replied to cases
 raised by the London-based Anti-Slavery Society and the
 Minority Rights Group regarding complaints by aborigines.
 The government acknowledges that the aboriginal population
 is disadvantaged in such areas as education, housing,
 health  and employment. The government has a range of
 programs aimed at providing to aborigines services available
 to other Australians plus additional services to improve
 their socio-economic conditions. During 1981, a World
 Council of Churches delegation visited Australia and later
 issued a report critical of the government's efforts to
 help the aborigines. In response, government officials
 acknowledged that there were still major deficiencies in
 aboriginal conditions, but pointed to the significant progress
 that has been made in past years and underlined the govern-
 ment's continuing commitment to improving aboriginal welfare.
 In September 1980, representatives of the National Aboriginal
 Council made a complaint in Geneva to the UN Sub-Commission
 on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
 Minorities alleging that an aborigine sacred site, where the
 *goanna spirit" (dragon spirit) resided, in Western
 Australia was being adversely affected by the drilling of
 an exploratory oil well near Noonkanbah. The Australian
 government spokesman in Geneva responded by saying that the
 drilling was occurring 3.5 kilometers from the nearest
 major sacred site and 1.25 kilometers from the nearest
 other sacred site or ritual area, and that the issue was
 not the protection of such sites but rather areas of
 influence surrounding sites.  He went on to say that the
 Australian government favors resolving such disputes by
 negotiation and compromise in which the interests of all
 parties are respected. The UN noted the complaint but
 took no action on it because "there has to be a consistent
 pattern" of human rights violations "before the commission
 or subcommission expresses concern." This was the first
 such presentation to the UN by Australian aborigines.

 There are a number of organizations in Australia which
 are active, strong and independent monitors and protectors
 of human rights, including the Australian Chapter of the
 International Commission of Jurists and the Australian
 Council of Civil Libertarians. In addition, the office
 of the Commonwealth ombudsman, established in 1977, is
 empowered to investigate complaints concerning adminis-
 trative actions of Commonwealth Government departments,
 statutory bodies and other authorities. Whenever maladmin-
 istration is found to occur, the ombudsman is required to
 report to the body concerned and may include recommendations
 for remedy. In the event of a failure to comply with a
 recommendation, the ombudsman may report the matter to the
 prime minister and parliament.
 The government actively attempts to prevent potential
 terrorist activities in Australia. Such activities have
 been primarily aimed at supporting foreign causes; the
 assassination of the Turkish Consul-General in Sydney in
 December 1980 is an example.
 4.    Economic and Social Circumstances
 Australia enjoys one of the highest living standards in
 the world. In 1980, per capita GDP was $9,152 and the
 infant mortality rate was 10.7 per thousand live births.
 Life expectancy at birth was 74 years in 1979. The
 population growth was 1.5 percent between 1970 and 1979.
 Adult literacy in 1976 was 100 percent and adjusted primary
 school enrollment was 94 percent. The government is
 committed to a comprehensive social security and welfare
 program which takes 27.8 percent of the budget. Basic
 food, shelter, health care, and social security benefits
 are guaranteed for the entire population, including recent
 immigrants.
