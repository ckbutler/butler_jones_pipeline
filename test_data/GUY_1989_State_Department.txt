 GUANA
 The Cooperative Republic of Guyana, a member of the
 Commonwealth of Nations, is a small, multiracial developing
 nation located on the South American continent; culturally and
 politically it is considered a part of the Caribbean. A
 unicameral Parliament is chosen by direct election in a
 multiparty political system. The head of the majority party
 in Parliament serves as Executive President. Under the 1980
 Constitution, parliamentary, regional, and municipal elections
 are held at least every 5 years. The People's National
 Congress (PNC), currently led by President Hugh Desmond Hoyte,
 has dominated political life since the 1964 elections. The
 opposition parties boycotted the November 1989 municipal
 elections, alleging that they would not be free and fair due
 to ruling party control of the electoral machinery.
 Guyanese society and political life are influenced by
 differences between the ethnic Afro-Guyanese and
 Indo-Guyanese. Urban Afro-Guyanese dominate the ruling PNC,
 the Guyana Police Force (GPF), the Guyana Defence Force (GDF),
 and other security forces; Indo-Guyanese predominate in the
 agricultural and business sectors.
 The Guyana Police Force has primary responsibility for
 maintaining law and order throughout Guyana. In addition, the
 Customs and Excise Department, and various branches of the
 Special Constabulary, have arrest authority within certain
 well-defined limits. The Police and Constabulary, the GDF,
 the Guyana National Service, the Guyana People's Militia,
 Guyana Prisons Service, and the Customs and Excise Department,
 are directly responsible to the civilian Government.
 Public corporations control two of Guyana's major export
 industries, sugar and bauxite, which employ about 17 percent
 of the work force. The third principal export industry, rice,
 is primarily in private hands. Despite the Government's
 efforts to enhance the role of the private sector and
 encourage private foreign and domestic investment, the economy
 continued to be plagued by external debt, sluggish growth, and
 a deteriorating infrastructure. On March 31 the Government
 began an economic recovery program with the assistance of the
 International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The program
 included an immediate 70-percent devaluation of the Guyana
 dollar, which drastically reduced real income and sparked
 public protests.
 Human rights concerns in Guyana continue to center on police
 abuse of persons arrested, limitations on press freedom, and
 questionable electoral practices. Although the improved
 atmosphere noted since the 1985 change of PNC leadership
 following the death of Linden Forbes Burnham has continued,
 several unions which exercised the traditionally recognized
 right to strike in 1989 suffered reprisal from public sector
 employers, and the authorities showed little tolerance for a
 new labor umbrella organization which challenged government
 policies.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No politically motivated or governmentally instigated
 extrajudicial killings are known to have occurred. Summary
 executions do not take place.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances,
 clandestine detentions, or abductions.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 While torture is prohibited by the Constitution, the Guyana
 Human Rights Association (GHRA) has expressed its concern over
 "the use of violence by the police and its apparent acceptance
 by society at large." It has also stated its belief that
 "those responsible for excessive violence constitute a small
 element within the force as a whole." Police regulations
 require internal investigation of all charges of abuse, and in
 the past some police officers have been disciplined or fined.
 In 1989 no police officers were disciplined or fined as a
 result of police investigations of brutality, although some
 were reportedly punished for corruption. The Director of
 Public Prosecutions did not prosecute any police on charges of
 brutality during 1989. On June 9, the legislature passed the
 Police Complaints Authority Bill which provides for the
 establishment of an independent Police Complaints Authority
 consisting of one person qualified to be a puisne (inferior)
 judge of the high court and two assistants. Although the
 Authority itself will have no investigative powers, it will
 supervise police investigations of specified cases of
 misconduct or serious crimes alleged to have been committed by
 members of the police force, and will make annual reports to
 the legislature.
 Civil and criminal suits may be brought against police
 officers by private citizens, but critics charge that police
 discourage complainants from bringing suit. One case, in
 which it is alleged that a prisoner died while in police
 custody in 1986, was in court at year's end.
 The GHRA noted in 1989 its concern with reports of inadequate
 nutrition for prisoners in the nation's penal system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that no person may be deprived of
 personal liberty except as authorized by law, and also calls
 for judicidl determination of the legality of detention. Some
 opposition politicians allege that the arrests of party and
 union activists during the May 1989 sugar strike was a
 politically motivated act of intimidation. The Government
 states that the arrests were part of an investigation into
 cases of arson. Most arrestees were released without charge.
 In an ongoing treason case, three People's Progressive Party
 (PPP) activists state that they were held incommunicado from
 their alleged arrest on April 28 until a writ of habeas corpus
 
 
 613
 was filed on May 3. On August 14, however, the magistrate
 presiding over the case accepted the statement of the police
 that the three were not in fact arrested until May 3.
 On December 6 the National Assembly voted to repeal the
 National Security Act, which permits the detention without
 charges for up to 3 months of persons who are deemed (by
 officials at the ministerial level) likely to act "in any
 manner prejudicial to public safety or public order or the
 defense of Guyana. At year's end, actual repeal was in the
 legislative process and the Act remained in force. No one has
 ever been detained under these provisions of the Act.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under Guyana's British common law system, the Constitution
 provides that anyone charged with a criminal offense has the
 right to a hearing by a court of law, and this right is
 respected in practice. Guyana has a functioning bail system,
 and defendants are granted fair public trials. Defendants are
 represented by counsel appointed by the court when necessary.
 Timely charges are presented, and appeal can be made to higher
 courts. There are no political prisoners or special courts
 for political security cases. A pending treason case against
 three men is being heard in the regular court. Some
 opposition figures have expressed concern over the courts'
 rulings in certain cases involving government interests, such
 as in libel suits brought by government officials. Opposition
 lawyers complain that the judiciary is prone to grant lengthy
 postponements in trials affecting the Government or law
 enforcement officials; however, postponements are routinely
 granted to both the defense and the prosecution. Delays in
 judicial proceedings are most often caused by shortages of
 trained court administrative personnel.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects the right to privacy. Some
 opposition politicians have alleged incidents of government
 surveillance, particularly at meetings and rallies. The
 National Security Act, which the National Assembly Voted to
 repeal in December (Section l.d.), permits police of the rank
 of inspector and above to conduct searches for narcotics and
 arms without a search warrant but with probable cause.
 Narcotics laws also permit searches for narcotics without
 warrants but with probable cause. The laws requiring
 judicially issued warrants for all other searches were
 respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The constitutional provision for freedom of speech is
 respected, and Guyanese can, and do, criticize their
 Government and its policies.
 Guyana's public television station, Guyana Television
 (GTV-10), broadcasts a 1-hour program on Sundays. It also
 provides a nightly 15-minute news program, which generally
 presents the Government's point of view but does include
 coverage of opposition views and events, to the country's two
 
 
 614
 GUANA
 private television stations. The two private stations
 normally broadcast satellite transmissions from the United
 States, including uncensored network news, but do not produce
 their own local news broadcasts. *The country's only radio
 station, the government-owned Guyana Broadcasting Corporation
 (GBC), is selective in reporting the views and activities of
 opposition parties. Some of the GBC's radio interview and
 commentary programs allow public criticism of the Government,
 but, in general, they reflect government policies. The GBC
 radio station refused, for example, to allow the Anglican
 Bishop's "Charge to the Synod" to be broadcast on the April 9
 "Church Calling" radio program on the grounds that it was not
 devotional. The GBC similarily refused to broadcast a July 9
 Catholic Church program concerning the 1979 murder of Father
 Bernard Arke. Although there is interest in establishing
 private radio stations, the Government has yet to implement a
 licensing procedure allowing for their operation. Foreign ana
 regional radio stations can be heard on medium and shortwave
 bands.
 In the past the Government, through ownership of the country's
 only daily newspaper and radio station, issuance of import
 licenses for newsprint and printing presses, and control of
 most hard currency, maintained varying degrees of control over
 the media. This control, however, has been easing since
 1987. The independent Stabroek News currently publishes twice
 a week. Newsprint availability remained a problem, but the
 shortage affected government as well as independent
 publications. The Guyana Press Association, reactivated in
 1988, continued to function in 1989.
 Individual members of the Government have sometimes brought
 libel suits against publishers, which critics claim is to
 discourage piess criticism of the Government. A lawsuit filed
 in 1988 by individual police officers against the GHRA over
 its "Brief on Police Violence" is still being heard in the
 courts. No such libel suits were filed in 1989.
 In 1989 the government-owned daily newspaper, the Guyana
 Chronicle, reduced its previously expanded coverage of news
 and commentaries that differ from government views, and became
 more clearly reflective of government positions. Independent
 periodicals remained free to criticize the Government and its
 policies. Information on government activities is carefully
 controlled, although in 1989 government officials were
 increasingly available to the press through press
 conferences. The April 1988 Public Corporations Act, which
 provides for the fining and imprisonment of employees of
 public corporations who disclose unauthorized information
 about government activities and operations, continued to be
 viewed by the media as a restraint. To date, no one has been
 charged under the law. Guyanese can receive printed materials
 from abroad without restrictions, but scarce foreign exchange
 limits their availability. Certain regional newspapers and
 international news magazines, which often contain criticism of
 the Government, are, however, regularly available.
 The Government's record on academic freedom continued to be
 good. Several opposition activists in the GHRA and the
 Marxist Working People's Alliance (WPA) teach at the public
 University of Guyana, and opposition parties have also
 organized groups there.
 
 
 GUYANA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Public Order Act requires police permits for mass
 political meetings but allows the police commissioner, at his
 discretion and without explanation, to refuse permission for a
 public meeting. In 1989 opposition parties organized numerous
 rallies and marches, particularly in April, to protest the
 establishment of the Government's economic reform program.
 Opposition figures complained, however, that permission to
 hold rallies and use amplified sound systems was at times
 arbitrarily denied. Although all requests to hold marches in
 April during the period of protests against the Government's
 economic program were denied, several marches took place
 without incident, while marchers in others were arrested for
 taking part in illegal processions. Unruly protestors were
 occasionally arrested but usually released within hours or the
 next day. The Government imposes no restrictions on private
 associations, which are not required to be registered and
 which may maintain relations with international bodies as they
 wish.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of thought and
 religion. There is no favored or official state religion. All
 religions in Guyana are allowed to select their places of
 worship and are free to maintain links with coreligionists in
 other countries. Christian, Hindu, Muslims, and Baha'i
 communities in Guyana practice their religions without
 restrictions. There are no restrictions on travel for
 religious purposes, nor pn training of clergy, religious
 publishing, conversion, religious education, or charitable
 activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Guyana is provided for in the
 Constitution. Travel to certain Amerindian areas requires
 government permission, a regulation dating from colonial times
 designed to protect the indigenous peoples from exploitation.
 The GHRA, opposition politicians, and some clergy contend that
 permits are sometimes denied to missionaries and non-PNC
 politicians, and that the regulations are being used to
 maintain PNC influence among the Amerindians. Guyanese are
 free to travel abroad, emigrate, and to return. Guyana is
 neither a refugee receiving nor generating country. There are
 no forced resettlements or displaced persons, and citizenship
 is not denied on political grounds.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guyanese are free to express their political views and to join
 or support a variety of political parties, but electoral
 practices call into question whether citizens in practice have
 the ability to change the Government. All citizens 18 years
 of age or older are eligible to participate in the political
 process and to vote. National and regional elections, by
 secret ballot, are held at least every 5 years. The leader of
 the winning party serves as President and forms a Cabinet.
 Constitutionally, the next national elections must be held by
 
 
 616
 GUYXANA
 early 1991.
 Opposition parties vigorously criticize the Government and are
 free to field candidates for election. Since 1964, however,
 the People's National Congress (PNC), a predominantly
 Afro-Guyanese party, has dominated political life through
 questionable electoral practices. Opposition parties
 regularly charge the ruling party with fraud. Following the
 1985 elections, opposition parties, including the Communist
 People's Progressive Party (PPP), joined in the Patriotic
 Coalition for Democracy (PCD). The PCD seeks such reforms in
 Guyana's election laws as the counting of ballots at the
 polling places rather than at central counting places.
 President Hoyte stated in September that he opposed the
 countihg of ballots at polling places on grounds that voters
 in "ethnic enclaves" could easily be subjected to
 intimidation. The PCD boycotted the November 1989 municipal
 elections, stating that current electoral laws were
 insufficient to guarantee that they would be free and fair.
 The unopposed PNC slates were declared elected. Thirty-six
 prominent individuals from a broad cross-section of Guyanese
 society signed an open letter on electoral reform in August,
 calling for the creation of an acceptable elections commission
 as well as election monitoring by local and international
 observers.
 The Integrity Commission, appointed by the Government in 1986
 to investigate the need for a code of ethics for public
 officials, also called for electoral reform, including greater
 dialogue with opposition parties. In 1989 the PCD requested a
 meeting with President Hoyte, who agreed to meet a single
 spokesman to represent the six parties. By year's end the PCD
 had not agreed on a spokesman. The President did meet during
 the year with the leader of the recently formed United
 Republican Party, which is not a member of the PCD.
 Political parties are organized generally along ethnic lines,
 a situation that predates independence. President Hoyte has
 appointed a number of Indo-Guyanese to ministerial and other
 government positions and attracted still others to the PNC.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government regards outside criticism of its human rights
 practices as interference in its internal affairs. The GHRA,
 the most active local human rights group, functions without
 government interference. The GHRA is a nongovernmental
 organization formed in 1979 with support from trade unions,
 professional organizations, and churches, and it issues
 periodic press releases and publishes an annual report on
 human rights in Guyana. It also gathers information from
 members, victims of abuse, trade unionists, clergy, other
 interested parties, official documents, and newspapers. A
 British prisons expert who visited Guyana in 1989 was received
 by government officials, but was not permitted to examine
 prisons. The Government contended that its refusal was due to
 insufficient advance notice.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for fundamental rights to all
 persons in Guyana. Guyanese society and political life
 
 
 1
 617
 continue to be influenced by ethnic differences between
 Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese. Guyana has a small ethnic
 Amerindian population, composed of nine tribal groups, living
 in scattered reservations throughout the country. Relative to
 most Guyanese, their standard of living is low. The GHRA has
 alleged that Amerindians are subjected to government control
 of their leaders and land titles, as well as limitations on
 access to their reservations by clergy and other outsiders.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex
 and provides women the right to equal pay for equal work.
 There are no discriminatory family laws or restrictions on
 women's right to own property. There are no organizations
 that focus primarily on women's rights. Violence against
 women, including domestic violence such as wife beating, is
 considered by many to be a significant problem. However,
 victims of such abuse oftentimes are reluctant to report it to
 the authorities or to press charges, and underreporting of
 incidents of such violence makes it impossible to estimate its
 true extent. The Government does not condone this practice,
 but other than providing victims with access to the courts for
 redress has not recommended additional legislation or other
 remedial action.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of association is provided for in the Constitution,
 which specifically enumerates a person's right "to form or
 belong to trade unions." Approximately 88,000 of Guyana's
 estimated 240,000 workers are organized. Unions are free to
 choose their own officials. There have been allegations that
 the Government has attempted to influence the outcome of some
 union elections, but in general elections are vigorously
 contested. The views of trade unions and trade unionists are
 widely publicized in both the government-controlled and
 -independent media. Workers in Guyana have a generally
 recognized right to strike, but this right is not codified.
 The sugar and bauxite industries experienced highly disruptive
 6-week strikes protesting the March 31 budget, which launched
 the difficult IMF-monitored economic recovery program,
 including a 70-percent currency devaluation. The strike ended
 when workers in both industries returned to their jobs without
 a formal wage settlement agreement after the Government
 pledged to seek ways to ameliorate the situation. Public
 employees providing essential services are forbidden to
 strike, but a procedure exists for the review of grievances by
 a tribunal appointed by the Minister of Labor.
 Political parties, particularly the ruling PNC, wield
 significant influence in a number of unions, and political
 figures often have dual roles as trade union leaders. All 18
 actively participating unions in the Trades Union Congress
 (TUC), the major umbrella labor organization, are either
 strongly influenced by or affiliated with the PNC. Guyana's
 largest union, the Guyana Agricultural and General Workers
 Union (GAWU), is affiliated with the opposition PPP.
 Six unions belong to the dissident Federation of Independent
 Trade Unions of Guyana (FITUG), which was originally formed
 when these unions plus one other (which later returned to the
 TUC) walked out of the September 1988 TUC conference in
 protest against heavy-handed electioneering tactics by PNC
 activist delegates. FITUG, whose members have not formally
 
 
 618
 severed their ties with the TUC, has renewed a longstanding
 call for reform of the TUC to redistribute internal power and
 safeguard the independence of the organization from political
 influence.
 FITUG suffered some consequences because it played the major
 role in protesting against the budget. The Government
 continued its efforts begun in 1988 to bring the FITUG unions
 back into the TUC, and several unions which struck during the
 labor unrest in the first half of 1989 suffered reprisals from
 public sector employers. In February, the leadership of
 Guyana's two bauxite unions was temporarily "derecognized" and
 collection of the union's checkoff dues (as required undez the
 unions' collective agreement) was discontinued by their public
 sector employer following a FITUG-inspired 1-day protest
 strike against government policies. A number of teachers who
 participated in this protest strike were dismissed or
 transferred to remote sections of the country, and in one
 instance it was reported that picketing teachers and students
 were attacked by PNC-connected thugs.  in response to a 1-day
 protest strike in April by a FITUG affiliate, four state
 corporations dismissed nearly 300 workers and ceased deduction
 of that union's checkoff dues. Collection of checkoff dues
 was reinstituted by mid-year for all affected unions,
 including one whose checkoff dues had been discontinued in
 late 1988. All but a few of the terminated workers were
 rehired in their previous positions, and some but not all of
 the teachers had their dismissals or transfers rescinded.
 The trade union movement has only limited influence beyond
 issues directly related to industrial relations. Unionists
 and their property are not specifically protected by law.
 Under the Trades Union Act, property of trade unions is vested
 in the unions' trustees for the use and benefit of the union
 and its members.
 Unions freely maintain relations with recognized Caribbean and
 international trade union and professional groups. All three
 of the global trade union internationals have affiliates in
 Guyana.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Public and private sector employees possess and utilize the
 right to organize and to bargain collectively. In 1987, the
 most recent year for which figures are available from the
 Ministry of Labor, 18 collective bargaining agreements were
 concluded. Although an amendment to the Labor Act gave
 centralized bargaining power to the TUC in negotiations with
 the public sector, this law was overtuTned on procedural
 grounds in 1987, and the collective bargaining provisions have
 not been resubmitted to Parliament.
 The Chief Labor Officer and his staff at the Ministry of Labor
 provide consulation services. Disputes are frequently settled
 through cohsulation and dialogue without resorting to strikes
 or other industrial action. During the sugar and bauxite
 strikes, however, this process did little to help resolve the
 dispute. There were no known cases of antiunion
 discrimination. There are no special areas or industries
 where collective bargaining is impeded or discouraged; labor
 laws and regulations are applied uniformly throughout the
 country.
 
 
 619
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and it
 does not exist in Guyana.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Minimum age laws are set out in the Factories Act and the
 Employment of Women, Young Persons, and Children Act. Under
 the law, no person under 14 years of age shall be employed in
 any industrial undertaking, and no person under 16 shall be
 employed at night, except under regulated circumstances.
 Government policy, however, is stricter: no one under 18 can
 be employed outside the family. In addition, the terms
 "industry" and "factory" as used in the law have been
 interpreted by the Ministry of Labor to encompass nearly all
 workplaces except offices and retail shops. According to the
 law, children under age 14 may be employed only in enterprises-
 in which members of the same family are employed. The
 Ministry of Labor monitors compliance with minimum age laws.
 There are significant numbers of children in Guyana under the
 age of 14 who engage in street vending and there have been no
 apparent efforts by the Government to limit this activity.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Hours of employment are set under the Factories Act and vary
 by industry and sector. Most workers work an 8-hour day and a
 40-hour week. The Ministry of Labor monitors compliance with
 laws on maximum hours. Occupational health and safety
 standards are also treated under the Factories Act. The
 Occupational Health and Safety Division of the Ministry of
 Labor conducts factory inspections and investigates charges of
 substandard workplaces and conditions. The Ministry of Labor
 report for 1987 states, however, that this division was
 hampered by understaffing and inadequate funding.
 Despite a 20-percent increase in the minimum wage for public
 employees, the 70-percent devaluation of the Guyanese currency
 on March 31, and the subsequent inflation, caused the public
 sector minimum daily wage to decline from the equivalent of
 $2.49 at the official exchange rate to $.90 per day. The
 widely used black market rate for U.S. dollars is
 approximately 40 percent more than the official rate. In
 September the Government implemented a further 20-percent
 increase, which brought the public sector minimum wage to the
 equivalent of $1.09 per day. This figure is considered
 inadequate to support workers and their families, primarily
 because continuing inflation and the recent devaluation have
 far outpaced wage increases. There is no legally established
 private sector minimum wage, but private employees' salaries
 are in almost all cases higher than those of public workers.
