 BURMA
 On September 18, 1988, a military dictatorship seized power in
 Burma through deadly suppression of massive, countrywide
 prodemocracy demonstrations. This popular uprising had done
 away with Ne Win's Burma Socialist Program Party (BSPP). This
 party's policies isolated Burma from the international
 community and engendered economic decline. The armed forces
 imposed martial law and established a 19-member State Law and
 Order Restoration Council (SLORC) as Burma's governing body.
 Members of this council are all senior military officers loyal
 to the ostensibly retired Ne Win and ranking members of the
 old regime.
 Fulfilling a promise made shortly after it took control, the
 military staged elections in May. Despite.harassment and
 arrests of opposition leaders and tight campaign restrictions,
 the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) won over 80
 percent of the parliamentary seats. However, contrary to its
 promises to relinquish control, the military ignored the
 election results and took steps to prolong its rule for an
 indefinite period.
 The Government continues to enforce martial law through a
 heavy military presence in Rangoon, Mandalay, and other urban
 areas. An 11 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew; extensive surveillance of
 government employees and private citizens; severe restrictions
 on civil servants' contact with foreign missions; arrests,
 harassment, and torture of political activists; and aggressive
 propaganda denouncing alleged agitation and foreign
 interference buttress the military's control. The Government
 rationalizes its extensive security apparatus as necessary to
 combat numerous ethnic insurgencies, although in recent years
 insurgent groups have posed no threat to the country's
 heartland. Financed mostly through narcotics production and
 trafficking, these groups engage in small-scale fighting along
 the country's borders to gain a measure of autonomy against
 perceived domination by the ethnic Burman majority.
 Twenty-six years of Ne Win's rule reduced what was once the
 richest land in southeast Asia to a U.N.-designated "least
 developed country." The new military leadership has tinkered
 with the economy to permit some foreign investment and obtain
 badly needed foreign exchange. It has failed, however, to
 address the fundamental problems: highly centralized
 decisionmaking, a grossly overvalued currency, and
 uncontrolled monetary expansion.
 Burma's deplorable human rights situation did not improve in
 1990. Torture, disappearances, arbitrary arrests and
 detentions, unfair trials, and compulsory labor persisted,
 according to numerous credible reports. Freedom of speech,
 press, and assembly were severely curtailed, as were worker
 rights. The regime's program for arbitrarily relocating some
 half million urban poor produced widespread hardship,
 including malnutrition, disease, and some fatalities. Despite
 holding--and losing--a free election, the military made it
 abundantly clear that the people do not have the right to
 change their government. Treatment of the population remained
 capricious and apparently unrestrained by legal, institutional,
 or moral considerations.
 
 
 BURMA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and other Extrajudicial Killing
 Government-instigated political killings were less common than
 in the more turbulent years of 1988 and 1989. Sufficient
 credible reports exist, however, to suggest a number of
 civilian deaths at the hands of government officials or
 soldiers throughout la90. Most of the reported deaths
 resulted from brutality in prison, including denial of medical
 treatment. For example, an Asia Watch report cited the case
 of one dissident who died while chained to his hospital bed.
 In August a student caught returning home just.after the 10
 p.m. curfew hour was beaten to death at a Rangoon police
 station. In October troops sent to- crush a hunger strike in
 Rangoon's Insein prison reportedly killed three inmates. In
 November a man named Aung Aung Moe died after beatings by
 local authorities, according to numerous reliable reports.
 NLD official U Maung Ko died in custody in November. Although
 regime officials claimed that he hung himself, several
 witnesses reported that his body had bruises and one leg was
 broken. Authorities again used excessive force in putting
 down antigovernment demonstrations during 1990. On August 6,
 Mandalay police beat four monks who were leaving the scene of
 a just-completed demonstration. Two days later, during a
 scuffle with demonstrating students and monks, Mandalay
 security authorities fired shots that killed at least one
 person and wounded others, according to numerous reliable
 accounts-
 h. Disappearance
 The number of persons who disappeared during 1990 was probably
 smaller than in 1988 and 1989, but accurate estimates are
 again impossible. Family and friends assume that many who-
 have- disappeared are under detention or have died in jail.
 Some of those who disappeared were later reported' as having
 been arrested. Others dropped out of sight or quietly
 attempted to leave the country in anticipation of arrest. A
 trickle of young people continued to join student-insurgent
 groups fighting the regime, while others were impressed as
 army porters (see Section l.g.).
 Authorities seldom responded to inquiries from embassies or
 from families concerning the whereabouts and welfare of
 disappeared or jailed individuals. The few replies routinely
 consisted of only general statements that such persons were
 arrested for violations of existing laws.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Substantial evidence, including eyewitness reports, documents
 that torture, beatings, and mistreatment of political
 detainees remain commonplace in Burma. Maltreatment includes
 sleep and food deprivation; beatings of prisoners causing
 permanent injury; suffocation; cigarette burns; electrical
 shocks to the genitals and elsewhere; and forcing prisoners to
 squat or assume unnatural positions for lengthy periods.
 Techniques designed to intimidate and disorient prisoners
 prior to interrogation are also routinely practiced. Guards
 and prison physicians also have deprived political prisoners
 
 
 824
 BURMA
 of needed medical treatment. Imprisoned antiregime activists
 have received beatings after requesting medical attention,
 according to several well-sourced reports.
 Despite repeated expressions of concern by foreign governments
 and international human rights organizations, the regime made
 no apparent effort to investigate charges of torture. The
 Government routinely denied that it engaged in torture or
 condoned the practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The regime arbitrarily detained or arrested several thousand
 people during 1990. While many were held only briefly and
 released after interrogation, significant numbers were
 detained for lengthy periods. In addition, many of those
 released were subsequently rearrested. A conservative
 estimate of politically motivated arrests would be 2,500 to
 3,000, the majority occurring after the May 27 elections (see
 Section 3). Detainees were commonly accused of violating
 criminal statutes, though some were simply held without
 trial. Most belonged to political parties or were involved in
 peaceful antigovernment demonstrations or pamphleteering.
 Numerous arrests of protesting students and monks occurred in
 August in connection with demonstrations to mark the second
 anniversary of the August 1988 crackdown. The military
 sometimes arrested parents of students who could not be
 located. In an October crackdown on the Buddhist clergy,
 upwards of 100 monks were arrested, mostly in Mandalay.
 Detention and interrogation of party officials occurred
 throughout the election campaign, either as harassment or
 reprisals for antigovernment statements or actions. In early
 February, reliable sources reported the detention of 25-40
 candidates from several parties. Military spokesmen
 subsequently confirmed the interrogation of several party
 officials but denied any arrests. In April the regime
 arrested 13 leaders of the Democratic Party for a New Society,
 who had written a letter alleging official harassment of their
 campaign activities. Ten days before the election, the
 Commander of the Irrawaddy Division announced the arrests of
 more than 30 officials from different parties for infringing
 various laws and campaign regulations. Arrests of party
 officials intensified after the election, as part of a
 campaign to stamp out all opposition. By year's end, an
 estimated 500 NLD officials, including some 45 elected Members
 of Parliament, were in custody.
 In July the military, without public announcement, extended by
 6 months the house arrest of National League for Democracy
 General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi. The decision was taken
 under the provisions of the "Law to Safeguard the State From
 the Dangers of Subversive Elements," which also was the legal
 basis for her initial 1-year period of house arrest. Further
 6-month extensions are possible up to a period of 3 years.
 Ms. Suu Kyi has never been formally charged.
 Even before the establishment of martial law, there was no
 provision in Burmese law for judicial determination of the
 legality of detention. Under martial law individuals have no
 pretrial rights. There is also no bail (see Section l.e.).
 
 
 825
 BURMA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Burma remained under martial law throughout 1990. Official
 spokesmen on numerous occasions emphasized that the Government
 ruled according to martial law and was not bound by any
 constitutional restrictions. Citing improved security
 conditions in 153 townships throughout the country--including
 the major cities of Rangoon and Mandalay--the regime revoked
 in those areas summary judicial powers granted to local
 military commanders during the previous year. This revocation
 did not, however, restore civilian legal authority, nor did it
 appreciably change law enforcement procedures.
 Military. tribunals continue to exercise jurisdiction over all
 cases involving defiance of orders issued by the SLORC or
 local military commanders (civil suits, petty thefts, and
 major crimes of no interest to the SLORC are left to civilian
 courts). Tribunals can mete out death or life sentences, or
 up to 3 year's imprisonment with labor, irrespective of
 existing legal provisions. During trials, court officials
 must report daily to the military and to the attorney
 general--with the military having final authority. Military
 courts continued to hand out heavy sentences to political
 prisoners. For example, after being held incommunicado for
 over a year, a well-known student leader was sentenced to life
 imprisonment in May. In July a parliamentary candidate
 arrested the day before the election was sentenced to 3 years'
 imprisonment. A crackdown on political leaders in the fall
 resulted in several political convictions. Two NLD leaders
 were sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment in September for
 "causing unrest." In November acting Chairman Kyi Maung and
 the party's second-ranking official, Chit Khine, were
 sentenced respectively to 10 and 7 years' imprisonment for
 "passing state secrets." At the same time, two more NLD
 leaders were sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment for "creating
 disturbances by writing false news" in connection with
 Mandalay's August demonstrations. As part of an October
 campaign against antiregime elements among the Buddhist
 clergy, the regime increased local commanders' martial law
 authority, delegating power to area commanders to investigate
 and "effect speedy and effective disposal of cases" involving
 politically active monks.
 The tribunals are free to summon or reject witnesses and to
 consider or ignore evidence. The accused is not presumed
 innocent and has no guaranteed right to a defense attorney.
 When allowed to participate, a defense attorney's role is
 severely limited. Lawyers- have been warned that an overly
 aggressive defense could jeopardize both attorney and client.
 Appeal is possible subject to certain conditions. Sentences
 up to 3 years' imprisonment may be appealed to the regional
 commander within 30 days. In cases involving the death
 sentence, life imprisonment, or sentences of over 3 years,
 appeals may be lodged within 30 days with the army
 commander-in-chief. In practice, military authorities have
 hampered the appeal process by noncooperation with and
 intimidation of attorneys.
 The number of political prisoners held by the regime remains
 impossible to estimate accurately, although reliable sources
 believe there are at least 2,000. According to one credible
 account, during May there were more than 1,000 political
 prisoners at Rangoon's Insein Prison alone. Prisons in
 Mandalay and at least five other locations also reportedly
 
 
 826
 BURMA
 hold political prisoners. Moreover, arrests of dissidents
 increased in the late summer and fall. Perhaps 1,500 to 2,000
 were taken in during that time. Many were released after
 interrogation, but some were rearrested.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The State continued to intrude extensively into the lives of
 private citizens during 1990. Forced entry and warrantless
 searches of private homes were often conducted without
 warning. The Government strictly monitored the travel,
 whereabouts, and activities of many persons. A well-developed
 and ubiquitous system of neighborhood informers reported on
 dissidents and criticism of the Government. Security
 personnel selectively monitored private correspondence and
 telephone calls.
 The regime continued its program of forced resettlement
 throughout the country. It is difficult to estimate
 accurately the number forcibly resettled, but a figure in
 excess of 500,000 is reasonable. While the Government
 described all those forced to move as "squatters," in many
 instances people had purchased and held deeds to their
 properties. There are several well-documented instances of
 arrests of people who protested resettlement and of
 intimidation and threats of force against reluctant
 neighborhoods. While selection of communities for relocation
 was arbitrary, several neighborhoods active in the 1988
 disturbances were forced to move. Numerous unconfirmed
 reports also allege official involvement in land speculation
 in areas vacated as a result of the resettlement program.
 The Government has resettled people, almost totally at their
 own expense, to "new towns," sometimes 100 miles or more from
 previous residences. These new settlements are in many cases
 sited on abandoned rice paddy land, subject to severe flooding
 in the rainy season. Facilities remain substandard or
 nonexistent. Occupants quite often live without adequate
 water, transportation, medical facilities, electricity,
 sanitation, or shelter from the elements. Dengue fever,
 malaria, and severe malnutrition took their toll, both in
 Rangoon and at other locations.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 The Burmese Army has fought various insurgencies for more than
 four decades. These conflicts have resulted in numerous human
 rights violations on all sides, including mistreatment and
 killing of prisoners, neglect of sick and wounded, impressment
 of civilians for porter duty, and indiscriminate attacks on
 civilians. Although there were no verifiable, eyewitness
 reports of deaths of impressed Burmese Army porters, it is
 reasonable to believe that such deaths continued to occur.
 The Burmese military continues to impress civilian labor to
 serve without compensation in combat areas. Porters carry
 ammunition, supplies, and wounded under the harshest
 conditions. They are subject to hostile fire as well as
 maltreatment at the hands of Burmese soldiers. They are
 placed at the head of columns to detonate mines and booby
 traps and to trigger ambushes. When porters are wounded, fall
 ill, or become unable to continue their work, they are left
 unattended to die. At the end of their service, survivors
 often must find their own means to return home.
 
 
 827
 BURMA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech remained severely restricted. Although the
 degree of enforcement varied, the regime did not tolerate
 opposing.views or criticism. Private citizens remained
 reluctant to express opinions for fear of government
 informers. The Government established extensive and
 restrictive guidelines for candidate speeches anT party
 statements during the election campaign. Banned were
 criticism of the regime, the army, and remarks "causing
 unrest." Regulations limited parties to one 10-minute
 televised address and one 15-minute radio broadcast--both
 approved in advance by censors. On February 28. the commander
 of the, Rangoon Division instructed authorities to scrutinize
 summaries of planned remarks by candidates before giving
 permission for political rallies.
 The regime continued to ban publications which it alleged
 criticized.its programs and policies. Throughout the year,
 authorities closed presses and arrested printers and
 distributors'of "agitative pamphlets." During the political
 campaign, the Government directed parties to exercise
 self-censorship of their written materials. Parties could
 issue without prior approval only those publications they
 believed did not contravene the law, but had to seek official
 approval in case of doubt. Regime propaganda repeatedly
 denounced various foreign news organizations for interference
 in Burma's affairs. Censors banned issues of news magazines
 with articles criticizing regime practices or reporting
 activities- of opposition figures or groups. The regime also
 used arrests and other forms of intimidation to discourage
 widespread listening to foreign news services.
 The Government continues to run and operate the mass media,
 including television, radio, and the sole newspaper, The
 Working People's Daily. The regime appoints newspaper editors
 and reviews editorials before publication. Especially for
 domestic news, journalists must observe strict publishing and
 broadcast guidelines. The Government receives the product of
 several wire services, but carefully selects and edits
 international news before publication or broadcast. All forms
 of communication--domestic and imported books and periodicals,
 stage plays, motion pictures, and musical recordings--are
 officially controlled and censored. Criticism of the
 Government, its officials, or sectors of the economy it
 controls-or partially controls is not permitted.
 Late in the year, the military stepped- up its monitoring of
 local journalists attached to international news services. In
 October security authorities detained and interrogated a
 journalist for several hours because of alleged ties to the
 oppos ition NLD.
 University teachers must report in daily at their offices,
 despite the fact that, excluding a few schools, the entire
 university system has been closed since June 1988. All
 teachers and professors are subject to the same restrictions
 on freedom.of speech, political activities, and publications
 as-other government employees. These include frequent
 warnings against criticism of the Government; repeated
 instructions not to discuss politics while at work; and
 strictures against joining or supporting political parties,
 engaging in political activity, and meeting foreign officials.
 
 
 828
 BURMA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of assembly exists only for those organizations
 permitted by law and duly registered with the Government.
 Moreover, the regime severely restricts the activities of
 these organizations. Trade associations and professional
 bodies, like other organizations, are permitted only if
 sanctioned by the Government, which strictly monitors their
 activities. Members are not free to discuss politics or
 criticize the regime. The martial law edict prohibiting
 outdoor assemblies by more than five persons was again
 unevenly enforced.
 The regime tightly controlled and monitored political rallies
 during the election campaign. In its preelection report, the
 International Human Rights Law Group concluded that the
 Government had "grossly breached minimum campaigning freedoms
 including the exercise of freedom of assembly." Campaign
 regulations banned political processions, limited campaigning
 to prescribed places, and required parties to seek permission
 for rallies 7 days in advance, specifying the date and
 identity of speakers. Authorities had wide latitude to
 disapprove requests or to attach numerous, arbitrary
 conditions. Parties subsequently complained that in many
 localities officials deliberately designated areas for rallies
 that were inconveniently distant or otherwise inappropriate,
 such as cemeteries.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in law and widely observed
 in practice. The great majority of Burmese are Buddhist,
 although sizable numbers of Christians, Muslims, and animists
 exist among various minority ethnic groups. While allowing
 these groups to practice freely, security services monitor the
 activities of some religious communities. The Government
 requires all religious organizations to register and subjects
 religious publications to the same control and censorship as
 that imposed on secular ones.
 In mid-October, authorities reacted strongly to organized
 passive opposition by monks in Mandalay and elsewhere.
 Upwards of 100 politically active clerics were arrested and
 others threatened with similar treatment if they continued to
 refuse to provide religious services to military personnel.
 Concurrently, two official proclamations outlawed groups of
 monks opposed to the Government and empowered local military
 commanders to move against others who engage in political
 activities. Troops subsequently searched numerous monastery
 compounds in Mandalay and seized quantities of alleged
 contraband goods and political literature. In Rangoon, two
 teaching monasteries were closed--both on the grounds that
 their students were out of control. To tighten its control
 over the activities of Mandalay monks, the Government in
 October enforced a photo registration card requirement for all
 monks and threatened to defrock those who refused to comply.
 Religious groups can and do establish links with
 coreligionists in other countries. The Catholic Church, for
 example, maintains ties to the Vatican. Foreign religious
 representatives are usually allowed only tourist visas and are
 not permitted to preach, proselytize, or remain to carry out
 missionary activities. There is at least one long-time
 resident foreign Catholic (Italian) priest in Burma, but
 permanent missionary establishments are not permitted.
 
 
 BURMA
 As part of its large-scale "urban development" program, the
 Government took control of several Christian and Muslim
 properties throughout Burma. A Catholic cemetery in Sagaing
 (near Mandalay) was turned into a park, and there are several
 reports of seizures of mosques and other Muslim properties in
 Mon and Arakan states. Religious communities in Mandalay have
 appealed, so far successfully, a government plan to bulldoze
 Christian and Moslem cemeteries and move the remains outside
 the city. In April authorities arrested and briefly held all
 seven lay members of the Board of Management of the Catholic
 Church of Burma who had gathered to protest the seizure of
 part of a church compound in Rangoon.
 d. -Freedom of Movement Within the Country-, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Burmese citizens have the legal right to live anywhere in the
 country. Except for limitations in areas of insurgent
 activity, Burmese citizens may travel freely within the
 country, but must inform local authorities of their temporary
 place of residence. Road checks are frequent, and have
 resulted in detention for several days of people deemed
 suspicious. People who fail to report either guests or
 intentions to stay overnight to the authorities are subject to
 a jail term, and arrests sometimes have been made. Throughout
 most of the year, the Government imposed a 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
 curfew on the entire country. In October it relaxed the
 curfew to 11 p.m. to 4 a.m.--the first change since December
 1988. In most cases, the curfew was strictly enforced, and
 violators were often punished.
 Legal requirements, bureaucratic procedures, and corruption
 cause long delays in obtaining passports. Emigrants must
 reimburse the Government for "educational expenses" before
 receiving exit permission and are severely limited in what
 they may take with them. Those who leave the country
 illegally cannot legally return. On the other hand, Burmese
 citizens who leave the country legally are generally allowed
 to return to visit relatives. However, the law does not
 recognize dual citizenship, and acquiring citizenship in
 another country results in the loss of Burmese citizenship.
 While those who take citizenship in another country are
 legally banned from returning, even to attend family funerals,
 the regime showed some flexibility in. 1990 by permitting a few
 former Burmese to visit for brief periods. Emigrants wishing
 to return permanently are required to reapply for Burmese
 citizenship, and approval is not guaranteed. Noncitizen
 residents, including ethnic Indians and Chinese born in Burma
 who hold foreigners' registration cards, must obtain prior
 permission to travel.
 Foreign refugees or displaced persons may not resettle or seek
 safe haven within Burma. The Government treats persons
 claiming to be refugees as illegal immigrants and imprisons
 them.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Burma is governed solely by the military, and the Burmese
 people do not have the right or the ability peacefully to
 change their government. In 1989 and 1990 active-duty
 military officers replaced civilians in important positions
 throughout the administration. The military occupied every
 cabinet-level position, numerous director general and
 
 
 830
 BURMA
 subordinate posts, and key positions previously held by
 technocrats in the economic ministries. The establishment in
 February of a large military holding company, with
 capitalization equal to about 9 percent of Burma's total gross
 domestic product, significantly increased the military's role
 in the economy.
 On May 27, the Government held Burma's first national election
 involving multiple parties in 30 years. Several accounts have
 attested that the procedures employed by the regime for voting
 and counting ballots were free and fair. Prior to the
 election, however, the regime had, in a series of closed
 proceedings, banned the candidacy of the country's leading
 opposition figure, National League for Democracy General
 Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi. Imprisonment, in most cases
 without trial, of numerous other political leaders effectively
 barred their candidacies as well. The subsequent election
 campaign was severely restricted and featured repeated press
 and official statements deprecating the democratic process and
 attacking various political parties, most particularly the NLD.
 In the election, the NLD received nearly 60 percent of valid
 votes cast and over 80 percent of parliamentary seats. At a
 postelection press conference, official military spokesmen
 acknowledged the party's mandate and pledged that the newly
 elected parliament would be free to write and adopt any
 constitution. By year's end, however, the military government
 had given no indication of a timetable for transfer of power.
 Moreover, it arrested NLD leader Kyi Maung, deputy leader Chit
 Khine, 45 elected Members of Parliament, and an estimated 500
 NLP officials throughout the country. The authorities renewed
 press attacks against the party, stopped all of its
 publications, and raided NLD offices throughout Burma. The
 regime now insists that transfer of power can occur only after
 a protracted constitution-drafting process under its control
 has been completed. The conditions it has imposed effectively
 negate the election results and ensure indefinite military
 rule.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government rejects outside scrutiny of its human rights
 record. It is unwilling to discuss human rights problems with
 foreign governments or nongovernmental organizations and
 routinely denies visas to foreign officials concerned with
 human rights. The military consistently denies charges of
 abuses and criticizes other governments and independent
 organizations for interfering in its affairs. No internal
 human rights organizations exist. A group called Amnesty
 International of Burma, established during the 1988
 prodemocracy demonstrations, was subsequently denied
 registration as a legal organization.
 Amnesty International, Asia Watch, the Governments of the
 United States, Japan, Australia, India, and the European
 Community have repeatedly and publicly expressed concern over
 various human rights abuses in Burma. The February 1990
 meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 appointed an "independent expert" to examine Burma's human
 rights situation and report to next year's session. The
 regime permitted this expert to visit Burma but took great
 pains to limit her access to people outside the regime.
 
 
 831
 BURMA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Burma's numerous ethnic minorities, with their own distinctive
 cultures and languages, are underrepresented in the Government
 and largely excluded from the military leadership. Despite
 some limited regime attention to the problem, economic
 development among minorities continued to lag and many still
 live at the subsistence level. This is due in part to
 geographic factors that impede economic development in the
 rugged, isolated border areas populated by minorities.
 Persons of nonethnic Burmese ancestry, primarily Indians and
 Chinese, are denied full citizenship and excluded from
 government positions. Indians and Chinese minorities continue
 to play an important role in the economy--a situation resented
 by many Burmans. Social prejudice against the country's
 Muslim community has in the past erupted into violence and
 prompted official actions infringing on the practice of
 Islam. The military periodically requires minority
 populations to provide without compensation vehicles,
 equipment, and lodging for soldiers.
 Women in Burma have traditionally had an active role in
 society. They enjoy most of the same legal rights as men,
 keep their own names after marriage, and often control family
 finances. Though there is no, legal or obvious de facto
 discrimination against women, female participation is low in
 the minuscule industrial sector and in the government
 administration. There are no women's rights organizations.
 There is no violence directed specifically against women.
 Although several credible reports attested to beatings of
 female prisoners, authorities appeared generally to treat
 detained women better than men. While in 1988 there were
 unconfirmed but persistent reports of rapes by soldiers or
 police, Burmese culturally view rape with great abhorrence.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. Right of Association
 After seizing power in 1988, the military banned the workers'
 and peasants' organizations established by the previous
 government. In 1990 several political parties established
 workers' organizations or committees to consider labor issues,
 but there continue to be no trade unions and no independent
 labor movement in Burma. Leaders of unofficial labor
 associations are subject to arrest- Workers do not have the
 right to strike, and none did so in 1990.
 In April 1989, the United States suspended Burma's eligibility
 for trade concessions under the Generalized System of
 Preferences program (GSP), pending steps to afford its labor
 force internationally recognized worker rights. Early in
 1990, a United States interagency subcommittee declined a
 formal request to reconsider the suspension.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have no right to organize and bargain, collectively.
 Military authorities are the sole arbiter of workers' issues.
 The regime abolished labor arbitration boards which, while
 government controlled, at least theoretically provided means
 for airing labor disputes. No special economic processing
 zones exist in Burma.
 
 
 832
 BURlMA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Burma's legal code does not prohibit forced labor. The regime
 routinely employed forced labor on its myriad building
 projects. For example, according to numerous credible
 reports, authorities employed corvee labor--including preteens
 and the elderly--drawn from townships in southern Rangoon to
 construct a new road. Officials accepted bribes to excuse
 people from work and, according to one reliable report, on May
 7 beat five persons caught sitting at the side of the road
 instead of working. The press subsequently reported the
 construction of this road by "voluntary" labor.
 The Burmese army has for years conscripted civilian males to
 serve as porters. According to numerous eyewitness reports in
 1990, the army continued to impress youths off the streets in
 various cities in minority areas. Women are now also being
 impressed as cooks and laundresses for soldiers in frontline
 areas, according to one report. Military authorities commonly
 permitted conscripted individuals and their families to pay
 money in lieu of serving as porter (see Section l.g.).
 d. Minimum Age of Employment for Children
 Children between 13 and 15 years of age may work 4 hours a
 day. The penalty for employers who disregard this regulation,
 2 years in prison, is not strictly enforced. In cities,
 working children are highly visible. Many spend their nights
 on the street, according to numerous reliable sources. They
 are hired at lower rates than adults for the same kind of
 work, and economic pressure forces them to work not only for
 their own survival but also to support their families.
 Burmese law requires children to attend school through the
 fourth standard, usually reached between the ages of 12 and
 14. According to a draft UNICEF report, however, 33 percent
 of children aged 5 to 9 never enroll in school. Of those who
 do, less than 30 percent complete the fourth grade. Forty-two
 percent Burma's primary school children leave school for
 economic reasons. In the higher grades, the dropout rate
 among girls is double that of boys. With the exception of a
 few special schools, the entire university system has been
 closed since the unrest in June 1988.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is a 5-day, 35-hour workweek for employees in the public
 sector and a 6-day, 44-hour workweek for private and
 state-owned business employees, with overtime paid for
 additional work. However, government employees seldom work
 more than 6 1/2 hours a day. Workers have 21 paid holidays a
 year.
 On April 1, 1989, the Government raised the minimum wage to
 about $2.50 a day at the current official rate of exchange.
 At the more realistic free market rate, this works out to
 about 25 cents a day. Wages continue to lag far behind
 inflation and are well below subsistence for many. In the
 private sector, the minimum wage law applies only to
 cheroot-rolling plants and rice mills. There are numerous
 provisions to protect health and safety at workplaces,
 pertaining to room size, ventilation, fire hazards, and the
 availability of latrines and drinking water. In practice
 these are seldom enforced, particularly in the private sector.
