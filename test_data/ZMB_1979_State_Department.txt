 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a one-party state with a strong presidency and
 extensive constitutional guarantees of human rights. The
 judiciary enjoys considerable independence and the politi-
 cal system, although limited to a single party, permits a
 substantial amount of political participation. Zambia is
 a vocal supporter of human rights internationally. Nonethe-
 less, the armed conflicts in neighboring Rhodesia and Nami-
 bia have placed unusual strains on the Zambian political
 system. Because of the continuing state of emergency, the
 Government has reserved the right to suspend constitutional
 guarantees, although it has not often done so. Zambia is
 strongly committed to the struggle for majority rule in
 southern Africa and supports USG's human rights policy.
 1.   Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Zambian Government policy strongly opposes the use of tor-
 ture. However, there are allegations that individual mil-
 itary personnel and police officers have resorted to un-
 necessary brutality when arresting or interrogating people.
 Such allegations have been made particularly during periods
 of national emergency such as during the October/November
 1979 Rhodesian raids into Zambia.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is not
 common. However, charges of maltreatment have been made;
 Zambian prisons are crowded, unsanitary and lacking basic
 necessities. Health care for prisoners is available al-
 though not always adequate.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under the state of emergency that in practice has been in
 effect since independence in 1954, the President has wide
 discretion to detain or restrict the movements of individ-
 uals. This detention authority dates from the British co-
 lonial administration and neither the authority nor the
 detention procedures under it have been revised since.
 Those detained under this authority enjoy certain rights,
 among them the right to receive notice of the reason for
 detention; publication of the fact of detention; access to
 counsel and the right to seek judicial review of the deten-
 tion order after one year. However, habeas corpus is not
 available to persons detained under Pres  ntial order, and
 the detaining authority is not obliged to accept the recom-
 mendation of the judicial review tribunal.
 Law officers and defense personnel also enjoy extraordinary
 powers under emergency legislation. Police officers of the
 rank of assistant inspector or above may arrest without war-
 rant and cause a person to be detained for up to 28 days
 before bringing charges. Such officers also enjoy broad
 powers of search.

 The President's detention powers and other emergency powers
 have in the past been used ag'ainst political opponent Simon
 Kapwepwe, as well as against Zimbabwe-Rhodesian nationalists
 and dissident Namibians, Zairean rebels, striking university
 students and professors and violators of currency control re-
 gulations. In most cases detainees are either released or
 formally charged once investigation of their cases has been
 completed, a process that usually takes less than a month.
 In practice, these powers are applied in many cases where or-
 dinary criminal charges would suffice. This is especially so
 in cases involving currency control. The Department of State
 is not aware of any executive order of detention or arrest in
 1979. Arrests for suspected involvement in externally ins-
 pired subversion have taken place, but the Government has fol-
 lowed regular judicial procedures. The number of persons cur-
 rently under Presidential detention order is reportedly very
 small but the Department of State does not have a precise
 figure. There is no information that suggests that political
 dissidents are serving long term imprisonments.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Zambian Government guarantees the right to a free public
 trial. This right is observed, but not in the case of Presi-
 dential detainees. The safeguards of English common law are
 provided in court cases. Lawyers handling even sensitive po-
 litical cases have expressed their confidence in the indepen-
 dence of the Zambian judiciary. Individuals who believe their
 rights have been or are likely to be contravened may apply to
 the High Court for redress. In 1972 several former political
 detainees collected damages for assault and false imprisonment.
 In late 1978 the Supreme Court heard a case brought by two
 prominent political figures against the ruling United National
 Independence Party.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is respected except in isolated in-
 cidents related to the national emergency and in some cases
 involving the deportation of illegal aliens.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 In times of high copper prices, Zambia was one of the more
 fortunate African countries, with the resources to provide
 substantial medical, educational and social services to the
 public. Zambia ranks near the top among African countries
 in its expenditure per capita on education. However, Zambia's
 dependence on world copper prices impairs the Government's
 ability td provide basic services. Accordingly, the 1979
 budget stressed the need to concentrate on economic stabili-
 zation and to reduce Government spending; the expansion of
 social welfare porgrams is subordinated to overall economic
 needs. Since mid-1977 President Kaunda has put his author-
 ity behind efforts to diversify the economy, with emphasis
 on developing Zambia's significant agricultural potential.
 This emphasis is reflected in the Third National Development
 Plan (1979-1983), which allocates the largest share of Gov-
 ernment investment for rural development. Official corrup-
 tion is a persistent problem in Zambia. President Kaunda
 has actively sought to communicate his own concern to Gov-
 erment officials and has acted forcefully against violators
 of the public trust. Cases of official corruption are in-
 vestigated and pursued through the judicial process.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of expression and assembly are theoretically circum-
 scribed by the constitutional ban on all political activity
 outside the one-party structure.  (See section 3c below.)
 Nonetheless, substantial freedom is permitted in practice.
 For example, the press regularly reports criticism of Gov-
 ernmental policies expressed in the National Parliament and
 by the general public. Even though both Lusaka newspapers
 are owned or editorially guided by the Government and/or the
 Party, criticism of Government performance is permitted.
 Both papers were sharply critical of Government economic po-
 licies in the past year and cases of corruption were heavily
 reported. However, criticism of the Head of State and of
 the basic national philosophy, described as Humanism, is pro-
 hibited. Criticism of the President is punishable by fine or
 imprisonment; there were no cases of such punishment in
 1979. Censorship of foreign publications exists, but is not
 stringent.
 Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and strong-
 ly supported by President Kaunda. However, rigorous proselyt-
 izing, especially where open air meetings are concerned, must
 be cleared by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Jehovah's
 Witnesses are specifically prohibited by Presidential order
 from proselytizing.
 All labor unions come under the Zambia Congress of Trade
 Unions (ZCTU). Member unions are well organized, strong de-
 fenders of worker interests and enjoy the right of collective
 bargaining. Although the ZCTU technically operates under
 Government supervision, it frequently questions and chal-
 lenges Government policy. The ZCTU is   regarded by experi-
 enced, outside observers as an effective and democratic
 trade union organization.
 Women participate freely in the social, economic and polit-
 ical life of the country. They hold senior positions in the
 Party and the Government. They are represented in the pro-
 fessions and at the National University. At the same time,
 the majority of Zambian women still occupy traditional roles
 in a society were rapid urbanization has served to undermine
 the importance of such roles. Further, women lack equal sta-
 tus with men regarding such matters as inheritance, taxation
 and ability to obtain credit. A Government commission on le-
 gal reform is examining such questions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The President may, under emergency powers, restrict the move-
 ments of individuals within Zambia. Foreign diplomats may
 not travel outside a 50 kilometer radius of Lusaka without
 written permission of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This
 restriction is consistently enforced. The Government also re-
 serves the right to refuse or withdraw passports to prevent
 foreign travel by individuals whose activities abroad are
 considered inimical to Zambian interests. Freedom to emi-
 grate is permitted by the Government. However, strict cur-
 rency regulations can make emigration difficult.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Under the 1973 Constitution, the United National Indepen-
 dence Party (UNIP) became the only legal political party
 in Zambia. Candidates for political office at any level
 must be members of UNIP and are subject to "vetting" for
 suitability by party authorities. This system is describ-
 ed by the Zambian leadership as "one-party, participatory
 democracy." The Government maintains that competition
 within the one-party framework, including elections with
 universal suffrage in which secrecy of the ballot is
 protected, gives adequate expression to the will of the
 Zambian people.
 In 1971 Simon Kapwepwe, a former close associate of Pres-
 ident Kaunda, broke from UNIP to form the United Progres-
 sive Party (UPP). The UPP was banned and Kapwepwe de-
 tained in February 1972 when President Kaunda announced
 that Zambia would become a one-party state. Kapwepwe and
 several of his senior followers rejoined UNIP in Septem-
 ber 1977. In late summer of 1978, Kapwepwe and two other
 persons announced their candidacy for the presidency of
 UNIP. Kapwepwe's candidacy was thwarted by the UNIP Party
 General Conference's adoption of an amendment to the Par-
 ty's constitution which restricted candidacies to those
 with five years of party membership. This change in the
 party's charter was appealed and upheld in the courts.
 As expected, President Kaunda was renominated at the same
 General Conference and stood as the sole candidate in the
 December 1978 presidential elections. Seventy percent of
 the eligible voters participated and President Kaunda was
 returned to office by a substantial majority. In reality
 the Zambian political system is open to individuals of
 widely different opinions provided they are willing to op-
 erate within the one-party structure.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-government Investigations of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State knows of no requests in recent
 years for outside investigation of alleged human rights
 violations in Zambia. Amnesty International makes no re-
 ference to Zambia in its 1978 report. President Kaunda
 is strongly committed to the principles of human rights
 and has voiced full support for President Carter's human
 rights policies. He has actively committed Zambia to
 seeking a mechanism in the OAU for protection of human
 rights in Africa.
