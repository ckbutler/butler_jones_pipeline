 CHILE
 The military Government which took power in a 1973 coup against
 the Marxist-dominated Allende regime continues to rule Chile.
 Prior to that time, except for brief periods, Chile had
 elected civilian governments since the 1830's. The current
 Government includes both military and civilian officials and
 operates under the Constitution adopted by plebiscite in 1980.
 The militaryJunta exercises the legislative function, and
 there.is a separate judicial branch, but primary authority
 resides with the Commanding General of the Army and President,
 Augusto Pinochet. In late 1988 or early 1989, a plebiscite is
 to be held on a presidential candidate to be selected by the
 commanders-ln-chief of the four armed services. There are no
 constitutional restrictions on President Pinochet being that
 candiaate. If approved by a simple majority in the plebiscite,
 thap candidate would serve until 1997. If a majority voted
 "no," the Constitution calls for open and direct presidential
 elections to be held within 1 year, simultaneously with
 congressional elections scheduled for late 1989 or early 1990.
 Civil liberties are provided for in the 1980 Constitution, but
 the Government maintains significant discretionary authority
 to limit them by use of one or more of the five states of
 exception. also provided for in the Constitution or its
 transitory articles. During 1987 two of these states of
 exception were in effect. A third, the state of siege last
 imposed in September 1986 following an assassination attempt
 against President Pinochet, expired on January 6, 1987.
 Concurrently, the Government lifted the late-night curfew in
 effect for most of the first'13 years of military rule.
 Many fundamental political freedoms in Chile remained
 restricted during 1987. The implementation of laws which
 allowed for the legalization of political parties and the
 registration of voters provided somewhat greater freedom of
 association and assembly. Rights of private property, freedom
 of religion, and'minority rights are respected, but freedom
 from agbitrary arrest and exile is limited. Freedoms of
 speech and of the press were expanded when the Government gave
 permission for the publication of two daily opposition
 newspapers. However, access to television by opposition
 groups remained virtually nonexistent, although some
 encouraging-developments occurred at year's end. During 1987
 judicial measures were taken against a number of journalists
 for publishing articles which military courts found
 objectionable. Progress in creating the legislative framework
 necessary for a political transformation away from military
 rule were not matched by adequate steps to develop an
 atmosphere of freedom and fair competition conducive to a
 successful transition to full democracy. The Government
 passed legislation designed to implement a ban in the 1980
 Constitution against totalitarian parties, legislation which
 includes a prohibition against publishing or speaking about
 views similar to those of such groups or individuals. The
 Government defends the ban as necessary to protect Chilean
 democracy from those who would overthrow it.
 In 1987, as in the past, there were reliable and documented
 reports of torture and mistreatment of those detained by
 Chilean security forces. Some government ministries have
 tried to stop or at least control such abuses. These efforts
 included agreements between the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) and the National Informdtion Center (CNI),
 the Investigations Police, and the carabineros; the prohibition
 against detentions by the CNI; the establishment of an
 
 
 408
 CHILE
 observer role for the Interior Ministry's Advisory Committee
 on Human Rights over those detained by the Investigations
 Police; and the signing, although with reservations, of the
 United Nations, and Organization of American States' (OAS)
 conventions on torture. Members of the security and military
 forces are widely believed to be responsible for the
 kidnapings, beatings, torture, and in a few cases, murders,
 for which no suspects have been identified or apprehended.
 The number of such incidents increased during the year, with
 the killing of 12 members of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic
 Front (FPMR), the terrorist arm of the Chilean Communist Party.
 The Government continued to cooperate with the Special
 Rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC). Delegations from other human rights organizations,
 such as Amnesty International, Americas Watch, and the
 International Human Rights Law Group, visited Chile during the
 year and in some instances were given permission to visit
 prisons. The diplomatic community was routinely denied access
 to Chileans detained by the Government for violations of the
 various state security laws.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Deaths and injuries resulting from political violence continued
 during 1987. According to the Vicariate of Solidarity, the
 human rights organization of the Catholic Church, 51 persons
 died in acts of political violence during the year. Government
 officials state that terrorist groups in 1987 caused 42 deaths
 and 404 personal injuries in attacks which included 368
 bombings. Chilean Human Rights Commission (CHRC) figures
 indicate that 43 deaths occurred due to political violence.
 The deaths and injuries resulted from both deliberate and
 random actions by leftwing and rightwing terrorists and by
 security and military forces.
 Over half of the dead were leftist terrorists, with seven
 deaths attributed to the premature explosion of bombs
 reportedly being placed by these persons. Two deaths were
 attributed to rightwing extremists when shots were fired from
 vehicles at antigovernment demonstrators. In June 12 people,
 whom government reports tied to the FPMR, were shot by CNI
 officials in 5 separate incidents. In all five cases
 authorities maintained the victims were killed resisting
 arrest. Human rights organizations questioned these claims
 and sought a special judicial investigation of the incidents.
 A civilian court began investigating the deaths of 7 of these
 12 people, but before it could establish if they had been
 summarily executed or not, the investigation was taken over by
 a military court. Since then this case has disappeared from
 the press, and human rights groups have no further information
 on it.
 Specific instances of politically related deaths include a
 carabinero (police officer) killed in Concepcion in March by a
 bomb reportedly placed by the FPMR; also in March two men were
 killed, one by shots fired into a demonstration from a passing
 vehicle and another by military personnel wearing civilian
 clothes; in April a guard at a radio station was shot trying
 to stop an FPMR takeover of the station; two men died in early
 
 
 409
 CHILE
 May when a bomb they were reportedly placing in an electoral
 registration office in San Joaquin exploded prematurely; two
 -people died in mid-June when a bomb they were placing exploded;
 another man was killed by a bomb explosion in early July in
 Osorno; FPMR terr6rists shot an investigations police detective
 in early August; and a prisoner held'on charges of violating
 state security laws died in the Valparaiso prison on August
 15. Investigations are under way to establish'if this death
 was a suicide or a murder. The level of violence increased
 notably in September-when two carabineros were killed by a
 bomb and a terrorist died when a bomb he was reportedly
 placing exploded prematurely. A national prbtest strike on
 October 7resulted in the deaths of three people in Santiago
 by unknown perpetrators.
 Investigations carried out by an ad hoc army prosecutor into
 the 1986 assassination attempt against President Pinochet and
 the August 1986 discovery of large caches of arms produced
 numerous ariests and detentions of individuals reported to be
 members of the FPMR.
 Rightwing terrorist groups such as the Chilean Anti-Communist
 Action (ACHA), the September 11 Command, the National Combat
 Front (FNC), and others continued to operate. Four deaths may
 have'been caused by these groups, but they also were involved
 in kidnapings and numerous threats against persons associated
 with opposition organizations. In the last months of 1987
 these *rganizations became'more aggressive and intensified
 their activities by threatening large groups of people,
 including actors, student leaders, and human rights
 activists. For example, a doctor in Vina del Mar was captured
 and tortured in late November. A vehicle which he identified
 as having followed him shortly before his captuie was revealed
 in court aocuments to belong to the CNI. The carabineros
 publicly stated they will investigate the activities of these
 rightwing organizations. Charges continued to surface that
 members of thb security and military 'forces are involved in
 some of these terrorist organizations.
 b. Disappearance
 Human rights organizations repori that politically motivated
 kidnapings, unauthorized searches, and threats increased from
 668-in 1986 to:792 in 1987. There were 85 individuals kidnaped
 in 1987. Although numerous complaints have been made to the
 courts, there have been no known arrests or prosecutions in
 any of these kidnaping cases.
 Five men disappeared in 1987, all in September. Witnesses saw
 the men being forced into vans by uidentified armed persons
 in two instances. The security forces denied knowledge of
 these incidents, and no one has been arrested. A senior
 government official suggested that the five, all members of
 the Communist Party, had gone underground on orders from the
 party. These were the first confirmed.disappearances since
 the wave of disappearances in the 1970's.
 On September 1, a Chilean army lieutenant colonel was kidnaped
 from his home. The FPMR later claimed responsibility and
 demanded a $50,000 ransom, the release of a number of prisoners
 whom they claimed were detained for political reasons, and the
 publication in the nation's press of an FPMR statement. The
 Government, through the ad hoc military prosecutor, imposed a
 complete press blackout on stories relating to this case.
 After lengthy negotiations with a Catholic priest serving as
 
 
 410
 CHILE
 an intermediary, the FPM4R released the lieutenant colonel
 unharmed in Sao Paulo, Brazil on December 3. Several persons
 have been arrested and charged with the kidnaping.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture remains one of the most serious human rights problems
 in Chile. Efforts by some government officials to stop
 torture included the signing of agreements by the
 Investigations Police, the CNI, and the carabineros with the
 ICRC. The agreements allow the ICRC access to all jails or
 prisons where people are detained for violations of state
 security laws. The agreements also stipulated that the ICRC
 be provided a daily list of detainees, and be allowed to visit
 the detainees after the first 5 days of detention or before
 the detainees are released or brought before the courts. The
 ICRC and the Interior Ministry's Advisory Commission on Human
 Rights are not allowed to visit detainees if the prosecutor in
 the case orders them held for 10-day periods of isolation
 under the antiterrorist law.
 In June a law was enacted that abolished CNI jails. The CNI
 may still make arrests, but it must keep the detainees under
 house arrest or immediately turn them over to the carabineros
 or the Investigations Police. The Ministry of Interior gave
 the Ministry's Advisory Commission on Human Rights the right
 to visit detainees held by the Investigations Police. The
 Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the conventions on torture
 of the U.N. and the OAS in September with reservations that
 have the effect of denying international involvement in
 ensuring compliance. Human rights organizations nevertheless
 welcomed the conventions and urged the Government to ratify
 them promptly. President Pinochet sent a message to the
 legislative Junta on November 13 asking that appropriate
 legislation be adopted to transform the texts of the
 conventions into law. No legislative action was taken by
 year's end.
 Torture continues to occur despite these efforts to stop it.
 The Vicariate reported 102 cases of torture in 1987, as
 compared to 130 cases in 1986, and 81 in 1985. The Vicariate
 has compared the statistics on torture with the number of
 people detained on charges of violating various state security
 laws. In 1987 there were 461 people detained, and 102 of them
 were subjected to torture, or 22.1 percent. In 1986 there
 were 773 people detained, and 130 tortured, or 16.8 percent.
 In 1985 the figures were 549 people detained and 81 tortured,
 or 14.7 percent. CHRC statistics indicate 118 cases of
 torture occurred in 1987, compared to 291 cases in 1986 and
 166 cases in 1985.
 Witnesses report that in June the CNI tortured a young man
 with an electric shock device. In September a man arrested on
 suspicion of involvement in the kidnaping of an army colonel
 was reportedly tortured by the CNI. He is presently in a
 hospital suffering from severe back injuries. Other reports
 also suggest that the CNI has reserved certain areas in
 Investigations Police jails for the detention and questioning
 of people. If so, this would violate the spirit of the
 restrictions placed on the CNI. There were reports of the use
 of sleep deprivation, blindfolding for long periods, and
 psychological torture. In early December, following the
 release of the kidnaped army colonel, a young woman charged
 with involvement in the case was shown on national television
 
 
 411
 CHILE
 after having been held incommunicado since early November.
 She confessed her role as spokesperson for the FPMR, but her
 phyfical'state and mannerisms' in responding to questions
 raised doubts about her treatment during the month-long
 solitary confinement. She publicly claimed to have been
 tortured during that time.
 A judge publicly denounced the repeated failure of CNI
 officials to cooperate with his investigations into 35
 separate torture incidents. The Supreme Court removed a
 number of other torture cases from this judge's jurisdiction
 and transferred them to a military court. The Supreme Court
 ruled that a military court should inVestigate charges of
 torture stemming from arrests mAde in connection with the
 assasbination attempt against the President and the 1986 arms
 discoveries.
 Government officials deny that torture 'is used or authorized,
 and note that members of the security services are investigated
 for possible'involvrment In cases of alleged'mistreatment.
 However, judicial investigations of eorture"are seldom
 concluded due in'large part to the'refus'l of- some state
 security organizations to comply with court orders to'make
 security agents available to the courts for questioning.
 Moreover, in one case, despite-a aOpreme Court order
 confirmhg the 5-year prison sentepce and fine for three
 Investigations Police detectives"'found guilty -in 1986 of the
 tofth'r& death of 'a young tran, the three have not been"
 imprisoned nor paid the fine.
 While there'were occasional reports of brutality by'the
 uniformed policejhuman rights leaders generally agreed that
 carabineros" treatment of demonstrators markedly improved. -A
 study by the Vicariate of Solidarity indicate ethat use of
 unnecessary force did decrease, as demonstrated by the
 following statistics. In 1987, 1,220 persons were arrested in
 demonstrations in Santiago, of whom 113 complained of
 mistreatment, or 9.3 percent of those detained. In 1986 there
 were3,721 people arrested and 396 complaints of mistreatment,
 or 10.6 percent. In 1985 there were 2,674 people arrested
 with 451 complaints, or 16.8 Percent. Army personnel
 abandoned 'the practice, conmmon in 1986, of blackening their
 faces'during sweeps of residential areas and generally played
 a reduced role in these searches. In the October 7 national
 protest strike, which resulted in three deaths, military troops
 exhibited restraint in handling rock-throwing incidents, street
 barricades, and attacks against public transportation. The
 deaths occurred after dark, and involved exchanges of gunfire.
 d. 'Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Vicariate of Solidarity'reported 673 individual arrests and
 2,534 arrests in demonstrations through November 1987, as
 compared to 732 individual and 4,152 collective arrests in
 1986, and 757-individual and 1,690 collective arrests in 1985.
 The CHRC'reports'660 individual arrests and 3,567 collective
 arrests'during the same time frame. Over 90 percent of those
 detained were released without charges, or charged with minor
 violations, and less than 8 percent were arraigned before the
 courts.
 Under Transitory Article 24, the Government may order detention
 for 5-days without affording the detainees the right to
 judicial hearing, or for as many as 20 days in cases where
 terrorist acts are alleged to be involved. In some cases
 
 
 412
 CHILE
 involving the special military prosecutor, the detainees have
 had limited access to lawyers even after the prosecutor
 formally charged them. However, many of those detained during
 investigations into the 1986 presidential assassination
 attempt and-the arms discoveries were held incommunicado for
 40 days or more. Appeals to the courts were ignored by the
 military prosecutor, who maintained that further prolonged
 periods of incommunicado detention were necessary and justified
 by new information. He also ordered that the detainees being
 held in connection with his investigations be dispersed to
 prisons throughout Chile. This was necessary, he stated, to
 keep the prisoners from coordinating their stories. Appeals
 by defense lawyers resulted in the end of the transfers.
 Although all these assassination suspects have been indicted,
 none has been brought to trial, and their cases are still under
 investigation.
 In other cases, once formal charges were issued and cases were
 brought before the court system, the defendants were allowed a
 lawyer of their own choosing. Human rights organizations
 provided free legal assistance. Many of those detained under
 Transitory Article 24 are never charged and are released after
 several days.
 The state security laws are used to detain people for
 prolonged periods of time while their cases are investigated.
 A doctor employed by the Vicariate of Solidarity, Ramiro
 Olivares, was imprisoned in December 1986 on charges of having
 violated the antiterrorist law by failing to report medical
 treatment he provided to a man who was wounded in a terrorist
 incident. Olivares was held for 1 year and released on bail
 in December 1987. Another doctor involved in the same case,
 Juan Macaya, was imprisoned from June 1986 to September 1987,
 when he was released on bail. In many cases, persons who
 cannot be successfully brought to trial are held for months
 without trial and then eventually released and the charges
 dropped.
 Persons once formally charged with or convicted of violations
 of state security laws generally are imprisoned separately
 from common criminals and have rights to visitation and
 communication with their families, friends, legal counsel, and
 representatives of the ICRC. The ICRC has access to most of
 those detained under the state security laws after a 5-day
 incommunicado detention period.
 Credible complaints of mistreatment have been received from
 the prisoners held by the military prosecutor, particularly
 after visits by foreign delegations. There were also reports
 of restrictions on family visitation rights and of harassment
 of visitors. In September the Supreme Court ruled that appeals
 court judges be allowed access to these prisoners to ascertain
 their condition.
 The Government announced in early 1987 that the majority of
 exiles would be permitted to return to Chile during the first
 90 days of the year. By the end of the 90-day period over
 2,700 names had been removed from the list of those whose
 return was prohibited, leaving 764 names still to be
 reviewed. By September the Government said the list had been
 reduced to 435 names, and on December 31 it claimed that 338
 cases remained pending. The Vicariate of Solidarity, however,
 counted 561 exiles still prohibited from returning, including
 a number of Chileans who are unable to return because they
 accepted foreign nationality and are on a. separate prohibited
 
 
 413
 CHILE
 list. A number of well-known political leaders who had been
 living in exile since late 1973 and 1974 were allowed to
 return.
 Several other exiles also returned to Chile without permission
 in 1987. Three of these people were detained and sent into
 internal banishment for 90 days, under the provisions of
 Transitory Article 24 which allows the President to use his
 administrative poWers'to banish people without charges or
 trial.
 One of ihe three, Clodomiro Almeyda, a foreign minister in the
 Allende Government, was imprisoned'following the termination
 of his 90-day banishment." In Nbvember he was sentenced to 541'
 days "in~prison under the antiterrorist law. In December the
 constitutional tribunal found him guilty of another charge,
 violafing Article 8 of the Constitution, which prohibits any
 group or persons from advocating class warfare; Marxism,
 communism, and a'variety of other ideologies. This tribunal
 ordered that'Almeyda lose all political rights and the ability
 to speak in public or publish for 10 yearg.' The decision
 cannot be appealed. Almeyda is also subject to charges that
 he returned illegally to Chile and that he advocates and
 supports violence and terrorism.
 Forced or bompulsory laboi is prohibited in Chile, and there
 have been no complaints 6n this issue since the mid-1970's.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tri'al
 The right t6 a fair public trial remains limited by Transitory
 Article 24. First instance jurisdiction for the prosecution
 of proscribed political activities remains with the regular
 civilian courts, but broad interpretation of state security
 laws has greatly expanded military coilrt jurisdiction. As in
 most civil law systems, trial is not by jury, reliance is on
 the written record rather than oral testimony, and the judge
 directs the investigation, finally deciding innocence .or
 guilt. The investigation phase is considered secret, with
 limited access to evidence or testimony developed by the
 judge. Secrecy makes it extremely difficult to ascertain if
 justice is being done. There is a well-developed, multistage
 appeal process leading ultimately to the'Supreme Court.
 Weapons violations (often the basis of charges against
 terrorists) and charges of slandering the commander-in-chief
 of the army (who is President Pinochet) are tried before a
 military court. Appeals may be made to a military court of
 two civilian judges and three military judges and, in the last
 resort, to the Supreme Court.
 Investigation by the courts of present and past human rights
 violations made little progress during 1987. Human rights
 organizations complained that judges failed to investigate
 vigorously charges'of government abuses of human rights. A
 court of appeals ru'led that the investigation'into the 1976
 disappearance of 10 people should be permanently closed. This
 decision upheld the lower court judge who ruled that the 1978
 amnesty law applied to this case. Human rights lawyers have
 appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. In addition, an
 appeals court refused to appoint a special investigating judge
 to look into the June 15 killing of 12 members of the. FPMR,
 and the Supreme Court in June accepted the request by the
 military tribunal to transfer the investigation of 7 of the 12
 deaths out of the civilian court's jurisdiction.
 
 
 414
 CHILE
 A Supreme Court decision in early 1987 changed the concept
 behind the 1978 amnesty law by ruling that the law should be
 applied before investigations of disappearances are carried
 out, rather than applying the benefit of amnesty after the
 cases have been investigated and the events surrounding the
 disappearances have been clarified.
 The investigation by a military judge into the 1986 burning of
 Rodrigo Rojas and Carmen Gloria Quintana during an
 antigovernment protest received considerable publicity, but
 there were no indications that any determination would be
 forthcoming any time soon. The military prosecutor staged
 reenactments of the crime with the participation of Carmen
 Gloria Quintana who reportedly identified those responsible
 for the burning. Defense lawyers charged that the military
 prosecutor harassed the witness and deliberately treated her
 as the aggressor in the crime rather than as a victim. The
 Supreme Court upheld the military prosecutor's earlier
 decision to reduce the charge against the army officer
 involved in this case to that of a misdemeanor for failing to
 provide adequate medical attention to the victims. The
 officer was promoted to the rank of captain, while his
 commanding officer was retired for allegedly failing to advise
 his superiors of the incident.
 Reports continue concerning the failure of security forces to
 cooperate with judges investigating human rights violations.
 In some instances higher courts have affirmed these charges.
 For example, in January an appeals court found that CNI
 officials had failed to comply with court orders to give
 prisoners medical examinations. The court subsequently
 ordered the CNI to obey future court orders. The Supreme
 Court also ordered the CNI to comply with lower court
 decisions. The Supreme Court is also investigating the
 unusual appearance on national television of a young woman
 detainee who was filmed by the CNI while being held in
 incommunicado status. According to Bar Association leaders,
 this violated the defendant's rights as well as the secrecy of
 the summary portion of the investigation into the army
 colonel's kidnaping.
 In late November, the legislative Junta approved a law which
 permits military unit commanders to refuse to comply with
 court orders seeking information on the activities of military
 units which may be involved in actions that infringe on human
 rights. Under this law military commanders may classify
 information relating to military patrols, involving the
 members of these patrols, as vital to national security.
 While the investigating courts may appeal to the Supreme
 Court, the information may still be denied to them. In the
 event that the information is provided to the court, a proviso
 may be attached that it may not be made public, which would
 deny to human rights lawyers information that may be vital to
 their investigations. For example, had the law been in effect
 in 1986, the military could have denied to the courts any
 information on the military patrol which was involved in the
 burning to death of Rodrigo Rojas.
 The Social Aid Foundation of the Christian Churches (FASIC)
 reported that 452 people were in prison at year's end facing
 610 judicial proceedings related to state security laws. This
 included 392 men and 60 women. Fifty of these people have
 been in prison since before 1983, but the majority (280) were
 detained in 1986 and 1987. Of the 610 judicial proceedings,
 477 are before military courts. Another 32 individuals were
 
 
 415
 CHILE
 released on bail during 1987, while 4 others escaped. One
 prisoner died either as .a.result of a suicide or murder
 related to the escape of the four mentioned above. Another
 four were released a~ter completing their prison terms. Of
 the 452, 104 have been convicted and are serving .their
 sentences, while 348 remain in detention with their cases
 still under investigation.
 International attention focused during the year on 15 prisoners
 who face possible death sentences because of charges of
 involvement in assassinations of senior military officers,
 bank robberies, and killings-of carabineros. Defense lawyers
 charged that all were tortured, and their confessions obtained
 under physical and psychological duress. Judicial
 ihvettigations of,,charges of torture are seldom concluded due
 in large part to-the refusal of some state securit'..
 organizations to comply with court orders to make security
 agents available to the courts for questioning. Human rights
 organizations have assisted 66 prisoners, including those
 facing a possible death sentence, to obtain visas to other
 countries. This was done in the belief that possession of
 such visas might either allow these prisoners to seek
 remission of their prison terms for exile or protect them from
 the.-eath sentence. While the Government permitted many
 Chileans serving prison sentences related to politically
 motivated acts to seek. exile in the mid-1970's, this practice
 has been severely restricted in recent years. One reason
 given has.been.that some of those who sought exile later
 returned to Chile illegally and became involved in terrorist
 activities.
 The military court of appeals in November rejfected the death
 sentence sought by the lower military court against three
 defendants in a 1983 assassination case. The refusal by one
 of the five judges on this appeal court to accept the death
 sentence automatically reduced the sentences to lengthy prison
 terms. The Government, however, is seeking to have this
 judge's decision challenged in the Supreme Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Searches of the home and interception of private communications-
 are permitted by the Constitution, provided search warrants
 are.issued by either a civilian or military court for specific
 locations. The 1984 antiterrorist law provides for
 surveillance of those promoting political views contrary to
 the Constitution or suspected of terrorist crimes, and for
 interception, opening, or recording of private communications
 and documents in these cases. The requirement of obtaining
 proper court documents for searches and surveillance, however,
 was not always complied with during the year. A significant
 number of searches were carried out by security forces or by
 armed groups who failed or refused to show identification, or
 without the necessary court orders. Most searches were
 conducted in'the early hours of the morning, often with force
 and violence.
 Searches of entire neighborhoods were infrequent during the
 first 6 months of the year, but they increased beginning in
 July. Carabineros and Investigations Police searched homes,
 church offices and buildings, trade union headquarters, and
 other selected locations. The detention of all men in the
 neighborhood was far less common than in previous years.
 Human rights organizations filed complaints that those
 
 
 416
 CHILE
 conducting the searches destroyed personal property and
 damaged houses. A Ministry of Defense spokesman stated that
 the searches were conducted to find arms, and that church
 properties were often used as hiding places for terrorist
 weapons. The Archbishop of Santiago rejected this statement
 and called on the authorities to stop such searches.
 Following the September kidnaping of an army lieutenant colonel
 by the FPMR, security services increased the number of
 neighborhood searches in their efforts to locate the victim.
 The sweeps were concentrated on !specific houses and were less
 violent than in 1986. These searches also covered
 neighborhoods not normally subjected to these actions,
 including several affluent areas.
 There were complaints during the year that houses and offices
 were searched'by security forces without display of the
 required warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for the freedom of speech and press.
 However, since 1973 the Government has exercised considerable
 control over the media through a variety of means ranging from
 violence and threats, legal actions, confiscations and
 closures, to economic pressures and the exercise of influence
 in personnel decisions. The Government formally and informally
 advises the press, radio, and television of norms for covering
 domestic developments, frequently making editorial and other
 suggestions and requests. In addition, the media practice
 varying degrees of self-censorship.
 Since the enactment'in March of a law establishing a legal
 basis for political parties, coverage of statements and
 activities of the political opposition by the daily press has
 increased. The launching of the daily La Epoca in March and
 the change of the weekly Fortin Mapocho to daily status gave
 the opposition its first two daily newspapers. In addition,
 several low-circulation opposition magazines exist. However,
 Government legal and other actions designed to restrict and
 intimidate the press have continued.
 The Government itself directly operates the country's largest
 television network. The other television stations are closely
 monitored, and program planning is strongly influenced by
 self-censorship. Until recently, opposition political
 spokesmen were not permitted to appear on television news (as
 they are on radio and in the press), and there were no
 political panels or discussions on television which included
 opposition leaders. The opposition was given very limited
 access to the three university channels in December 1987 and
 January 1988.
 Based on a March 1987 ruling by the National Television
 -Council, political parties in formation can purchase
 advertising time on television. Such advertisements must be
 restricted to calling for party membership registration and to
 explaining party views. Once a political party is legally
 recognized, its access to television ceases until no more than
 60 days and perhaps as little as 30 days before a vote is to
 be held, depending on the language of a draft bill now under
 consideration. Political party spokesman state that the high
 
 
 417
 CHILE
 cost of television advertising ($2,000 for 30 seconds on
 nationwide networks) has place television advertising campaigns
 outside their reach.
 Opposition'magazines and radio stations, while often outspoken
 in their coverage and commentaries, face the threat of
 harassment, legal 'nd otherwise.- On June 28, Juan Pablo
 Cardenas* Director of the weekly magazine Analisis, was
 sentenced-by the Supreme Court to 541 days of nightly
 imprisonment. Charges had been brought against Cardenas in
 mid-1986 'for offenses against the President of the Republic"
 contained in several editorials published in the magazine.
 Increasihg use ig being made of the system of military justice.
 to bring charges relating to libel of the Commanding General
 of the Army"(President Pinochet), as in the case'of the arrest
 of the editor and vice editor of the magaz'ine APSI in
 September2- New newspapers and magazines are not allowed to
 commence publishing or to change their frequency of publication
 without government approval.
 On 06tober 20, the Government established penalties for
 violations of Article Eight of the 1980 Constitution. Article
 Eighe prohibits- "all acts by persons or groups propagating
 doctrines-undermining the family, espousing violence or a
 conceptiod of the society, the state, or legal order of
 totalitarian character or contrary to the institutional order
 of the republic...'."  It 'also7prohibits advocating or
 defendiig  such doctrines. Activities'in violation of the
 Art'ile include media coverage, commebtary., or publicity.
 Pena Ities' include fines and the loss of the right to vote, to
 pr6sent 'iE ws i'h the media, or to work in journalism,
 education, or government. Fines and sanctions, such as
 temporary suspension of publication, may be applied to the
 media involved.
 Prior'to-the passage of this enabling law, the Interior
 Ministry brought charges against the directors of La Epoca,
 Atalisis, and APSI for publishing a paid advertisement' by the
 outlaw ed Coinunist Party. In addition'to the threat of
 closure, editions found offensive have been confiscated.
 Se'eral' M ajor media enterprises are seriously in debt to
 goverimgnt .financial institutions, a situation which provides
 the GoVerniment with further influence over news and editorial
 content. Individual journalists may be subjected to penalties
 for reporting on or quoting statements found objectionable.
 On September 23, the Interior Ministry brought charges against
 Analisis'repofter Monica Gonzalez for "offenses against the
 President of'the Republic" contained in an interview with
 Christian Democrat politician Andres Zaldivar. Zaldiar
 stated'publicly that he was accurately'quoted by the ' I
 jouratifist ind took full responsibility for his words as
 published. However, the reporter remains charged and was
 jailed on Oct6ber 9. She was freed on bail on October 26.

 'The leftist movdment MAPU (Movimiento de Accion Popular) was
 charged with the attack.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government reduced restrictions on peaceful demonstrations
 and association during 1987 with the passage of the
 legislation regulating the legalization of political parties.
 This was followed in April with a revised regulation by the
 military commander of the Santiago region which permitted the
 holding of meetings in public and private locations. While
 still requiring official permission to hold rallies, and
 conferring on the military commander the right to designate
 the location, the new rules are easier to comply with than
 previous ones. Political parties in the process of seeking
 legal status under the political parties law and those which
 had not yet begun that effort held well-publicized gatherings
 in public theaters and other locations. The Government
 generally did not interfere with meetings of labor unions and
 professional associations. The National Workers Command (CNT),
 for example, was allowed to hold outdoor rallies in November
 and December.
 Those who organize or call for unauthorized demonstrations or
 protests are subject to arrest and prosecution. The CNT
 leaders involved in calling a general strike on October 7 were
 charged with several violations of the state security law.
 Three CNT leaders were jailed in late October and denied bail
 until mid-November when they were released. People charged
 with such violations are usually released on bail after a
 period of detention, but they are restricted from traveling
 abroad. The courts may permit such travel and have done so on
 a number of occasions, but the inconsistency with which this
 permission is given makes foreign travel by many political and
 trade union leaders uncertain and difficult.
 A major open-air opposition rally, the first in 2 years, was
 held in November without incident. Efforts by opposition
 groups to solicit membership signatures, distribute information
 on voter registration, and seek support for free elections have
 been frequently broken up by security forces. The inability to
 carry out these types of activities is seen as intimidation and
 harassment.
 Legally recognized unions do not need permission to hold union
 meetings or conferences. Unions may face legal difficulties,
 however, in electing leaders. For example, in September the
 Government declared void the election of a union leader in a
 confederation of peasant unions. This individual is under
 indictment for his participation in the National Civic Assembly
 protests in 1986. Under the labor laws, unions cannot elect
 an officer who is under indictment. In November, however, the
 Ministry of Labor reversed its earlier decision, for
 unexplained reasons, and allowed this leader to assume his
 union position. Professional associations, which are regulated
 by a different law, face a similar problem, but the Government
 has not yet applied this restriction to those groups.
 The political parties law also discriminates against trade
 union and professional association leaders because it
 establishes that officers in trade unions and professional
 associations may not be members of a political party. The
 Constitutional Tribunal rejected legal challenges to this
 aspect of the political parties law. Union leaders continue
 to be active in the political parties that have not achieved
 legal status. Since these parties are not legal entities,
 membership by union leaders is not prohibited.
 
 
 419
 CHILE
 In 1987 the Government codified-12 laws covering various
 aspects of labor, such as trade union organizations,
 colleqptiye.bArgaining, and maritime-workers. The new code
 clarifjies.zthe unionization of workers in firms employing
 between 25 and 50 workers which should ease union organizing.
 The code still places severe restrictions on collective
 bargaining, the right to strike, and the development of
 national union confederations. Collective bargaining is
 strictly, regulated,. and the entire collective bargaining  -
 procedure-can be nullified if one -egally constituted deadline
 is missed by eithert the union or management;. Further, any
 decision by a union-to delay the bargaining process in
 anticipation <f a more propitious future bargaining atmosphere
 automatically extends the current contract for a minimum
 2-yeat. PerA,*!0-                  -,
 Strikes are-prohibited in designatedstrategic enterprises,
 primarily public utilities, the largest government copper
 mine, and the petroleum industry. In 1987 the Government
 increased the number of state enterprises designated strategic
 from 23 to.25, which is still a'significant reduction from the
 1985 figue.of 48-.-,-
 Labor unions maintain relations with international labor
 bodies,-,im thei. fields. ,-The Government selects Chilean worker
 delecate.s.participating in.the conference of the International
 Labor xgjnization ILO)., These delegates have had their
 credentiAls challenged in the past. .,In 1987,' as in 1986, the
 Governmentrsought, to avoid this challenge by seeking to,
 consultw..th representative trade unions in Chile, but-this
 procedure was itself challenged as restrictive in nature.
 Leaders of internationally recognized Chilean labor bodies-at
 the national level were not consulted in their capacity as
 leadera.-of,these bodies, but in their -role as union officials
 of smallertrade union entities. Complaints were:filed in the
 ILO against-the Government concerning-violations-of freedom of
 association, of employment, and ofexpressionj includin� the
 prohibition,of union officials from-participating in political
 parties.
 On January 2, 1987, President Reagan announced that the U.S.
 Government would continue for.up to 1 year its review of
 whether-Chile was taking- steps. to.afford its workers
 internaiionally recognized worker rights in accordance with
 the eligibility requirements of.the U.S. Generalized System of
 Preferences (GSP) program. As a result of the ongoing review,
 on December-24 Chile was formally suspended from the list of
 countries eligible-to participate-in the GSP program.
 Trade union leaders and members who participate in illegal
 strikg-actions, no matter what the-motive, are generally
 dismissed by their employers with the support of the
 government. They are then subjected to blacklisting and are
 not able to obtain employment in other industries. For
 example, hundreds of copper miners fired in 1983 for
 particip~ting in a brief protest against the Government were
 forced to emigrate to other countries when they found it -
 impossible to obtain employment in Chile. 'Trade union leader
 Rodolfo Seguel, who left Chile for Australia in 1987, was but
 one example of this blacklisting tactic.
 Organized labor continued to press for a full investigation of
 the 1982 murder of labor leader Tucapel Jimqnez. Efforts to
 have the Government appoint another judge to investigate this
 murder were not successful; and the case remains officially
 
 
 420
 CHILE
 closed. While the Government dropped indictments against a
 political leader and a trade union officer for having
 slandered the Government in this case, interest remains high
 within trade union and opposition circles that this case not
 be shelved.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for absolute freedom of religion.
 Although Chile is predominantly Roman Catholic, there are no
 restrictions on religious practices and no official
 discrimination against any religious group. A number of
 Protestant denominations and other groups are active and
 report full freedom and tolerance, as does the Jewish
 community, although the latter is concerned about occasional
 manifestations of anti-Semitism. Religious belief and
 adherence appear to have no effect on acceptability for
 government positions in Chile.
 The Mormon church continued to be a target of leftwing
 terrorist groups, but with fewer bombings than in 1986. The
 Catholic Church suffered further attacks against property and
 officials.
 The offices of the bishops of Valdivia, Osorno, and Linares
 were broken into at various times during the year by unknown
 persons who searched the files. In some instances items of
 value were stolen, but church officials do not believe robbery
 was the motive. Massive searches during the latter half of
 the year in poor neighborhoods often included churches and
 church buildings. In some instances, searches were conducted
 without displaying search warrants.
 The Catholic Church continues to take the lead in defending
 human rights. It supplies legal counsel to those accused of
 politically related crimes and to victims of human rights
 abuses. Its Vicariate of Solidarity monitors the human rights
 situation throughout Chile, issues factual monthly reports on
 human rights violations, and protects and defends significant
 numbers of people.
 Relations between the Catholic Church and the Government
 remained tense because of government investigations of the
 Vicariate of Solidarity and of statements made by the Council
 of Catholic Bishops calling for modifications to the 1980
 Constitution, greater respect for civil liberties, and fair
 conditions for electoral competition. These relations were
 typified by the Ministry of Interior's year-end statement in
 which he charged that internal divisions and political
 extremism within the Catholic Church were one of three
 obstacles to social order and national development. The other
 two he gave as terrorism and foreign intervention.
 The Vicariate remains a target of investigation by the
 military prosecutor who is looking into several terrorist-
 related incidents. Several lawyers for the Vicariate were
 subjected to court summonses, generally from military courts,
 on a variety of charges related to their legal work. The
 prosecutor, so far unsuccessfully, has sought access to the
 Vicariate's case files and bank records. Threats against
 Vicariate officials and lawyers were reported, and the
 executive secretary of the Vicariate was forced to seek police
 protection following an attempted forced entry into his
 house. The Interior Minister also singled out the Vicariate
 for criticism in his end-of-year speech to the Junta as an
 
 
 421
 CHILE
 organization directed to bring down the Government and provide
 moral.cover and 'logistical support to terrorism.
 d;    reedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Chileans are supposed to enjoy full constitutional freedom to
 move within and to enter and leave their country, but exi'le
 and inteinal bahishment are still practiced. International
 organiza-ions dealing with migrants believe thd volume of
 skill7aand-unskilled workers returning to Chile now roughly
 equals the nuniber leaving. The UNHRC or International
 Committee-for Migration (ICM) and other organizations assisted
 80 personmto return to Chile fiom abroad during the year.
 According t6 Chilean'government figures, of the 9,233 names
 removed.from the" exile list between 1982 and early 1987, only
 1,746 reportedly elected to return-permanently to Chile.
 According to organizations such as FASIC which assist in the
 resettlement of these people, many choose to remain in their
 adopted countries for economic and family reasons. A number
 of wel1-known political leaders whose names were removed from
 the prohibited list during the year returned to Child and
 resumed their political activities without facing harassient.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The 'Right of Citizens
 to-.Change Their Government
 This right remains severely restricted. Under the Constitution
 a plebiscite-must be held no later'than February 1989 on a-
 presfdential candidate to be selected unanimously by the four
 commanders-in-chief of" the armed forces and national polide.
 The plebiscite must be held within 30 to 60 days after the
 commanders meet for this purpose. If the four commanders (who
 include President Pinochet)" do not achieve unanimity, the
 candidate must be chosen by jive of the eight-member National
 Security COuncil composed of the President, members of the
 junta, the president of the Supreme Court, the president of
 the Council of State; and the 'Comptroller General. In the
 event that the candidate selected by either procedure is
 rejected bythe citizenry, President Pinochet will continue in
 office'until March 11, 1990 but must'before that date hold
 competitive elections for the President'and the Congress.
 The Constitution'provides that 9 of the 36 members of the
 future Senate be appointed by the executive branch or the
 Supreme Court. Acting through the National Security Council,
 the armed forces chiefs may disapprove any law which
 compromises national security or "gravely threatens the
 foundations of the institutional order." A constitutional
 court can expel any legislator for drafting or supporting a
 resolution or bill it deems unconstitutional. Once the period
 of transitio'ends in 1989', the Constitution will be, for all
 practical purposes, impossible to amend for another 8 years
 without the consent of the President.
 The Catholic Church and the moderate opposition political
 parties have aTgued for a return to full democracy, not the
 "protected democracy" envisioned by the Constitution. So far,
 their efforts to seek a negotiated agreement with the military
 to reform the Constitution to allow for competitive elections
 for president and a fully elected and empowered congress have
 been consistently rebuffed by the bovernment. President
 Pinochet has ruled out modifications to the Constitution and
 insists On the plebiscite mechanism for presidential
 succession. Democratic opposition groups are nonetheless
 
 
 422
 CHILE
 engaged in a national campaign in support of free and fair
 elections and a rejection of the candidate nominated for.the
 plebiscite, who could be Pinochet himself. The Communist
 Party and its allies in other radical left groups continue to
 seek the overthrow of the regime through armed struggle and
 political violence.
 Shortly after coming to power in 1973, the military government
 had all electoral records burned. In February 1987 voting
 registers were reopened, requiring as a prerequisite a new
 national identity card. The enrollment process has proved to
 be slow and cumbersome. Citizens must often travel long
 distances to enroll. Those who work Monday through Saturday
 have difficulty getting access to the registration process,
 and no mobile units have been permitted. An estimated
 one-third of the electorate must still purchase their new
 identity card at a cost of about $1.50, which opposition
 leaders have said amounts to a poll tax for low-income
 Chileans.
 In August the Government announced a slight increase in the
 hours and sites of registration. Civic groups have lobbied to
 make registration obligatory, to have the Government publicize
 it more effectively, and to strengthen the legal provisions
 which require employers to grant workers time off to register.
 Their biggest obstacle is voter apathy, which is compounded by
 the fact that 45 percent of the potential electorate has never
 participated in national elections and that many citizens
 cannot understand why they should prepare for a plebiscite
 whose goals and timing are still unclear. At the end of 1987,
 3,744,000 persons had been registered out of an estimated
 8,200,000 eligible voters.
 The political parties law passed in March 1987 grants parties
 the right to function as legally recognized bodies provided
 they fulfill a number of highly stringent specifications.
 These include a requirement that parties in formation who
 desire to operate in all regions of Chile amass 35,000
 notarized signatures of members, who in turn must be
 registered voters. Because party lists are public property,.
 many prospective members purportedly are reluctant to enroll
 for fear of job discrimination or possible retaliation. A
 prohibition against leaders of unions, and student and
 professional organizations being party members has likewise
 hindered the collection of signatures. The legislation
 provides for strict government supervision of parties'
 internal elections, structures, and financial procedures.
 So far 12 parties have begun the process of registering. Four
 of them are identified as sympathizers or supporters of the
 Government. Chile's most important political organization,
 the Christian Democratic Party, filed for legal status in
 September.
 Although to date political parties have been allowed to
 function as before, their future conduct under the political
 parties law would be subject to much stricter government
 control. Due to the extension of the states of emergency and
 danger, the right of assembly is still seriously limited.
 Because television coverage of political debate had not been
 allowed until recently, and television advertising, though
 permitted, is so expensive as to be out of reach of opposition
 parties and leaders, their access to a broad public audience
 is restricted, while the Government and progovernment media
 enjoy a near monopoly in reaching mass audiences.
 
 
 423
 CHILE
 A law-regulating the electoral process was passed on January
 14, 1988 by the-legislative junta and is awaiting approval by
 the constitutional tribunal. The law contains many
 restrictions on political advertising. Apart from the period
 of formation of,parties, and the month or two prior to the
 plebisqite,.prties.will have no access to television for
 either paid or free-advjertising. A party must have completed
 the 7-month registration process 4 months before the plebiscite
 to qualify to name observers for local vote-counting purposes.
 On Decemir l7, the United-States issued a statement in
 support of dqrpcracy in Chile. The United States called for -
 the development in Chile, well before any scheduled balloting,
 of a climate offreedom and fair competition marked by
 equitable access to the mass media, unrestricted ,discussion of
 political issues, broad freedom of assembly, early announcement
 of the rules of the electoral proceeding, facilitization of
 registration by prospective'voters, and-freedom for citizens
 and political groups to campaign peacefully in favor of their
 ideas.                .   .
 Section 4 Gov.ernmental Attitude Regarding International and
  ..Nongover3mental Investigation of Alleged Violations,.
 ' ~" ~, of  HumanRights  .....
 The Governmer  tmaintained its cooperation with the UNHRC -
 Special Rapporteur and provided another detailed reply to the
 Spec l-Rapporteuro* report on the human rights situation in
 Chile- ?The SpecailRapporteur visited Chile inMarch and "-
 December.
 The Government refused to cooperate with-the Inter-American
 Human kight-s Commission and denied it permission to enter .
 Chile... ; ,
 The Government continued to  cooperate with the ICRC, which
 proyides confidential reportsto-key government-miniAtries on
 the results ofits-visits to prisons, as provided for-in the.
 agreements signed in late 1986 and early 1987 with the CNI,
 the Investigations Rolice, and the carabineros.
 The'Government permits visits and investigations by private
 international human rights.groups. A number of international
 visitors as well as diplomatic personnel assigned to Chile
 were, however, denied entry to prisons even after seeking
 permission, in writing. The inability to carry out visits to
 those-detained for violations of,state security laws prevented
 thorough investigations into the treatment of these detainees
 and of prison-conditions.
 The Ministfyi.of Interior's AdvisQryCommission on Human Rights,
 which was established in-.June 1986, was assigned the task of
 reviewing the list of those'prohibited from returning to Chile
 and.-making a series of recommendations to the Ministry on
 allowing these people to return. It appears that the
 Commissibn recommended favorably in almost all cases it
 reviewed. The Commission was also instrumental in persuading
 the Government to reduce the number of mass neighborhood
 sweeps by the army. It also heard-complaints from-the
 families of victims of human rights violations. For example,
 in September the president of the Commission met with the
 families of the five young men who disappeared that month.
 After hearing their versions-of the disappearances, he
 requested that an appeals court appoint a judge to investigate
 
 
 424
 CHILE
 them and promised to review the matter with the Vice Minister
 of Interior. To date, however, no action has been taken.
 The Chilean Commission for Human Rights (CHRC), a private
 organization directed by opposition political figures,
 continued to publicize abuses. The central offices of the
 CHRC were searched in September during one of the many
 military searches of various neighborhoods for a kidnaped army
 officer. Statistics provided by the CHRC cover violations
 brought to their attention from throughout the country, as
 compared to Vicariate figures which generally cover cases
 actually handled by the Vicariate. Since some persons
 involved in human rights violations may not go to the
 Vicariate for assistance, the CHRC statistics provide a wider
 picture of human rights violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Minority groups do not suffer from any specific legal
 discrimination. The only significant racial minority, the
 Mapuche Indians in southern Chile, remain separated from the
 rest of society due to historical, cultural, educational, and
 geographical factors rather than official policy. They charge
 that government policies throughout the years have failed to
 take into account the different cultural values of the
 Mapuche, particularly in the areas of-land ownership and
 education. They have in many instances refused to participate
 in government attempts to assign land to individual families,
 preferring to retain the land as tribal property.
 Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist. The legal
 retirement age for women is 5 years lower than that for men.
 Married women may not conduct major commercial transactions
 unless a separation of goods contract is established at the
 time of marriage, or through a subsequent special one-time
 authorization. Inheritance laws provide strong protection for
 wives and favor female over male heirs. Legislation is
 presently under consideration by the junta to modify portions
 of the laws relating to women. The changes would include such
 matters as allowing women to take children out of the country
 without the fathers' permission, and relaxing restrictions on
 women engaging in business transactions. No action was taken
 by the junta on these changes by year's end.
 Women enjoy access to education and employment, although their
 average salaries for similar work are lower than those paid to
 men. In 1983 women made up 48.8 percent of the primary school
 enrollment, 50.5 percent of secondary school pupils, and 40
 percent of university students. Women have served in such
 important government positions as mayors, agency heads, and
 ministers, although none is currently in the Cabinet. Women
 enjoy good access to low-level and mid-level professional jobs
 but do not hold a proportional number of high-level positions.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Child labor is regulated by law. Young people between the
 ages of 14 and 15 may be employed only with the permission of
 their parents or guardians and if they have completed their
 schooling, and then only in restricted types of labor. Those
 between the ages of 15 and 18 can be employed in a larger
 variety of labor and at expanded hours, but only with their
 parents' or guardians' permission.- Economic factors have
 forced many children to seek part-time and full-time
 
 
 425
 CHILE
 employment in areas of the economy which are generally
 diffic . to regulate. Unemployment -levels for younger
 workers betwpen the ages-of 18 and 24 are considerably higher
 than thepational averag.i,, and most seriously affect youth in
 the ;popr neighborhoods of large. urban areas.
 Minimum wages, hours- of ,work,, and :occupational safety and
 health are regulated by 'law. : The.law permits the hiring of
 apprenticeso, but less, than minimum wages may not .be paid.
 Laws cove.ing child labor, wages, and hours of work are
 difficult to enfopce. There are complaints that occupational
 health and..pa3fety laws are not a dequatelyr enforced, with the
 copper industry- often singled ou t as one of the main culprits.
