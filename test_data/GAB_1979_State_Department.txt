 GABON
 Gabon is a one-party state in which political power is
 effectively concentrated in the Presidency. Given the
 country's prosperity, small population and lack of ethnic
 tensions, there is little opposition to the present lead-
 ership, which has been in office since 1967. While poli-
 tical activities are circumscribed by the existence of
 a single party system, civil and individual rights are
 generally respected.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law in Gabon, and this prohibi-
 tion appears to be followed in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no reports of such treatment or punishment.
 There are no summary executions. Capital punishmeft is
 permitted by law but is rarely imposed and, in the three
 known cases this decade, only after public trial and con-
 viction for murder. Prison conditions are austere, with
 rudimentary and frequently crowded facilities. Visits by
 family members, however, are permitted and in cases where
 medical attention is required, the prisoner seems able to
 obtain it. Arrested persons may engage attorneys of their
 choice if they can hire them; otherwise they are provided
 court-appointed counsel.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Political detention of Gabonese citizens rarely occurs.
 Arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is prohibited by the
 Gabonese Constitution. That prohibition appears to be
 generally respected, and there have been no reports of
 such cases during the past year. Moreover, following the
 recent coup in Equatorial Guinea, and the resulting im-
 provement in conditions in that country, many of the ten-
 sions created by the large numbers of Equatorial Guinean
 refugees in Gabon which occasionally resulted in arbitrary
 actions have been ameliorated. There were no reported
 instances of harassment of those Beninese who remained in
 Gabon or of Beninese who returned to Gabon since Gabon
 ordered the expulsion of most of the Beninese community in
 July 1978 because of a political dispute between the two
 countries.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair, public trial is guaranteed by the
 Gabonese Constitution which prohibits arbitrary detention.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home is not officially sanctioned. There
 were cases in previous years when non-Gabonese, particular-
 ly Beninese and Equatorial Guineans, suffered invasion of
 
 
 the home by non-official Gabonese in the wake of political
 differences between Gabon on one hand and Benin and
 Equatorial Guinea on the other. Gabonese officials pro-
 vided protection to those affected.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Gabon's large mineral and timber resources and its small
 population (600,000) have resulted in relatively high per
 capita income, but the distribution of income has been un-
 equal, a problem which the Government has begun to address.
 The economy is organized around extractive industries which
 are exploited primarily by privately owned companies with
 substantial state participation. Outside these relatively
 few pockets of economic activity and wealth, most of the
 country lives by fairly basic subsistence agriculture with
 a modicum of cash crop activity supplemented by a substan-
 tial governmental sector. The right to hold privately
 owned property is respected. Given its substantial foreign
 exchange earnings, Gabon has tended to import virtually
 everything it needs, and relatively high salaries have
 oeen accompanied by high prices. Tnere is little unem-
 ployment among Gabonese wishing to work. While instances
 of corruption are not uncommon, the problem is not a major
 one for Gabonese society.
 Although Gabonese investment programs have given priority
 to minerals and infrastructure projects, a substantial por-
 tion of the Gabonese budget is devoted to providing shel-
 ter, health care and education. In the past two years,
 the Government has begun to improve agricultural produc-
 tivity and the condition of the rural population. In
 spite of an austerity program which has forced curtailment
 of many development projects, those dealing with agricul-
 ture are being implemented. Free public education is
 available to all Gabonese, including full scholarships on
 the university level for all qualified applicants.
 Gabonese data indicate that virtually 100 percent of those
 eligible to attend primary school and 80 percent eligible
 to attend secondary school do so. Educational facilities
 and quality of instruction in urban areas are significant-
 ly superior to those in rural areas. Free health benefits
 are theoretically available to all employed Gabonese and
 their families, although the system is hampered by short-
 ages of doctors and medicines in both urban and rural
 areas.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 There are no restrictions on religious worship or mis-
 sionary activities in Gabon, nor are there legal restric-
 tions on speech, press or right of assembly. However,
 since virtually all important organizations -- labor
 unions, women and youth -- are affiliated with the sole
 political party, all assemblies for political purposes re-
 quire de facto Government approval. All media are also
 
 
 Government controlled. Nonetheless, television regularly
 carries live news from abroad, and occasional items criti-
 cal of prevailing conditions appear locally as well as in
 journals published abroad which circulate freely within
 Gabon.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no significant restrictions on emigration or on
 freedom of movement within or travel outside the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation is restricted to the single au-
 thorized party, the Democratic Party of Gabon (PDG), and
 its affiliate organizations. Apparently no citizen who
 wishes to take part within this framework is prohibited
 from doing so. There was active politicking in prepara-
 tion for the December 30, 1979 Presidential election.
 National assembly elections are scheduled for February 10,
 1980. This has involved considerable competition without
 discernible governmental restriction. After an extraordi-
 nary congress of the PDG in early 1979, and in accordance
 with constitutional provisions, electoral procedures for
 the presidency and the National Assembly have been revised
 for the 1980 election. The revisions will apparently pro-
 vide for increased opportunity on the local level for
 choosing candidates to the National Assembly.
 Participation in the political process is open to women,
 who have legal equality with men. Women are found in
 high political positions but not in proportion to their
 numbers in the country as a whole. For the most part,
 women's role in Gabonese society, though growing, has been
 confined to traditional roles outside of the most modern-
 ized sectors of society.
 Trade unionism operates within government and party param-
 eters. There have recently been signs that leaders of the
 one authorized organization are being permitted more au-
 tonomy, including greater contact with sister organiza-
 tions outside of Gabon. There is no interdiction of the
 right to strike, but strikes are rare and wildcat strikes
 are discouraged. Government employees are not normally
 unionized. Union officials often seek Government appro-
 bation and support prior to engaging employers on signi-
 ficant trade union concerns.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 During the past year there are no known cases of non-
 governmental human rights groups seeking to conduct in-
 vestigations of alleged violations within Gabon. The
 United Nations High Commission for Refugees continued to
 operate with the cooperation of the Gabonese Government
 in providing services to the estimated 60,000 Equatorial
 Guinean refugees living in Gabon. Although cooperation
 was on the whole good, there were two cases when refugees
 were returned to Equatorial Guinea by GOG authorities de-
 spite the recommendation of the UNHCR.
