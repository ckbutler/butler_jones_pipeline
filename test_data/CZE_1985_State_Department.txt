 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is a centralized Communist
 state in which the Communist Party leadership decides all
 important political, economic, and social questions and limits
 the scope of individual human rights. There has been
 virtually no change in the state and party leadership during
 the last 15 years.
 Czechoslovakia has a large, well-funded security apparatus,
 directed by the Ministry of the Interior and the Communist
 Party hierarchy. It includes the uniformed police force
 (public security) which is similar to a Western police force,
 and the secret police (state security), which deals with
 people it judges to be past, present, or future opponents of
 the regime. This powerful internal security force--backed by
 the Czechoslovak Army and the 80,000 Soviet troops stationed
 in Czechoslovakia since 1968--is the main pillar of the
 Government's control.
 The Czechoslovak centrally planned economy allows little or no
 private enterprise or ownership in manufacturing, retail
 operations, agriculture, or services. In the 17 years since
 the suppression of the Prague Spring, the words "economic
 reform" have been banished from the official lexicon. When
 the Communists took power in 1948, Czechoslovakia had one of
 the most advanced economies in Europe, one that had escaped
 much of the destruction of World War II. In recent years,
 however, the economy has stagnated, burdened by excessive
 central planning, obsolete equipment, and infrastructure, and
 by a lack of incentives for innovation and initiative.
 The human rights situation in Czechoslovakia changed little in
 1985. There have been no major trials of well-known figures
 which would attract unfavorable publicity in the West. The
 authorities have, however, made free use of more subtle forms
 of repression, including: frequent house searches,
 detentions,-and interrogations; suspended prison sentences and
 ".protective supervision;" intrusive surveillance and other
 forms of psychological pressure; discrimination in employment;
 and denial of education opportunities to the children of
 "dissidents." As in previous years, the harshest repression
 has been directed at religious activists and at those
 individuals and groups who. monitor human rights abuses in
 Czechoslovakia.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Every year a number of Czechoslovak citizens are shot by
 Czechoslovak border guards while trying to cross the border
 without official permission. These incidents rarely come to
 public attention unless the victims reach the West, so it is
 impossible to estimate the number of fatalities that result.
 There have been no reports-of political killings by the police
 in 1985. However, one political activist has reported a
 "warning" by the police that he was likely to "suffer a car
 accident" or "fall off a bridge" if he persisted in his
 activities.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of disappearances in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of systematic torture in
 Czechoslovak prisons since the early 1960's. Many former
 prisoners credit this to the influence of President Husak, who
 himself suffered long years of imprisonment and mistreatment
 in the 1950's. However, there have been reports of beatings,
 threats, and Intimidation during interrogation. Reports of
 mistreatment have been most frequent in political cases.
 Prison conditions are poor and sometimes approach a level of
 cruel and inhuman treatment, especially under the "third
 category" of imprisonment (harshest regime), which is often
 applied to political prisoners. In general, cells are small
 and unheated; family visits are strictly limited; and
 prisoners report that they receive such punishments as
 reduction in pay and limitations on free time, bathing, and
 exercise periods for failing to meet unrealistically high work
 standards. Diet and medical facilities are reliably reported
 to be deficient. Former prisoners have reported that prison
 guards sometimes encourage hardened criminals to prey on
 prisoners serving sentences for political offenses. Prisoners
 or former prisoners who complaint publicly of mistreatment
 have been severely punished.
 In its July 1983 meeting, the World Psychiatric Association
 accused Czechoslovakia of misusing psychiatry for political
 purposes, causing Czechoslovakia to resign its membership in
 the organization. Several cases of misuse have been
 documented in recent years, most notably that of the Korineks,
 a Christian Adventist family which has been struggling to
 avoid involuntary incarceration and regain custody of their
 children for more than a decade. However, this appears to be
 an isolated instance, and the misuse of psychiatry does not
 appear to be a widespread practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Persons in Czechoslovakia are frequently arrested, detained,
 or subjected to searches and interrogations for expression of
 views contrary to those of the regime. Such actions by the
 police and judicial authorities are often explained in legal
 terms and performed with warrants, but in many instances they
 have been carried out without warrants. Under the law a
 person may be detained for up to 48 hours without being
 charged, although in practice this limit is often exceeded.
 It is normal for political activists to be detained repeatedly
 for 48 hours at a time and then released without being
 charged. Searches, detentions, and frequent interrogations
 are among the tactics used by the regime when it has decided
 to harass rather than prosecute.
 According to law, a detainee may be held in investigative
 detention for 60 days if the authorities decide to press
 charges. A detainee does not have the right to visits by
 family members until after the trial is over. Investigative
 detention may be and often is extended at the request of the
 prosecution, apd .detainees are occasionally held for long
 periods without being brought to trial. Miklos Duray, the
 
 
 950
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 best known activist for the Hungarian minority in
 Czechoslovakia, was arrested in Bratislava on May 10, 1984
 and released 12 months later without ever having been brought
 to trial.
 People/arrested for expressing views opposed by the regime are
 generally charged with "subversion," "incitement," "defamation
 of the republiC," or "damaging the interests of the republic
 abroad." Persons who have unauthorized contacts with foreign
 diplomats or frequent embassy libraries have on occasion been
 charged with "espionage." People arrested for religious
 activities are usually charged with "obstructing state
 supervision over churches and religious societies." Many of
 these articles of the Criminal Code are so elastic that they
 could encompass almost any activity. In certain instances,
 the authorities have also resorted to trumped-up criminal
 charges (e.g., '"hooliganism," or "stealing socialist
 property") to punish those whose real offense was-to engage in
 unauthorized political activity.
 Internal exile and house arrest have not been imposed formally
 in Czechoslovakia since the 1950's. In 1984, though, for the
 first time, the Government introduced a regime of "protective
 supervision" which combines features of both. Five former
 political prisoners are currently being subjected to this
 regime: Ladislav Lis, Jan Litomisky, Jiri Gruntorad,
 Frantisek Starek, and Ivan Jirous. Protective supervision
 includes travel restrictions; curfews; frequent searches of
 their persons, homes, and guests; and the obligation to report
 to the police on a regular basis. Ladislav Lis, for example,
 has been obliged to report to the police 10 times a week; has
 been subjected to lengthy house searches 3 to 5 times a week;
 and has had many of his visitors detained, taken away for
 questioning, and otherwise harassed. The imposition of such a
 regime, intended for habitual violent offenders, against
 persons who have never committed or advocated an act of
 violence is clearly aimed at isolating them from contact with.
 the outside world.
 The Government has also used forced exile to rid itself of
 critics. In some cases people who had been working or
 visiting abroad with official permission were stripped of
 citizenship and refused the right to return.
 Forced exile is often aimed against people who have already
 served a jail sentence. Upon their release, or while still In
 prison, they are pressured to emigrate. If they refuse, they
 and their-families arb harassed, denied jobs and schooling,
 and threatened with rearrest. Frequently, after a year or
 more of this treatment, these ex-prisoners apply to emigrate.
 Forced labor is hot practiced in Czechoslovakia, but "work
 education" is.required of prisoners. Former prisoners report
 that convicts face higher norms, lower pay, and poorer working
 conditions than normal workers.
 9. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 According to Czechoslovak law, people charged with criminal
 offenses are entitled to a fair and open ptblic trial. The
 law provides that the accused has a right to be informed of
 the charges against him, to have counsel, and to present a
 defense. However, the practice is quite different, especially
 where political offenses are concerned.
 
 
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 For the most part, friends of the defendant, representatives
 of the press, and diplomats are barred from attending trials
 with political content, and the courtroom is filled with
 "representatives of the public," who work for the security
 forces.
 Defendants are allowed to choose their lawyers, and
 court-appointed lawyers are provided if necessary. However,
 lawyers, like judges, are subject to direct and indirect
 pressure from the political authorities and do not always
 vigorously represent their clients. Defense attorneys who
 have defended their clients with vigor have in some cases been
 disbarred and occasionally prosecuted. Defendants do exercise
 their right to defend themselves in court and occasionally
 have the charges dismissed or reduced at the original trial or
 appeal. But an appeal may also result in an increase in the
 sentence or in additional charges.
 The judiciary is not independent of the Government and
 Communist Party. In theory, judges can be removed only by the
 Federal Assembly (Parliament) or by the Czech or Slovak
 National Council. In practice, they are subject to direct
 control and supervision by the Communist Party, to which most
 judges and lawyers must belong.
 The number of political prisoners in Czechoslovakia is
 difficult to estimate. The Czechoslovak Government does not
 recognize political prisoners as a separate category, and does
 not release figures on its prison population. The only
 figures available are from VONS, the Committee in the Defense
 of the Unjustly Persecuted, which to the best of its ability
 documents individual cases. Fewer than a dozen of the cases
 that VONS has been following since 1978 are currently in
 prison, However, VONS does not document certain categories of
 political prisoners, such as those sentenced for attempts to
 leave Czechoslovakia without official permission. The number
 of such prisoners--most of whom serve terms of 1 to 2
 years--has been variously estimated between 300 and 1,000.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government believes it has the right to monitor and
 control the leisure-time activities of its citizens. As such,
 it also asserts the right to interfere with privacy of
 communications.
 Those who are considered opponents of the regime bear the
 brunt of heavily intrusive surveillance. They, their
 families, and friends are routinely subjected to such measures
 as electronic surveillance, tapping of telephones, and
 interceptions and destruction of mail. Discrimination in
 education and employment is regularly practiced against the
 families of dissidents and religious activists. Fear that
 their children will be denied higher education is a major
 factor in preventing even more open dissent among
 intellectuals and white-collar workers.
 A special problem exists for religious believers who wish to
 raise their children in their faith. Organization of
 religious instruction or ceremonies in private homes is
 forbidden. Parents must seek the permission of local
 authorities for their children to receive religious education
 at school. Such requests are discouraged by school
 
 
 952
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 authorities who warn parents that participation in religious
 classes could be damaging to a child's future education and
 career prospects.
 Contacts with individuals and receipt of information from the
 West are discouraged. Czechoslovaks in many professions are
 required to file a report each time they have a conversation
 with a Westerner. Broadcasts of Radio Free Europe in Czech
 and Slovak are jammed in Prague and other major cities,
 although they can often be heard in rural areas. Other
 Western radio broadcasts are not jammed. Many people who live
 near the country's western or southern borders can receive
 West German or Austrian television broadcasts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 press, it also states that they must be exercised "in
 accordance with the interests of the working class." In
 effect, individuals may not voice opinions publicly that
 differ from party policy or question the legitimacy of party
 rule, the fundamental principles of the "Socialist" state, or
 the regime's relationship with the Soviet Union. Likewise,
 academic freedom is severely limited by political directives.
 In order to publish, writers must belong to the
 state-controlled Union of Writers. All newspapers and
 magazines are published by political parties or mass
 organizations -(e.g., The Youth League, Revolutionary Trade
 Union Movement, or Sports Federation) which are controlled by
 the Communist Party. Legal religious literature and
 periodicals come under strict censorship and are published in
 limited editions. Publishing houses and the news media, all
 state-owned, are self-censored under Communist Party
 guidelines. In cases where insufficient care is exercised,
 fines are imposed, or editors may be fired.
 Only a limited number of Western non-Communist periodicals are
 allowed into the country, and they are beyond the reach of
 ordinary citizens. Since the early 1970's, libraries have
 restricted access to Western publications of a political
 character to those individuals who have obtained special
 permission from their employers, documenting their need for
 the material for official purposes. Periodicals such as Time
 and Newsweek are locked in cabinets controlled by special
 personnel. Books and periodicals published during the 1968-69
 period or other publications considered ideologically
 "harmful" are subject to similar controls.
 Printing and photocopying equipment, except typewriters, are
 controlled by the Ministry of Interior and cannot be legally
 obtained by individuals. Despite these restrictions, a lively
 underground "samizdat" (self-published) press publishes a
 variety of fiction and nonfiction, usually in very small
 editions. Some of it is sent abroad where it is reprinted in
 emigre publishing houses and then brought back to
 Czechoslovakia in larger editions. Those arrested for
 literary activities in 1985 include Lenka Mareckova, who was
 sentenced after reading her poetry at a literary evening to a
 6-month prison term for "incitement;" Petr Kozanek and Zdenek
 Kotrly, who were given suspended sentences for trying to take
 some of Mrs. Kotrly's writings to Austria; and a group of five
 
 
 953
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Catholics in Prague who were believed to have organized an
 underground printing press for religious materials.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although freedom of assembly is protected in theory by the
 Constitution, it does not exist in practice. Public meetings
 may be held only with permission of the police, and this
 permission is given only when the meeting supports state
 objectives. When the authorities wish to have a large rally
 (May Day or "peace" demonstrations), people are often
 pressured to attend.
 Lectures and film showings in private homes may also be
 subject to dispersal, if the authorities object to their
 contents or to the participants. In March 1985, 48 people
 were taken to a police station from a private home where they
 had gathered to watch some historical films. Most were
 released after a few hours, but several were detained for 48
 hours without charges. Similar disruptions have plagued
 philosophical seminars organized by Dr. Ladislav Hejdanek, a
 Charter 77 signatory and former professor of philosophy.
 Despite the harassment, the seminar series has survived since
 the late 1970's.
 Independent associations are not permitted in Czechoslovakia.
 All labor unions, professional associations, and even amateur
 groups are controlled by the Communist Party and subordinated
 to it. The Government's unwillingness to tolerate independent
 initiatives by these organizations is evident from its
 treatment of the Jazz Section of the Musicians Union, a
 legally constituted association of 6,000 jazz fans throughout
 Czechoslovakia, which organized jazz festivals and sponsored
 publications on music and the arts for its members. In March
 1985 the Jazz Section was dissolved under a 1968 statute
 banning "counterrevolutionary activity." Leaders of the
 section protested and addressed a series of letters and
 petitions to the authorities. The result was surveillance,
 interrogations, loss of their jobs, and other forms of
 harassment. In September the Jazz Section's offices and
 leaders' apartments were raided by the police, and the
 section's financial and legal records and membership lists
 were confiscated. Despite official pressure, the Jazz
 Section, has thus far, refused to acquiesce in its
 dissolution. Petr Cibulka, a Jazz Section member and Charter
 77 activist, was sentenced on September 27 to 7 months in
 prison for "insulting the nation" during an alleged incident
 in a restaurant.
 Czechoslovak workers do not have the right to establish and
 join organizations of their own choosing without previous
 authorization. An attempt to establish an independent trade
 union in the early 1980's was suppressed. Membership in the
 official trade unions or professional associations is
 virtually obligatory for workers and those seeking to practice
 a profession. Communist Party membership is an unwritten, but
 commonly acknowledged, prerequisite for nearly all
 higher-level jobs.
 The Czechoslovak union organization, the "Revolutionary
 Workers' Movement" (ROH), is a mass organization strictly
 controlled by the Communist Party. Strikes, independent
 organizing efforts, and collective bargaining are not
 permitted under the Czechoslovak system. The ROH is
 
 
 954
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions whose
 headquarters are in Prague.
 The Constitution guarantees the right and duty to work. In
 practice, individuals who are considered politically
 unreliable are barred from professional positions and forced
 into menial, low-paid jobs such as coal stokers and
 nightwatchmen. This practice has been condemned by the
 International Labor Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution but
 strictly limited in practice. "Scientific atheism" is the
 official ideology, and the Government actively discourages
 religious activity, especially among the young. Teachers,
 policemen, Communist Party officials, and certain other
 professionals encounter problems in their careers if they are
 seen in church. Higher education is often denied to active
 believers and their children.
 A church must be officially registered in order to function
 legally in Czechoslovakia. Proselytizing groups, such as
 Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, are banned outright, and
 their members suffer frequent harassment and arrest.
 Jehovah's Witnesses have been reported in several prisons, but
 there are no reliable estimates of their number.
 Organized religious practice is hampered by both written and
 unwritten restrictions. Clergymen are paid by the State and
 must receive a state license in order to practice. Such
 licenses can be--and are--withdrawn without explanation.
 Estimates of the number of clergymen who have lost their
 licenses vary, but they are known to include several bishops.
 Those who continue to practice despite revocation of their
 licenses are liable to criminal prosecution.
 The Roman Catholic Church is the largest of Czechoslovakia's
 18 officially registered religious bodies. There are
 estimated to be 8 to 11 million Roman Catholics in
 Czechoslovakia, and up to 450,000 members of the affiliated
 Greek Catholic (Uniate) Church. The Greek Catholic Church was
 reestablished in 1968 after having been forcibly united with
 the much smaller Orthodox Church in 1950. However, the Greek
 Catholics have been unable to reclaim their property which
 remains in the possession of the Orthodox Church.
 Students in Czechoslovakia's two remaining Catholic seminaries
 (out of a prewar total of 13) need state approval to be
 admitted and ordained. In addition, the State must approve
 each priest's assignment to a parish or higher office. As a
 result of these restrictions, many priests have to cover more
 than one parish, and only 3 of 13 dioceses have resident
 bishops.
 In 1950 all male religious orders were dissolved. A few
 female religious orders were allowed to continue functioning,
 but they were prevented from accepting new members, except
 during a brief interlude in 1968. Despite these limitations,
 some Catholic monastic orders have continued to operate
 clandestinely. In November 1984 seven Catholics were detained
 and interrogated on suspicion of being affiliated with the
 Franciscan order. All were released without trial within
 2 months, but charges remain pending against them.
 
 
 955
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 "Pacem in Terris," the state-sponsored "peace association" of
 clergy, has been a major instrument of state control over the
 Catholic Church since it was founded in 1970. The association
 has been losing ground since 1982 when the Vatican banned
 clergy participation in political organizations worldwide.
 Although Cardinal Tomasek and the overwhelming majority of the
 clergy in Czechoslovakia have disassociated themselves from
 "Pacem in Terris," priests associated with the organization
 have retained control of Katolicke Noviny (Catholic News), the
 only legally published Catholic newspaper.
 The year 1985 witnessed the largest religious gathering in
 Czechoslovakia's postwar history, when 150,000 Czech and
 Slovak Catholics gathered in a small Moravian village to
 celebrate the ll00th anniversary of the death of St.
 Methodius. Although the authorities did not prevent people
 from gathering at Velehrad, they refused to allow the Pope and
 Catholic leaders from Western European countries to attend the
 ceremonies. The crowds in attendance made their views on
 government religious policies clear by booing the Czech
 Minister of Culture and chanting slogans for religious
 freedom, a papal visit, more priests and bishops, and an end
 to "Pacem in Terris."
 The printing of religious literature is severely restricted,
 and Bibles are in short supply. There has been some progress
 in this area of late: the Czech Ecumenical Council of
 Churches reportedly imported 122,000 Czech Bibles and New
 Testaments in 1984-85, and the Appeal of Conscience Foundation
 provided Jewish communities 2,000 copies of the Pentateuch in
 1985. Still, the demand for religious literature exceeds the
 supply, and Bibles are smuggled in from abroad and produced by
 underground "samizdat" (self-published) methods.
 Protestant denominations registered by the Government operate
 under similar constraints as the Catholic Church.
 Proselytizing is forbidden; religious education is strictly
 regulated and may not be organized in private homes; religious
 ceremonies are restricted for the most part to church
 premises, and education of clergymen is closely controlled.
 Clergymen who are popular with young people or associated with
 Charter 77 soon find themselves barred from preaching.
 The Jewish community of several thousand has a central
 religious organization, financially supported and controlled
 by the Government. There are synagogues and prayer houses
 open for worship and two rabbis, one in Prague and one in
 Kosice. In Prague, there is a Jewish Museum operated by the
 State. There are no Jewish schools or rabbinical seminaries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 For most Czechoslovaks freedom of movement within the country
 is not restricted, except near military installations and the
 borders with Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany.
 However, the Government has increasingly restricted the
 movements of Charter 77 activists and other "suspect" persons
 by preventing them from leaving their homes or meeting with
 foreigners. Leading Prague-based dissidents were kept under
 virtual house arrest for several days or weeks during the
 spring and summer of 1985, when Western dignataries were
 visiting Prague, in an effort to prevent them from meeting
 with delegation members and the accompanying press. Likewise,
 
 
 956
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 several religious activists were picked up by the police and
 driven back to Prague each time they went to visit friends or
 colleagues outside the city.
 Travel to Western countries is difficult since travelers must
 obtain permission and, unless visiting close relatives, a hard
 currency authorization. The number of such authorizations
 issued each year is far below the demand. Travelers to the
 West must usually leave some member of the immediate family at
 home to ensure their return. These restrictions are often
 relaxed for retired persons.
 Travel by citizens of Czechoslovakia to other East European
 countries has become more difficult in recent years. A
 special passport is now required for trips to Yugoslavia, and
 travel to Poland has been restricted since 1981. Travel to
 Hungary has been made more difficult by limiting the amount of
 currency which may be exchanged and the number of trips which
 may be made in 1 year. Citizens deemed politically
 "unreliable" may find that they are denied permission to
 travel to either Eastern or Western Europe.
 The right to emigrate is extremely limited. It is generally
 enjoyed only by those wishing to join a foreign citizen
 spouse, or, in the case of retired persons, foreign citizen
 children abroad. Those caught while seeking to leave
 Czechoslovakia without official permission are usually
 sentenced to 1 or 2 years in prison. The number of such
 prisoners has been variously estimated between 300 and 1,000.
 Czechoslovakia occasionally denies the right of repatriation
 by stripping the citizenship of those citizens it wishes to
 keep out. Emigration passports are not valid for return
 without special endorsement, and in some cases permanent exile
 is a condition for emigration or study abroad. Many former
 Czechoslovak citizens who wish to visit their former homeland
 are denied visas.
 There is a moderate outflow of refugees from Czechoslovakia,
 primarily persons who leave the country legally on vacation to
 non-Warsaw Pact countries and do not return. This may amount
 to about 10,000 people annually, but precise statistics are
 unavailable.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All significant decisions regarding the Government, the
 economy, and society are made exclusively by the leadership of
 the Communist Party. Through its apparatus, the party
 leadership determines who will be placed in decisionmaking
 positions not only within its own ranks but also throughout
 the structures of state authority, the economy, the media, and
 mass organizations. Real power is enjoyed by only a few
 top-level officials in the party Presidium and Secretariat.
 Ordinary citizens, especially those who are not party members,
 have no role in selecting their leaders or in making important
 political or economic decisions. Four minor political parties
 are permitted to organize and publish their own newspapers but
 must conform their activities to Communist Party directives.
 All parties and mass organizations are represented in the
 National Front which is completely controlled by the Communist
 
 
 957
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Party. Among its tasks is the nomination of a single slate of
 candidates to stand unopposed at all elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Czechoslovak Government reacts negatively to expressions
 of concern about human rights violations in Czechoslovakia
 either by other governments or by nongovernmental
 institutions. It has delayed or denied visas to members of
 international human rights organizations such as the Helsinki
 Watch Committee and Amnesty International.
 Two groups within Czechoslovakia concern themselves with human
 rights. One is Charter 77, a group of individuals who signed
 a document first issued in January 1977 calling on the
 Government to honor its commitment to international
 arrangements on human rights, including the Final Act of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as
 human rights guarantees in the Czechoslovak Constitution. The
 second group, the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly
 Persecuted (known by its Czech intials VONS), uses public
 records and reports from friends and relatives of the accused
 to issue communiques in cases where it believes the police,
 the courts, or the prisons have abused citizens' human
 rights. These communiques are distributed to the Czechoslovak
 authorities. Members of both of these groups, are targets of-
 harassment by the regime.
 Amnesty International, in its 1985 Report (covering the year
 1984), was concerned about the continued detention of
 prisoners of conscience and the application of the Law on
 Protective Surveillance to some prisoners of conscience who
 had been released. It also noted that many people were
 sentenced to short prison terms and harassed in various ways
 for exercising their human rights. Freedom House rated
 Czechoslovakia "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Czechoslovakia is a highly industrialized country of
 approximately 15.5 million inhabitants. It has had a rising
 standard of living since the end of World War II, but recent
 figures show a slowing down in the rate of growth. The
 stable, largely urbanized population enjoys an adequate
 material existence.
 The basic needs of food and health care are met. Food
 supplies are adequate and the average daily caloric intake in
 1984 was 3,100 calories. Health care is universally available
 .through a national system administered and financed by the
 Government and paid for in part by employee deductions. There
 are reports, however, that prompt treatment is only secured
 through payment of bribes, and many standard drugs are
 available only if paid for in hard currency. In 1984 average
 life expectancy at birth was 66.7 years for men, and 74.0 for
 women. The infant mortality rate was 14.9 per 1,000 live
 births.
 The retirement age is 57 years for women and 60 years for
 men. The average pension is 55 percent of the average wage,
 and many retirees supplement their pension payments by working.
 
 
 958
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Education is compulsory to 16 years of age. Literacy is
 nearly universal. Secondary and university education are free
 of charge, and opportunities exist for evening study at the
 advanced secondary and technical levels. However, the
 selection of students for courses and schools, particularly
 those leading to more desirable careers, is reportedly based
 on their parents' political standing and reliability.
 Official policies also deliberately favor children from
 workers' families in the admissions process. There has been
 criticism of the insertion of political criteria i4 admission
 to higher education.
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 16, although
 part-time employment is permitted at an earlier age. The
 average workweek is 42.5 hours. Beyond 46 hours workers are
 paid overtime, and there are additional bonuses for some shift
 and weekend work. There is a labor shortage, especially for
 unskilled and semiskilled labor, which is filled in part by
 workers from other Communist countries. Working conditions
 appear generally adequate, although less attention is paid to
 occupational safety and pollution than in the West. When
 problems do arise, the workers have little recourse, since
 strikes and independent labor organizations are prohibited,
 and the major preoccupation of the state-controlled labor
 union is to ensure that production plans are fulfilled.
 Women form 46.5 percent of the work force, but they tend to be
 concentrated in lower-paying, less skilled jobs. They do,
 however, receive equal pay to their male colleagues if they
 hold the same job. There are inconsistencies in the
 responsibilities women are asked to assume: they are
 encouraged to join the work force, but they are also offered
 incentives to have children. According to Czechoslovak
 figures, the population growth rate was 0.3 percent in 1984.
 Women are equal under the law, and there are small numbers of
 women in the professions and in higher ranking party,
 government, and managerial positions. There is only one woman
 in the party Secretariat, and she holds her position by virtue
 of being Chairman of the Women's League. There are no female
 ministers or ambassadors.
 Czechoslovakia has two major nationalities--Czechs and
 Slovaks--and two substantial minorities--Hungarians and
 Gypsies. Interethnic relations are still colored by historic
 animosities, but the Czechoslovak system provides certain
 guarantees for minorities.
 Hungarians who are concentrated in southern Slovakia form the
 country's largest minority (555,000 according to official
 statistics). They are proportionately represented in federal
 and local legislative bodies but are underrepresented in
 high-level jobs in industry, government, and the party
 apparatus. The State provides some primary and secondary
 education in Hungarian and permits a limited number of ethnic
 Hungarians to pursue higher education in Hungary. Ethnic
 Hungarians complain, however, that Hungarian-language
 instruction at the elementary and secondary levels is being
 reduced, and that the lack of opportunities for higher
 education in Hungarian is creating a growing shortage of
 qualified Hungarian-language teachers. Miklos Duray, a
 leading Hungarian minority activist, spent a year in prison
 without trial for addressing these issues in open letters to
 Czechoslovak officials. He was amnestied in May 1985 and has

 reportedly been permitted to return to his job as a geologist
 in Bratislava.
 The Gypsies, who number about 250,000, are the only other
 sizable minority in Czechoslovakia. As elsewhere in Europe,
 they tend to suffer disproportionately high rates of poverty,
 crime, and disease. However, their problems appear to result
 more from traditions and popular prejudice than from
 government policies.
 Approximatley 30,000 Vietnamese laborers are temporarily
 residing in Czechoslovakia. Reportedly, they are allowed to
 retain two-thirds of their salary. The remainder is shared by
 the Czechoslovak and Vietnamese Governments.
