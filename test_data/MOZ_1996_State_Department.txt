 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique has a constitutional government headed by President Joaquim
 Chissano who was elected in the country's first multiparty elections in October
 1994. President Chissano and the leadership of his party, the Front for the Libera-
 tion of Mozambique (FRELIMO), which has ruled the country since independence
 in 1975, control policymaking and implementation. The National Assembly, the only
 multiparty institution beside the defense force, provided useful debate on national
 policy issues. However, the Assembly's FRELIMO majority did not exert significant
 authority or independence from the executive with regard to policymaking. The judi-
 ciary began to openly discuss its weaknesses, but it remained unable to implement
 constitutional provisions safeguarding individual human rights or to provide an ef-
 fective check on the power of the executive branch. Although the foundations of de-
 mocracy remained fragile, Mozambique's political transition continued to be largely
 successful, and reintegration of areas controlled by the Mozambican National Resist-
 ance (RENAMO) during the war continued, with tensions limited to only a few dis-
 tricts.
 The integration of the FRELIMO and RENAMO defense forces continued, al-
 though a lack of resources and political will has hampered the development of a
 nonpartisan professional military. There are several forces responsible for internal
 security under the Minister of Interior, the Criminal Investigation Police (PIC), the
 Mozambican National Police (PRM), and the Rapid Reaction Police (PIR). The State
 Information and Security Service (SISE) reports directly to the President. These ill-
 trained and ill-disciplined units continued to be the focus of much controversy.
 Members of the security forces committed numerous human rights abuses.
 Approximately 80 percent of the population is employed in agriculture, mostly on
 a subsistence level. Major exports are shrimp, sugar, cotton, and cashew nuts. The
 transition to a market economy in the small formal economy accelerated during the
 latter half of the year with increasing privatization of state-owned enterprises and
 progress in financial sector reform. Starting from an extremely low base, the gross
 domestic product grew 3 percent in 1995 and was forecast to grow at a significantly
 higher rate in 1996. Inflation fell significantly with an estimated annuai inflation
 rate of approximately 21 percent, below the International Monetary Fund target for
 the year. Although the general economic outlook improved with good rains and a
 good harvest, the economy and the Government's budget remained heavily depend-
 ent on foreign aid; the economy experienced a $613 million trade deficit in 1995.
 Extensive corruption at all levels of the Government continues to be a problem. The
 annual per capita income of around $90 remains very low, and unemployment is
 hi he
 %e the status of political and civil liberties improved, the Government's overall
 human rights record continued to be marred by a pattern of abusive behavior by
 the security forces and an ineffective judicial system which is only nominally inde-
 pendent from the FRELIMO-controlled executive. Poorly trained and undisciplined
 police forces and local officials continued to commit human rights abuses, including
 extrajudicial killings, excessive use of force, and arbitrary detention. Security forces
 and police routinely beat, tortured, or otherwise abused detainees, including street
 children. Extremely poor prison conditions resulted in the deaths of dozens of in-
 mates. Arbitrary arrests and lengthy detentions without fair and expeditious trials
 remained problems. The Government continued to restrict press freedom; the media
 remained largely owned by the Government and state enterprises and manipulated
 by factions within the ruling party, but there was greater criticism of government
 policies. Also, with increased press and NGO scrutiny, more abuses by security
 forces came to light than in previous years, and in some instances the Government
 investigated and punished those responsible. However, in view of the common per-
 ception that the police force is unreliable and corrupt, many citizens resorted to mob
 justice. Late in the year, the President dismissed the unpopular Minister of Interior,
 and the Government promised long-needed reforms of the police forces. Societal dis-
 crimination and violence against women, and violence against children remain prob-
 lems.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known cases of politi-
 cal killings, but there were reports of extrajudicial killings. RENAMO officials
 charged that security forces had killed several of its members. In May the General
 Secretary of RENAMO, Francisco Marcelino, accused police of intimidating, perse-
 cuting, detaining, and executing RENAMO followers in Manica, Sofala, Nampula,
 and Tete provinces. The Government did not investigate these charges, but there
 were no independent verifications of the alleged killings.
 According to the Mozambican League of Human Rights (LDH), in June police
 were responsible for the death in police custody of an accused car thief, Frenque
 Tchembene, and the disappearance of another suspect, Abdul Mota (see Section
 1.b.). According to Frenque's wife, who was present during his interrogation,
 Frenque was beaten with iron bars and AK-47 rifles, submerged in dirty water, and
 struck in the genital area. His medical report indicated that he died later the same
 week from these police-inflicted injuries. After protest by the LDH, the authorities
 arrested a sergeant and charged him and four other officers with murder.
 A press report stated that police killed three people-two by gunshot and the
 third by beating-early in the year in Central Zambezia province. The police in-
 volved were briefly detained then released. In March the independent press reported
 that a police officer in Machava, a Maputo suburb, tortured a man to death after
 a complaint that the man was harassing a neighbor.
 Extremely poor prison conditions led to the deaths of many persons in custody
 (see Section 1.c.).
 There were no known disciplinary actions taken in the 1995 killing of Fern
 Macongue Sitoe. The police shot Sitoe in the course of attempting to settle a local
 dispute.
 Mob and vigilante killings continued to be common. For. example in March a
 group of residents in Manjacaze lynched two suspected armed robbers. While the
 authorities rarely prosecuted mob participants, in June police in Matola prevented
 a mob from burning to death four thieves. There were numerous but unverified re-
 ports during the year that regulos (traditional chiefs) and curandeiros (traditional
 healers) had imposed and carried out death sentences against persons accused of
 witchcraft.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 In May Abdul Mota, a suspected car thief, disappeared after an argument with
 an officer of the paramilitary "lightning brigade" that patrols the Maputo-Ressano
 Garcia highway. Mota disappeared after last being seen with a senior officer of the
 brigade. The authorities failed to conduct a thorough investigation, and no report
 on the incident had been issued by year's end. Mota remained missing at year's end.
 The fate of thousands of Mozambicans who disappeared during the civil war still
 remains unresolved. However, a FRELIMO National Assembly deputy reported pub-
 licly for the first time that the FRELIMO leadership had had one such person-
 Lazaro Nkavandame, one of FRELIMO's founders--executed by firing squad for
 treason, as were others during the conflict.
 In March another FRELIMO National Assembly deputy alleged that RENAMO
 continues to hold kidnaped children in Niassa province.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1990 Constitution expressly prohibits torture an cruel or inhuman treatment,
 but the Mozambican olice forces continued to commit serious abuses. The police
 often used excessive 1orce, and there were continuing reports that police routinely
 beat and whipped detainees. In February one senior PRM officer stated publicly
 that in order to restore public order police have to beat people.
 Corruption in the police forces extends throughout the ranks, and the PRM used
 violence and detention to intimidate people from reporting abuses. In July the Di-
 rector of the Criminal Investigation Police (PIC), Domingos Maita, publicly stated
 that the police forces are infiltrated by crime syndicates. A press report in Septem-
 ber from Gaza province's capital Xai Xai indicated that the local police regularly ex-
 torted money from street vendors (predominately widowed and divorced women),
 beat the women, and confiscated their produce. Police also beat street children (see
 Section 5).
 The vast majority of these cases were never investigated, but one case received
 nationwide publicity due to the LDH's investigation. The LDH accused the PRM of
 deliberately torturing nine workers on the Mozambican National Airline (LAM) at
 the end of 1995. The report stated that the police officers tortured the workers with
 saws, hammers, and by sticking guns up the workers' nostrils or in their ears, leav-
 ing some of the workers with hearing impairments. Although the LDH sent letters
 
 
 to various authorities, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior,
 by the end of 1996 no investigation into the alleged torture had taken place.
 Credible reports indicated that the paramilitary "lightning brigade guarding the
 Ressano Garcia-Maputo road continued to beat and torture suspected car thieves,
 keeping them shackled for days without due process.
 A RENAMO provincial official, Tome Fernandes, accused the police in May of in-
 timidating citizens of the RENAMO constituency in Cabo Delgado province. Al-
 though RENAMO presented Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi with a series of such
 allegations, it does not appear that any investigation has taken place. A civil court
 in March settled the 1994 case of torture of a bank official by "PROTEG* private
 security forces involving the use of electric shocks. The court ordered the Commer-
 cial Bank of Mozambique to reemploy the official and pay him 17 months' back
 wages. However, the criminal case concerning the torture allegations had not been
 heard by yeas end.
 RENAMO officials continued to allege that on numerous occasions police har-
 assed, detained, and beat its members (see Sections l.a. and 3).
 On occasion the Government took action to counter the abuses arising from police
 corruption and excessiv  e of force. In June the Maputo provincialpolice com-
 mander, Raimundo Macie, stated that in 1995 the Maput command disci plined 66
 policemen and expelled 19 from the force for collaborating with criminals.  August
 two police officers were found guilty of sexually violating two minors, 12 and 14
 years of age. There were isolated instances of disciplinary actions in other parts of
 the country. In November President Chissano relieved the unpopular Interior Min-
 ister and his deputy, and the new Minister took steps to discipline or expel dozens
 of police officers as well to begin a program of reform inside the police force.
 Prison conditions throughout the country are extremely poor and continued to de-
 triorate; they posed a severe threat to inmates' life and health. Medical and food
 supplies are usually insufficient, with little medical care available, and some pris-
 oners being fed only once a day or less. It is estimated that some prisons hold up
 to four times their intended prisoner capacity. Throughout the ear ustice Minister
 Jose Abudo reported on the serious conditions in the prisons. He made highly pub-
 licized visits to prisons, reporting that severe overcrowding, food shortages, and dis-
 ease, including scabies, malaria, tuberculosis, and anemia, had led to thie deaths of
 prisoners. He also found that management irregularities in many of the country's
 prisons, including embezzlement of prison funds, had exacerbated prison conditions.
 In June Abudo stated that the Justice Ministry was unable to fund three meals a
 day for prisoners and that, in general, prisoners throughout the country received
 barely one daily meal, ofte n o extremely poor quality.
 There were many reports of deaths in overcrowded prisons. For example, in June
 prison director Pedro Neharrgula said that at least five prisoners had tied of diar-
 rheal diseases during the previous 10 months in the main prison in Quelimane, the
 capital of Central Zambezia province. He said that the Quelimane prison, built to
 accommodate 90 inmates, currently held 406. Other reports indicated that at least
 25 prisoners had died in Manica provincial prison by the end of March. The Manica
 rison built to hold 300, contained more than 900 persons. The Beira central prison
 irector, Luis Alberto Sucane, admitted that overcrowding and poor sanitary condi-
 tions had caused numerous deaths in the Beira prison, which, despite a capacity of
 200,izentaineds80 prisonrprigta  eeeoers.wig odsoraeadds
 aInterior Minister Manuel Antonio declared in January that if prisoners die of hun-
 ger, they only have themselves to blame. His comments evoked severe national criti-
 cism. Calls by a variety of national figures for his resignation went unheeded by
 the Government. However, in order to combat these poor prison conditions, in Feb.
 ruary the Ministry of Justice began an initiative whereby prisoners in Sofala,
 Central Zambezia, and Manica provinces were given their own plots of land to cul-
 tivate for food, and in Quelimane prisoners were contracted out as laborers to local
 businesses.
 Although the majority of cases of abuse in prison are due to overcrowding and
 lack of food and medical attention, prisoners continued to regularly report police
 beatings, ae, and demands for money in exchange for freedom. In an April letter
 by a group of inmates to a national newspaper, the prisoners charged that police
 officers beat and tortured them, sexuall abused prisoners and their wives, and de-
 manded money for food and sometimes freedom.  an pretrial detainees are minors
 who are incarcerated with adult inmates. As a result, child molestation and other
 violence against children are rampant in the country's prisons. Military and civilian
 prisoners are held in the same prisons.
 International human rights groups are given access to prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-nThe Constitution provides that the dura-
 tion of preventive imprisonment be set by law; however the police continue to arbi-
 
 
 trarily arrest and detain citizens. Under Law 2/93 the maximum preventive impris-
 onment is 48 hours. Within that time period, a detainee has the right to have his
 case reviewed by judicial authorities, after which he can be detained up to another
 60 days while his case is investigated by the PIC. However, persons accused of the
 most serious crimes, i.e., security offenses or these requiring a sentence of more
 than 8 years, may be detained up to 84 days without being formally charged. With
 court approval such detainees may be held for two additional periods of 84 days
 while the police complete their investigation. In practice, however, the authorities
 often ignore these rules, as well as a detainee's constitutional right to counsel and
 to contact relatives or friends. Although Law 19/91 provides definitions of crimes
 against the State, such as treason, terrorism, and sabotage, the Government retains
 the discretion to determine which crimes constitute security offenses.
 Most citizens are unaware of their rights, particularly those granted under the
 1990 Constitution and Law 2/93, and detainees can spend many months, even years,
 in pretrial status. In August the President of the Supreme Court, Mario Mangaze,
 publicly admitted that detainees' rights under Law 293 regarding preventive im-
 prisonment were being abused due to a severe shortage of qualified judicial authori-
 ties to review cases. The bail system remains poorly defained, and prisoners, their
 families, and NGO's complained that pelice and prison officials often take bribes to
 release those who can afford to pay. The law provides that if the prescribed period
 for investigation has been completed and no charges have been brought, the de-
 tainee must be released. In practice, however, this law is often ignored, in part be-
 cause of the severe lack of administrative personnel, trained judges, and sufficient
 lawyers to monitor the judicial system (see Section i.e.).
 A large backlog of prisoners continue to await trial. Official data for 1995 indi-
 cated that there were 2,572 persons in prison and that over half (1,451) were still
 awaiting trial. In July the Minister of Justice reported that of Pemba prison's 321
 inmates, 61 awaited trial and 170 had not even been charged. In Beira central pris-
 on 322 of the 743 inmates reportedly had already been in pretrial detention for peri-
 ods longer than the potential jail terms applicable for their alleged crimes, and 278
 of the 639 prisoners in Manica central prison were in similar status. In Guelimane
 provincial prison 245 of the 406 prisoners were awaiting judicial hearing, many for
 over 6 months.
 The Constitution expressly prohibits exile, and the Government does not use exile
 as a form of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tial.-The Constitution formally established an inde-
 pendent judiciary and specifically states that the decisions of the courts take prece-
 dence over all other authorities and individuals and must be obeyed. Nevertheless,
 the executive, and by extension the FRELIMO arty, dominates the judiciary.
 Judges largely owe their positions to the ruling FRELIO party, which continues
 to exercise significant influence on all aspects of public life through the executive
 and party organs.
 The President appoints the President and Vice President of the most important
 tribunal, the Supreme Court. These selections are then sent to the National Assem-
 bly for approval. Although the Supreme Council of Judicial Magistrates assembles
 a list of qualified persons for the remaining Supreme Court positions, the President
 selects the justices off the list. No National Assembly approval is needed for these
 choices. In May the FRELIMO-dominated National Assembly succeeded in electing
 its list of four candidates to the Supreme Council. The President also appoints the
 Attorney General. The National Assembly has yet to assert it prerogatives in the
 judicial area.
 There are two complementary formal justice systems: The civil/criminal which in-
 cludes customary courts; and the military. A 1991 law empowered the Supreme
 Court to administer the civil/criminal; it also hears appeals, including military
 cases, although the Ministry of Defense administers the military courts. Below the
 Supreme Court there are provincial and district courts. There are also special courts
 that exercise limited subject-matter jurisdiction, e.g., administrative courts, customs
 courts, fiscal courts, maritime courts, and labor courts. As with the provincial and
 district courts, these specialized courts are ineffective because they suffer from a
 lack of qualified professionals. Civilians are not under the jurisdiction of, or tried
 in, the military courts. Local customary courts handle matters such as estate and
 divorce cases.
 Persons accused of crimes against the State are tried in regular civilian courts
 under standard criminal judicial procedures. The Supreme Court has original juris-
 diction over members of the National Assembly and anyone else who is immune
 from trial in the lower courts. A judge may order a trial closed because of national
 security interests or to protect the privacy of the plaintiff in cases concerning rape.
 
 
 In regular courts, all accused persons are in theory presumed innocent and have
 the right to legal counsel and the right of appeal, but the authorities do not always
 respect these righ~ts, and in fact the great majority of the population is either un-
 aware of these ri-ghts or does not possess the means to obtain any form of legal
 counsel. There is a serious shortage of qualified judicial personnel. In April Supreme
 Court President Mangaze reported that at the provincial level, only one licensed
 judge exists in Cab Delgado, Gaza, and Zambezia provinces, respectively. He re-
 ported that at the district level there are districts with no courts or judges at all.
 In August Supreme Court President Mangaze further admitted that the grave prob-
 lems of a lack of human and financial resources and problems with outdated legisla-
 tion have impeded the judiciary's effectiveness. Exacerbating the problem is the lack
 of licensed attorneys, with less than 200 in the country and the vast majority cen-
 tered in Maputo. In an effort to replace the public organization previously respon-
 sible for providing counsel for indigent defendants, some NGO's, such as the
 Mozambican League of Human Rights and the Association of Mozambican Women
 in Judicial Careers, offer limited legal counsel at no or little cost.
 The President of the Supreme Court has also acknowledged that the judicial sys-
 tm in plagued by bribery and extortion. In June a judge in Gaza province was ac-
 cused ofcon iscating private goods, including cars of local citizens.
 In November the presiding judge of the Manica provincial court was accused of
 murdering his domestic servant. The victim's widow filed a case against the judge
 with the provincial attorney who forwarded it to the relevant authorities in Maputo.
 As a result of these charges, the Deputy President of the Supreme Court traveled
 to the provincial capital of Chiomoio to conduct an investigation. By year's end,
 there had not been any disciplinary action taken.
 The Government, with international assistance, has developed a comprehensive
 plan for improving the professional level and efficiency of the judiciary. In an effort
 to combat the lack of human resources, in mid-September a Center for Judicial For-
 mation (with European funding) opened, which will train nonlicensed persons for
 the role of district magistrates.
 Efforts to reintegrate RENAMO-controlled zones into central administrative struc-
 tures continued, but RENAMO still exercises informal control over a number of
 areas through a rudimentary form of civil administration and traditional courts,
 with extensive use of traditional authorities as judges. In September the RENAMO
 National Assembly deputy for Inhambane, Fernando Pries, acknowledged the exist-
 ence of a RENAMO administrative structure in the district of Chipandzane. A tradi-
 tional chief in the district of Rovuro was accused of trying to collect taxes, and an-
 other in Inharrime district forced residents to build huts and latrines.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1990 Constitution provides for the right of privacy and expressly forbids the use of
 surveillance techniques. By law police need a warrant to enter homes and busi-
 nesses. Although there are fewer reports of such activity, incidents of illegal tele-
 phone wiretapping by government intelligence agencies allegedly still occur. Secu-
 rity forces keep watch on RENAMO members and supporters and other members
 of the opposition.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution, the 1991 Press Law, and the
 1992 Rome Peace Accords provide for freedom of expression and the press but with
 restrictions in cases involving national defense considerations. Although there was
 some progress toward greater transparency and criticism in reporting on govern-
 ment policies and more independent editorial content, the Government continued to
 restrict press freedom. While criticism of the President is not legally prohibited, the
 1991 Press Law holds that, in cases of defamation against the President, truth is
 not a sufficient defense against libel. Although this law has not been tested in court,
 it resulted in considerable self-censorship, and there is almost no direct criticism of
 the President.
 The Government dominates the media, which reflect a bias toward state interests.
 The Government and state enterprises own the greater part of the country's media,
 including Mozambique's two daily newspapers, the only Sunday newspaper, the only
 weekly news magazine, and the national radio and television stations. Radio Mo-
 zambique is thepublic's most important source of information and receives the larg-
 est single subsidy from the state budget of any public company. The Government
 also has its own wire service, the Mozambican News Agency.
 The government-controlled media continued to orchestrate disinformation cam-
 pagus regarding RENAMO activities. For example, the government-controlled press
 repeatedly claimed that members of an obscure Zimbabwean dissident group, aleg-
 
 
 edly operating along the two country's borders, had ties to RENAMO and that
 RENAMO was keeping armed men in hiding. No credible evidence was ever pro-
 duced for these allegations, and the claims died out in the latter half of the year.
 More generally, the press tended deliberately to portray RENAMO in a bad light
 although this too was less evident as the year wore on.
 The development of the small independent media continued over the past year.
 In addition to the two weekly newspapers, Demos and Salvana, and two facsimile
 daily news sheets, Medifax, and Imparcial, two monthly newspapers appeared;
 Renascer oriented to general news, and Gaseta Mercantil covering economic issues.
 There were attempts at other news sheets, and independent newspapers with mime-
 ographed formats appeared in two provinces. The second television station and a
 few limited range radio stations also continued to operate.
 The small independent press carried opposition viewpoints and generally enjoyed
 far greater credibility, but its influence (and that of the official press as well) is lim-
 ited largely to Maputo and the provincial capitals because of the logistical difficulty
 of distribution of any publication in rural areas. Only a small minority of the popu-
 lation receives news through either television or the print media.
 Journalists who criticized government officials or policy were at times subjected
 to threats and intimidation. For example, in April, in violation of the 1991 Press
 Law, police in Nacala detained, harassed, and destroyed the fim of two journalists
 of the independent newspaper Savanna who had photographed local traffic police.
 Government domination of newspaper printing presses led to allegations of official
 harassment of the independent press, but there was no evidence this affected publi-
 cation or content of the independent publications.
 Abolition of the Ministry of Information in late 1994 did not notably result in
 greater independence of the media, and a new information office under the Prime
 Minister continues to at least informally monitor press content. A Mozambican
 chapter of the Media Institute of Southern Africa, whose goal is the creation and
 development of a free and pluralistic press in southern Africa, was founded in July.
 There are no formal restrictions on academic freedom. In practice, however, teach-
 ers routinely adhere to self-censorship since their employment depends on the State.
 During a June strike of students (demanding an increase in living allowances) at
 the University of Eduardo Mondlane, the university rector made credible allegations
 of political interference in the functions of the university.
 h. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Throughout the year political parties and
 other groups freely held congsses, press conferences, workshops, and other public
 gatherings. No groups werenown to have been denied permission to hold public
 marches. For exampie, RENAMO's Maputo city branch organized celebrations of the
 fourth anniversary of the signing of the Rome Peace Accords in October and held
 other meetings throughout the country. NGO's and church organizations were also
 active in hosting conferences and rallies, and faced no governmental obstacles or
 harassment. The Mozambican Christian Council continued its project of collecting
 arms throughout the country without interference.
 Legislation promulgated in 1991 ensures the process of registration of plitical
 parties. Currently there are over 15 registered, active political parties. Under 1992
 legislation a political party must demonstrate that it has no racial, ethnic, or reli-
 gious exclusiveness and secure at least 2,000 signatures of citizens in order to be
 recognized legally.
 Other groups and associations continued to organize themselves or become more
 active, including Foro Mulher, an umbrella women's NGO group, which hosted a
 conference on women's rights (see Section 5). The Government requires nonpolitical
 groups, except religious organizations, to register, but it rarely rejects applications
 from new associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides that all citizens have the free-
 dom to practice or not to practice a religion and gives religious denominations the
 right to pursue their religious aims freely. The Government respects these rights in
 practice. The Government does not require religious organizations or missionaries
 to register, and foreign missionaries are routinely granted visas. The Constitution
 also gives religious groups the right to own and acquire assets, and these institu-
 tions are allowed bylaw to oerate schools. Small Christian evangelical groups con-
 tinued to form throughout the year, and an Islamic group provided funds for the
 construction of schools in Niassa, Nampula, and Maputo provinces.
 Relations between the Government and the religious organizations, tense in the
 early years after independence, began to improve in 1992 and have improved fur-
 ther as the Government sought political support from these organizations in the
 multiparty system. Muslim deputies introduced an Islamic holiday proposal in the
 National Assembly's fourth session (February-May), but President Chissano re-
 
 
 quested that the Supreme Court make a ruling on its constitutionality. A variety
 of national figures, including the Catholic Church's Archbishop of Beira, charged
 that the proposal conflicts with the Constitution, which declares that Mozambique
 is a secular state. The Supreme Court in December ruled that the Islamic Holidays
 Law was unconstitutional since it conflicted with constitutional provisions guaran-
 teeing the secular nature of the Mozambican State.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of travel within the country and
 abroad. The Government no longer requires citizens to obtain permits from local au-
 thorities in order to travel within the country. The Government continues to enforce
 a law fining foreigners who overstay their visas; increasing the amount to $350 per
 dahrughout the year, security force roadblocks and patrols affected freedom of
 movement. Police harassment throughout the country's road network increased over
 the past year, with many incidents of officers demanding bribes on trumped-up
 charges. Confiscating people's possessions under flimsy pretexts has become a com-
 mon police practice.
 Although several riots throughout the country by unemployed demobilized soldiers
 occurred in midyear, the disturbances were small in scale and largely confined to
 urban areas. In the countryside, where most of the demobilized soldiers reside,
 former soldiers appeared to be reintegrating peacefully with no threats to freedom
 of movement.
 In July the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) officially
 ended its repatriation and reintegration program for Mozambican refugees. In the
 30-month period following the signing of the October 1992 Rome Peace Accord, ap-
 proximately 1.7 million Mozambican refugees returned to the country from six coun-
 tries of asylum During the same time period, most of the country's 3.6 million inter-
 nally displaced persons moved back to their homes.
 In recent years, Mozambique has been primarily a refugee generating country.
 Historically, however, Mozambique has provided asylum to large numbers of refu-
 gees from neighboring countries. The Government cooperates with the UNHCR and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees, including providing first
 asylum. At year's end, there was a small caseload of 48 refugees who have been
 ranted asylum in Mozambique, primarily from other African countries (Rwanda,
 Burundi, Zaire, and Somalia). Of these 48 persons, 28 individuals were granted asy-
 lum in 1996. The UNHCR also manages a moderate caseload of individuals who
 have been refused refugee status but are in the process of appealing this decision
 and of those who are still in the application process. There were no reports of forced
 return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides that citizens have the right to elect their representa-
 tives by universal, direct, secret, and periodic elections. In October 1994 citizens
 freely exercised for the first time their right to vote in multiparty elections, which
 U.N. and other international observers declared to be free and fair. President
 Chissano was elected, with the ruling FRELIMO party winning 129 of the 250 Na-
 tional Assembly seats. RENAMO surprised many observers with its strong showing
 in the elections, winning majorities in the country's five most populous provinces.
 Although the opposition parties are in a minority status in the Assembly and lacked
 previous legislative experience, the two 1996 parliamentary sessions were marked
 by an improvement in both the overall quality of debate as well as the effectiveness
 of individual deputies from all parties.
 Although debate and the airing of issues of national concern increased in the Na-
 tional Assembly during the year, the Assembly with its FRELIMO majority did not
 provide any significant check on the power of the executive branch. The executive
 continued to gain parliamentary approval on even the most controversial issues,
 such as the composition of the newly created National Defense Council.
 The President and the FRELIMO leadership continued to control policymaking
 and implementation, and all cabinet positions and provincial governorships went to
 FRELIMO party members, even in provinces where RENAMO had won overwhelm-
 ing majorities in the 1994 elections. The Government's strategy appeared increas-
 ingly to be to use its patronage and power to build support in areas that supported
 RENAMO during the 1994 elections. RENAMO parliamentarians complained of a
 lack of support from provincial and district officials during visits to their constitu-
 encies. Working relationships between the parties at the national and local level ap-
 peared to improve, however, as the year wore on.

 Although FRELIMO administrators in some areas continued to accuse RENAMO
 officials of running parallel governmental structures and harassing central govern-
 ment appointed officials, by year's end these allegations diminished as the Govern-
 ment began to operate more freely in RENAMO-dominated areas.
 Momentum behind local elections grew throughout the latter part of 1996 cul-
 minating in the National Assembly's approval of-the Municipalities Law in Decem-
 ber. Local elections were expected to take place in late 1997 in several dozen local-
 ities covering a signifcant proportion of the population. RENAMO officials, who had
 previously resisted the concept of gradualism in local elections, by year's end had
 accepted this phased approach to the polls.
 While there are no legal restrictions hindering women's involvement in govern-
 ment, cultural factors have inhibited their political advancement. Nonetheless, 62
 of the 250 (28 percent) National Assembly deputies are women, even though these
 female deputies are not beieved to p lay a significant role in either the Parliament's
 or the individual parties' decisionmalting processes. One women serves as a minister
 and five as vice ministers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no legal obstacles to the formation of local human rights groups. The
 Mozambican League of Human Rights has focused efforts on educating the public
 regarding its rights. It uncovered many of the grave abuses within the prison sys-
 tem. The Government has permitted the League access to Maputo and Nampula
 prisons under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. The League has also pub-
 licly criticized widespread abusive behavior by the police and the Minister of Inte-
 rior himself. In May a new group, the Mozambican Human Rights Association, was
 formed with a primary mission of human rights education. In late December, a third
 group, Human Rights and Discovery, was formed with stated aims of promoting,
 protecting, and developing human rights.
 The Government has been receptive to visits by international human rights mon-
 itoring groups, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and the
 International Commission of Jurists.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution forbids discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or disability,
 but the Government does not ensure in practice that such discrimination does not
 occur.
 Women.-Although official statistics are not kept, according to health officials,
 women's groups, and other sources violence against women-particularly wife beat-
 ing and rape-is widespread, especially in rural areas. Many women believe that
 their spouses have the right to eat them, and cultural pressures make it highly
 unlikely for most women to press for legal action against abusive spouses. While
 rape can theoretically be prosecuted in the courts, no civil laws exist whereby do-
 mestic violence is specifically considered a crime. The police do not normally inter-
 vene in domestic disputes, and cases are rarely brought before the courts. When vic-
 tims of physical abuse are brought to the hospital, such cases are rarely registered
 as caused by domestic violence.
 Nevertheless, an increasing number of women's groups have been calling for a re-
 vision in the Penal Code to include provisions for prosecuting such violence, docu-
 menting cases of domestic violence, and encouraging victims of domestic and sexual
 violence to press charges. In July the President described domestic violence against
 women as a violation of human rights and an obstacle to social harmony. The Presi-
 dent stated that the Government is committed to fighting against domestic violence
 and called for the establishment of hostels for the victims of domestic violence. A
 group of NGO's active in the women's rights area established the Kulaya Center for
 Victims of Domestic Violence in midyear. The Center, which operates out of the
 Maputo central hospital, currently has approximately 15 beds and relies on foreign
 funding.
 Despite constitutional protections providing for the equality of men and women
 under law in all aspects of political, economic, social, and cultural life, civil and com-
 mercial legal codes that predate independence frequently contradict each other and
 the Constitution. Under the Law of the Family (through both court interpretation
 and precedent), the husband (or father) is the head of the household, and women
 (both wives and daughters), must ensure male approval of any and all undertakings
 that women assume. For example, in order to start a business, a woman must first
 have the written approval of her husband or father (or closest male relative). With-
 out this approval, a woman is unable to lease a building, obtain a loan, or contract
 
 
 for goods and services. The legal domicile of a married woman is her husband's
 house, and she may only work outside the home with the express consent of her
 husband.
 Family law also dictates that a couple's possessions belong to the husband, and
 he has full authority to decide on the disposition of these goods. Upon the death
 of a husband, a widow is only fourth in line (after sons, fathers, and brothers) for
 inheritance of the household goods. Although the law states that the widow is enti-
 tled to half of the goods acquired during the marriage, in practice women rarely
 know of or insist upon this right.
 Several women's groups have argued that the Constitution discriminates against
 women because it only grants Mozambican citizenship to the foreign wife of a
 Mozambican male, but not to the foreign-born spouse of a Mozambican woman.
 Customary law or traditional law offers women even fewer protections than family
 law. Unless a marriage is registered, a woman has no recourse to the judicial
 branch for enforcement of the few rights provided to women by the civil codes. Al-
 though women are the primary cultivator of family land in rural areas, under cus-
 tomary law they have no rights to the disposition of the land. Generally, land tenure
 is passed on through male relatives, not female ones.
 Women also experience economic discrimination in practice and sexual harass-
 ment in the workplace. The Organization of Mozambican Workers (OTM) reported
 in March that women are the principal victims of retrenchments due to economic
 restructuring and are often fired under the pretext of low productivity. Women are
 rarely given the same opportunities for technical training as men. According to the
 Secretary General of the National Union of Agricultural and Forestry Workers, fe-
 male workers were fired from their jobs for not allowing sexual advances. In April
 another trade union, the National Union of Road Transport and Technical Assist-
 ance Workers, alleged that women experience sexual assault, are overworked, and
 work in conditions lacking basic santation and bodily protection. In March the
 Chemical Workers' Union accused company managers of sexually harassing female
 workers. In May the Mozambican Association of Demobilized Soldiers noted that de-
 mobilized female soldiers from both government and RENAMO forces were still fac-
 ing discrimination in the reintegration process. The demobilized female soldiers
 claimed, for example, that the majority of microenterprise projects benefited demobi-
 lized males.
 Women have less access than men to educational institutions above the primary
 level. Although roughly equal proportions of male and female children enter primary
 school, by secondary school males greatly outnumber females. Discrimination
 against women is most apparent in rural areas where over 80 percent of the popu-
 lation live, and where women are engaged mainly in subsistence farming and child
 rearing, with little opportunity for schoolin or access to health care.
 Foro Mulher, an umbrella for women's N GO groups, has approximately 21 reg-
 istered members. These women's NGO's have become increasingly active over the
 last year in their efforts to highlight a variety of women's issues, including domestic
 violence, legal inequities, and economic empowerment. Funded through a host of dif-
 ferent means, some of these NGO's provide basic legal advice for women, others con-
 duct training seminars, and still others lobby for changes in governmental legisla-
 tion. Although these groups have organized successful programs, their effectiveness
 is often limited because the programs are concentrated in Maputo or other urban
 areas while the vast majority of women live in the rural zones.
 Children.-The Government has not made children's rights and welfare a priority
 but is making some efforts to deal with a corrupt and overcrowded educational sys-
 tm. It is widely reported that school children (or their parents) must bribe teachers
 for passing grades. TReportedly about 60 percent of the country's children now attend
 school.
 The Government has also made little attempt to alleviate the plight of the in-
 creasing numbers of urban street children, many of whom were orphaned by the
 war. In March Minister of Health, Dr. Aurelio Zilhao reported that 300,000 children,
 traumatized by the war, orphaned, and abandoned, require social reintegration.
 Street children are beaten by police and are often victims of sexual abuse. In Janu-
 ary a press article reported that police in Maputo imprisoned a 15-year-old child for
 9 days with no recourse to justice for allegedly stealing a tape cassette. The same
 minor was then allegedly given 12 lashes by the police before being released. In Feb-
 ruary a parliamentary deputy discovered five street children detained in a
 Montepuez, Cabo Delgado prison.
 People With          it           the Constitution expressly states that dis-
 abled citizens shall enjoy fully the rights enshrined in the Constitution," the Gov-
 ernment provided few resources to make this a reality. It has relied on NGO's to
 assist the disabled. Founded in 1991, the Association of Mozambican Disabled
 
 
 196
 (ADEMO) addresses the social and economic needs of the disabled. Since then
 smaller NGO's have formed, such as the Association of Handicapped Military and
 Paramilitary Mozambicans (ADEMINO), which represents disabled demobilized sol-
 diers, and the Association of Blind and Visually Impaired Mozambicans. Although
 poorly funded, these groups provide training, raise public awareness of the need to
 integrate the disabled into society, and lobby the Ministry of Labor to initiate legis-
 lation to support the working rights of the disabled. In May ADEMIMO charged
 that the Government had not yet authorized medical pensions for disabled soldiers.
 Also in May the press reported that more than 9,000 disabled former military per-
 sonnel in Sofala province were living in dire conditions due to the Ministry of Plan-
 ning and Finance s refusal to institute disability pensions.
 The only provisions that the Government has enacted for accessibility to buildings
 and transportation for the disabled were in the electoral law governing the countrs
 first multiparty elections, which addressed the needs of disabled voters in the poll-
 ing booths. No special access facilities exist.
 National/Raclal/Ethnic Minorities.-There was no systematic persecution or dis-
 crimination on the basis of race or ethnicity, although the FRELIMO Government
 has traditionally included at all levels a disproportionate number of southerners,
 mostly from the Shangaan ethnic group. However, the Government took some steps
 to address this imbalance by appointing provincial governors native to their respec-
 tive provinces. The Government also included more nonsoutherners in the
 FRELOpariamentry delegation.
 RENAMO leadership is predominately from the Shona ethnicgrup. There is no
 indication that the conflict between the Government and RENAMO was primarily
 motivated by ethnicity, although ethnic and regional factors may have played some
 role and explain some of the civil war violence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies that all workers are free
 to join or refrain from joining a trade union. The 1991 Labor Law further protects
 workers' right to organize and to engage in union activity at their place of employ-
 ment. The legislation gave existing unions the right to register independently from
 the Organization of Mozambican Workers (OTM).
 Until 1992 the only trade union federation in Mozambique was the OTM, which
 was affiliated with the FRELIMO party, and from its inception FRELIMO domi-
 nated the union. Its leadership was dictated by FRELIMO. With the passage of the
 1991 legislation, three unions broke away from OTM in 1992, and by 1994 had
 formed their own central union, the Free and Independent Union of Mozambique
 (SLIM). SLIM maintains a working relationship with the OTM. The OTM claims al-
 most 67 percent worker affiliation within its constituent unions, and SLIM claims
 60 percent worker affiliation.
 At its third National Congress in May 1994, the OTM declared itself free of com-
 mitments to anypolitical party, company, or religious group, and ruled that its
 members affiliate  with any political party would not be eligible to hold elected of-
 fices. However, independent unions continue to charge that the OTM lacks sufficient
 independence from the Government.
 The Constitution explicitly provides for the right to strike, with the exception of
 government employees, police, military personnel, and employees engaged in other
 essential services (which include sanitation, firefighting, air traffic control, health
 care, water, electricity, fuel, post office, and telecommunications). Throughout the
 year there were sporadic strikes at a variety of companies throughout the country,
 where workers' demands usually centered around the issues of salaries in arrears
 or increases in wage levels. In August workers of a fishing company in Nampula
 province went on strike, demanding an increase in their minimum wage of $19 per
 month (the national minimum wage is $22.50 per month).
 The 1991 Labor Law forbids retribution against strikers, the hiring of substitute
 workers, and lockouts by employers. There were no known instances of employer
 retribution against striking workers. Specific labor disputes are generally arbitrated
 through ad hoc workers' commissions, formally recognized by the Government. In
 May an ad hoc workers' commission at one company met with the employer to dis-
 cuss striking workers' allegations that officials of the company verbally and phys-
 ically abused workers.
 The Constitution and labor legislation give unions the right to join and participate
 in international bodies. The OTMI is a member of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and the Southern African Trade Union Coordinating Council.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colectiuely.-The Labor Law protects the
 right of workers to organize and to engage in collective bargaining. The Government
 has become less involved in the bargaining process despite the large number of
 
 
 state-owned enterprises. In late 1991 the Government decreed that it would no
 longer set all salary levels and left negotiations for wage increases in the hands of
 existing unions. The Social Pact Committee, which involves the Government, the
 OTM, the SLIM, the teachers' and journalists' unions, and employers' associations
 is important in resolving labor-management issues. This Committee negotiated a re-
 vision of the minimum wage in May. In April the Minister of Labor agreed to sub-
 mit any proposed change to the Labor Law to the committee for review.
 The Labor Law expressly prohibits discrimination against organized labor, al-
 though antiunion discrimination has not been as issue because, until recently,
 unions were government-controlled organizations.
 While Mozambique has enacted legislation for the establishment of export proc-
 essing zones, no zones have been created.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and there have been no reports of such labor practices.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor is regulated by the
 Ministry of Labor. In the wage economy, the minimum working age is 16 years. Be-
 cause of high adult unemployment, estimated at around 50 percent, few children are
 employed in regular wage positions. However, children of ounger ages commonly
 work on family farms or in the urban informal sector, where they perform such
 tasks as guarding cars, collecting scrap metal, or selling trinkets andfood in the
 streets.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets minimum wage rates ad-
 ministratively. The minimum wag t  e enacted in May was approximately $22.50
 (271,126 meticais) per month. It is estimated that a salary of about $62.00 (700,000
 meticais) per month is needed in order to provide a decent standard of living for
 a worker and family. As the minimum wage is not considered sufficient to sustain
 an average urban worker and family, many workers must turn to a second job, if
 available, as well as work garden plots to survive.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing the minimum rates in the pri-
 vate sector, and the Ministry of Finance is responsible in the public sector. Viola-
 tions of minimum wage rates are usually investigated only after workers register
 a complaint. It is customary for workers to receive additional benefits such as trans-
 portation and food.
 The standard legal workweek is 44 hours, with a weekly 24-hour rest period stip-
 ulated. In the small modern sector, the Government has enacted health and envi-
 ronmental laws to protect workers. However, the Ministry of Labor enforces these
 laws ineffectively, and the Government has only occasionally closed fin-ms for non-
 compliance. A report issued in July indicated that violations of health and safety
 norms and regulations in 1995 caused 524 accidents in the building, timber, and
 mining sectors alone. Workers have the right to remove themselves from work situa-
 tions that endanger their health or safety without jeopardy to their continued em-
 ployment.
