 BELIZE
 Belize achieved independence on September 21, 1981, following
 seventeen years as an internally self-governing British
 colony. Belize has a parliamentary form of government with a
 competitive political party system and regular local and
 national elections. The People's United Party (PUP) was the
 dominant political force since it emerged to lead the movement
 for self-government and independence in the early 1950's. It
 controlled the national government from the time of internal
 self-government in 1964 until the first post-independence
 national elections in December 1984. In the December 14, 1984
 national parliamentary election, however, the United
 Democratic Party (UDP) defeated the PUP, winning 54 percent of
 the popular vote and capturing 21 of the 28 seats in the House
 of Representatives. The election was peaceful, open, and
 honest. In addition, the UDP currently controls four of the
 eight municipal councils in Belize, including the Belize City
 Council.
 The security apparatus consists of the Belize National Police
 and the Belize Defense Force (BDF). The National Police
 comprises approximately 600 men and women and has the
 principal responsibility for law enforcement and maintenance
 of order. The BDF consists of 800 active personnel and
 reservists, with both men and women serving. Although
 internal security is not the principal mission of the BDF, it
 occasionally assists in police activities. During 1984, BDF
 personnel conducted a number of joint operations with police
 to destroy marijuana fields and seize marijuana processing
 equipment.
 The economy returned to positive growth in 1983-84,
 registering an increase in the GDP of one to two percent, but
 continues to suffer the effects of low world prices for sugar,
 which accounts for approximately 60 percent of Belize's
 foreign exchange earnings, and from the sharp reduction in the
 re-export trade to Mexico caused by the decline of the Mexican
 peso. Public sector finances came under substantial pressure
 in 1983-84 mainly due to declining revenues from the slack
 economy. The Government continues to pursue the goal of a
 mixed economy, encouraging private sector development and
 foreign investment, particularly for export production.
 Human rights continued to be respected in Belize in 1984.
 Constitutional protections for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual are upheld by an independent
 judiciary and an equitable justice system. A free press and
 competitive electoral politics also serve to protect civil and
 political rights. There were no cases of political violence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Unlawful or arbitrary deprivation of life and politically
 motivated killings were not reported in Belize during 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in Belize during 1984.
 
 
 425
 BELIZE
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment is prohibited by the Belizean Constitution and
 does not in practice take place.
 Although penalties for possession and trafficking in illicit
 drugs were stiffened in 1984, sentences for these and other
 crimes are generally lenient compared to sentences imposed for
 similar crimes elsewhere in the region. The Government
 recognizes that prison facilities and prison service staff
 need upgrading, but continuing public sector financial
 constraints limit its ability to make these improvements.
 While prisons continue to be crowded, prisoners are adequately
 fed and have comparatively generous social and recreational
 privileges. Press reports of alleged police brutality
 involving rough handling of suspects declined during 1984.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary imprisonment and
 guarantees the right of habeas corpus. A person is entitled
 to be informed within 48 hours of arrest of the reason for the
 detention and to be brought before a court within 72 hours.
 Release on bail is allowed for all but the most serious,
 violent criminal offenses. These procedural safeguards are
 routinely observed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution specifically guarantees due process and the
 rights of accused persons: presumption of innocence,
 privilege against self-incrimination, right to counsel, and
 public trial. Trial by jury is mandatory in criminal cases.
 Protection for the integrity of the person in law corresponds
 to the actual practice of the courts. The judiciary is
 independent of the executive and is regarded as an effective
 guarantor of an equitable judicial system. There are no
 political prisoners in Belize.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the protection of family life,
 personal property, the privacy of the home, and recognition of
 human dignity. No violations of these guarantees have been
 reported during the past year.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The freedom of speech and press are guaranteed in the
 Constitution and respected in practice. The Government
 controls Belize's only radio station, but a wide range of
 political opinion is represented in the country's press. The
 opposition and independent newspapers are frequently critical
 of the Government. There are seven privately owned and
 operated television stations in Belize. A new broadcasting
 law was enacted in 1983, and the Government moved to implement
 it the following year by appointing a six-member board, the
 Belize Broadcasting Authority. The Authority has begun the
 process of licensing existing stations, but it has not acted
 to impair the freedom of television broadcasting.

 BELIZE
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly and
 association and the right to form and belong to trade unions
 are respected in practice. Permits are required to hold
 public meetings, but such permits are routinely granted.
 There are eight independent labor unions representing
 approximately fifteen percent of the labor force. The
 National Trade Union Congress of Belize is affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions through
 membership in tne Caribbean Congress of Labor. Belizean
 unions engage in the full range of union activities. Labor
 disputes are normally settled through arbitration; the Labor
 Commissioner or joint labor-management panels serve as
 mediators. The Government has been expanding its contacts
 with the International Labor Organization (ILO) and is
 preparing for Belizean representation at the ILO, possibly in
 1985.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. More than fifteen Christian
 denominations and a few non-Christian denominations worship
 freely. The vast majority of Belize's primary and secondary
 schools are operated by churches. Church leaders have long
 had close ties to the political establishment, and churches
 play an active role in the tasks of social and national
 development.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Belize or on
 foreign travel and emigration. Emigration is principally
 motivated by economic reasons and not by political or human
 rights considerations, and emigrants frequently return for
 family visits. Aliens convicted of crimes, particularly drug
 offenses or entry into Belize without proper documentation,
 are usually deported.
 Belize continues to attract displaced persons and immigrants
 from other Central American countries. In 1984, the
 Government moved to regularize the status of aliens who had
 entered Belize and were residing there without proper
 permits. Tne Government decreed a ninety-day amnesty period
 (May 2 to July 31) during which illegal aliens were required
 to register with the police and immigration authorities. A
 total of 8,558 aliens registered. None was subject to arrest,
 prosecution, or deportation for being in Belize illegally.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Following the general election of December 1984, Belize
 experienced a peaceful transfer of national governmental power
 from the PUP to the UDP. Although the ruling party's
 parliamentary majority gives it broad freedom to decide
 government policy, its exercise of political power is limited
 by public opinion, a free press, an independent judiciary, and
 genuinely competitive electoral politics. Political
 participation is broadly based. All citizens over 18 are
 eligible to vote and both the PUP and the UDP engage in voter
 registration campaigns. All ethnic groups in the population
 are represented in both major parties. In addition, there are
 
 
 427
 BELIZE
 two small parties in Belize, the Christian Democratic Party
 whose activities are centered in the Dangriga-Stann Creek
 area, and the Toledo Progressive Party in Punta Gorda.
 Participation in local and national elections is traditionally
 high in Belize; approximately 90 percent of the electorate
 voted in the general election in 1979 and 74 percent voted in
 the 1984 election.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international entities have asked to investigate the human
 rights situation in Belize. A private human rights council
 and a branch of Amnesty International exist in Belize. Given
 the favorable human rights environment, the activities of
 these two organizations have been very limited. Freedom House
 was the only outside organization to report on the human
 rights situation in Belize in 1984; its report rated Belize
 "free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population grew to 158,000 inhabitants in 1984. The rate
 of population growth remains stable at 2.3 percent for 1984
 due to large-scale emigration. Life expectancy at birth is
 over 65 years, while the infant mortality rate is 54.9 per
 thousand live births. According to the latest World Bank
 figures available, per capita gross national product was
 $1,083 in 1982. Real income remained basically unchanged from
 the previous year; unemployment (14.2 percent) and
 underemployment also remained at 1983 levels. The adult
 literacy rate is 91.2 percent and 80 percent of the population
 has access to safe water (both figures are 1970 World Bank
 estimates). The ratio of caloric supply available for
 consumption to nutritional requirements was 111 percent in
 1977.   The health care system is not able to provide basic
 health care for all Belizeans.
 Women in Belize are faced with discrimination rooted in
 cultural, social, and economic structures. There is no
 official policy of discrimination, however, and the Government
 seeks the participation of women in the nation's political and
 developmental process. Belizean women are active in unions,
 political parties, private voluntary organizations, and
 churches. They are prominent in local and national government
 and well represented in the professions. The Governor
 General, who represents the British monarch in Belize, is a
 woman. Women also hold officer and enlisted positions in the
 police and the BDF.
