 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal
 structure. Legislative power is vested in a bicameral
 parliament. Given the nation'i linguistic and religious
 diversity, the Swiss political system emphasizes local and
 national political consensus and grants considerable autonomy
 to individual cantons.
 The Swiss aried forces are a militia based on universal
 military service for able-bodied males. There is virtually no
 standing army apart from training cadres and & few essential
 headquarters staff functions. Police duties are primarily a
 responsibility- of the individual cantons, which have their olin-
 distinct police forces. The National Police Authority has a
 coordinating role and relies on the cantons for actual law
 enforcement.
 Switzerland has a free enterprise industrial and service
 economy highly dependent on- international trade. There has
 been virtual full employment and labor peace for many years.
 The standard of living is one of the highest in the world.
 The only known human rights problem during 1990 was the
 Government's alleged-excesses in monitoring the activities of
 Swiss citizens. Switzerland maintained its own strong
 association with human rights issues, exemplified by hosting
 the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The headquarters
 of the International Labor Organization and the International
 Committee of the. Red Cross are located in Switzerland.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing-
 There were no political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abductions, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution provides freedom from all of the above-, and
 there were no allegations of any violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile is provided
 by law. A detained person may not be held longer than 24
 hours without a warrant of arrest issued by the magistrate
 conducting the preliminary investigation. A suspect must
 immediately be shown the warrant and has the right to contact
 legal counsel as soon as a warrant is issued. A suspect may
 be detained with a warrant until an investigation is completed
 but the length of investigative detention is always reviewed
 by higher judicial authority, and investigations are typically
 completed quickly. Release on personal recognizance or bail
 is granted unless the examining magistrate believes the person
 is a danger to society or- will not appear for trial.

 SWITZERLAND
 There is no summary exile, nor is exile used as a means of
 political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials. All courts of
 first instance are cantonal courts, with right of appeal to
 the federal courts and freedom from interference by other
 branches of government. Minor cases are tried by a single
 judge, difficult cases by a panel of judges, and murder or
 other serious crimes by a public jury. Even the most serious
 cases are usually brought to trial within a few months. There
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, ome, or
 Correspondence
 Police entry into the premises of a person suspected of a
 criminal offense is regulatec by cantonal legislation.
 Regulations differ widely among the cantons.
 Allegations of a certain kind of government invasion of
 privacy became a significant political issue in 1990. A
 parliamentary investigation revealed that judicial and police
 authorities held extensive files on Swiss citizens, some of
 whom were apparently suspected of activities damaging to
 national security. It was also revealed that the Military
 Department kept files. While many of these files were not
 being kept up to date, the revelation provoked intense public
 attention and demands by citizens to see their files. The
 Government established a procedure-so that citizens could view
 an extract (fiche) of their files and appointed special
 officials for this purpose. This procedure was in effect
 throughout 1990. The episode sparked consideration of new
 guidelines to ensure privacy as well as access to government
 files on private citizens.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 An independent press, effective judiciary, and democratic
 politicpl system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press.
 Groups or associations determined to be a potential threat to
 the State may have restrictions placed on their freedom of
 speech and press. No groups are restricted at the present
 time. Broadcast media are government funded but possess
 editorial autonomy, and foreign broadcast media are freely
 available. Press and publishing are private enterprises
 operated without government intervention. Academic freedom is
 respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only restriction on peaceful assembly and association is a
 requirement to obtain permits from police authorities before
 holding public meetings. These are routinely granted unless
 authorities have reason to believe the meeting will lead to
 violence.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Switzerland enjoys religious freedom. There is no single
 state church, but individual cantons may support a particular
 church out of public funds, and most cantons do so. Foreign
 
 
 1283
 SWITZERLAND
 clergy are free to perform their duties in Switzerland. The
 legal requirement for universal male military service provides
 no exemption for conscientious objectors. They may apply for
 military service that does not entail bearing arms, but
 refusal to serve has in the past nearly always led to
 prosecution and conviction. Parliament in 1990 approved a
 government bill which, while maintaining that refusal to serve
 was a punishable offense, allows courts to sentence
 conscientious objectors to a period of community service
 instead of prison.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration,-and Repatriation
 Swiss citizens have freedom to travel in or outside the
 country and can emigrate without difficulty. Switzerland has
 traditionally been a haven for refugees, but public concern
 over the growing number of asylum seekers, many of whom come
 for economic reasons, led to revision of the asylum law. The
 revision provides swifter processing of asylum seekers, makes
 Switzerland a less attractive destination for economic
 migrants, and facilitates expulsion of those whose applications
 are rejected. Asylum seekers continue to receive orderly
 consideration, and those whose applications are rejected are
 allowed to stay temporarily if their home country is torn by
 war or insurrection. This is the case with many Lebanese and
 Sri Lankans.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Switzerland is a highly developed constitutional democracy.
 There is universal adult suffrage by secret ballot in federal
 elections. Elections are free and contested actively by four
 major national parties and at least a dozen significant
 regional or minor parties. Initiative and referendum
 procedures provide unusually intense popular involvement in
 the legislative process. Participation by women in politics
 has been limited historically but continues to expand slowly.
 The last restrictions on female suffrage were eliminated in
 1990 when the Supreme Court ruled that henceforth women must
 be permitted to vote in the cantonal and municipal elections
 of Appenzell-Innerrhoden canton.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Switzerland cooperates with international and nongovernmental
 groups in all areas of human rights. All major international
 human rights groups are active in Switzerland, and some of the
 leading ones--e.g., the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)--are
 based there. The ICRC is made up of Swiss nationals, and
 Swiss play prominent roles in other humanitarian
 nongovernmental organizations. Human rights advocacy groups
 in Switzerland concern themselves almost exclusively with
 lobbying the Swiss and other governments about human rights
 situations in other countries.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Lahguage, or- Social Status
 Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination against
 women in the workplace, government and other sources noted
 
 
 1284
 SWITZERLAND
 that further implementation was necessary to ensure equal pay
 and other benefits for women. A special government office of
 equal rights for men and women addresses this problem. A
 Federal Commission for Women's Rights and several private
 groups, e.g., the Federation of Women's Organizations, monitor
 and promote women's rights. Discrimination that persists
 today is social, not legal, but it nevertheless hinders
 opportunities for women in fields that traditionally have been
 dominated by men.
 Swiss policymakers have become aware in recent years of the
 issue of violence toward women. Observers believe that many
 cases go unreported, so that accurate statistics are lacking."
 There is, however, widespread agreement that a problem
 exists. The Federation of Women's Organizations and other
 women's advocacy groups have heightened public consciousness
 about this issue. Each city has an emergency telephone number
 through which women who are victims of violence can cbtain
 help and counseling. Specialists work with police authorities
 to interview women who report attacks. Appropriate laws exist
 against wife beating and similar crimes, although there is
 some disagreement as to whether existing law adequately
 prohibits spousal rape. Parliament included discussion and
 possible action on this point as part of a review of the penal
 code. While the penal code is established at the federal
 level, enforcement is the responsibility of the cantons.
 Thus, variations in enforcement can occur.
 Italian and Romansch linguistic minorities (respectively about
 10 and 1 percent of the population) express concern that the
 limited resources made available to them by the Federal
 Government endanger the continued vitality of these languages.
 The Federal Government's policy is to ensure, through
 apportionment of funds, that all linguistic groups have
 facilities and means to carry out cultural activities in their
 own languages. The Government held consultations with cantons
 and other groups on possible revision of the constitutional
 article on languages, in part to strengthen protection for the
 minority languages. The revision would make explicit the
 responsibility of the Federation and the cantons to preserve
 the four national languages, especially the two (Italian and
 Romansch) that are least spoken in Switzerland. The Federation
 would support the cantons in their-own efforts to maintain
 usage of the minority languages
 Employment opportunities and residence permits are limited for
 foreigners; some assert that this reflects racial prejudice
 and discrimination, but these limitations apply to all
 non-Swiss. There is no discrimination on religious grounds.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers, including public sector workers and foreign
 workers in Switzerland, have freedom to associate freely, to
 join unions of their choice, and to select their own
 representatives. Unions are free to publicize their views and
 determine their own policies to represent member interests
 without government interference. Unions may join federations
 or international bodies. Swiss trade union federations belong
 to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
 the World Confederation of Labor, as well as to the European
 Trade Union Confederation. The right to strike is legally
 recognized, but a unique labor peace agreement between unions
 
 
 1285
 SWITZERLAND
 and employers in existence since the 1930's has resulted in
 fewer than 20 strikes per year since 1975.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Swiss law gives wbrkers the right to organize and bargain
 collectively and protects them from acts of antiunion
 discrimination. The industrial sector is generally unionized;
 in the service sector, union membership is less widespread.
 The Government encourages voluntary negotiations between
 employer and worker organizations, although for the most part
 employers and workers alike seek to exclude the Government
 from involving itself in their affairs. There are no export
 processing zones in Switzerland.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor. While there is no
 specific statute or constitutional ban on compulsory labor,
 legislation regulating conditions of employment and,
 specifically, the rights of a worker upon terminating
 employment make clear that compulsory labor would be illegal.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 15 years.
 Children over 13 may be employed in light duties (e.g.,
 helping in retail stores) for not more than 9 hours a week
 during the-school year and 15 hours otherwise. Employment
 between ages 15 and 20 is strictly regulated. For example,
 youths may not work at night, on Sundays, or under hazardous
 or dangerous-conditions. These laws are observed in practice
 and enforced through inspections by the Federal Office of
 Industry, Trades, and Labor-
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minifium wage. Employer associations and
 unions negotiate industrial wages during the collective
 bargaining process. The Labor Act establishes a maximum
 45-hour workweek for blue- and white-collar workers in
 industry, offices, and retail trades, and a 50-hour workweek
 for all other workers. The workweek for blue-collar workers
 in most industries is 43 hours and for white-collar workers
 from 40 to 43 hours. Overtime is limited by law to 120 hours
 annually. The economy is normally at or near full employment.
 The resulting take-home pay provides Swiss workers and their
 families with one of the highest standards of living in the
 world.
 The Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations contain
 extensive regulations to protect worker health and safety.
 The regulations are rigorously enforced by the Federal Office
 of Industry, Professions, and Labor, providing a high standard
 of worker health and safety. Female workers may not be
 employed in dangerous work, and women in industrial
 enterprises may not work at night or on Sundays. These
 special protections were under review in 1990; the Government
 proposed to eliminate restrictions against females working on
 Sundays or weekends in its effort to remove sexist bias from
 the labor law. There were no allegations of worker rights
 abuses from domestic or foreign sources.
