 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty political system and free
 elections. There is no constitution but a series of basic laws defines the responsibil-
 ities of government institutions. lrhe legislature (The Knesset) can limit the govern-
 ment and force its dissolution. Although Israel has an independent judiciary, the
 Supreme Court, with few exceptions, has sided with the Government on policy is-
 sues of land and security, especially in the occupied territories. Public debate on is-
 sues of concern to Israelis is open and lively. A vigorous free press scrutinizes all
 aspects of Israeli life and politics.
 Since Israel's founding in 1948, it has been in a formal state of war with most
 of its Arab neighbors, except Egypt, with which it concluded a peace treaty in 1979.
 As a result of the 1967 war Israel occupied the areas of the West Bank, the Gaza
 Strip, the eastern sector of Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. Throughout its exist-
 ence as a state, Israel experienced numerous terrorist incidents, within and outside
 its borders. Israel has relied heavily on its military and security services and has
 retained many security-related emergency regulations from the preindependence
 British mandate period.
 On September 13, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed
 an historic Declaration of Principles relating to a transfer of authority from Israel
 to an interim Palestinian authority. The Declaration lays out a timetable for Israeli
 withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho, scheduled to
 be completed in the first quarter of 1994. In addition, the Declaration calls for rede-
 ployment of Israeli security forces away from populated areas in the West Bank as
 early as July 1994, which is the target date for the election of a Palestinian council
 and for the dissolution thereafter of the Israeli military-backed Civilian Administra-
 tion (CIVAD), which has governed daily life in the occupied territories since 1981.
 Israel is to continue to control external security, internal security and public order
 in Israeli settlements, foreign relations, and certain other areas until an agreement
 on permanent status is achieved.
 Internal security is the responsibility of the General Security Service (Shin Bet),
 which is under the authority of the Prime Minister's office. The police are under the
 authority of a separate minister. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which include a
 significant portion of the Israeli adult population in either active duty or reserve
 status, also play a role in maintaining internal security. The IDF is under the au-
 thority of a civilian Minister of Defense. The Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense
 Committee reviews the activities of the IDF and the Shin Bet.
 Israel has a developed market economy. While there is substantial government
 regulation, intervention, and ownership in the economy, the Government is moving
 in the direction of reducing state involvement in it. Israel enjoys a relatively high
 standard of living.
 Positive human rights developments, in addition to the ramifications of the Sep-
 tember signing of the Israeli-PLO agreement (see report on the occupied territories),
 included the Knesset's action to eliminate restrictions placed upon membership in
 or contact with the PLO and court decisions that limited house demolition orders
 and expanded prisoner rights. Israeli citizens enjoy a wide range of civil and other
 rights. Israel's main human rights problems arise from its policies and practices in
 the occupied territories. In addition, while the Government's declared intention has
 been to close the social and economic gap between the Arab and Jewish sectors of
 the population within Israel, Israel's Arab citizens still do not share fully in the
 rights granted to, and the levies imposed on, Jewish citizens. However, in 1993 the
 Government began seriously to address imbalances in resource allocations to the
 Arab sector, especially in education and infrastructure development.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political killings in Israel are nei-
 ther practiced nor sanctioned by Israeli authorities. In the context of the extreme
 political tension between Israel and the Palestinians, intercommunal killings are
 often assumed to have political motivation. In 1993 authorities ascribed the murders
 of at least 16 Israelis in Israel to Arab nationalist motivations. In the wake of sev-
 eral killings and stabbings of Israelis by Palestinians from the occupied territories,
 the Government in March imposed a closure on the occupied territories, sealing off
 *Because the legal status and the political and human rights conditions of the West Bank,
 Gaza, and East Jerusalem differ sharply from those in Israel the situation in those territories
 is dealt with in a separate report following the report for Israel.
 
 
 1195
 indefinitely the West Bank and Gaza from Jerusalem and Israel. This action re-
 sulted in restrictions on the numbers of Palestinians able to work in Israel and trav-
 el to Jerusalem.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of government-condoned disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although Israeli laws and administrative regulations prohibit such practices, there
 are credible reports of abuses of Palestinian detainees. (See the occupied territories
 report for a discussion of mistreatment of prisoners from the occupiedterritories in-
 carcerated in detention facilities located in Israel.)
 Incarceration facilities in Israel and the occupied territories are operated by one
 of three authorities, the Israeli Prison Service (IPS), the national police, and the Is-
 rael Defense Forces. Although the conditions vary greatly among the facilities, all
 are monitored by various branches of the Israeli Government and members of the
 Knesset, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and many human rights or-
 ganizations which have access to the prisons, police jails, and IDFcamps. Generally,
 inmates are not subject to physical abuse by guards, food is adequate, and prisoners
 receive basic necessities. Security prisoners are subject to a different regime, even
 in IPS facilities, and as a class they are often denied certain privileges given to pris-
 oners convicted on criminal charges. In general, however, the most severe problem
 in all facilities is overcrowding, even among facilities run by the IPS.
 [PS prisons conform to general international standards which permit inmates to
 receive mail, have televisions in their cells, and receive regular visits. Prisoners can
 receive wages for prison work and benefits for good behavior. Many IPS prisons
 have religious and drug-free wards and educational and recreational programs.
 Police detention facilities are intended for short stays prior to trial, but due to
 chronic overcrowding and slow scheduling for court dates, police detention facilities
 can become de facto jails for several months. Inmates in these centers frequently
 are not accorded the same rights and living conditions as prisoners in the regular
 IPS facilities, and some of these can fall below generally accepted minimum inter-
 national standards. For example, the Abu Kabir police detention facility in Jaffa has
 approximately 562 inmates for 466 beds. Prisoners awaiting transfer can be con-
 imed for months under these conditions. One U.S. citizen has been confined in a
 cell with 11 prisoners and 8 beds. He was unable to bathe for over a week. Violence
 is common in the Abu Kabir facility with weapons made by prisoners from such
 items as bed legs, spoons, and pens. There were also reports of mixing juveniles
 with adults as well as pretrial offenders with convicted prisoners.
 Prison conditions in the IDF detention camps, which are limited to male Palestin-
 ian security prisoners and are guarded by armed soldiers, do not meet minimum
 international standards and threaten the health of the inmates. The camps use
 unheated outdoor tents even in severe weather conditions, mix minors andadult
 prisoners, restrict family visits, and contain minimal recreational facilities. Poor
 ealth care in Ketziot prison has resulted in a petition, filed before the High Court
 in September by a human rights organization composed of medical professionals, to
 close the camp unless medical conditions are improved. According to the Govern-
 ment, the petition concerning Ketziot, due to be heard at the end of the year, was
 postponed to March 1994.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Israeli law and practice prohibit arbi-
 trary arrest or imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other procedural and sub-
 stantive safeguards are available. Defendants are considered innocent until proven
 guilty. However, administrative detention with no formal charge or trial is per-
 mitted under a 1979 law. The Minister of Defense may issue a detention order for
 a maximum of 6 months. Within 48 hours of issuance of such an order, a detainee
 must be brought before a district judge. The process of review to confirm, shorten,
 or overturn a detention order must be carried out as quickly as possible and if the
 order is confirmed, an automatic review must take place after 3 months. Adminis-
 trative detention orders are renewable. The detainee may be represented by counsel
 and may appeal to the Supreme Court. The Government may withhold evidence
 from the detainee and counsel on security grounds. According to the Ministry of Jus-
 tice, no Israeli citizens were held in administrative detention in 1993. Israel contin-
 ued to hold most Palestinian administrative detainees from the occupied territories
 in detention centers inside Israel. The transfer of prisoners from the occupied terri-
 tories to Israel contravenes Article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. (For a full
 discussion of administrative detention, see the separate report on the occupied terri-
 tories.)
 A judge of a district court may, in cases involving a felony, permit the postpone-
 ment of notification of an attorney of the arrested person. This period normally can-
 not exceed 48 hours. It may, however, be extended for a total of 7 days when
 theMinister of Defense has certified in writing that national security requires the
 
 
 1196
 arrest to be kept secret or if the Inspector General of Police certifies in writing that
 secrecy is required in the interest of the investigation. The law also allows an exten-
 sion of up to 15 days in cases involving certain security offenses, such as espionage.
 The whereabouts of 10 Lebanese detainees is not known, according to human
 rights groups. The Government of Israel acknowledges holding the 10, but the dis-
 position of their cases, as well as those of 12 Lebanese prisoners who have served
 their sentences, ape     to be linked to Israeli efforts to obtain definitive informa-
 tion on the fate of Israeli prisoners of war and others missing in action in Lebanon.
 Israel does not exile its citizens. (See the separate report on the occupied terri-
 tories for discussion of deportations).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There are both civil and military courts in the ju-
 dicial system. There are also religious courts, labor relations courts, and other ad-
 ministrative tribunals. Although the judiciary is independent, the Israeli Supreme
 Court has, with rare exceptions, sided with the Government on policy issues of land
 and security, especially in the occupied territories. According to human rights law-
 yers, in the few instances the court has ruled in favor of individuals it has been
 on procedural grounds. The right to a hearing by an impartial tribunal with rep-
 resentation by counsel is guaranteed by law and observed in practice. All
 nonsecurity trials are open except for those in which the interests of parties are
 deemed best served by privacy. Security cases may be tried before a military court
 or a civil court and may be partly or wholly closed to the public. The Attorney Gen-
 eral determines whether a security case is tried before a military or civil court.
 The prosecution must justify nonpublic proceedings. Defense counsel is present,
 even during closed proceedings, but may be denied access to some evidence on secu-
 rity grounds. In security cases in which access to some evidence is denied, that evi-
 dence may not be used to convict a defendant.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though privacy of the individual and the home are generally protected by law within
 Israel, interference with mail and the tapping of telephones are practiced in some
 cases. Israeli law permits wiretapping by court order in criminal cases; in security
 cases the order must be issued by the Ministry of Defense. Emergency regulations
 permit mail to be stopped, opened and even destroyed on security grounds.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.--(See the separate reports on the occupied territories and Lebanon for discus-
 sions of excessive use of force.)
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although individuals, organizations, the press,
 and the electronic media freely debate a wide range of public issues and criticize
 government officials and policies, emergency regulations authorize censorship and
 outlaw statements and written materials that express or encourage support for ille-
 gal organizations. Publications and domestic or foreign press articles dealing with
 security-related matters must be submitted to the military censor. Arabic-language
 publications and press are censored more strictly than Hebrew-langua e equiva-
 lents. In 1993 the Supreme Court rescinded a closure order against the Arabic-lan-
 guage newspaper With the People. The newspaper had been closed because its edi-
 tor was the former editor of another publication that had been closed for inciting
 its readers to action against the State and the IDF. No other Arabic-language news-
 papers were closed in 1993.
 The Government occasionally initiates prosecution for statements or writings on
 behalf of terrorist organizations; such action is almost always directed against Is-
 raeli Arabs. The Government asserts that at various times it has prosecuted Jewish
 individuals and groups for inflammatory statements and writings. No cases were
 filed against Jews in 1993, but investigations into statements made by members of
 the Kach and Kahane Chai, ultranationalist extremist organizations, are currently
 under way. In 1992 the poet Shafiq Habib received a suspended sentence carrying
 a stipulation that he not engage again in the type of activity of which he was ac-
 cused and a 3-year probationary period as well as a fine for violating the 1949
 Antiterror Act which bans the publication of statements praising, supporting, or en-
 couraging any acts of violence that could lead to personal injury or death. Habib
 had published poems in 1990 which, according to government officials praised the
 revolutionary aspect of the Intifada. In 1993 Habib was acquitted of these charges
 by a district court on appeal, and the High Court has refused to review the case.
 All newspapers are privately owned and managed. Newspaperlicenses are valid
 only for Israel; to distribute publications inside the occupied territories, separate li-
 censes are required. The quasi-independent Israel Broadcast Authority, whose direc-
 tor is a pointed by the Government, retains significant control over electronic
 media. There are now six cable companies operating in Israel under franchises
 
 
 1197
 granted by cable councils whose members are appointed by the Government. Three
 companies were awarded franchises in 1993 to start a second television channel
 which has brought commercial television to Israel for the first time.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law and court rulings pro-
 tect the rights of Israelis to assemble and associate. In 1993 the Knesset repealed
 the 1986 amendment to the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance under which Israelis
 were prohibited from membership in, or contact with, outlawed organizations, pri-
 marily the Palestine Liberation Organization, its subdivisions, or its individual
 members.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Israeli law provides strong guarantees of freedom for all
 faiths. Approximately 82 percent of Israeli citizens are Jewish. Muslims, Christians,
 and Druze, and members of other minority religions make up the remaining 18 per-
 cent. Each recognized religious community in Israel has legal authority over its
 members in matters of marriage and divorce. Secular courts have primacy over
 questions of inheritance, but parties, by mutual agreement, may bring the case to
 religious courts. Orthodox religious authorities have exclusive control over marriage,
 divorce, and burial in all sectors of the Jewish community, whether or not they are
 Orthodox.
 Missionaries are allowed to work in Israel. According to the Justice Ministry, the
 Government has not applied a 1977 antiproselytizing law, prohibiting the offering
 and receipt of material benefits as an inducement to conversion, against any individ-
 uals or organizations for several years.
 Travel to visit religious sites or perform religious obligations in and outside Israeli
 is widely permitted. (See separate report on the occupied territories on denial of
 rights of Muslim and Christian Palestinians to worship at holy places.) In 1993 Is-
 rael approved the pilgrimage to Mecca (for both the haij and the umra) of over 4,000
 Israeli  uslims. However, for security reasons, the Government forbids participa-
 tion in the hajj by males under 30 years of age. The Government asserts that travel
 to Saudi Arabia, a country formally still in a state of war with Israel, is a privilege
 and not a right for Israeli Muslims. In 1993 the Government welcomed the visit of
 192 Libyan pilgrims to Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Israeli citizens may move freely within Israel except in military or secu-
 rity zones or in cases where they may be confined to their neighborhood or village
 by administrative order under emergency regulations. Israeli citizens are free to
 travel abroad and to emigrate, provided they have no outstanding military obliga-
 tions or are not restrictedby administrative order.
 Israel welcomes Jewish immigrants and family members, including Jewish refu-
 gees, to whom it gives automatic citizenship and residence rights under the Law of
 Return. It accepts the return of Jewish Israeli citizens who have emigrated. The
 Law of Return does not apply to Israeli Arabs or to persons of Jewish descent who
 have converted to another faith. Under the principle of family reunification, Israel
 has allowed the return of a few Arab refugees who fled Israel in 1948-1949 (the
 Government claims that 100,000 Arabs were allowed to return to Israel after the
 1949 armistice agreement) but has rejected the great majority of requests by such
 refugees to return. Israel offered temporary haven to 100 Bosnian Muslims, victims
 of the civil strife in their country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Israeli citizens have the right and ability to change their government peacefully.
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, with a multitude of parties representing a wide
 range of political views. Relatively small parties, including those whose primary
 support is among Israeli Arabs, regularly win seats in the K-nesset. All adult Israeli
 citizens have the right to participate in the political process and to vote by secret
 ballot. According to official figures, 77.4 percent of Israeli citizens over the age of
 18 voted in the 1992 parliamentary elections.
 Two women serve as Cabinet ministers, and there are 11 women in the Knesset.
 Two Arab Israelis serve as deputy ministers in the current Cabinet. There are 6
 Arab members (and 2 Druze members) in the 120-member Knesset.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Private Israeli orfanizations are active in publicizing and litigating human rights
 issues and cases. srael is generally responsive to international and nongovern-
 mental interest in its human rights situation and treats seriously responsible chal-
 lenges to its human rights practices.
 
 
 1198
 Human rights groups may litigate general questions of law or go before the courts
 on clients' behalf. Israel permits reo.lar visits by a wide range of private and inter-
 national organizations concerned with human rights such as Amnesty International
 (A), Middle East Watch, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rig.ts, the Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO), and others. It hosts and works with a delegation
 of the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC).
 The Justice Ministry has a human rights office which responds to human rights
 inquiries, and the Government has designated specific points of contact within the
 Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs to prepare responses to human rights in-
 quiries from foreign governments, international bodies, and human rights organiza-
 tions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Equal Opportunity Employment Law prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 sex, marital status, or sexual orientation. The Labor Exchange Law prohibits dis-
 crimination on the basis of race, religion, political beliefs, and age. A general law
 prohibits government bodies from practicing discrimination on any of these grounds.
 Women.:-The Equal Opportunity Law requires employers to pay male and female
 workers equal wages for equal work. In 1993 a new law was passed that prohibited
 discrimination in unemployment compensation benefits paid to elderly female citi-
 zens. However, women's advocacy groups, which are very active in Israel, report
 that women routinely receive lower wages, are promoted less often, and benefit from
 fewer career opportunities than male counterparts.
 Domination of personal status law by religious courts means that women are sub-
 ject to restrictive interpretations of their rights in such crucial areas as marriage
 and divorce. In 1993 common law spouses were entitled to take the family names
 of their partners, helping to mitigate problems faced by unmarried couples. In 1993
 women's groups stepped up their protest of the rabbinical authorities' refusal to re-
 quire husbands to grant divorces to a number of women claiming marital abuse or
 neglect.
 Women are drafted into the IDF but do not serve in combat positions.
 The Government asserts it condemns violence against women and the subject is
 being dealt with on an ongoing basis. The courts in Israel deal with persons con-
 victed of violence, including violence against women. In 1991 the Government
 passed the Law for the Prevention of Family Violence, which allows legal authorities
 to act expeditiously to ban violent family members' access to property. In the last
 2 years, enforcement of the law has improved markedly as women's groups cooper-
 ate with legal and sr.ial service institutions to educate primarily women about their
 rights under this law. Women's groups and the Government have collaborated on
 opening seven shelters for battered women, while the women's movement Na'amat
 operates four counseling centers for battered women. Women's oups also lobby for
 higher conviction rates and harsher sentences for men accused of perpetrating vio-
 lent acts, including rape, against women. Government and advocacy gups estimate
 that at least 10 percent of Israeli women over the age of 15 are liable to experience
 violent attacks.
 Children.-The Government has a strong commitment to the rights and welfare
 of children. While there is no pattern of societal abuse against children, the Govern-
 ment has legislated against sexual, physical, and psychological abuse of children
 and has mandated comprehensive reporting requirements to assure close attention
 to the issue. Prostitution involving children-mostly adolescents--has been reported
 in isolated cases and has been promptly dealt with by appropriate authorities. A
 combination of police and educational and socialwelfae officials are charged with
 monitoring cases of abuse and administering government programs to treat the vic-
 tims.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Israeli Arabs, who constitute 18 percent of
 the population, are not provided with the same quality of education, housing, em-
 ployment, and social services as Israeli Jews. For security reasons, Israeli Arabs are
 not allowed to work in companies with defense contracts or in security-related fields.
 In 1993 the Government moved to redress inequities in resource allocations to Arab
 sectors but acknowledges that gaps remain in a number of areas, including edu-
 cation, health, infrastructure development, and public sector employment. The
 Sheves Plan, adopted in 1993, for the first time recognized Arab municipalities as
 developmental areas, entitling them to government benefits. The new policy now
 recognizes the geographical, rather than the ethnic, basis of an area as the main
 determinant of eligibility for priority government funding.
 Relative to their numbers, Israeli Arabs are underrepresented in the student bod-
 ies and faculties of most universities and in higher level professional and business
 
 
 1199
 
 ranks. The Arabic-speaking community has access to local and foreign Arabic press,
 publications, and media. The Israeli Druze and Circassian communities, at their ini-
 tiative, are subject to Israel's military draft, and some Bedouin and other Arabs
 serve voluntarily. Other than Druze and Muslim but non-Arab Circassians, Israeli
 Arabs are not subject to the draft. Consequently, they have less access than do other
 Israelis to a variety of social and economic benefits for which military service is a
 prerequisite or an advantage, including housing and new-household subsidies and
 government or security-related industrial employment. The Government has decided
 to award national insurance equally to veterans of the IDF and those who have not
 served in the army. The Government has also determined that, within a 3-year pe-
 riod starting in 1994, it will bring social security child bonus allowances for parents
 who have not served in the army in line with those for parents who have. The Gov-
 ernment asserts that it maintains an open door policy with respect to Israeli Arabs
 who volunteer for military service and that hundreds of Muslim and Christian
 Arabs are voluntarily inducted into the IDF and serve in various units, including
 the infantry, armored corps, and paratroopers. Parts of the Israeli Arab community
 have objected to the idea of alternative national service.
 The problem of the legal status of unrecognized Arab villages remained unre-
 solved in 1993. The Government promised to study the situation of the villages but
 offered no solutions. Residents of the village of Ramyah (see the 1991 and 1992
 country reports) continued to negotiate the future of their village after the Govern-
 ment stayed an order of eviction against them in 1992. A private member's bill be-
 fore the Knesset proposing that the pre-1948 residents of the villages of Bir Am and
 Ikrit or their descendants be permitted to rebuild their houses there has passed a
 first reading and has now been referred to a Knesset committee for preparation of
 the law for its second and third readings.
 Religious Minorities.-In general the Government respects freedom of religion and
 protects the rights of citizens of all creeds to worship freely. In those civic areas
 where religion is a determinant criterion-primarily religious courts and religious
 centers of education-non-Jewish institutions routinely receive less state support
 than Jewish counterparts. Immigration to Israel is significantly easier for those who
 are Jewish than for non-Jews. The Government generally respects and protects non-
 Jewish religious sites. Muslim organizations continue to demand that cemeteries
 and an unused mosque in Beersheba be proteted. In 1993 the Government allowed
 Libyan pilgrims to visit Jerusalem and encouraged the attendance of Syrian and
 Lebanese Druze at the funeral of the sect's religious leader in northern Israel. At
 year's end, Arabs in the city of Jaffa were trying to prevent the building of housing
 units over a Muslim cemetery in Kfar Shalem. The High Court turned down an ap-
 peal by Jaffa's supreme Islamic committee which had argued that the land in ques-
 tion had been illegally acquired by a joint government/municipality building com-
 pany.
 People with Disabilities.-The Government provides a range of benefits, including
 income maintenance, housing subsidies, and transportation support, for the approxi-
 mately 10 percent of the Israeli population who have disabilities. While the law pro-
 vides for equal treatment of disabled persons, advocacy groups report continued dif-
 ficulties with enforcement in the areas of employment and housing. The law also
 requires public buildings to provide complete access for disabled persons, but it is
 not widely enforced. There is no law providing for access to public transportation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Israeli workers may join freely established organiza-
 tions of their own choosing. Israeli Arabs are free to form their own unions but have
 not done so. Most unions belong to the General Federation of Labor in Israel
 (Histadrut) or to a much smaller rival federation and are independent of the Gov-
 ernment, although a majority of the elected union leadership is identified with the
 Labor Party and a significant Likud Party minority. About 60 percent of the work
 force, including Israeli Arabs, are members of the Histadrut trade unions, and an
 additional 15-20 percent are covered by Histadrut's social and insurance programs
 and collective bargaining agreements. Histadrut members democratically elect na-
 tional and local officers and officials of its affiliated women's organization, Naamat,
 from political party lists. Plant or enterprise committee members are elected indi-
 vidua fly.
 The right to strike is exercised regularly. A 15-day notice prior to a strike or a
 lockout is legally mandated unless otherwise specified in the collective bargaining
 agreement, but unauthorized strikes also occur. Strike leaders--even those organiz-
 ing illegal strikes-are protected by law. If essential public services are affected, the
 Government may appeal to labor courts for back-to-work orders while negotiations
 continue. The Government had recourse to this right during a 2-week general strike
 
 
 1200
 in the public sector in July. Other strikes in 1993 were concentrated in the health
 and public sectors.
 Unions freely exercise their right to form federations and affiliate internationally.
 The lifting of the Israeli ban on contacts with the PLO and the si in  of the Dec-
 laration of Principles have led to the beginning of an informaI dilog between
 Histadrut and the representatives of Palestinian trade unions in the occupied terri-
 tories on issues of mutual interest. Nonresident workers, including the approxi-
 mately 52,000 nonresident Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza currently
 working legally in Israel, may not be members of Israeli trade unions and thus may
 not belong to union health systems or participate in union elections or other activi-
 ties.
 Palestinian workers may not organize their own trade unions within Israel. Pal.
 estinian trade unions in the occupied territories are not permitted to operate in Is-
 rael. However, nonresident workers in the organized sector, including Palestinians
 from the occupied territories, are entitled to Histadrut contract and grievance pro-
 tection and may join, vote for, and be elected to shop-level workers' committees if
 their numbers in individual establishments exceed a minimum threshold. Palestin-
 ian participation in such committees is minimal. Labor laws applicable in Israel also
 apply to Palestinians in east Jerusalem and Syrian Druze on the Golan Heights (see
 the occupied territories report for discussion of worker rights in east Jerusalem and
 the West Bank and Gaza.)
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Israelis fully exercise their
 legal right to organize and bargain collectively. While there is no law specifically
 prohibiting antiunion discrimination the basic law against discrimination could be
 cited to contest discrimination based on union membership. No antiunion discrimi-
 nation has been reported. Nonresident workers may not organize on their own or
 bargain collectively but are entitled to representation by the bargaining agent and
 the protection of collective bargaining agreements. They do not pay union member-
 ship fees but pay a 1- ercent agency fee which entitles them to union protection by
 Histadrut's collective bargaining agreements. Israelis fully exercise their legal right
 to organize and bargain collectively. The Ministry of Labor can and does extend col-
 lective bargaining agreements in one sector to nonunionized workplaces in the same
 sector. The Ministry of Labor also oversees personal contracts and wage arrange-
 ments in unorganized sectors of the economy.
 There are currently no export processing zones, although a government bill au-
 thorizing creation of such zones has been approved by the Cabinet and is currently
 pending in the Knesset. The city of Eilat is a duty-free area in which all relevant
 Israeli labor laws apply.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 ulsory labor, and neither Israeli citizens nor nonresident Palestinians working in
 fIsrael are subject to such practices.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-By law, children under age 15
 may not be employed. Schoolchildren aged 15 may not be employed without special
 permission except as apprentices or during school vacations. Employment of those
 aged 16 to 18 is restricted to ensure time for rest and education. Israeli labor ex-
 changes do not process work applications for West Bank or Gaza Palestinians under
 age 17, and often higher age requirements are imposed for security reasons. Min-
 istry of Labor Inspectors enforce these laws, but advocates of children's rights
 charge that enforcement is lax, especially in smaller, unorganized workplaces.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legislation in 1987 establisheda minimum
 wage at 45 percent of the average wage, calculated periodically and adjusted for cost
 of living increases. As of August 1993, the minimum wage was about $499 (NIS
 1396.77) per month. The Ministry of Labor is charged with enforcing minimum
 wage regulations. In 1993 the Government increased resources available to tighten
 the enforcement of minimum wage legislation but continued to identify this as a
 1problem. The minimum wage is often supplemented by special allowances and is
 generally sufficient to provide workers and their families an acceptable standard of
 living.
 By law, maximum hours of work at regular pay are 47 hours per week, 8 per day,
 and 7 the day before the weekly rest, which must be at least 36 consecutive hours
 and include the Sabbath. By national collective agreements, the private sector es-
 tablished a maximum 45-hour workweek in 1988, while the public sector moved to
 a 5-day, 42-1/2 hour workweek in 1989.
 Along with union representatives, the Labor Inspection Service enforces labor,
 health, and safety standards in the workplace, although resource constraints affect
 overall enforcement. Legislation protects the employment rights of safety delegates
 elected or appointed from among the employees of an enterprise and charged with
 overseeing, in conjunction with management, the overall safety and health of the
 
 
 1201
 
 work force. Workers do not have the legislated right to remove themselves from dan-
 grous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment. However, collec-
 tive bargaining agreements in some sectors provide the worker with recourse
 through The work site labor committee. In addition, any worker may challenge un-
 safe work practices through appropriate government oversight and legal agencies.
 For the first 3 months of 1993, the Government continued to en~force restrictions
 on West Bank snd Gazan workers imposed in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf war
 requiring employers to register all Palestinian employees with government agencies
 and requiring all Palestinian workers seeking employment in Israel to qualify for
 a government-issued "magnetic card" which permits access to Israel and als serves
 as a work permit. In late March after a series of attacks against Israelis, the Gov-
 ernment closed access to Israel from the occupied territories. The Government
 gradually applied new occupational quotas stricter criteria rgarding age and mari-
 tal status, and additional security checks for Palestinians seeking to work in Israel.
 In the succeeding months, these criteria were gradually relaxed but not removed.
 As a result the number of workers from the occupied territories employed through
 the Israeli employment service labor exchanges fell from 74,000 in February to
 8,500 in mid-April before rising to 52,000 by December. (The latter figure excludes
 Palestinians working in Jerusalem, transportation services, or diplomatic missions.)
 Prior to the March closure of the territories, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 unregis-
 tered workers from the occupied territories entered Israel to work. Government offi-
 cials estimated in December that between 10,000 and 15,000 unregistered Palestin-
 ian workers were employed in Israel. All workers from the territories are employed
 on a daily basis and, unless they are employed on shiftwork, are not authorized to
 spend the night in Israel. Police carry out identity checks of Palestinians found out-
 sde the wrkplam and aretadfn       hs     ihu    ai   okprmits.
 Palestinans wokin in Isael  re technicallytcoverdby the lawsiand collective
 bargaining agreements that cover Israeli  orkers, including minimum wage, ick
 leave, severance pay, paid vacations, and pensions administered by the Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs. However, it is widely believed that most Palestinian work-
 er do not receive the full benefits to which they are entitled under these laws and
 agreements. In return for their NIl contributions, Palestinian workers receive some
 of the benfits Israeli workers receive but do not have access to unemployment insur-
 ance, general disability payments, low-income supplements, child allotments or ma-
 ternity leave, all of which are provided to Israeli workers. In 1993 the Government
 made public for the first time parts of the civil administration budget relating to
 progms carried out in the occupied territories.
 Palestinians working in Israel are paid through the employment service of the
 Labor Ministry, which receives their wages and Ienefits from employers and pays
 the recipient after deducting taxes, a 1-percent union fee, and contributions to te
 National Insurance Institute (Nil). The same percentsge (5.35 percent) for NIl con-
 tributions is deducted from the pay of legally hired Palestinians and from Israeli
 workers. In return for their NII contributions, Palestinian workers receive some, but
 not all, of the benefits Israeli workers receive. Because of these restrictions, only 1.2
 percent of Palestinian workers' pay goes to the Nii. The remaining 4.15 percent is
 nonetheless deducted from their pay in order to equalize the labor costs of Palestin-
 ians and Israelis. The IL has long criticized this inequality in entitlements. These
 funds are deposited with the Finance Ministry, which applies them to programs ad-
 ministered by the Government in the WestBank and Gaza. In 1993 the Govern-
 ment made public parts of this budget for the first time.
 In 1991 an employer brought suit to the Supreme Court, arguing that Palestinian
 workers and their employers should have to contribute only that part of the salary
 that app lied, to benefits directly received by the employee. In response to the Su-
 preme Court s recommendation, the Government formed an interagency committee
 to study the issue. In 1993 the committee issued draft legislation that would essen-
 tially institutionalize the status quo. The proposed legislation remained under
 Knesset review at the  en f      th   e end of 1993 a human rights organiza-
 tion announced plans to file a class-action suit against the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs for failing to provide equal benefits to asrgeli and Palestinian workers
 employed in Israel. Israeli settlers living in the occupied territories but working in-
 side Israel have the same benefits as all other Israeli workers.
 OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 This report deals with territories under military occupation, whereas most others
 in this volume describe practices within sovereign states and deal with the relation-
 
 
 1202
 ship between governments and their own citizens. Israel occupied the lands known
 as the 'occupied territories' (the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and East
 Jerusalem) as a result of the 1967 war.
 Israel is not recognized internationally to have sovereignty over any of the occu-
 pied territories. Israel has, however, asserted sovereignty over and annexed East Je-
 rusalem. The West Bank and Gaza legal regime derives from Ottoman, Jordanian,
 Egyptian, and British law, as modified by Israeli military orders. Israel has ex-
 tended its law and administration to the Golan Heights. The United States consid-
 ers Israel's occupation to be governed by The Hague Regulations of 1907 and the
 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection ofCivilians in Time of
 War. Israel considers the Hague Regulations applicable, but not the Geneva Con-
 vention, though Israel states that it observes the Geneva Convention's humani-
 tarian provisions.
 Israel has governed the West Bank and Gaza through the Civil Administration
 (CIVAD), which is answerable to the Minister of Defense. Most Palestinian munici-
 palities have Israeli-appointed mayors, the majority of elected mayors having been
 dismissed in the early 1980's. Palestinians have not had the opportunity to partici-
 pate in significant political or economic decisions regarding the occupied territories,
 except for East Jerusalem, where Palestinian residents have largely boycotted the
 Israeli political process. Israeli settlers in the territories (about 5 percent of the pop-
 ulation of the territories, exclusive of East Jerusalem) are subject to Israeli law and
 receive better treatment than Palestinians under military occupation law. Israeli
 economic policies discriminate in favor of Israeli interests and Israeli settlers in the
 territories.
 The security forces in the occupied territories have consisted of the army (Israeli
 Defense Forces-IDF), the Shin Bet (General Security Service-GSS), the police, and
 the paramilitary border police. Crimes by Palestinians related to "security," as de-
 fined by the authorities, have been tried in military courts.
 The economies of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are small, poorly developed, and
 highly dependent on Israel. The West Bank produces many agricultural items and
 some light manufactured goods. Gaza's economy is more focused on agriculture and
 depends heavily on earnings from day laborers in Israel. Both economies have suf-
 fered from the effects of the occupation, the 6-year-old Palestinian uprising
 (intifada) against Israeli rule, the Gulf war and resulting cutoff of Arab funding, and
 the March 29 closure of the occupied territories.
 The first 5 months of 1993 witnessed a dramatic increase in violence and con-
 frontation. After a series of killings and stabbings of Israeli soldiers and civilians
 in Israel and the occupied territories during the first 3 months of 1993, the Govern-
 ment on March 29 sealed off indefinitely the West Bank and Gaza from Jerusalem
 and Israel. While proving an effective measure in curbing Palestinian attacks
 against Israelis in Israel, closure has severely constricted Palestinians' freedom of
 movement and has caused a deterioration of economic conditions (see also Sections
 2.c. and 2.d.). The closure, which was partially eased later during 1993, does not
 apply to Israeli citizens, who are not required to obtain special permits to cross into
 and out of the West Bank and Gaza.
 On September 13, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed
 an historic Declaration of Principles on a gradual transfer of authority from Israel
 to an interim Palestinian self-governing authority. The Declaration lays out a time-
 table for Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, scheduled to be com-
 pleted in the first quarter of 1994. In addition, the Declaration calls for a redeploy-
 ment of Israeli security forces away from populated areas in the West Bank by as
 early as July 1994, which is the target date or election of a Palestinian council and
 for the dissolution of the Israeli military-backed CIVAD which has administered the
 occupied territories since 1981. Through this process, Palestinians will also assume
 early responsibility for functions such as the health sector; educational, cultural,
 and social welfare affairs; tourism; and taxation. The Palestinians are also to create
 a Palestinian police force for the occupied territories. Israelis are to continue to con-
 trol external security, internal security, and public order in Israeli settlements, for-
 eign relations, and certain other areas until an agreement on permanent status is
 achieved. This historic arement, when implemented, should fundamentally trans-
 form the basic relationship between Palestimans and Israelis.
 Both Palestinian and Israeli opponents of the Declaration of Principles have at-
 tempted to exploit the violence as a means of derailing the agreement. The Palestin-
 ian Islamist extremist organizations Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad launched
 a number of attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians between September 9 and the
 end of the year. Armed settlers also blocked roads, harassed Palestinian commuters,
 destroyed Palestinian property, and fired at unarmed Palestinians. From October
 through mid-December, six settlers were killed by Palestinians, while eight Pal-
 
 
 1203
 estinians were killed by settlers. As the occupying power, Israel remained obligated
 under international occupation law to ensure, as far as possible, public order and
 the safety of Lhe civilian population in the occupied territories. Violence in the occu-
 pied territories also included killings of Palestinians by other Palestinians because
 of alleged collaboration with Israel.
 All of the 414 Palestinians deported to southern Lebanon in December 1992 be-
 cause of their alleged association with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were
 allowed to return in 1993, with the exception of about 15 who chose not to return.
 Some were then administratively detained.
 There were credible reports that during 1993 Israel mistreated and, according to
 those reports, in some cases tortured Palestinians during arrest and interrogation,
 utilized undercover units implicated in possible extrajudicial killings, ordered ad-
 ministrative detentions, used heavy weaponry to destroy houses in which IDF sol-
 diers believed security suspects to be hiding, limited freedom of movement, em-
 ployed harsh tax collection practices, and followed discriminatory policies in land
 and resources use and trade. The longstanding U.S. position is that several Israeli
 ractices, such as the transfer of prisoners outside the occupied territories and the
 emolition or sealing of houses for security offenses as a form of collective punish-
 ment, contravene specific provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
 Apart from the major development reflected in the Israeli-PLODeclaration of Prin-
 ciples, there were other improvements in the human rights situation. Israel liberal-
 ized its policy on family reunification for residents of the West Bank and Gaza (see
 Section 2.d.), carried out significantly fewer court-sanctioned demolitions of Pal-
 estinian houses (although demolition orders were usually converted to orders for
 sealings), and used curfews less frequently in the West Bank. The nighttime curfew
 imposed on Gaza since 1987, however, remained in effect, and general curfews were
 used extensively throughout the year in Gaza. In October Israel released 617 Pal-
 estinian prisoners as a goodwill gesture following the signing of the Declaration of
 Principles. As of the end of the year, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were dis-
 cussing the timing and numbers of additional releases.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Credible sources report that under-
 cover units disguised as Palestinians killed 27 Palestinians as of late November.
 This number represents a significant decrease from the 45 Palestinians reported
 killed by undercover units in 1992. As in 1992, the task of the undercover umts ap-
 peared to have been to arrest activists wanted by the authorities for serious crimes.
 The undercover units also focused on stone-throwers or graffiti-writers. Human
 rights organizations continued to c..arge that the undercover units targeted certain
 activists, in some cases killing suspects under circumstances in which it may have
 been possible to apprehend them without killing. Israeli authorities acknowledge the
 operation of special undercover units whose members circulate among Palestinian
 activists and claim that such units observe standard rules of engagement applicable
 to other IDF units and that all killings and allegations of misbehavior are inves-
 t'gated. Investigations of abuses by IDF troops are conducted by IDF investigators.
 These investigations rarely result in imposition of serious punishment. According to
 the Israeli Government, c.ie investigation into the killing of a child by an under-
 cover unit did result in an undercover unit lieutenant's conviction on charges of neg-
 ligence. The officer was sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment and was demoted to
 the rank of sergeant.
 According to some human rights groups, the General Security Service (GSS) was
 responsible for at least one extrajudicial killing-the death of Omar Khamis Yusef
 Al-Ghula, who, according to eyewitnesses, was andcuffed and offering no resistance
 when he was shot by a security officer on January 27. The Israeli Government
 states that members of an army patrol shot and killed AI-Ghula, while he was in
 their custody, when he attempted to draw a handgun. The military prosecutor for
 Gaza investigated this case. le concluded that the soldiers acted in accordance with
 the rules of engagement and instructed that the file be closed.
 Palestinian attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians in 1993 resulted in the
 deaths of 49 Israelis in the occupied territories, compared to 23 such deaths in 1992.
 Most deaths were by knifing or gunfire. After a series of killings and stabbings of
 Israeli soldiers and civilians in Israel and the occupied territories in the first 3
 months of the year, the Government sealed off the West Bank and Gaza from Jeru-
 salem and Israel on March 29 for an indefinite period as a means of reducing the
 number of Palestinian attacks on Israelis.
 
 
 1204
 
 As of mid-December, 79 Palestinians had been killed by other Palestinians, most
 often because of alleged collaboration with Israeli security services but also because
 of disputes between political factions or street gangs or because of personal feuds.
 These killings included Palestinian women accused of collaboration with Israeli au-
 thorities, infidelity, or prostitution. (The Government of Israel claims that 139 Pal-
 estinians were killed by other Palestinians in 1993.) Sixty-six of these killings took
 place in Gaza, a dramatic decrease from 149 killings in 1992; in the West Bank,
 the phenomenon continued a downward trend begun in 1992.
 During the October to December period, there were credible reports of IDF inac-
 tion during several settler attacks, which occurred usually in retaliation for the kill-
 ing of a settler, on Palestinians and their homes and property. In late December,
 the IDF appeared to investigate more vigorously two separate incidents in which
 Palestinians were killed, reportedly by settlers, and it appeared that by the end of
 the year the IDF had begun taking stronger measures to protectPalestinians from
 settler attacks. These measures included the provision by the IDF's Judge Advocate
 General to IDF officers of a 14-page handbook on how to deal with disturbances in-
 volving Israeli citizens in the occupied territories. According to that guidance, sol-
 diers were authorized to arrest Israelis if they were breaking the law.
 Israeli authorities prosecute Palestinians accused of killing other Palestinians as
 well as those accused of killing Israelis, and, although there is no capital punish-
 ment, sentences are severe. Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis and alleged col-
 laborators have been a principal target of undercover unit operations. The Govern-
 ment also prosecutes Israelis accused of killing Palestinians, though sentences given
 to Israelis are generally much lighter than sentences handed down to Palestinians
 convicted of killing either Israelis or Palestinians. (See Section L.e. for additional in-
 formation on trials; for further discussion of killings, see Section l.g.)
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 As in 1992, international, Israeli, and Palestinian human rights gups and dip-
 lomats continued to provide detailed and credible accounts of wilespread abuse,
 which they claim in some cases amounted to torture, of Palestinian and Palestinian-
 American detainees, both immediately after arrest and during interrogation. Accord-
 ing to credible reports, hooding, forced standing or tying up in contorted positions,
 prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures, blows and beatings, confinement in a
 small space, sleep and food deprivation, threats against the detainee's family, and
 threats of death were common practice in interrogation facilities. The apparent in-
 tent of these practices was to disorient and intimidate prisoners, often with the goal
 of obtaining confessions or information about third parties. The International Com-
 mittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1992 declared such practices to be violations of
 the Geneva Convention.
 In June the Israeli-Palestinian Association of Physicians for Human Rights pub-
 lished a form reportedly used in the intermgation section of Tulkarem Prison in the
 West Bank. The form requested an examining physician to certify the medical fit-
 ness of a detainee for interrogation and specifically asked the doctor to indicate any
 medical "limitations" by reason of which the prisoner should not be chained forced
 to wear a hood, or forced to stand for long periods. Subsequent to the publication
 of the form, the Israeli Medical Association issued a statement forbidding member
 physicians to answer such questions. The Government asserts that the form, while
 considered, was never put into use. Human rights groups believe that IDF and pris-
 on service doctors have routinely been called upon to certify prisoners for interroga-
 tion, whether or not a specific form is required.
 Torture is forbidden by Israeli law. Israeli authorities say that torture is not au-
 thorized or condoned in the occupied territories but acknowledge that abuses occur
 and state that they are investigated. In 1987 the Landau Judicial Commission spe-
 cifically condemned "torture" but allowed for "moderate physical and psychological
 pressure" to be used to secure confessions and to obtain information; a classified
 annex to the report defining permissible pressure has never been made public. In
 a case brought by the Public Committee Against Torture, the Israeli Supreme Court
 refused to halt the use of "moderate physical pressure."
 In April the director of the GSS, responding to a petition before the Israeli Su-
 preme Court, presented the court with an affidavit in which he announced amend-
 ments to the GSS's policy on interrogation. While the GSS was to continue to adhere
 to principles contained in the Landau Commission Report, he listed the following
 activities as prohibited: torture and humiliation, denial of food, water, and access
 to a toilet; and subjecting a detainee to extreme temperatures. Interrogators were
 required to proceed in steps, starting with "psychological pressure" and moving on
 to "additional pressure methods" in accordance with regulations. Human rights
 
 
 1205
 groups assert that despite these announced changes in policy, there was no per-
 ceivable difference in treatment of suspects under interrogation.
 The Israeli Ministry of Justice established two units in 1992 to investigate allega-
 tions of misconduct by police and GSS officers, including ill-treatment of detainees
 during interrogation. As of late November, 61 complaints of maltreatment during in-
 terrogation had been filed against GSS interrogators during 1993. Investigations
 into most of those complaints had not yet been completed. The Government claims
 that during 1993 unspecified legal or disciplinary measures had been taken in 13
 cases, approximately half of which had been initiated prior to 1993.
 In 1993 six Palestinians died in detention, four from what appeared to be natural
 causes. Human rights groups claim, however, that lack of prompt and adequate
 medical attention while in detention in at least three cases aggravated the medical
 conditions of those three prisoners. The Israeli Government states that all of these
 prisoners received medical examinations, and none complained of chronic ailments.
 According to credible sources, one detainee, a 23-year-old from Gaza, was denied
 medical attention for smoke inhalation for at least 3 days after his arrest. A second
 case was an apparent suicide.
 Most convictions in security cases are based on confessions. An attorney is nor-
 mally not allowed to see a client until after interrogation is complete and a confes-
 sion, if obtained, has been made. The ICRC is not allowed access to detainees until
 the 14th day after arrest. Human rights groups point to this prolonged incommuni-
 cado detention as contributing to the problem of abuse. Detainees frequently tell
 judges that confessions were coerced. Human rights groups assert that Palestinian
 detainees often fail to lodge complaints either from fear of retribution or because
 they assume their complaints will be ignored.
 Charges of beatings and physical abuse by Israeli security forces continued in
 1993. The IDF says that it investigates automatically every fatality but that it does
 not routinely investigate nonfatal violent incidents unless a complaint is made. Ac-
 cording to the IDF, from January 1 to September 1 there were 11 indictments
 against 24 soldiers and officers for "intifada-related offenses." Twelve soldiers were
 convicted while none were acquitted. Five indictments are still pending. No informa-
 tion was provided as to the sentences in these cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-As of the end of 1993, a total of 9,573
 Palestinians were incarcerated in IDF (5,308) and prison service facilities. Of those,
 roughly 68 percent had been tried and were serving sentences, 29.6 percent were
 awaiting charges or trial, and 2.3 percent were detained administratively, i.e., sen-
 tenced to a specific period of detention without formal charge or trial.
 In October Israel released 617 Palestinian prisoners as a goodwill gesture follow-
 ing the signing of the Declaration of Principles. At the end of the year, Israeli and
 Palestinian negotiators were discussing the timing and numbers of additional re-
 leases.
 Since the beginning of the intifada in late 1987, Israel has routinely transferred
 Palestinian prisoners from the occupied territories to detention facilities within Is-
 rael, espealy to the Ketziot camp in the Negev desert and Megiddo  rison near
 Afula. This practice, which continued in 1993, contravenes Article 76 o the Fourth
 Geneva Convention. Estimates of the number of Palestinian residents of the occu-
 pied territories incarcerated within Israel range up to 7,000. In late 1993, there
 were indications that Palestinian prisoners were being transferred from detention
 centers in Gaza to facilities in Israel prior to the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza
 scheduled to begin on December 13.
 The use of administrative detention for alleged security reasons without formal
 charges or a full opportunity for detainees to defend themselves continued in 1993.
 As of October, 277 Palestinians were held in administrative detention, compared to
 520 held at the end of 1992.
 Detention periods are for a maximum of 6 months and are renewable. Evidence
 used at hearings frequently is declared secret and unavailable to either the detainee
 or his attorney. Israeli officials state that administrative detention is used only
 when IDF legal advisrs have determined that there is sufficient evidence to detain
 a person andthat the evidence has been corroborated by two sources. They assert
 however, that the evidence cannot bc presented in open court because to do so would
 compromise the method of acquiring the evidence, which is often provided by in-
 formers whose lives would be jeopardized if their identities were known. Human
 rights monitors contend that admnistrative detention is often used when evidence
 against a suspect would not stand up in court.
 District military commanders may order administrative detention without formal
 charges. Detainees may appeal detention orders or renewal of detention before a
 military judge. Attorneys may question security service witnesses concerning the
 
 
 1206
 
 general nature of that evidence. The Supreme Court may review rulings by military
 judges and may examine secret evidence.
 Any soldier may arrest without warrant a person who has committed, or is sus-
 pected of having committed, a criminal or security offense. Persons over age 12 are
 treated as adults by the court system. Persons arrested for common crimes are usu-
 ally provided the apportunit  or bail, access to an attorney, and a statement of
 charges (although these opportunities are sometimes delayed). Bail is rarely avail-
 able to those arrested for security offenses. Special summonses are reportedly issued
 to Palestinians wanted by authorities for security reasons. Israeli Military Order
 1369 allows authorities to sentence to 7 years' imprisonment any person who does
 not respond to a special summons that is delivered to him or a family member or
 is posted in the Civil Administration office nearest his home address.
 Persons may be held in custody without a warrant foi- 96 hours and then must
 be released unless a warrant is issued. A warrant may be issued by a police officer
 for two periods of 7 days each. For extensions beyond 18 days from the date of ar-
 rest, the detainee has to be brought before a military judge, at which point he is
 entitled to defense counsel. In 1992 Israeli authorities shortened this period to 8
 days for minors and those accused of less serious offenses (such as stone throwing).
 A military judge may extend the detention for a period of no longer than 6 months
 from the date of arrest. If there is no indictment during this period, the detainee
 must be released. If there is an indictment, a judge may order indefinite detention
 until the end of the trial, though the detention may be appealed.
 In theory a detainee has the right to see a lawyer as soon as possible. In the cases
 of security detainees, however, officers routinely issue a written order to delay ac-
 cess to counsel for up to 15 days for reasons of security or to conduct the investiga-
 tion. Higher ranking officials or judges may extend this period by up to 75 more
 days for the same reasons. In June the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the fun-
 damental right to consult a lawyer required the Government not only to inform a
 detainee of his right but also to advise the detainee of any orders preventing him
 from seeing a lawyer. Israeli regulations also permit prisoners to be held in isolation
 from family and from other detainees during interrogation.
 Israeli authorities claim that they attempt to post notification of arrest within 48
 hours; Palestinians assert that families and lawyers are normally notified much
 later and generally locate the detainee through their own efforts. Notification to the
 US. Embassy or Consulate General of detained Palestinian-American citizens has
 almost always been through the family. The ICRC attempts to help by passing on
 to families (by telephone) the information it receives from Israeli prison officials. A
 senior officer may extend for up to 12 days denial of notification of arrest to imme-
 diate family members, attorneys, and consular officials. A military commander may
 appeal to a judge to extend this period in security cases for an unlimited time.
 The Israeli authorities acted in a number of areas to improve prison conditions
 in the occupied territories after Palestinian prisoners staged an 18-day hunger
 strike in September and October 1992 to protest prison conditions. Implementation
 of the specific measures, however, was not uniform throughout all detention facili-
 ties. In August 1993, prisoners at Hebron prison staged a hunger strike to protest
 lack of water for toilet and bathing facilities. The Israeli Supreme Court agreed to
 consider a petition presented by the prisoners but, as of October, the case had not
 been resolved. In the meantime, Israeli authorities reportedly agreed to truck in
 water supplies to meet prisoner needs. In September the Association of Israeli-Pal-
 estinian Physicians petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court to close the Ketziot Mili-
 tary Detention Camp in Israel because of "inferior conditions of imprisonment." The
 petition argued that the conditions at the camp, which reportedly houses 4,900 Pal-
 estinian security detainees, violated the Geneva Convention. Overcrowding (26 in-
 mates to a tent), inferior diet, lack of adequate medical care, and lack of arrange-
 ments for religious worship were cited as key problems. At the end of the year,
 Ketziot camp was still in use. According to the IDF Judge Advocate General, the
 IDF has been granted a postponement to study the report of an advisory panel. Con-
 sideration of the case by the Supreme Court has been postponed until March 1994.
 In December 1992, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 799,
 which called for the immediate return of 415 Palestinians who had been deported
 to South Lebanon earlier that month because of their alleged association with
 Hamas--the Islamic Resistance Movement and the largest Islamist organization in
 the occupied territories--and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Israel agreed in March
 to a two-phase plan to return the deportees. In September 186 deportees returned
 from the edge of the Israeli-declared security zone in South Lebanon where they had
 been camped since December 1992. Upon their return, the deportees were inves-
 tigated by the Israeli authorities and some were freed while others were placed in
 administrative detention. In mid-December, the remaining deportees returned ex-
 
 
 1207
 cept for about 15 deportees who reportedly elected to remain outside the occupied
 territories to avoid imprisonment. Like those who had returned in September, the
 197 who returned in December were subject to interrogation and investigation. As
 of the end of the year, approximately 65 remained in detention.
 In addition to the deportees in southern Lebanon, Israel allowed 30 pre-intifada
 deportees to return to the occupied territories in May as a confidence building meas-
 ure. Among those who returned was one former West Bank mayor elected in 1976
 and later deported to Jordan.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Palestinians accused of nonsecurity offenses are
 tried publicly in local courts by Palestinian judges appointed by Israeli officials, ex-
 cept where jurisdiction has been transferred by military order. Since the beginning
 of the uprising, local administration of justice has deteriorated seriously. At the be-
 ginning of the intifada in December 1987, the intifada leadership ordered Palestin-
 ian police and judges to resign. Since then, Palestinian courts have functioned spo-
 radically. Palestinians accused of security offenses are tried in Israeli military
 courts. Security offenses are broadly defined by Israel and may include charges of
 political activity, such as suspected membership in outlawed organizations. Follow-
 ing the exchange of letters of recognition between Israel and the PLO, membership
 in the mainstream Fatah organization ceased to be considered a "security offense
 by the Israeli authorities. Charges are brought by military prosecutors, and suspects
 are entitled to counsel. Serious charges are tried before three-judge panels, and de-
 fendants are entitled to a p peal the judgments of such ourts as a matter of right.
 Lesser offenses are tried before single-judge courts. The Court of Military Appeals
 may accept appeals of decisions by those courts based on the law applied in the
 case, the sentence imposed, or both. The right of appeal does not apply in all cases,
 and appeals sometimes require court pernmssion. In practice, it is rare for Palestin-
 ians tred for security offenses to be acquitted, though their sentences sometimes
 are reduced through the appeal process.
 Trials are delayed for several reasons: witnesses (including Israeli military or po-
 lice officers) do not appear, the defendant is not brought to court; files are lost; or
 attorneys fail to appear. These delays may constitute an additional source of pres-
 sure on the defendant to plead guilty in order to avoid serving a period of pretrial
 detention that would exceed the sentence likely to apply in the context of a plea
 bargain. In cases involving minor offenses, such as stone throwing, an "expedited"
 trial may be held, in which a charge sheet is drawn up within 48 hours and a court
 hearing scheduled within days. In 1993 the IDF reported that approximately two-
 thirds of detainees in military prisons had completed their trials.
 By law, most military trials are public, although access is limited. Consular offi-
 cers are allowed to attend military court proceedings involving foreign citizens, but
 there have been delays in gaining admission.
 Most convictions in military courts are based on confessions. Israeli officials assert
 that Palestinians rarely cooperate as witnesses to crimes, refusing to deal with Is-
 raeli authorities. Physical and psychological pressures and reduced sentences for
 those who confess contribute to the likelihood that security detainees will sign con-
 fessions. Confessions are usually recorded in Hebrew, which many defendants can-
 not read. Israeli authorities say that confessions are made by and repeated to the
 defendant in Arabic, although they are written down in Hebrew because, while
 many Israeli court personnel speak Arabic, few write it.
 Crowded facilities and poor arrangements for attorney-client consultations in pris-
 ons hinder effective legal defense efforts. Palestinian attorneys report that appoint-
 ments to see clients are difficult to arrange and that prison authorities often fail
 to produce clients when scheduled. In addition, prison authorities often limit the
 time available to meet with clients.
 Israeli settlers in the occupied territories accused of security and ordinary crimi-
 nal offenses are tried in the nearest Israeli district court under Israeli law. Civilian
 judges preside over these courts, and standards of due process and admissibility of
 evidence are not governed by military occupation law. Settlers convicted in Israeli
 courts of crimes against Palestinians regularly receive lighter punishment than Pal-
 estinians convicted of crimes against either Israelis or other Palestinians.
 In 1992 an amendment to Israel's penal law provided greater discretion in sen-
 tencingfor cases of self-defense or necessity where a defendant has used excessive
 force. Palestinians raised concerns that this might result in unjustifiably lenient
 sentences for Israeli settlers who use force. As of October, however, the Israel state
 attorney's office was unaware of any cases in which that amendment had been ap-
 plied.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Prit,acy, Family, Home. or Correspondence. -Military
 authorities in the occupied territories may enter private Palestinian homes and in-
 stitutions without a warrant on security grounds. Authorization by an officer of the
 
 
 1208
 rank of lieutenant colonel is required prior to entry. Forced entries are used in IDF
 operations and are sometimes accompanied by beatings and destruction of property,
 including foodstuffs. Undercover units have engaged in destructive and violent be-
 havior during searches, as well as harassment of families of wanted Palestinians.
 Israeli authorities claim that forced entry may lawlly occur only incident to arrest
 when entry is resisted, that beatings and arbitrary destruction of property during
 searches sre punishable violations of military regulations, and that compensation is
 due to victims in such cases. The Government did not provide information regarding
 such compensation.
 In 1993 the security authorities sealed 27 houses for security reasons, a decline
 from 33 sealed in 1992. Indicating the continuation of a policy begun in 1992, the
 Israeli Government reports, and some human rights groups agree, that no houses
 were ordered demolished for security reasons in 1993. Other credible sources, how-
 ever, believe that three house demolitions which occurred during 1993 were ordered
 for security reasons, not because of building permit violations or during military op-
 er~ations. Using bulldozers and other construction equipment, security forces may de-
 molish or seal the home of a suspect, whether he is the owner or only a tenant, be-
 fore any trial is held. The final decision to seal or demolish a house is made by a
 number of high-level Israeli officials, including the coordinator of the Civil Adminis-
 tration. Owners of houses ordered to be demolished have 48 hours to appeal to the
 area commander, and final appeals may be made to the High Court. A successful
 appeal generally results in the conversion of a demolition order to sealing. When
 a house is demolished, the land on which it sits is confiscated by the Israeli authori-
 ties, and the house owner is not allowed to rebuild or even remove the rubble.
 Israeli authorities say there is a formal procedure whereby owners may apply to
 regional military commanders for permits to rebuild or unseal, but this procedure
 is rarely used. The Israeli Government did allow two homes to be rebuilt after being
 demolished, and four homes were permitted to be opened after being previously
 sealed. The Government reports that 10 houses in Gaza and 10 in the Weat Bank
 were sealed in 1993. During 1993, the IDF continued the practice of using various
 heavy weapons, including rockets, to destroy houses in which soldiers believed secu-
 rity suspects to be hiding (see Section 1.g.).
 The security services sometimes monitor mail and telephone conversations. The
 authorities sometimes interrupt telephone service to speciuic areas.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of He manitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flict.-Estimates vary on the number of casualties caused by use of excessive force
 in the occupied territories. Figures compiled from press  Palestinian, international
 organizations, and Israeli government sources indicate that a total of 184 Paiestin-
 ians were killed by security forces in 1993, compared to 158 in 1992. Estimates of
 the numbers of Palestinians wounded vary; the number could be as high as 4,120.
 IDF figures report approximately 890 Palestinians were injured as of September 1
 by the security services. Forty-nine Israeli soldiers and civilians were killed by Pal-
 estinians in 1993 in the occupied territories, and estimates of Israelis woundedwere
 about 366. Extremists associated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were
 responsible for many of the lethal attacks on Israelis.
 After May it appeared that both the security forces and Palestinian activists pur-
 sued less confrontational policies in order to reduce violent clashes. The killing of
 an Israeli settler near Ramallah in October began a cycle of killings and reprisals
 which had not ended as of late December. Many of the IDF observation posts erect-
 ed in camps and cities thru hout Gaza, which had provoked violence, were re-
 moved in August. Of the total number of Palestinians killed, the Israeli human
 rights group B'tselem estimates that 37 were children aged 16 or under, 33 of whom
 were killed between January and June. Many of these children were involved in
 demonstrations or were near the sites of confrontations or incidents at the time they
 were shot. In July, however, a soldier reportedly shot 10-year-old Ezzat Mattar
 while the boy was flying a kite in an open field.
 In a June report on iDF killings of Palestinian children under age 16, B'tselem
 charged that the IDF pursued a deliberate policy of opning fire in situations in
 which soldiers were not in mortal danger. Citing the pD's rules of engagement for
 dispersing demonstrations and pursuing suspects which allow, in the last resort, use
 of live fire, B'tselem declared that "the many instances in which Palestinians in the
 territories have been killed by soldiers . . . are unequivocal p roof of the danger in-
 herent in such orders and of the need to change them." B'tselem acknowledged that
 the IDF had no deliberate policy to kill children but contended that "in hundreds
 of instances security forces had the option of refraining from shooting, at the risk
 of having suspects (the vast majority are demonstrators or stone-throwers) escape,
 in order to ensure that innocent people would not be hurt."
 
 
 1209
 In its response to the B'tselem report, the IDF stated that soldiers were under
 orders to act with the greatest care in dealing with "riots" in which women and chil-
 dren participated and noted that opening-fire regulations prohibited shooting at
 children. Children were injured, the IDF said, because they were near or among ri-
 oters or armed terrorists who endangered the lives of IDF soldiers. The IDF state-
 ment attributed the increase in deaths to the escalation of violence in the first half
 of 1993.
 Until April IDF regulations permitted the use of live ammunition only when sol-
 diers' lives were in immediate danger, to halt fleeing suspects, or to disperse a vio-
 lent demonstration. In April the IDF issued an amendment to those regu ations per-
 mitting the use of live fire on an "individual unlawfully carrying firearms." Palestin-
 ians asserted, and the Government of Israel denied, that this modification ipso facto
 allowed soldiers to open fire on anyone carrying a firearm. It was not clear how sol-
 diers were to determine if an individual was authorized to carry a firearm. Accord-
 ing to IDF policy, soldiers are to direct fire at the legs only and at a fleeing suspect
 only if they suspect a serious felony and have exhausted other means of apprehend-
 ing the suspect. In practice, however, uniformed soldiers, police, and undercover
 units used live fire in situations other than those described above (see Section l.a.)
 and often shot suspects in the upper body and head. Uniformed soldiers, police, and
 undercover units also injured many bystanders (including children) by live fire, rub-
 ber bullets, or beatings while pursuing suspects.
 During 1993 the IDF continued the practice of using various heavy weapons, in-
 cluding rockets, to destroy houses in which soldiers believed security suspects to be
 hiding. These demolitions took place almost exclusively in Gaza. Although the IDF
 stated that no figures were available on the number of houses damaged in these
 operations, human rights groups count up to 220 houses or apartments either de-
 stroyed or partially damaged by the IDF in the course of military operations in pur-
 suit of suspects. Israel defended this practice as a necessary military operation and
 a measure to save the lives of Israeli soldiers. The Israelis assert that the operations
 were based on intelligence received that certain suspects were in the reported
 places. In practice, IDF units regularly evacuated houses in which they believed sus-
 pects to be hiding and then fired rockets into the buildings. In several instances,
 no suspects were found in the houses. Since late 1992, 177 Palestinian claims have
 been filed for damages to homes by the security forces. Sixty claims have already
 been settled to the sum of approximately $500,000 (one and a half million NIS).
 On a number of occasions, security forces forcibly removed Palestinian suspects
 undergoing medical treatment from hospitals or prohibited Palestinians in need of
 medical care from crossing roadblocks or going out during curfews. The Israeli Gov-
 ernment asserts that a patient is removed only after a doctor certilies a patient is
 fit for transfer, the transfer must be made with a doctor present.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Israeli authorities impose some restrictions
 on freedom of speech. Israel prohibits, for example, public expressions of support for
 Muslim extremist groups, such as Hamas, and other banned organizations. For most
 of the year, the display of Palestinian political symbols, such as flags, national col-
 ors, and graffiti was punishable by stiff fines (usually the equivalent of $150-300
 for graffiti), or imprisonment. Security forces often forced Palestinians to erase graf-
 fiti found on theirproperty, regardless of whether they were responsible for it. Since
 September, after Israel and the PLO signed the Declaration of Principles on the
 transfer of authority, Israeli authorities have generally permitted displays of the
 Palestinian flag or national colors, although there has been no formal change of pol-
 icy.
 The Israeli authorities impose restrictions on the Arabic press, citing security rea-
 sons. Arabic-language publications in East Jerusalem must submit to the military
 authorities for prior censorship all copy relating to the security, public order, and
 safety of Israel and the occupied territories. Many reports and editorials related to
 the uprising and Palestinian political goals were permitted, but other articles and
 editorials were routinely expurgated. Arabic translations of news stories about the
 intifada, which had previously appeared in the Hebrew-language press, were rou-
 tinely censored from the Arabic press.
 A permit is required for publications imported into the occupied territories. Im.
 ported materials may be censored or banned for anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli content.
 According to the Government, publications supporting Palestinian nationalism are
 not censored or banned unless they advocate violence. Possession of banned mate-
 rials, such as uprising leaflets espousing violence, is punishable by fine and impris-
 onment. Reports by foreign journalists are subject to a system of self-regulation.
 
 
 1210
 
 No broadcast media originate from the occupied territories. Jordanian radio and
 television is broadcast throughout the occupied territories.
 Israeli authorities continued to close individual secondary and elementary schools
 for short periods, citing security problems emanating from the schools. In addition,
 strike days called by Palestinian activists continue to cause students to lose a few
 days of school each month. In contrast, Palestinian universities generally operated
 normally for the first time since the intifada began in 1987.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Military orders ban public
 gatherings of 10 or more people without a permit. Until September, when Israel rec-
 ognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people, Palestinian politi-
 cal parties and other groups, including some labor unions viewed as political, were
 banned. However, student and professional associations have been allowed to oper-
 ate and hold democratic elections. Since the signing of the Declaration of Principles
 in September, Israeli authorities have permitted large-scale rallies in support of the
 agreement in a number of towns. The authorities also permitted several rallies orga-
 nized by opponents of the agreement.
 Private organizations are required to register with the authorities, though some
 operate without licenses. Israeli authorities permitted Palestinian charitable, com-
 munity, professional, and self-help organizations to operate unless their activities
 were viewed as overtly political or supporting the uprising.
 c. Freedom of Religion. -Freedom of religon is respected, and no group or sect is
 banned on religious grounds. Muslim and Christian holy days are observed, as are
 Jewish holy days in Jerusalem and the settlements. All faiths operate schools and
 institutions. Religious publications circulate subject to the laws for publications de-
 scribed in Section 2.a. After the occupied territories were sealed off in March, Mus-
 lim and Christian Palestinians who wanted to visit or attend services at holy places
 in Jerusalem were often unable to obtain permits to enter the city. While some Pal-
 estinians were allowed to travel by bus from the West Bank directly and only to
 the Haram as-Sharif (where the al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques are lo-
 cated) authorities often restricted access by male worshipers under a certain age.
 In April many Palestinian Christians protested the closure of Jerusalem, which
 prevented their attending Easter Rites at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. While
 some congregations refused to apply for permits claiming it would establish a prece-
 dent for Israeli control over holy sites, other Christians did apply and found that
 their applications were denied or delayed. Various sources alleged that Israeli police
 interfered with passing of the "holy fire," one of the most important rituals of the
 Greek Orthodox Church during the Easter season, by extinguishing lanterns that
 worshipers at checkpoints were using to pass the flame among themselves.
 Israei authorities also banned West Bankers and Gazans (even those with per-
 mits) from entering Jerusalem on several major Jewish holidays, citing this as a
 precautionary security measure. These restrictions were not applied to Jewish set-
 tlers in the occupied territories.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Occupied Territories, Foreign Travel, Emigra-
 tion, and Repatriation.-The escalation in violence both in the occupied territories
 and inside Israel during the first 3 months of 1993 led the Government to seal off
 indefinitely the West Bank and Gaza from Jerusalem and Israel on March 29. By
 inhibiting the free movement of goods and people, the closure caused deterioration
 in economic conditions in the occupied territories and disrupted patterns of reli-
 gious, educational, cultural, and family life as well as access to medical care. The
 March 29 closure constitutes the longest period during which the Israeli security
 forces have employed this measure, which was first used in 1991.
 Closure severely constricted Palestinians' freedom of movement between the West
 Bank and East Jerusalem, between the northern and southern sections of the West
 Bank, and between Gaza and the rest of the occupied territories. As during previous
 periods of closure, any Palestinian wishing to enter Jerusalem or Israel must obtain
 a special permit issued by the Civil Administration. Any Palestinian found in Jeru-
 salem without such a permit is subject to a fine (usually the equivalent of about
 $160) or arrest. Because most main roads pass through Jerusalem, closure effec-
 tively divides the West Bank into two parts, with the result that Palestinians from
 the north may not travel to the south without special permission, and vice versa.
 In addition, Gazans may only travel to Jerusalem and the West Bank if they are
 able to obtain permits.
 The closure had a serious effect on the economy of the occupied territories. Of the
 120,000 Palestinians who prior to March 29 worked in Jerusalem or Israel, only
 about half had received permits to resume their employment by year's end. Palestin-
 ian factories in the occupied territories, having lost their markets in Jerusalem and
 Israel, were unable to pay their workers. Unemployment rates in the West Bank
 were estimated at 25 percent before closure and are now estimated at 40 percent.
 
 
 1211
 
 Palestinian businesses and institutions in Jerusalem suffered because their West
 Bank clients were unable to enter the city.
 The IDF states that the number of Palestinian workers who have been issuedper-
 mits since closure (about 52,000), added to the number of Palestinians exempt from
 the permit requirement who work in Jerusalem (15,000), is roughly equal to the
 number of Palestinians (70,000) who had been legally permitted to work in Israel
 and Jerusalem before March 29. The IDF maintains that only Palestinians who had
 been woring illegally in Israel and Jerusalem lost their employment. After closure,
 however, the Israeli Government significantly reduced the number of permits issued
 to unskilled Palestinian day laborers allowed to work in Israel or Jerusalem. Per-
 mit to enter Jerusalem and Israel were valid for periods vaying from a few hours
 to 3 months. Permits were denied for a variety of reasons, including security con-
 cerns and nonpayment of taxes. As of October, the CIVAD had issued 268,309 tem-
 porary permits of varying duration for various purposes to Palestinians from the oc-
 cupied territories who were not employed in Israel or Jerusalem.
 In April Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups issued a joint statement in
 which they condemned the closure. The statement described closure as an illegal col-
 lective punishment of the population of the occupied territories and as "disproper-
 tionate to any legitimate security concern." As noted in Section 2.c., many Muslim
 and Christian Paestinians were denied the right to worship at holy places associ-
 ated with their faith because of closure. The clsr aso affected the movement of
 health care personnel and prevented or slowed the provision of health care services
 to some emergency and critically ill patients in the West Bank and Gaza strip. In
 October Israe[ eased certain restrictions on access to Jerusalem as a "goodwill ges-
 ture." At the end of the year, Palestinians employed in the city, women over 25, men
 over 50, and children under 16 accompanied by a parent were the categories of indi-
 viduals not required to present permits. All Palestinians entering Jerusalem, how-
 ever, were still required to stop at checkpoints and present either their permits or
 identification proving they were exempt from the permit requirement.
 Israeli authorities also continued to issue rgreen" identity cards, which identified
 the bearer as a security risk and precluded travel in or through Jerusalem, as well
 as travel abroad. "Green" cards generally were valid for 6 months, renewable indefi-
 nitely. The issuance of such cards, like administrative detention, is a form of pun-
 ishment without formal charge or trial.
 Tde Israeli authorities continued to impose curfews and military closures as secu-
 rity controls in 1993. Curfews were more frequent in villages and refugee camps
 than in urban areas but occurred less frequently in the West Bank than in previous
 years. Curfews were still used extensively in Gaa in 1993, including the continued
 imposition of a night-time curfew in effect since 1987. Human rights groups criti-
 cized the prolonged curfews, which do not apply to Israeli settlers, as a form of col-
 lective punishment.
 All Palestinians need permits, which require several clearances, in order to travel
 outside the occupied territories, and Israeli authorities have imposed travel restric-
 tioks on certain political activists. However, thousands of Palestinians in the occu-
 pied territories travel abroad each year.
 In 1991 Israeli authorities announced that bridge-crossing permits to Jordan
 could be obtained at post offices without a screening process. In July Israel an-
 nounced that the requirement for Palestinian males crossing the bridge into Jordan
 to remain out of the occupied territories for 9 months no longer a pplied to men
 above the ag of 25. The requirement remained in effect, however, for Palestinian
 males between the ages of 16 and 25. In late 1993, Jordan aghtened restrictions
 on entry, with the result that Palestinians granted permission to travel by Israeli
 authorities were sometimes denied permission to enter Jordan.
 Obstacles to emigration include the inability to obtain a travel permit and the
 fear of losing residency. Restrictions on residence, tourist visas, reentry, and family
 reunification have applied only to Paestinians resident in the occupied territories.
 Israel sometimes refses to renew laissez-passers of Palestinians from the occupied
 territories who live or work abroad, on the grounds that they have abandoned their
 residence, even thouh they may not have acquired foreign citizenship. Palestinians
 who obtain foreign citizens hip ordinarily are not allowed to resume residence in the
 occupied territorie s; those who acquire the right to residence elsewhere or who re-
 main outside the occupied territories for over 3 years are often not permitted to re-
 sume residence. They are permitted to return only as tourists and sometimes are
 denied entry entirely. These restrictions do not apply to Israeli settlers resident in
 the occupied territories. Israeli authorities have limited family reunification for de-
 mogrphic, political, and economic reasons. Most Palestinians who were abroad dur-
 ing the 1967 war (estimated to be one-fourth of the Palestinian population at that
 
 
 1212
 
 time) or who have lost their residence permits for other reasons are not permitted
 to return to reside permanently with their families.
 Permanent residency permission or family reunification has usually been denied
 to foreign-born spouses and children born in the occupied territories to nonresident
 mothers, althouh they were generally allowed to reside as temporary residents
 with renewable permits.
 In August the Israeli Government announced a change in its policy on family re-
 unifications. Following the presentation by human rights groups of a series of peti-
 tions to the Israeli Supreme Court, Israel decided to expand its policy on family re-
 unification for residents of the West Bank and Gaza by offering to consider the cases
 of 6,000 immediate family members who had arrived and applied for visitors' visas
 between June 1990 and November 1992. As of the end of August, the Israeli au-
 thorities had considered 3,249 applications from residents of the West Bank and
 Gaza for family reunification, of which they had approved 723 and denied 861. Still
 pending were 1,781 applications, including 116 held over from previous years. Israel
 also announced it would consider 2,000 new cases annually, allowing the return of
 up to 5,000 persons. However, immediate family members of Palestinian residents
 of East Jerusalem were excluded from the new policy.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The people of the occupied territories do not enjoy this right. Israel's Ministry of
 Defense has ruled the West Bank and Gaza through a military government and civil
 administration. The Government of Israel has not recognized the right of Palestin-
 ians to participate in policy decisions concerning land and resource use and plan-
 ning, taxation, trade, and industry. Israeli authorities have permitted some Pal-
 estinian municipalities, which have approved town lians to issue building permits
 within their boundaries. Municipal elections were last held in 1976 in the West
 Bank; most mayors elected then were later dismissed. Palestinians appointed by Is-
 rael have filled most vacancies.
 On September 13, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed
 a Declaration of Principles on a transfer of authority from Israel to an interim Pal-
 estinian authority. The Declaration lays out a timetable for Israeli withdrawal from
 the Gaza strip and Jericho, scheduled to be completed in early 1994. In addition,
 the declaration calls for the redeployment of Israeli security forces away from popu-
 lated areas in the West Bank by as early as July 1994, which is the target date
 for the election of a Palestinian council, and for the dissolution thereafter of the Is-
 raeli military-backed Civilian Administration (CIVAD), which has administered the
 occupied territories. Through this process, Palestinians will also assume early re-
 sponsibility for governmental functions such as the health sector, educational, cul-
 tural, and social welfare affairs; tourism; and taxation. The Palestinians will also
 create a Palestinian police force for the occupied territories. Israel is to continue to
 control external security as well as security and public order in Israeli settlements,
 foreign relations, and certain other areas until an agreement on permanent status
 is achieved. Although Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem has not been recognized
 internationally, East Jerusalem is governed as part of Israel. Palestinian residents
 of East Jerusalem are permitted to vote in Israeli municipal elections but have
 largely boycotted them.
 No Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem sits on the city council. In the Novem-
 ber municipal election less than 7 percent of Jerusalem's Palestinian population
 voted. According to the Declaration of Principles, negotiations on the final status of
 Jerusalem are scheduled to start by 1996.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Many local groups-Israeli, Palestinian, and mixed-monitor human rights. Is-
 raeli authorities permit their publications and statements to circulate in the occu-
 pied territories, and they are allowed to hold press conferences. Some Palestinian
 human rights workers encountered administrative obstacles to their work in 1993,
 such as denial of permits to enter Jerusalem (where their offices are located) after
 the occupied territories were sealed off in March.
 Although Israel normally permits international human rights groups to visit the
 occupied territories, Israel declined to accept the visit of the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission Special Rapporteur for the occupied territories. The Government stated
 that while Israel has always been open to individuals, groups, and representatives
 of organizations concerned with human rights, Israel was being asked to comply
 with a decision of a body to which, unlike every other U.N. member state, Israel
 cannot be elected because it is not a member of any regional group. Israel generally
 
 
 1213
 cooperates with human rights organizations, and officials are generally available for
 meetings on human rights issues. Some of these organizations, however, find that
 Israel's responses are inadequate. Not all inquiries receive answers, and some
 groups' requests for meetings with officials or access to detention facilities are de-
 nied.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Palestinian women living under military occupation face similar human
 rights problems as do men in tleir contact with Israeli authorities. In addition,
 many Palestinian women face poverty, lack of education, and social repression. Pal-
 estinian society is only now coming to recognize the problem of violence against
 women. A major difficulty in dealing with this highly sensitive issue is lack of re-
 sources: women's organizations are working to raise consciousness and provide help
 and intervention when needed, but funds are not available for shelters or centers.
 The CIVAD has made no significant attempt to relieve the situation, and Palestin-
 ian social institutions have so far failed to focus on the issue.
 Palestinians are governed by a mixture of Jordanian and Egyptian law, British
 mandate law, and Israeli military regulations. There are no laws guaranteeing
 women's rights in the workplace. Palestinian women often work outside the home
 and are prominent in many professions, including medicine, law, and teaching. Per-
 sonal status law for Palestinians is based on religious law. For Muslim Palestinians,
 personal status law is derived from Shari'a (Islamic) law. Women have certain
 rights regarding marriage and divorce, inheritance, property ownership, and chil-
 dren. Man women's rights activists believe, however, that many women are not
 aware of their riZhts and often fai! to demand what is guaranteed to them by law.
 Women's rights groups are active throughout the occupied territories, dealing tra-
 ditionally with social issues (children, health, education) but have more recently
 begun to venture out into practical training, women's rihts education, advocacy
 work, and political activism. The major concern of women s groups is that women
 who have contributed significantly to Palestinian political efforts will be relegated
 to traditional roles in the interim period.
 Children.-There is no pattern of societal abuse of children. Palestinian children
 have, however probably suffered disproportionately from the effects of military oc-
 cupation and dhe intifada. Since the uprising began in 1987, schools, which are often
 overcrowded and underfunded, have been subject to frequent closings by both the
 Israeli authorities and by Palestinian activists enforcing strikes. Political tensions
 and lack of funding have closed most of the few sports and recreation facilities that
 existed for children. Encouraged by political rhetoric and the example of older sib-
 lings, children have been drawn into street violence and have frequently provoked
 it by throwing stones. During 1993, credible sources report that 37 children (aged
 16 and under) were killed by Israeli security forces. While some had been involved
 in demonstrations or rock-throwing incidents, others had been merely in the vicinity
 of clashes when killed.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Under the dual system of governance
 plied to Palestinians and Israelis, Palestinians are treated less favorably than a-
 raeli settlers on a broad range of issues, including the right to due process, resi-
 dency rights, freedom of movement, sale of crops and goods, land and water use,
 and access to health and social services. Since the occupied territories were sealed
 off in March, Muslim and Christian Palestinians have often been denied access to
 holy places associated with their faith while the same restrictions have not applied
 to Jewish settlers (see Section 2.c.). Israeli settlers involved in security violations
 have been treated far more leniently than Palestinians guilty of similar offenses. Of-
 fenses against Israelis are investigated and prosecuted more vigorously than of-
 fenses against Palestinians. Some Israeli agriculture and manufacturing are pro-
 tected against Palestinian competition from the territories, whereas all markets in
 the territories are open to Israelis. Significant disparities exist between personal in-
 come taxes levied on Palestinians versus Israeli settlers.
 Despite tax reforms that took effect in January 1992, the minimum taxable in-
 come applied to Israelis and Palestinians differs markedly: while an Israeli pays no
 tax if his monthly income is below about $1,000, Palestinians are liable for taxes
 on any monthly income in excess of about $250. Corporate tax breaks available to
 Israeli business people in settlements are not applicable to Palestinians. Harsh tax
 enforcement practices, including raids at night backed by Israeli soldiers, are used
 against Palestiniars who attempt to avoid paying taxes. Tax raids directed at busi-
 nesses and individuals typically involve teams of tax inspectors, backed by soldiers,
 who confiscate movable property and cash. Tax raids frequently result in the tem-
 porary confiscation of identity cards as well. According to the Declaration of Prin-
 
 
 1214
 ciples, direct tax authority over non-Israelis will pass to the Palestinian authority
 once the agreement is implemented. As of the endof the year, transfer of that au-
 thority and other powers had not yet been agreed.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no mandated provision of accessibility for the
 disabled in the occupied territories. While some Palestinian institutions for the care
 and training of disabled persons exist, they generally suffer from chronic
 underfunding. This sector has received little attention from Israel.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 The applicable sections for West Bank and Gaza Palestinians working in Israel
 are contained in the countr report for Israel.
 a. The Right of Association.-The labor law in the West Bank is Jordanian Law
 No. 21 of 1965, as amended by military orders. It permits workers to join unions
 without government authorization. It also permits formation of unions by any group
 of 20 or more workers from the same trade or workplace, with prior government au-
 thorization.
 Nevertheless, Israeli authorities in the West Bank require all proposed new
 unions to apply for a permit. During 1993 two new unions were formed, but no new
 unions were licensed by the authorities. Israeli authorities have licensed 31 unions
 out of approximately 125 unions functioning in the West Bank.
 The labor law in Gaza is Egyptian Military Order No. 331, which supplements
 the prior British Mandate labor law and which has been amended by Israeli mili-
 tary orders. It allows the organization of unions on a workplace or craft basis. Since
 1979, unions have been permitted to operate under strictly enforced restrictions that
 permit only the 6 unions that existed in 1967 to function in Gaza, under an um-
 brella organization.
 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem are governed by the same law as workers
 in Israel and are free to establish their own labor unions. The Israeli authorities
 officially bar East Jerusalem unions from joining the West Bank trade union federa-
 tions, though this restriction has not been enforced. Individual Palestinian workers
 in East Jerusalem may belong to both local unions, some of which are affiliated with
 a West Bank federation, and the Israeli Histadrut Labor Federation.
 West Bank unions are not affiliated with the Israeli Histadrut Labor Federation.
 Palestinian workers who are not resident in Israel or East Jerusalem are prevented
 by government order from being full members of Histadrut. Nevertheless, all legal
 Palestinian workers in Israel are required to contribute an agency fee of 1 percent
 of their wages to Histadrut. Palestinian workers also are required to contribute to
 the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) which provides worker benefits, e.g., unem-
 ployment, old age, maternity, and disability from occupational accidents. Palestinian
 workers are not eligible for all NIS benefits. (Israeli authorities maintain that the
 Palestinians receive tax allowances and benefits through CIVAD investment pro-
 grams which adequately compensate Palestinian workers.) The 1993 International
 abor Organization (ILO) Director General's report noted that: "Contrary to what
 is maintained by the Israeli authorities, there is not a country in the world that
 excludes such a high number of workers living outside its territory from full social
 protection-which is paid for by workers and employers-solely on the grounds that
 their place of residence is outside the national territory."
 The rat majority of West Bank unions belong to either the General Federation
 of Trade Unions in the West Bank (GFTU) or the General Federation of Trade
 Unions in the West Bank - Workers' Unity Bloc (WUB). Membership in the West
 Bank unions was estimated at 100 000 in 1992, but deteriorating economic condi-
 tions and the cloture of the occupied territories significantly reduced union member-
 ship in 1993. According to the 1993 ILO Director General's report, membership in
 the GFTU (the largest federation of unions) at most numbered 63,000, of whom only
 19,000 were full dues-paying members. The four principal trade union blocs in the
 West Bank, including the WUB, told an ILO mission that they were moving toward
 a full reunification of the GFTU. The General Federation of Trade Unions of the
 Gaza Strip consists of the six registered unions. The GITU participates in meetings
 of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions (ICATU), although it is not
 formally affiliated. Both the GFTU and the WUB have applied for membership in
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The GFTU and the
 Gaza Federation began a dialog in 1993 with the Histadrut as a result of the Dec-
 laration of Principles.
 The West Bank unions are independent of the Government of Israel. However,
 union organizations do reflect the prevailing Palestinian political factions. Israeli
 authorities tend to view unions more as political organizations than as labor unions
 and occasionally inhibit union activities in the West Bank and Gaza. Union leaders
 have been subject to harassment ranging from arrests and administrative detention
 
 
 1215
 
 to interrogation, denial of travel permits, and the refusal of telephone and fax facili-
 ties.
 Citing the reports of the ILO, the ICFTU's annual report for 1993 observed that
 a general fear of intimidation and possible arrest by the Israeli authorities for par-
 ticipation in union activities inhibits the development of union membership in the
 territories. Like all organizations in the territories, Palestinian labor organizations
 are subject to disciplinary measures for engaging in political activities. All meetings
 of 10 or more non-Israeli citizens in the territories must have prior CIVAD approval.
 During 1993, however, unions were able to conduct meetings without reported inter-
 ference. The Gaza Federation was able in 1992 to hold its first May Day since 1967.
 According to the ILO's report, however, CIVAD told the ILO mission that the IDF
 had prevented fundamentalists from establishing what they considered to be a trade
 union front in Ramallah.
 Military Order 825 of 1980, officially applied in the West Bank and unofficially
 in Gaza, requires that Palestinian unions present lists of candidates for union office
 to the CIVAD for approval 30 days before elections. The order authorizes the CIVAD
 to remove from the lists any candidates who have been convicted of a felony, includ-
 ing those sentenced for seL-rity offenses. Despite this restriction, nearly half a
 dozen West Bank trade unions held elections in 1992. West Bank unions held no
 elections in 1993 due to internal organizational difficulties and uncertainty about
 how the newly approved peace accords would affect labor law and union structure.
 There has been no dissolution of unions by administrative or legislative action.
 Under prevailing labor law, unions have the right to strike only after submitting
 a complaint to the CIVAD for mandatory arbitration. Only one abbreviated strike
 in the West Bank occurred in 1993, and the Israeli authorities did not interfere.
 There are no laws that specifically protect the rights of striking workers, and, in
 practice, such workers have little or no protection from employers' retribution.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-A majority of workers in the
 occupied territories are self-employed or unpaid family helpers in agriculture or
 commerce. Only 40 percent of employment in the territories consists of wage jobs,
 most in services provided by CIVAD, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
 (UNRWA), or municipalities. Collective bargaining is protected. The CIVAD does not
 record collective agreements because it does not recognize some unions and union
 leaders. However, most union-employer agreements are honored without inter-
 ference from the authorities; approximately 60 are currently in force in the West
 Bank. According to the ILO Director General's report, several labor committees, con-
 sisting of 3 to 5 members each in businesses employing more than 20 workers, have
 been formed to mediate labor grievances. The Center for Trade Union Rights,
 headquartered in Bethlehem, is also active in conducting labor courses and working
 with many different trade unions on the spectrum of labor-related issues. Existing
 laws and regulations do not offer real protection against antiunion discrimination.
 The labor dispute ordinance of 1972 established a process for settling labor disputes
 in general but does not deal specifically with antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones in the occupied territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor in the occupied territories.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-A 1978 military order raised the
 minimum working age in the West Bank and Gaza to 14. This order is not effec-
 tively enforced, and underage labor is used in the agricultural sector and in some
 West Bank and Gaza factories. Hours of young workers are not limited compared
 to the regular work force.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage provision in the
 West Bank or Gaza. In the West Bank, Jordanian law allows for a maximum work-
 week of 48 hours with a required 24-hour rest period, except for certain hotel, food
 service, and cinema employees, whose workweek is 54 hours. In Gaza, Israeli au-
 thorities amended this law to provide for a 45-hour workweek for day laborers and
 a 40-hour week for salaried employees. There is no effective enforcement of maxi-
 mum workweek laws.
 The Ministry of Labor's Office of Inspection services is charged with enforcing
 health and safety standards in the West Bank and Gaza and claims to have under-
 taken a small number of inspections. Health and safety conditions in some factories
 do not meet industry standards established by international labor organizations.
