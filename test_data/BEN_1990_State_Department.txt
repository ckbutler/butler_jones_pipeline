 BENIN
 In the Republic of Benin in 1990, the single-party,
 military-dominated regime, which had been in place for the
 past 17 years, came to an end. Widespread public discontent
 with the old regime, which manifested itself in 1989 in
 strikes and demonstrations, reached a climax at the beginning
 of the year. In February a National Reform Conference voted
 to set the country on a democratic, multiparty course.
 Although President Mathieu Kerekou remained the Chief of State
 during 1990, the Government was directed by a civilian
 transition team led by Prime Minister Nicephore Soglo, who was
 chosen by the February Conference. A 22-member High Council
 of the Republic acted as the interim parliamentary arm. Some
 24 political parties were founded during 1990 and actively
 prepared to contest March 1991 legislative and presidential
 elections. A new Constitution was approved by referendum on
 December 2. Local mayoral elections were held in November.
 Benin's armed forces number approximately 6,000 personnel and
 are under the direction of the civilian Prime Minister, who is
 also Minister of Defense. In addition to the regular army,
 there are small navy, air force, and national gendarmerie
 contingents. The once dominant Beninese military maintained a
 low profile in 1990. The Beninese militia was formally
 dissolved in June. A national conference on military
 restructuring transferred control of the police, customs
 forces, and foresters to civilian ministries in April. The
 Government also decreed that soldiers could disobey a
 superior's order if that order would lead to a violation of
 human rights. Prime Minister Soglo has called for a
 professional, depoliticized military oriented toward civic
 action, development, and antismuggling controls.
 Benin's underdeveloped economy is largely based on subsistence
 agriculture, cotton production, regional trade, and small-
 scale offshore oil production. In accordance with World Bank
 and International Monetary Fund agreements, Benin has
 undertaken a number of austerity reforms, including
 elimination of many state-owned corporations, reduction of
 fiscal expenditure, deregulation of trade, and expansion of
 the private sector. Despite these measures, Benin's small
 modern economy remained depressed in 1990 due to falling world
 prices for local exports, high debt service charges, and
 widespread unemployment.
 In Benin, 1990 was a watershed year for human rights. The
 transition Government released all remaining political
 prisoners in March, encouraged freedom of expression,
 facilitated the return of Beninese political exiles to
 participate in the reform process, and oversaw the development
 of a new Constitution that provides for many human rights
 safeguards, including a prohibition of torture. The
 Government also invited several international monitoring
 organizations to Benin during the year; welcomed in March the
 formation of a nongovernmental monitoring organization, the
 National Human Rights Commission; and assisted a newly formed
 association of former political prisoners, which sponsored a
 human rights forum in May. In general, the transition
 Government committed itself to establish a solid legal
 foundation in support of human rights during the period
 leading to national elections which, if fully implemented,
 will signifcantly enhance the respect for human rights in
 Benin.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance in 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The new Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment, and there were no reports of torture or
 inhuman punishment in 1990. Public attention focused on past
 incidents of torture. In April the media gave heavy coverage
 to former political prisoners and presented detailed reports
 on their mistreatment. The official government radio
 discussed the case of Remy Akpopo Glele, a "prisoner of
 conscience" championed by Amnesty International (AI).
 Television interviews with former prisoners shocked viewers
 with camera close-ups of scarring and disfigurement caused by
 torture.
 Civilian prison conditions in Benin remained very poor.
 Sanitation and medical facilities are deficient, and the
 prison diet is grossly inadequate. In July the official state
 newspaper published an expose of squalid prison conditions at
 the Athieme prison, citing severe overcrowding, structural
 faults, and inadequate medical care.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrest or detention in
 1990. The democratic Reform Conference led directly to a
 general amnesty in March for the 44 remaining political
 detainees. A visiting AI team in May noted that there were no
 remaining political prisoners in Benin.
 On March 6, President Kerekou signed a decree permitting
 political exiles to return to Benin without restrictions or
 fear of reprisal. The decree also returned all previously
 confiscated property to the exiles. Following promulgation of
 the decree, many exiles returned to Benin. One of the most
 celebrated of the returnees was Lieutenant Colonel Francois
 Kouyami, former head of the security service. Imprisoned in
 1988 for supporting a coup attempt against President Kerekou,
 Kouyami later escaped and fled to Nigeria. He returned to
 Benin on April 14. The new Constitution includes a provision
 which specifically prohibits the Government from exiling any
 Beninese citizen.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Benin's legal-system is based on French civil and local
 customary law. A civilian court system operates on the
 provincial and national levels. Defendants have the right to
 be present at their trial and the right to an attorney (at
 public expense, if neccesary). Under the.new Constitution,
 the highest courts are the Constitutional Court and the
 
 
 BENIN
 Supreme Court. In theory, the Constitutional Court will judge
 the constitutionality of Beninese laws, monitor human rights
 in the legal system, and act as a counterbalance to other
 branches of the Government.
 The Supreme Court has ultimate jurisdiction over all other
 administrative and judicial matters, and is the final recourse
 in all legal cases. The new Constitution also provides for a
 special High Court of Justice to preside over cases of high
 treason or crimes committed against the nation by government
 officials. The Reform Conference officially condemned and
 terminated the old regime's practice of assigning political
 appointees, so-called nonprofessional judges, to judicial
 positions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home
 and requires that police obtain a warrant from a judge before
 entering a residence. No violations were reported in 1990.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The new Constitution provides for freedom of'expression and of
 the press and other media. During 1990 the Beninese freely
 discussed politics in public and private forums. The
 Government continued to own and operate the local radio and
 television stations and 1 daily newspaper, but more than 18
 independent private newpapers, representing a wide variety of
 viewpoints, made their media debut. La Croix, a weekly paper
 published by the Catholic church, and Eco-Magazine, a monthly
 journal of opinion, circulated throughout West Africa. In the
 past, the official media carried stories approved by and
 serving the interests of the State. In 1990 media criticism
 of government policies became common, with candid political
 debate dominating the independent press.
 Under the new policy of governmental openness, the official
 media were also given considerable leeway to criticize the
 Government directly. The press and television aired widely
 diverging views on the constitutional referendum and reported
 on all political parties, including the Communist Party of
 Dahomey, which had been banned under the previous regime.
 Local television, radio, and press also played a major role
 in revealing past human rights abuses, including torture (see
 Section l.c.).
 There was no censorship of foreign books or artistic works.
 Foreign periodicals were widely available on newsstands, and
 much of the population listened to foreign broadcasts on
 shortwave radio. Foreign radio broadcasts were not jammed.
 In general, academic freedom is enjoyed by the schools and
 Benin's sole university. University professors are permitted
 to lecture freely in their subject areas, conduct research,
 draw independent conclusions, and form unions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In 1990 the transition Government permitted the formation of a
 large number of political, service, professional, and other
 organizations. A multiparty charter signed on August 13
 
 
 BENIN
 authorized the registration of independent political parties
 and outlined the implementation of democratic principles in
 political life (see Section 3).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions coexist in
 Benin, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer any
 special status or benefit. There are no restrictions on
 religious ceremonies, teachings, foreign clergy, or conversion
 to any religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is unrestricted. In 1990 the Government
 dismantled police and gendarmerie roadblocks to facilitate
 free movement. Passport and exit permits needed for travel
 outside of West African countries are not difficult to
 obtain. Emigration is common. Beninese live and work in
 neighboring countries without jeopardizing their citizenship.
 Benin welcomes all refugees and helps them integrate into
 Beninese society if they choose not to return to their country
 of origin. Benin's refugee population declined in 1990,
 reflecting continued voluntary repatriation. According to the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
 identified refugees in Benin numbered 611 in July. Of these,
 582 were Chadians who had fled the fighting in their country.
 Although some have chosen to settle in Benin, many returned to
 Chad with the help of the UNHCR. The Government imposes no
 restriction on the return of refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 During 17 years of authoritarian, single-party rule, the
 Beninese were unable to change their government. However, in
 1990 the transition Government laid the groundwork for
 multiparty democracy in which citizens should be able to
 select and change their government through election. The
 National Reform Conference denounced the former single-party
 system and called for a political system based on the rule of
 law and democratic pluralism. The Reform Conference organized
 a transition government comprised mainly of technocrats and
 set a 12-month timetable for free national elections.
 A multiparty charter signed into law on August 13 authorized
 the formation of independent political parties and defined the
 regulations for founding and organizing political parties.
 Special attention was given to regional representation in
 parties. The charter mandates that a party's membership must
 be national in scope and not limited to any particular
 geographic area, ethnic group, or religion. The charter also
 directs all parties to defend democracy, national sovereignty,
 fundamental liberties, and individual rights. The charter
 declares illegal any party which does not respect fundamental
 human rights and bans parties espousing violence in any form.
 Upon registration with the Ministry of the Interior, political
 parties may establish a headquarters, organize activities, and
 publish materials. By the end of 1990, some 24 political
 parties had been formed. The fogmer single party, the
 People's Revolutionary Party of Benin, was formally dissolved
 on April 30. The first national legislative and presidential
 elections are scheduled for February and March 1991.
 
 
 BENIN
 The drafting of a new constitution was a stated primary goal
 of the transition Government. Approved in a national
 referendum in December, Benin's new Constitution proclaims the
 principle of "government of the people, by the people, for the
 people." It declares that the Beninese State is based on the
 rule of law and democratic pluralism, in which human rights,
 individual liberties, and justice for all are guaranteed. The
 Constitution empowers the Beninese freely to elect their
 leaders and representatives and to exercise sovereignty
 through popular referendums. The document grants universal
 suffrage to all Beninese over the age of 18. The Constitution
 further grants an elected president-who will lead the
 Government-a 5-year term, renewable only once. An extensive
 system of checks and balances among the executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches is set in the new
 Constitution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In the past, the Government had discouraged the operation of
 independent local human rights groups. However, on March 30,
 a 45-member nongovernmental Human Rights Commission became
 active. Conceived as an internal monitoring organization, the
 Commission as well as the Government stress this group's
 independence from the State. As its primary goal, the
 Commission seeks to promote and safeguard human rights in
 Benin through close study of national and international human
 rights conventions, investigation of alleged human rights
 violations, and implementation of national educational
 campaigns on human rights. Other private groups, including
 the African Jurists Association and the Association of Former
 Prisoners and Victims of Repression, specifically concern
 themselves with human rights issues.
 Before 1990, the Government considered proposed investigations
 of human rights practices by outside groups to be unwarranted
 interference in internal Beninese affairs. However, the
 transition Government facilitated several international
 investigations of human rights in the past year, including, in
 July by the West German Parliamentary Subcommittee for Human
 Rights and an International Committee of the Red Cross
 delegation. A team from Al visited Benin in May and
 subsequently congratulated Prime Minister Soglo and the
 transition Government for the progress in respecting human
 rights.in Benin.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on the above factors is prohibited in the
 new Constitution and by law, and there is no evidence of
 officially sanctioned discrimination. In August the High
 Council of the Republic ratified the U.N. Convention on the
 Elimination of Discrimination against Women. It also ratified
 U.N. Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic,
 Social, and Cultural Rights.
 The new Constitution states that women are by law the equals
 of men in the political, economic, cultural, and social
 spheres, and the Government officially encourages
 opportunities for women. However, while Beninese women play a
 major role in the commercial sector, in rural areas they have
 traditionally occupied a subordinate role-and, in particular,
 
 
 14
 BENIN
 have not enjoyed the same educational opportunities as men.
 While no studies are available, violence against women,
 including wife beating, occurs, although it is prohibited in
 the newly revised family code. Civil penalties may be applied
 in cases of domestic violence, but the police and courts are
 often reluctant to intervene, considering such affairs to be
 "family matters."
 According to several local medical practitioners, the practice
 of female circumcision is not widespread in Benin. However,
 published reports in the United States suggest that about 20
 percent of the female population is subject to this practice,
 mostly in the northern part of the country. The Government is
 making efforts to eradicate this practice through an
 educational campaign conducted by government health workers,
 and there are signs that the practice is diminishing.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The new Constitution provides for the freedom to organize, to
 meet, and to strike, and the Ministry of Justice is working
 with local legal experts to revise and update a number of
 laws, including the labor code. Approximately 75 percent of
 wage earners belong to organized labor unions. Labor was a
 driving force in a 14-month national general strike that
 paralyzed the country and largely precipitated February's
 national democratic reform actions. In March the unions ended
 the general strike and lent support to the democratization
 process.
 Until February the only legally recognized trade union
 federation in the country was the National Workers' Union of
 Benin (UNSTB), which was closely linked to the Government and
 the ruling party with its long-held Marxist/Leninist
 philosophy. Anticipating the February reforms, the UNSTB
 declared its independence from the political party in
 January. In March the UNSTB voted to break its affiliation
 with the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade
 Unions. The UNSTB currently represents 42 of Benin's 80 trade
 unions. The remaining 38 declared themselves independent and
 began to form other independent trade union federations.
 Unions are free to join international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Beninese Labor Code provides for collective bargaining.
 Individual labor unions are authorized to negotiate with
 employers on labor matters and represent workers"grievances
 to both employers and to the Government, with the Government
 often voluntarily acting as arbitrator. Unions in the
 education, hotel, and petroleum sectors exercised these rights
 frequently during the year, entering into productive
 negotiation with employers. The Labor Code prohibits
 employers from taking union membership or activity into
 account when making decisions on hiring, work distribution,
 professional or vocational training, or dismissals. There are
 as yet no export processing zones. Labor laws and practice
 are the same throughout the country.
 
 
 BENIN
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by Article 3 of the
 Labor Code and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Code prohibits the employment or apprenticeship of
 children under the age of 18 in any enterprise. However,
 enforcement by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs is erratic, and child labor does occur,
 especially in rural areas. Some child labor occurs in urban
 areas, primarily in the informal sector. For example, street
 vendors of newspapers, smuggled petroleum products, and
 foodstuffs are frequently under the age of 16. Children below
 the age of 14 often work on family farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Benin's labor force of 2.0 million (out of a population of 4.7
 million) is primarily employed in agriculture (80 percent),
 with less than 2 percent of the population involved in the
 industrial (wage) sector. For the wage sector, the labor code
 establishes a 40-hour workweek and sets a minimum wage of
 approximately $40 per month. The minimum wage level is
 sufficent to provide only rudimentary food and housing for a
 family and must be supplemented by subsistence farming or
 petty trade in the informal sector if a family is to enjoy a
 decent living. The Government supports policies designed to
 improve the conditions of workers in both the agricultural and
 industrial sectors. For example, it has declared its intent
 to provide free or low-cost medical care and social services.
 Stringent occupational'health and safety standards have
 already been established in the Labor Code. The Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs is responsible for enforcement of
 labor laws and regulations, but a number of factors, including
 a lack of inspectors and high unemployment, have resulted in
 erratic enforcement.
