 JORDAN
 Jordan's Constitution declares Jordan a hereditary monarchy and
 gives the King broad powers. Governments are formed and dissolved
 at his command, and he remains the ultimate arbiter of policy.
 Organized political parties are not permitted. The Communist Party
 is prohibited by law. According to the Constitution, there is
 provision for a council of ministers (Cabinet) and an independent
 judiciary. It also provides for a National Assembly consisting of
 an appointed 30-member Senate (Council of Notables) and a
 Parliament (Council of Deputies) of 60 members elected from both
 the East and West Banks of the Jordan River. The Senate was given
 the power to approve laws placed before it, while the Parliament
 had the ability to propose, amend, or reject laws. Both chambers,
 however, were overshadowed by the King and his Cabinet. The
 Parliament was dissolved in 1976 after falling into disuse when the
 1967 war made elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
 impossible. The Senate continues to function. Following the
 dissolution of the Parliament, the King instituted an appointed
 National Consultative Council in 1978 to study and debate bills and
 to render its advice and opinion to the Cabinet. It lacks
 authority to make policy or to amend, approve, or reject bills.
 On January 5, 1984, the Jordanian Government announced the
 dissolution of the National Consultative Council and the
 reconvening of the Parliament, effective January 9.
 The modern state of Jordan emerged from the British mandate
 following the First World War, the 1948 war which established the
 State of Israel, and the 1967 war which ended with Israel's
 occupation of the West Bank, formally annexed by Jordan in 1950. A
 participant in the 1948 and 1967 wars, Jordan gave shelter to a
 large number of Palestinian refugees following each of those
 conflicts. Tensions between the Palestinians and native Jordanians
 boiled over into Civil War in 1970. The Government was able to
 reestablish its control over the country and has maintained
 internal security since that period through authoritarian use of a
 strong military, public security force (police), and General
 Intelligence Directorate. Oversight of the media, surveillance of
 activities which the Government believes could pose security risks,
 the abolition of political parties, and the power to detain
 individuals without charge (allowed by the state of martial law
 declared by the Government) are all used by the Government to
 insure internal security.
 While qualified by the state of martial law proclaimed in 1973 and
 currently in force in Jordan, the Constitution affirms the
 integrity of the person in Jordan. There have been no
 substantiated reports in 1983 of politically motivated killings,
 disappearances, torture, or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment. Invasion of the home is prohibited except by
 court-issued warrant. Under martial law, persons may be detained
 without trial or charge for indefinite periods; however, limited
 use is made of this power. Martial law courts provide the same
 guarantees as do the civil courts, but in practice do not grant
 bail.  The civil and military courts provide for public trial and
 appeal.
 Political parties have been banned since 1957 and the Parliament
 was dissolved in 1976. Elections are freely held for most
 municipal and local councils and mayors.

 1306
 Jordan has an essentially free enterprise economy with limited, but
 growing, government participation in some sectors, largely in basic
 industries. It exercises control over some goods in the
 marketplace, notably foodstuffs. The country has very few natural
 resources and relies on foreign assistance and remittances from
 workers abroad for the greater part of its foreign exchange needs.
 Although Jordan is a poor country with a developing economy, it has
 enjoyed healthy growth for the past decade and, partially due to
 the large number of Jordanians working abroad, has had little
 unemployment. Economic stability and development have been
 enhanced by the fact that Palestinian refugees have been given
 Jordanian citizenship and participate fully in Jordan's economic
 and social life. Despite occasional tensions between
 Palestinian-Jordanians and the East Bank Trans-Jordanians,
 relations between the two communities are generally good. Because
 of Jordan's dependence on outside sources of funding, the
 foundations of the economy are fragile. Faced with declining
 foreign assistance and a weakening world economy, the country's
 economic growth slowed in 1983.
 Jordan has a relatively high average annual income. Annual per
 capita Gross National Product is $1,700. The majority of its
 population are free from hunger and have adequate shelter, although
 approximately 10 percent of the population are Palestinian refugees
 who still live in shelters supervised by the U.N. Relief and Works
 Agency (U.NR.W.A.).
 With mandatory free education through 9th grade, the population is
 largely literate with a significantly high level of university
 graduates.
 Although Jordan is constitutionally an Islamic state, freedom of
 religion is afforded by law and is enjoyed in practice. The King's
 support for religious tolerance plays an important role in assuring
 religious harmony.
 Jordanian law treats men and women equally, except in matters such
 as marriage and inheritance, where, under Islamic law, women are
 afforded some rights not equal to the rights of men. Middle
 Eastern traditions, in some instances, further constrain women's
 freedoms.
 The human rights situation in Jordan has not changed significantly
 since the end of the 1970 Civil War. The only change in 1983 was
 the adoption of a decree which provided for penalties up to death
 for continued participation in the "Village Leagues", rural-based,
 quasi-political organizations encouraged by the Civil
 Administration on the West Bank. While sentences of imprisonment
 have been passed in absentia on several West Bank residents, they
 have not been carried out as the defendants have not come to Jordan.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 No politically motivated killings have been recorded in 1983.
 There have been a very few attempted or actual killings for
 political purposes in the past few years. The perpetrators in the
 few identified cases may have been acting under the orders or
 influence of a foreign government. The Government actively tries
 to prevent such acts.
 
 
 1307
 Summary executions do not occur in Jordan. Jordanian law provides
 for trial in absentia of Arabs who sell West Bank property to the
 "enemy: (defined as an Israeli citizen, resident of Israel, or
 Israeli corporation) or who participate in the "Village Leagues" on
 the West Bank. The maximum penalty for this crime is death.
 Although such trials have occurred, and the death penalty has been
 pronounced in some cases, there is no record that it has ever been
 carried out.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances reported in 1983. The security forces
 do not secretly abduct people; however, they are empowered to
 detain people without trial. In such cases, family members can
 obtain information on the whereabouts of their relatives;
 government authorities are not under legal obligation to attempt to
 notify the family members of those detained.
 c. Torture or Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No constitutional provision or law specifically forbids torture.
 The law which regulates the treatment of prisoners, guarantees that
 they receive medical treatment and provides for inspection of
 prisons in order to insure that healthful conditions prevail in
 them. No accusations of torture are known to have been made in
 1983 other than the unspecified comment by Freedom House citing
 "instances of torture." There is no evidence that governmental
 authorities condone or practice torture.
 Jordanian law provides for the decent treatment of prisoners.
 While spartan, prison conditions are not designed to be
 intentionally degrading. A new, modern complex is currently being
 built to replace Amman's old, inadequate, and cramped Mahatta
 Prison. There appears to be no discrimination according to
 religion or social class in the treatment of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Martial law, most recently reaffirmed in 1973, has been in force
 for much of the last 20 years. Under martial law, the executive
 authority has the power to detain persons idefinitely without
 trial. The security forces use the detention provisions of martial
 law to detain individuals suspected of cross-border infiltration or
 security offenses. A detained person may take his case to the High
 Court of Justice (an administrative tribunal) to argue that his
 detention on security grounds is not justified. Martial law does
 not provide for habeas corpus.
 IA recent years the Government has made limited use of its
 detention powers. While exact statistics are unavailable, it
 appears that several dozen people were detained in 1983 for periods
 ranging from a few days to several months. Detainees are held in
 conditions similar to those in which common criminals are held.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both civilian and military courts operate under normal law.. In
 addition, martial law courts are established under the provisions
 of martial law. The jurisdiction of the systems is clearly defined
 in law, with the martial law court responsible for crimes such as
 espionage, bribery of public officials, trafficking in narcotics or
 weapons, black marketeering, and security offenses. The civil
 courts retain jurisdiction for most other-crimes. Military courts
 prosecute military personnel for all categories of offenses.
 
 
 1308
 Although the martial law court is not bound to observe normal rules
 of evidence or procedure, generally.accepted legal practices are
 observed. Accordingly, defendants before this court are
 represented by legal counsel and may cross-examine witnesses. The
 three judges currently sitting on the martial law court all have
 legal education, as does the military prosecutor. Sentences of the
 martial law court may not be appealed, but they must be ratified by
 the Prime Minister in his capacity as Martial Law Governor. The
 Prime Minister has the authority to increase, reduce, or annul any
 martial law sentence. In practice, cases are reviewed for fairness
 by his legal adviser or the Minister of Justice before the Prime
 Minister makes a decision. Individuals charged in martial law
 courts are not customarily granted bail. Martial law trials in
 general are handled more expeditiously than civilian trials.
 Under the civilian court system, cases must be reviewed by the
 public prosecutor's office within 24 hours of an arrest. The
 prosecutor must determine that sufficient evidence exists to
 warrant prosecuting the accused. The prosecutor then turns the
 case over to the Attorney General's office, which prepares a formal
 bill of indictment if satisfied that enough evidence exists to
 warrant prosecution.
 At all stages in this process, the accused is entitled to be
 represented by legal counsel. Many defendants are unaware of this
 right and fail to exercise it. The "Law of Criminal Procedure"
 specifies court appointment of lawyers for defendants who cannot
 obtain their own lawyers.
 Judges are selected by a board composed of members of the High
 Court of Justice, a representative of the Attorney General's
 office, and the Undersecretary of Justice (the senior civil servant
 in the ministry) and must prove competence in the law through a
 written examination. Judges may only be removed from office on
 grounds of specific transgression of the law and after a hearing
 before a disciplinary board (made up of a membership similar to
 that of the selection panel).
 In addition to martial and civil law, Muslim religious law
 (Shari'a) plays an important role in Jordanian life and society.
 Rights of inheritance, child custody, conduct between neighbors,
 and women's personal status are largely adjudicated according to
 Shari'a law.  In accordance with Muslim tradition, polygamy is
 permitted though not widely practiced. A man may divorce by
 unilateral repudiation.
 A separate Shari'a court system exists to resolve disputes between
 Muslim parties in cases dealing with subjects such as divorce,
 alimony, and inheritances. Christian religious courts handle
 similar cases between Christians. Cases between individuals of
 differing religions are handled by the civil court system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Arbitrary entry of private homes by the authorities is against the
 law, and no reported cases have occurred. Search and arrest
 require warrants except in cases of hot pursuit. While there is a
 strong cultural tradition of respect for the privacy of the home
 and individuals, there is also general popular belief that the
 Government could be engaged in surveillance and tampering of the
 mails.
 
 
 1309
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees the freedoms of speech and press except
 that in the event of the declaration or martial law or a state of
 emergency, a limited censorship on newspapers, pamphlets, books,
 and broadcasts in matters affecting public safety or national
 Idefense may be imposed by law. The radio and television systems
 are owned and operated by the Government. Private newspapers and
 periodicals (which are all subject to government influence)
 practice a form of self-censorship. Ministry officials meet often
 with the press to provide general guidelines on government
 positions. Low-key media criticism of the Government's domestic
 policies occurs occasionally. While the press generally reflects
 the Government's position on major foreign policy and security
 issues there have been a number of instances during the past year
 when papers have taken an attitude differing from that of the
 Government. Journalists are required to register with the Ministry
 of Information and become members of the Journalists Association.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely available, although
 subject to infrequent censorship. Pornographic materials are
 banned.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All organizations must obtain government approval prior to
 establishment. Persons who demonstrate without first obtaining a
 permit are liable to be dispersed or detained by the police;
 permits to demonstrate are rarely granted. Formally organized
 associations are subject to the laws of their establishment.
 Political parties are not permitted; charters of other
 organizations may not include political objectives. Government
 surveillance of public meetings, university activities, and
 organization gatherings is routinely carried out.
 Jordanians may freely join labor unions and professional
 organizations. Such associations require government license, but
 these are granted routinely for groups which are not overtly
 political. Unions and associations are permitted to defend the
 interests of their members, and their officers are freely elected
 by the membership. Unions routinely participate in international
 labor organizations such as the International Labor Organization,
 Arab Labor Organization, and International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions and take part in their conferences. Strikes are
 legal; however, the Ministry of Labor must be notified in advance
 (14 days for small firms, 28 days for large firms). During this
 period, the Ministry attempts to arbitrate. If these efforts fail,
 employees may strike and have done so.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam, the state religion, is followed by the great majority of
 Jordanians. The Constitution guarantees freedom of worship.
 Persecution or harassment of Christians (about five percent of the
 population) or other minorities is against the law as well as
 government policy and practice. The only restraint on non-Muslims
 is a prohibition against proselytizing among Muslims. There
 appears to be little difference between adherents of the religions
 in social or economic status. Neverthelegs, some tensions do exist
 between the Islamic and Christian communities. Christians are
 represented in the Government and military roughly in proportion to
 
 
 1310
 their share of the population, although traditionally, the most
 senior positions are reserved for Muslims.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within the country (with the exception of certain military
 zones) is unobstructed. With a few exceptions, the Government does
 not restrict emigration or travel abroad by its nationals.
 Women and minor children are required to have written consent of
 their husband, father, or oldest male relative in order to obtain a
 passport. Such persons traveling alone generally are presumed by
 the authorities to have written permission to travel.
 Jordan has faced a long-term refugee problem due to the influxes of
 Palestinians homeless as a result of the Arab-Israeli wars in 1948
 and 1967. In 1983 Jordan's budget outlay for refugees was $25
 million. According to the most recent U.N.R.W.A. statistics,
 refugees and their descendants on the East Bank of the Jordan River
 now total approximately one million. Of these refugees,
 approximately 230,000 now live in refugee camps. This total does
 not include a large but undetermined number of other persons from
 the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or the State of Israel, who have
 settled in Jordan since 1948. All of these people have been
 granted Jordanian citizenship and have the unrestricted right to
 live, work, and own property in Jordan.
 There are no restrictions on these or any other citizens who might
 wish to return to Jordan after a period spent residing abroad.
 Jordanians who have traveled or studied abroad, especially in
 Communist countries, often have their passports taken by the
 General Intelligence Directorate upon their return to Jordan.
 Passports are returned after the travelers answer questions
 relating to security matters, espionage, and contacts with
 Communists.
 Jordan allows the movement of peoples between the East Bank and
 Israeli-occupied territories. In doing so, the Government has
 reminded its critics that such travel is humanitarian, helps
 maintain West Bank-Arab ties, and is economically advantageous to
 the inhabitants of the occupied territories.
 Jordan recognizes the right of asylum even in cases which have
 resulted in strained relations with neighboring states.
 Section 3   Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Jordan is a hereditary monarchy in which the King possesses a
 monopoly of political power. Governments are formed and dissolved
 at his command, and he remains the ultimate arbiter of policy.
 Organized political parties are not permitted in Jordan. The
 Communist Party is prohibited by law. According to the
 Constitution, there should be an appointed Senate and Parliament
 elected by universal suffrage by secret ballot. The Parliament was
 dissolved in 1976.
 In a November 1983 interview King Hussein stated that Jordan would
 restore an elected Parliament. The announcement came January 5,
 . 1984 and it was expected that the Parliament would be reconvened
 and hold its first meeting in early January.
 
 
 1311
 In 1978, King Hussein established a National Consultative Council
 with appointed members selected to represent the various geographic
 regions and social, ethnic, religious, and tribal groups in the
 country. Legislation is submitted by the executive to the Council
 for review; the Council votes, although its recommendations are not
 binding; it does not have veto power but often discusses policies
 actively and sometimes heatedly. Thus, it has provided a forum for
 dialog between the Government and the public. The Government
 generally has not promulgated legislation with which the Council is
 in disagreement; for example, the Council has had substantive input
 into the recently approved five-year plan and the new income tax
 law.
 The National Consultative Council was dissolved at the same time
 the Parliament was restored, January 5, 1984.
 The councils of most cities and towns in Jordan are elected by
 popular vote. King Hussein has taken steps to increase the
 participation of women in the political process, appointing the
 first female Cabinet minister in Jordan's history in 1979. Four of
 the 75 members of the National Consultative Council are women.
 Women work in managerial, professional, and clerical positions in
 the public sector, the military, and the police, albeit in much
 lower numbers and at a generally lower level than men.
 A certificate of good conduct is required for government employment
 and for work or study abroad. It may be requested by any
 employer. The certificate is provided or refused by the General
 Intelligence Directorate based on review of their files and, at
 times, following an interview with the individual concerned.
 Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Jordan has attracted little attention from private and
 international human rights organizations. Amnesty International
 has made inquiries about specific cases from time to time, focusing
 on detention without trial and on the death penalty, but it did not
 cite Jordan in its 1983 report. The Jordanian lawyers'
 professional association has formed a Human Rights Committee, but
 it is not active. The International Committee of the Red Cross
 maintains an office in Amman. The representative visits all
 prisons and detention facilities on a regular basis. He is allowed
 confidential access to all prisoners and detainees. The Government
 is responsive to his recommendations. Citing unspecified
 "prisoners of conscience and instances of torture," Freedom House
 regards Jordan "not free."
 The Government has played an active role in the International Labor
 Organization and U.N. Human Rights Commission at Geneva. Jordan
 has signed and ratified both the Covenants on Political and Civil
 Rights and on Economic and Social Rights. The Palace, and
 especially Crown Prince Hassan, has an active interest in
 international human rights. The Crown Prince is a cofounder of the
 newly established Independent Commission on International
 Humanitarian Issues.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 From 1976 through 1980, Jordan's economy grew at an average annual
 real rate of close to nine percent. Since 1981, economic growth
 has slowed, dropping to about 5.5 percent in 1982. Per capita GNP
 
 
 1312
 in 1982 rose to approximately $1,700: some 17 percent of the
 population is considered to receive income below the absolute
 poverty level. Services, including government, continue to
 contribute nearly two-thirds of national output, followed by the
 industrial and construction sectors (30 percent) and agriculture
 (six percent). Jordan remains heavily dependent upon external aid
 with 51 percent of its 1982 budgetary resources coming from
 external sources.  Inflation in 1982 was 7.4 percent, the lowest
 rate since 1973.
 Jordan's domestic work force of nearly 450,000 is close to full
 employment. Significant numbers of foreign workers, estimated at
 over 120,000, have entered the country in recent years, primarily
 from Egypt. Such unemployment as exists is structural, with the
 highest incidence being among new entrants in some professional
 categories. While more than 300,000 Jordanians continue to work
 abroad, principally in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf countries,
 these states have reduced the number of foreigners admitted to work
 in the past few 9ears. Women are 17 percent of the labor force and
 are expected soon to be 20 percent. They participate broadly in
 the professional, clerical, and managerial sectors of the work
 force.
 Remittances through the banking system from Jordanian workers
 abroad exceeded one billion dollars in 1982. As much as another
 billion dollars may have passed through the moneychanger network.
 Since 1979, Jordan has received large annual transfer payments from
 the oil-rich Arab States. In 1982 these payments totaled $900
 million. Foreign aid coupled with the high-level of worker
 remittances enabled Jordan to cover its $2.4 billion balance-of-
 trade deficit in 1982 and still post an overall balance-of-payments
 surplus of USD 50 million.
 Jordan's current population, based on the preliminary result of the
 1979 national census and growth rate of 3.5 percent per year, is
 now approximately 2,400,000. Of this about 60 percent live in
 corporate city limits, but some 20 percent more live in suburban
 and semiurban areas, thus making Jordan a highly urbanized
 society. The population below the age of 15 is 51.8 percent,
 resulting in a high dependency ratio. Life expectancy at birth is
 currently 59.8 years for males and 63.6 years for females. Infant
 mortality is estimated to be 69 per 1,000 live births.
 Health facilities in Jordan are widely distributed, but with a wide
 disparity in the quality of services, which range from the most
 modern facilities in the cities to rural village clinics which have
 a doctor in attendance only infrequently. At present there is one
 doctor for each 960 Jordanians residing on the East Bank. By 1986
 there is expected to be one doctor for each 568 residents. In 1981
 there were 16.7 hospital beds for each 10,000 inhabitants, but a
 planned increase will raise this number to 25.8 per 10,000 by 1986.
 Although education is compulsory through the ninth grade, primary
 school (1-6) enrollment rates which are close to 100 percent drop
 to about 82 percent in preparatory (7-9) and 74 percent in
 secondary (10-12) schools. Adult literacy has increased
 dramatically over the past 20 years. At present, some 65 percent
 of all those above the ages of 15 are literate, with males at 71
 percent and females at over 55 percent.
 Some 66 percent of all Jordanians have piped-in water supplies.
 Only 35.7 percent of rural families have piped-in water, however,
 and provision of piped water to most of the remaining rural
 families, representing 10-15. percent of all Jordanians, is
 
 
 1313
 prohibitively expensive. While chlorination and treatment of some
 water is carried out in Jordan, water is not always safe and
 incidents of contamination are common.
 Jordanian citizens are accorded equal treatment in social services
 such as health, education, and some subsidized foodstuffs. Despite
 limited natural resources and a rapidly growing population. the
 standard of living has risen during the past decade, although the
 gains have been unevenly distributed.
 Jordan's essentially free enterprise economy has created many
 opportunities for its people regardless of religious, ethnic, or
 tribal background. There is no evidence of Government-encouraged
 discrimination. Women in Jordan, as in other Arab states, are
 traditionally disfavored economically and to a lesser extent,
 educationally. The status of women is a result of traditional
 Islamic social values which fix women in the role of housewife and
 mother.  (Women are still required to have the written permission
 of the family's eldest male in order to travel. Women have the
 right to initiate divorce under limited circumstances; they have
 the right to own and inherit property; and they have priority "rule
 of first right" for the custody of minor children.) This pattern
 is changing. The Government encourages more female participation
 in the labor force.
