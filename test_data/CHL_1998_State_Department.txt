 CIDLE
 Chile is a multiparty democracy with a constitution that provides for a strong ex-
 ecutive and a bicameral legislature. Approved by referendum in 1980 and amended
 in 1989, the Constitution was written under the former military government and
 establishes institutional limits on popular rule. President Eduardo Frei, a Christian
 Democrat, began his 6-year term in 1994. The National Congress comprises 120
 deputies and 48 senators. The government coalition of six parties holds a majority
 in the lower house. An opposition coalition, including several independent and many
 of the 10 nonelected senators, controls the upper chamber, although the senate
 president is from the ruling coalition. Former president General Augusto Pinochet
 retired from the army on March 11 and assumed a lifetime senate seat. The Con-
 stitutional Tribunal rejected a lawsuit that sought to prevent Pinochet from enter-
 ing the Senate. Following his assumption of the seat, the Chamber of Deputies on
 April 9 rejected an attempt to remove Pinochet from the Senate. Turnover in the
 courts has led to a significant diminution in the influence of General Pinochets ap-
 pointees over the constitutionally independent judicial branch.
 The armed forces are constitutionally subordinate to the President through an ap-
 pointed Minister of Defense but enjoy a large degree of legal autonomy.  o n-
 bly, the President must have the concurrence of the National Security Council,
 which comprises military and civilian officials, to remove service chiefs. The
 Carabineros (the uniformed national police) have primary responsibility for public
 order and safety and border security. The civilian Investigations Police are respon-
 sible for criminal investigations and immigration control. Both organizations--al-
 though formally under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense, which prepares
 their budgets--are under operational control of the Ministry of Interior. The secu-
 rity forces, mainly the police, committed a number of human rights abuses.
 The export-led, free-market economy experienced its 15th consecutive year of ex-
 pansion, but growth moderated in 1998 due to the impact of the Asian and global
 economic crises. The most important export remained copper; salmon, forestry prod-
 
 
 ucts, fresh fruit, fish meal, and manufactured goods were also significant sources
 of foreign exchange. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 7.1 percent rate in
 1997, and inflation fell to 6.6 percent. Unemployment stood at 7.2 percent, although
 it was expected to rise. From 1987 to 1997, the percentage of the population living
 below the poverty line decreased from 45 to 23 percent Annual per capita GDP rose
 to approximately $5,300 in 1997.
 T he Government generally respected its citizens' human rights; however, there
 continued to be problems in some areas. The most serious cases involved torture,
 brutality, use of excessive force by the police, and physical abuse in jails and pris-
 ons. Discrimination and violence against women and violence against children are
 problems. Discrimination against the disabled and minorities persists. Many indige-
 nous people remain marginalized. Child labor is a problem.
 Almost all other human rights concerns are related to abuses during the former
 military government, primarily between 1973 and 1978. In October the United
 Kingdom detained retired General Pinochet pending resolution of an extradition re-
 quest from Spain on charges of genocide and murder. The British High Court origi-
 nally ruled that Pinochet had immunity as a former head of state; however, a No-
 vember Law Lords panel overturned that decision. In December the Law Lords set
 aside their previous ruling and agreed to reconsider the case. At year's end, another
 panel was to hear the case, and Pinochet remained under house arrest in England.
 The detention of General Pinochet led to a reexamination of what, if anything,
 could and should be done to deal with the sometimes conflicting demands for justice
 and for national reconciliation. Efforts to bring abusers to justice in cases dating
 back to the early years of the military government often have been stifled by the
 judiciary. The military authorities continued to resist a full accounting of the fate
 of those persons who had disappeared, and the courts continued to close, without
 investigation or prosecution, many cases of abuse that occurred during the first 5
 years of military rule, citing the 1978 Amnesty Law. Over the past 6 years, the Gov-
 ernment and opposition parties have debated various proposals that effectively
 would close all cases covered by the Amnesty Law that are still under judicial inves-
 tigation. These efforts largely have stalled, and the judicial system continued to in-
 vestigate and either prosecute or close pending human rights cases.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 On January 12, taxi driver Raul Palma Salgado died while in police custody, al-
 legedly as a result of torture. Four National police members implicated in the death
 are under arrest, and the case is in the courts. The Committee for the Defense of
 People's Rights (CODEPU) identified Palma's death as the third instance of suspects
 dying while in police custody due to torture or excessive force since 1990. The other
 two alleged cases occurred in 1995 and 1997. Legal action continued in these two
 earlier cases.
 Police used water cannons and tear gas when violence broke out during dem-
 onstrations on the anniversary of the September 11, 1973 coup against the Allende
 government. Two persons died. One was a Communist Party official who apparently
 suffered a stroke while marching; party officials claimed that the stroke was
 brought on by tear gas. The other was a 25-year-old woman who was shot under
 unclear circumstances; at year's end her death was under investigation (see Sections
 2.a. and 3).
 In December 1996, Pedro Soto Tapia, a 19-year-old military conscript, disappeared
 from his regiment at San Felipe after having written many letters to his family de-
 scribing mistreatment at the hands of his superior officers. In March 1997, his re-
 mains were found in a cave in San Felipe, accompanied by what was purportedly
 a suicide note. In February the judge handling the case fell ill and a series of tem-
 porary substitutes were named. In September the family's attorneys, assisted by the
 CODEPU, succeeded in having a new permanent judge named. They continue to al-
 lege that Soto's death was a homicide.
 Important advances were made in clarifying events surrounding "Operation Alba-
 nia," the June 1987 killings of 12 "Manuel Rodrignez Patriotic Front" (FPMR) mem-
 bers. The authorities brought charges of use of unnecessary violence against nine
 former and current intelligence and security officers; all were in custody. At year's
 end, the judge was considering a motion to raise the charges to aggravated homi-
 cide.
 Proceedings against General Pinochet continued in Spain for his alleged respon-
 sibility in the deaths, torture, and disappearance of Spanish and other citizens. On
 
 
 October 16, authorities in the United Kingdom detained General Pinochet, who was
 recovering in London from a back operation, following the UK's receipt of a Spanish
 arrest order sent via Interpol. An extradition request followed. The Spanish request
 grew out of two separate Madrid court proceedings (consolidated into one on October
 20 under Judge Baltasar Garzon) involving persons who were killed, tortured, or
 who disappeared in Chile during the military regime. One investigation had focused
 on those killed in Chile during the military era, while the other focused on persons
 killed outside of Chile in "Operation Condor," an undercover operation in which sev-
 eral military governments in the region, led by Chile, cooperated to eliminate leftist
 opponents. Judge Garzon and a colleague had spent the past 2 years collecting evi-
 dence and taking testimony regarding human rights violations in Chile and Argen-
 tina during the military dictatorships.
 The British High Court ruled on October 28 that Pinochet enjoyed sovereign im-
 munity as a former head of state. This decision was overturned on November 25
 by the House of Lords' Law Lords panel, and on December 9 the British Home Sec-
 retary decided to allow the extradition process to proceed. On December 17, the Law
 Lords set aside their previous ruling and agreed to reconsider the case following an
 appeal from Pinochet s lawyers that one of the deciding jud es had not revealed a
 potential conflict of interest involving his links with one of the parties that sup-
 ported the Spanish request. At yeas end, Pinochet remained in England under
 house arrest.
 Former Chilean intelligence agent Enrique Arancibia Clavel continued to be de-
 tained in Argentina after an Argentine judge denied his January request to be set
 free; this decision was reaffirmed in another court decision in September. Arancibia
 is charged with involvement in the 1974 car bombing in Buenos-Aires that killed
 former Chilean army.-chief Carlos Prats and his wife, Sofia Cuthbert. The case was
 reopened in 1992 as a result of a petition filed by 'the Prats family containing new
 evidence. The- Chilean Government has agreed to be a coplaintiff in the Argentine
 trial of Arancibia. Legal efforts to gain the testimony of retired General Manuel
 Contreras and retired Brigadier General Pedro Espinoza, former director and oper-
 ations director, respectively, of DINA (the army intelligence branch during the mili-
 -tary regime), allegedly impicated in the killing, continued. Contreras andEspinoza
 had been convicted in 1993 of the 1976 killings in Washington, D.C. of former Chil-
 ean foreign minister Oriando Letelier and his assistant Ronni Moffitt.
 On November 6, the judge investigating the 1982 death of labor leader Tucapel
 Jimenez and the related homicide of carpenter Juan Alegria Mundalca closed the
 case, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to bring anyone to trial for the mur-
 ders. This decision is being appealed. Four former agents of the National Intel-
 ligence Center (the successor to DINA) had been under investigation for the killings.
 Some alleged perpetrators of human rights abuses during the military regime re-
 main on active duty in the army. Army General Sergio Espinoza Davies, who com-
 manded the United Nations observer.mission along-the India-Pakistan border, was
 accused of being involved in an October 1973 "war-council" that sentenced five so-
 cialists to death without, due process. Following the UN's announcement that it
 would investigate the. charges against him, the Government consulted with the UN.
 The issue became moot-when. General Espinoza Davies, promoted to army Inspector
 General, returned to the-country in December.
 In September Swiss authorities denied the Government's request for extradition
 from Switzerland of a member of the FPMR terrorist group who escaped from prison
 in December 1996. The individual was convicted in Chile of killing a police officer
 in 1991 (see Section I.e.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The major human rights controversy involved past disappearances and efforts by
 political forces and the Government to reinterpret the 1978 Amnesty Law in such
 a way as to achieve both justice and national reconciliation. As interpreted under
 the so-called Aylwin- doctrine (named after former President Patricio Aylwin), the
 courts should not close a case-involving a disappearance until either the- body is
 found or-credible evidence is provided-to indicate that an individual is dead. This
 could affect over 500 cases, which cover-about-1,000 persons-still classified as "de-
 tained or missing" from the early years-of the military regime. However, application
 of.the Aylwin-doctrine has been uneven, as -some courts continue the previous prac-
 tice-of.applying the 1978 amnesty to disappearances without conducting an inves-
 tigation to identify the perpetrators.
 On December 29, a Supreme Court- panel overruled a 1997 application of the Am-
 nesty Law to the August 1974 disappearance of Alvaro Miguel Barrios Duche. The
 Supreme Court ruled that the law only could be applied following the completion
 of a full criminal investigation and the identification of the guilty parties and or-
 dered the military court to begin an investigation into the case. According to the
 
 
 537
 
 Social Aid Foundation of Christian Churches (FASIC), 2 disappearance cases were
 pending before the Supreme Court at year's end, with 12 cases having been closed
 in 1998 through application of the Amnesty Law; 4 other cases were closed for other
 reasons, including 1 temporarily closed and subject to being reopened. Application
 of the Amnesty Law was denied in five cases, with four of these cases reopened; an-
 other case involving a disappearance was reopened under a different legal doctrine.
 The Supreme Court had sometimes ruled in the past that when judges receive
 criminal complaints related to actions by armed services members in the period cov-
 ered by the amnesty (September 11, 1973 to March 10, 1978), they were required
 to close the case immediately without further investigations. In September the Su-
 preme Court revoked the amnesty granted by a lower court, ruling that the Geneva
 Convention (on internal conflicts) was applicable in the 1974 disappearance of Move-
 ment of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) member Pedro Enrique Poblete Cordoba. At
 year's end, the case was being investigated.
 FASIC, CODEPU, and other human rights organizations have a total of nine de-
 nial-of-justice cases pending before the Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights (IACHR) regarding previously closed disappearance and execution cases.
 They have filed 11 cases before the United Nations Committee on Human Rights.
 In April the IACHR ruled that 22 previously closed disappearance cases that had
 been appealed to the commission should be reopened.
 In November France joined Spain in seeking the extradition of General Pinochet
 from the United Kingdom, based on the disappearance of three French citizens in
 1973-77. Switzerland also filed an extradition request for Pinochet.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids the "use of illegal pressure" on detainees, but the CODEPU
 has received reports of abuse and mistreatment by both the National police and the
 Investigations Police. When requested by other human rights organizations or fam-
 ily members, CODEPU lawyers visit detainees during the interrogation (see Section
 1.d.) and represent some suspected terrorists in court. The CODEPU continues to
 investigate alleged use of excessive force against detainees. The Minister of Interior
 asks the courts to conduct independent investigations of credible complaints of po-
 lice abuse, but such investigations often do not result in arrests, due in part to the
 reluctance of judges to pursue the issue vigorously.
 FASIC reported in March that it had received 27 complaints of mistreatment from
 persons who had been in police custody during the first 2 months of 1998. Of these
 reports, 25 involved the National police and 2 the Investigations Police. CODEPU
 reported in January that during the previous year the authorities had found 13 Na-
 tional poice gulty of abuse and appied administative sanctions against 11 others
 whom the courts had absolved. As of August, 21 cases of alleged police abuse were
 pending in the court system.
 In March four members of the Investigations Police allegedly tortured Pedro
 Navarr Pozo in the city of Castro. Passers-by heard Navarro's screams and alerted
 the Chiloe provincial governor and a judge. The two officials entered the police sta-
 tion and witnessed an unclothed and handcuffed Navarro being beaten. The authori-
 ties fired the four police officers and indicted them. At year's end, the case was in
 the courts.
 In June Osvaldo Baeza accused police in Talca of beating him. Similar charges
 were made by four minors also detained in Talca on suspicion of robbery.
 According to a press report, the human rights office of the Metropolitan Legal Aid
 Office, an arm of the Justice Ministry, released a report in January stating that it
 had received 400 complaints against the police in 1997, a large increase over pre-
 vious years. The report stated that 42 cases had been presented to the civilian or
 military courts that year. Most of the cases were lodged against the national police,
 while four cases involved the Investigations Police. The report asserted that there
 was a growing trend of human rights complaints, as five lawsuits were lodged
 against the police during the first 20 days of January.
 On July 1, a new law entered into effect that clarified the illegality of any use
 of force against persons detained by the police. The law provides that if a member
 of the police force uses "torture or unlawful coercion," either physical or mental, or
 orders them to be applied, or commits them against a person under arrest or deten-
 tion, the officer would be sentenced to imprisonment. Officers who know about the
 abuse and have the "necessary power and authority" to prevent or stop it would also
 be considered accessories to the crime if they fail to do so (also see Section 1.d.).
 Human rights groups claim that military recruits sometimes are mistreated. The
 CODEPU reported that by the end of June, human rights groups had received 537
 complaints of mistreatment of recruits over the prior 2 years. Of this number, 80
 dealt with torture allegations; 46 of these cases are under judicial investigation, and
 18 of the alleged victims are in psychotherapy.
 
 
 538
 In July, 14 military conscripts stationed in Puerto Varas filed a legal petition
 claiming that they were, among other things, beaten during a military exercise. A
 military investigation identified a corporal as directly responsible. He was removed
 from the military and is awaiting trial.
 A new judge was named to handle the case of military conscript Pedro Soto Tapia,
 who alleged mistreatment in 1996 and whose remains were found in March 1997
 (see Section l.a.).
 At year's end, the court of appeals had not yet ruled on the August 1997 filing
 by attorneys for Carmen Gloria Quintana that appealed efforts by the Government
 to set aside an award of approximately $600,000 in compensation that the IACHR
 had recommended for Quintana in 1988. Army Captain Pedro Fernandez Dittus set
 fire to Quintna and her cormpanion Rodrigo Rojas Denegri while they were partici-
 pating in a protest against the military regime in 1986. Rojas died4 days later,
 while Quintana survived with severe and disfiguring injuries.
 Prisons are often overcrowded and antiquated, but the conditions are not life
 threatening. Food meets minima nutritional needs, and prisoners may supplement
 the diet by buying food. Those with sufficient funds often can rent space in a better
 wing of the prison. Prison guards have been accused of using excessive force to stop
 attempted prison breaks. Athough most reports state that the guards generally be-
 have responsibly and do not mistreat prisoners, several prisoners have complained
 of beatings. There were 346 minors in adult prisons (see Section 5).
 The maximum security prison houses 56 prisoners, most of them charged with or
 convicted of terrorism. Prisoners continue to complain that strict security measures,
 prohibition of visitors, hidden cameras, and rigid regulations violate their rights. In
 1997 the Ministry of Justice confirmed that there were listening devices in prison
 cells but said that they were never used.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution allows civilian and mili-
 tary courts to order detention for up to 5 days without arraignment and to extend
 the detention of alleged terrorists for up to 10 days. The law affords detainees 30
 minutes of immediate and subsequent daily access to a lawyer (in the presence of
 a prison guard) and to a doctor to verify their physical condition. The law does not
 permit a judge to deny such access; police authorities generally observe these re-
 quirements.
 In practice, many detainees are not promptly advised of charges against them, nor
 are they granted a speedy hearing before a judge. Early in the year, 7 percent of
 the general prison population of 24,791 was under investigation but not charged
 with a crime; 44 percent were charged with an offense and were awaiting trial or
 had been convicted and were awaiting sentencing; and 49 percent were serving sen-
 tences.
 On July 1, a new law entered into force that eliminated the right of the police
 to stop persons, demand identification, and arrest them based on suspicion that they
 may have committed a crime. (This right to arrest persons on suspicion often was
 used against minors.) The new law also requires police to inform those detained of
 their rights and to expedite notification of the detention to family members. The law
 also deals with physical abuse by police against detained persons (see Section 1.c.).
 On July 22, the Government legal aid corporation fled its first lawsuit based on
 the law. The lawsuit was filed against a number of Investigations Police officers for
 failing to follow the new arrest procedures and for beating the person arrested.
 Police officials failed to investigate fully an October 1997 allegation that police
 and military officials arbitrarily detained Marlene Martinez and her son for ques-
 tioning in an effort to coerce the child's father concerning a business controversy.
 The September kidnaping of Martinez brought the case to public attention, prompt-
 ing two criminal and military investigations and government acknowledgement of
 the prior lack of official diligence.
 The Constitution provides for the right to legal counsel, but this is a reality only
 for those who can afford to pay. The poor, who account for the majority of the cases,
 may be represented by law students doing practical training (who often are over-
 worked), on occasion by a court-appointed lawyer, or by a lawyer from the Govern-
 ment's legal assistance corporation. The Constitution allows judges to set bail.
 There were no cases of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution calls for a judicial system inde-
 pendent of the other branches of government. Although the judiciary, and particu-
 larly the Supreme Court, has been dominated in the past by appointees of the
 former military regime, turnover in the courts has led to a significant diminution
 of that influence.
 Cases decided in the lower courts can be referred to appeals courts and ultimately
 to the Supreme Court. Criminal court judges are appointed for life. In December
 
 
 539
 1997, constitutional reforms were approved that set 75 as the age limit for Supreme
 Court justices, gave the Senate the right to approve or disapprove presidential nomi-
 nees to the Court, and increased court membership from 17 to 21. Of the 21 justices
 on the Supreme Court, only 3 were appointed under the military regime. The Su-
 preme Court prepares lists of nominees for the Supreme Court and appeals courts,
 from which the President makes appointments. The Senate must approve nominees
 to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court continues to work with the other
 branches of government on broad judicial reform.
 The jurisdiction of military tribunals is limited to cases involving military person-
 nel. If formal charges are filed in civilian courts against a member of the military,
 including the National police, the military prosecutor asks for, and the Supreme
 Court normally grants, military jurisdiction. This is of particular consequence in the
 human rights cases from the period covered by the 1978 Amnesty Law. In addition,
 military courts have the authority to charge and try civilians for defamation of mili-
 tary personnel and for sedition. Rulings by military tribunals can be appealed to the
 Supreme Court.
 In September 1997, President Frei signed a judicial reform law that created the
 post of Attorney General and a related ministry that are expected to be in full oper-
 ation by 2002. The new law provides that national and regional prosecutors inves-
 tigate crimes and formulate charges, leaving judges and magistrates the narrower
 function of judging the merits of evidence presented before them. The Government
 has designated two regions to begin gradual implementation of the reform. Training
 and administrative setup is to begin in 1999, with the first oral trials expected in
 2000.
 Based on the Napoleonic Code, the criminal justice system does not provide for
 trial by jury, nor does it assume innocence until proven otherwise. Criminal pro-
 ceedings are inquisitorial rather than adversarial. The Constitution provides for the
 right to legal counsel, but the poor do not always get effective legal representation
 (see Section 1.d.).
 Four FPMR ringleaders broke out of Santiago's maximum-security prison in De-
 cember 1996 in an elaborately orchestrated escape via helicopter. In September
 1997, one of the escapees, Patricio Ortiz Montenegro, requested political asylum in
 Switzerland, claiming that he had not received justice in Chile. (In June 1995, a
 military court had convicted Ortiz of the 1991 murder of a police officer and sen-
 tenced him to a 10-year prison term.) Swiss authorities initially detained Ortiz at
 Chile's request but in September denied an extradition request and freed Ortiz from
 detention.
 There were no reports of political prisoners, although among the 56 inmates in
 Santiago's maximum-security prison, those who have been convicted of terrorist acts
 routinely claim to be political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions. A 1995 pri-
 vacy law bars obtaining information by undisclosed taping, telephone intercepts,
 and other surreptitious means, as well as the dissemination of such information, ex-
 cept by judicial order in narcotics-related cases.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the authorities generally respect these rights. The press main-
 tains its independence, criticizes the Government, and covers issues sensitive to the
 military, including human rights. However, investigative journalism is still a rarity.
 Two major media groups control the print media, which are largely independent
 of the Government. The State is majority owner of La Nacion newspaper, but it is
 editorially independent.
 The electronic media also are largely independent of government control. The Tel-
 evision Nacional network is state-owned but not under direct government control.
 It receives no government subsidy and is self-financing through commercial adver-
 tising. It is editorially independent and is governed by a board of directors that, al-
 though politically appointed, encourages the expression of varied opinions over the
 network.
 Under the Internal Security Law of 1958, it is a criminal offense to besmirch the
 honor of state institutions and symbols, such as the Congress, the military services,
 the flag, and the President. Military courts have the authority to charge and try ci-
 vilians for defamation of military personnel and for sedition, but their rulings can
 be appealed to the Supreme Court. Human Rights Watch criticized these restric-
 tions on freedom of expression and information.
 
 
 In 1996 Congress passed a privacy law that set penalties for those who infringe
 on the private and public life of individuals and their families. At the time of the
 law's passage, journalists argued vigorously that applying it to media reporting
 would have a chilling effect on freedom of the press. To date, this privacy law has
 not been applied to the media. On November 4, the Supreme Court overturned a
 ruling by a lower court that had prevented Caras magazine from publishing a report
 on the suffering that an airplane- accident caused to a family. Cams refrained from
 publishing the story, since it was no longer timely. There have been unsuccessful
 attempts to incorporate language and penalties similar to those in the privacy law
 into a draft press law.
 On January 21, the authorities jailed two journalists in a libel case brought
 against them by Supreme Court justice Servando Jordan. They were released on
 bail the following morning. The case was brought under provisions of the Internal
 Security Law. On January 28, following public criticism of the lawsuits, Jordan
 withdrew his libel charge against the journalists. Jordan also filed libel charges
 against the director and deputy director of La Tercera daily newspaper. On January
 30, a court rejected this case, and an appeals court reaffirmed the decision on June
 17. However, on- September 16 another appeals court reinstated the case. The two
 journalists spent the night of September 16 in jail before being released on bail. At
 year's end, judicial proceedings were still open.
 On June 4, La Epoca newspaper journalist Jorge Molina received a written. threat
 warning him to stop writing -about a 1994 bribery case involving military hospital
 procurement. The journalist was provided with police protection.
 In mid-July, retired General Pinochet asserted that he was misquoted in La
 Tercera newspaper following a breakfast meeting with four members of the press.
 He brought a libel suit, which a court dismissed in November.
 The 1980 Constitution established a Film Classification Council (CCC) with the
 power of prior censorship. The Council has banned over 50 films and approximately
 700 videos. Local and foreign film distributors regard the CCC's screening process
 as insufficiently transparent. The Lawyers Association for Public Liberties peti-
 tioned the IACHR to object to censorship of the film "The Last Temptation of
 Christ." (The 1989 ban on the film had been lifted in 1996.) The Government contin-
 ued efforts to abolish the CCC through constitutional reform.
 The National Television Council (CNT), created by legislation in 1989 and sup-
 ported with government funding, is charged with assuring that television program-
 ming "respects the moral and cultural values of the nation." The CNT's principal
 role is to regulate violence and sexual explicitness in both broadcast and cable tele-
 vision programming content. Films and other programs judged by the CNT to be
 excessively violent or to have obscene language or sexually explicit scenes can be
 shown only after 10 p.m. when "family viewing hours" end. In practice, the ever-
 increasing volume of programming makes the CNT's job all but impossible. The
 CNT issues occasional warnings to networks and cable providers and sometimes
 obliges them to postpone the showing of certain films until after 10 p.m. It also occa-
 sionally has levied fines. Debate continues over the CNT's role.
 The courts can prohibit media coverage of legal cases in progress but do so rarely.
 Courts issued two gag orders involving criminal cases during the year, but both
 were overturned on appeal. The press has begun using foreign Internet web sites
 to publish articles when gag orders are issued.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 The police used water cannons and tear gas to break up violent demonstrations
 on the anniversary of the September 1973 coup. Two persons died, 77 were injured,
 and over 300 were arrested. Property damage was considerable; several buildings
 were vandalized along the parade route (also see Sections l.a. and 3).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. All denomninations practice their faiths
 without restriction. Although church and state are officially separate, the Roman
 Catholic Church recelves official preferential treatment. Chile's 1 to 2 million
 Protestants assert that the Government discriminates against them, based upon dif-
 fering legal status afforded to non-Catholics. They cite the absence of Protestant
 armed forces chaplains, difficulties for pastors to visit military hospitals, and the
 predominantly Catholic religious education in public schools. To remedy this situa-
 tion, the lower house of Congress unanimously approved a bill to afford greater legal
 equality among all churches late in 1997; however, the bill remained pending in the
 Senate at year's end. There was one false bomb threat against a Santiago synagogue
 in late August.
 
 
 541
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice. For minor children to leave the country, either
 alone or with only one of their parents, they must have notarized permission from
 both parents.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The
 law include provisions for granting refugee and asylee status in accordance with the
 provisions of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its
 1967 Protocol. The issue of the provision of first asylum has not arisen. There were
 no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecu-
 tion.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Chile is a constitutional democracy, and citizens have the right to change their
 government through periodic elections. There is universal suffrage for citizens 18
 years of age and over. The Government still operates under some political restraints
 that were imposed by the previous regime. Under the 1980 Constitution, various na-
 tional institutions-including the President, the Supreme Court, and the National
 Security Council (acting on nominations by the armed forces)-appoint an additional
 nine Senators (beyond those elected) to 8-year terms. Nine newly appointed institu-
 tional senators took their seats in March, along with former President Pinochet,
 who became a Senator-for-life. The Constitutional Tribunal rejected a suit seeking
 to prevent Pinochet from entering the Senate. Following his assumption of the seat,
 the Chamber of Deputies on April 9 rejected an attempt to remove Pinochet from
 the Senate. The legislative branch, with the exception of the institutional senators,
 is elected freely and is independent from the executive branch.
 The former military government wrote the 1980 Constitution and amended it
 slightly in 1989 after losing a referendum on whether General Pinochet should stay
 in office as president. The Constitution provides for a strong presidency and a legis-
 lative branch with limited powers. In addition, it includes provisions designed to
 protect the interests of the military and the rightwing political opposition. These
 provisions include limitations on the Presidents right to remove military service
 chiefs (including the chief of the army, a post which Pinochet finally relinquished
 in March); an electoral system that gives the second-place party (or coalition) in
 each district disproportionate representation in Congress; and the provision for non-
 elected institutional senators. The Government has pledged to amend these provi-
 sions, which it views as "authoritarian enclaves" left over from the previous regime;
 the opposition has pledged to fight to retain what it views as important checks and
 balances in the system of government.
 As in previous years, demonstrations on the anniversary of the 1973 coup resulted
 in harm to persons and property. Two persons died, 77 were injured, and over 300
 were arrested. However, in the future, the coup anniversary is to be replaced by a
 "Day of National Unity," to be observed on the first Monday in September (see Sec-
 tions l.a. and 2.a.).
 Women have had the right to vote in municipal elections since 1934 and in na-
 tional elections since 1949 and are active in political life at the grassroots level.
 Women make up a majority of registered voters and of those who actually cast bal-
 lots, but few women are in leadership positions. There are 13 women among the 120
 deputies, 2 women in the 48-seat Senate, and 3 women among the 19 cabinet min-
 isters. No women serve among the 21 Supreme Court justices. The level of female
 participation in government is not increasing markedly.
 The over 1 million indigenous people have the legal right to participate freely in
 the political process, although relatively few are active politically. Only one member
 of Congress is of indigenous descent.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several nongovernmental human rights organizations. The Chilean
 Human Rights Commission, a nongovernmental organization (NGO), is affiliated
 with the International League of Human Rights and gathers evidence of police
 abuses. The Social Aid Foundation of Christian Churches is also very active on the
 full range of human rights issues. The CODEPU provides legal counsel to those ac-
 cused of politically related crimes and to victims of human rights abuses. Local
 NGO's say that the Government cooperates with their efforts to investigate current
 accusations of human rights violations. Many international NGO's also follow
 human rights issues closely.
 
 
 In May President Frei advocated the creation of a "national defender of citizens,"
 a state body that would receive complaints about abusive government acts. How-
 ever, implementing legislation had not been introduced in the Congress by year's
 end.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law, but it does not ban specifi-
 cally discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or social status.
 Women.-The public is only beginning to appreciate the extent of physical abuse
 of women. The National Women's Service (SERNAM), created in 1991 to, combat dis-
 crimination against women, found in a 1996 study of more than 12,000 reports of
 domestic violence that 3 years after the Law on Intrafamily Violence went into ef-
 fect, only 1 in 5 accusations resulted in judicial action. The study indicated that
 spouses or domestic partners were responsible for 88 percent of family violence, and
 that 63 percent of the reports involved physical attacks. The study showed that in
 nearly three-quarters of reported cases of domestic violence, the accusation led to
 a positive change in the domestic situation regardiess of the judicial outcome.
 SENAM also conducted courses on the legal, medical, and psychological aspects of
 domestic violence for police officers and judicial and municipal authorities.
 The courts may order counseling for those involved in intrafamily violelice. In
 1997 there were approximately 61,000 reports of domestic violence. In 1994 (latest
 data available) there were 2,280 reported cases of rape; 75 to 80 percent of rapes
 are believed to go unreported. Under a 100-year-old law, if a man charged with rape
 asks the rape victim to marry him and she accepts, he would be released imme-
 diately, but the fact of his arrest for rape would remain on his criminal record.
 SERNAM is working to have this law abolished.
 Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist. The law permits legal separation
 but not divorce, so those who wish to remarry must seek annulments. Since annul-
 ment implies that a marriage never existed under the law, former spouses are left
 with little recourse for financial support. Although a recent law created conjugal
 property as an option in a marriage, some women saw this as a step backward,
 since the law on separate property (which still exists) gives women the right to one-
 half their husbands' assets but gives husbands no rights to assets of a wife. In the
 face of heavy opposition from the Catholic Church, the Chamber of Deputies ap-
 proved a divorce bill in September 1997; the bill still is awaiting Senate action.
 Another SERNAM study in 1997 found that the average earnings of female heads
 of household are only 71 percent of those of male heads of household. Women with
 no schooling averaged a salary that was 87 percent of their male counterparts with-
 out schooling, while female heads of household with university training averaged
 only 57 percent as much as their male counterparts. SERNAM has a pilot program
 that provides occupational training and child care in an effort to alleviate this dis-
 parity.
 Employers no longer have the right to ask women to take pregnancy tests prior
 to hiring them; legislation prohibiting this practice took effect in November.
 Children.-The Government provides free education through high school; edu-
 cation is compulsory from first through eighth grade.
 A 1996 survey by the National Minors Service indicated that sexual abuse of mi-
 nors occurs but that few cases are reported. A 1996 United Nations Children's Fund
 (UNICEF) report stated that 34 percent of children under 12 years of age experience
 serious physical violence, although only 3.2 percent of the victims of intrafamily vio-
 lence reported to the National police family affairs unit were below the age of 18.
 A 1994 law on intrafamily violence was designed in part to deal with this problem.
 According to UNICEF, some form of corporal punishment is used by one or both par-
 ents in 62 percent of households. A Catholic Church study released in August 1998
 estimated that 12 percent of children are beaten by their mother and 10 percent
 by their father. UNICEF estimates that approximately 107,000 children between
 the ages of 12 and 19 are in the work force. The Catholic Church's study estimated
 that some 50,000 children under age 15 are working (see Section 6.d.).
 Investigations of child abuse within Colonia Dignidad, a secretive German-speak-
 ing settlement 240 miles south of Santiago, received widespread publicity through-
 out the year. The 34,000-acre enclave, inhabited by 350 colonists, was founded by
 77-year-old Paul Schaefer, who immigrated from Germany in 1961 with 300 fol-
 lowers. Armed with a court order seeking Schaefer's arrest on multiple counts of
 child molestation and tax evasion, police conducted extensive search operations on
 the grounds of Colonia Dignidad, but were unable to apprehend Schaefer, who re-
 mained at large throughout the year. In March the police detained several members
 of the community during a raid.
 
 
 By law, juvenile offenders (i.e., those under the age of 18) are segregated from
 adut prisoners. The Government had reduced the number of minors in adult pris-
 ons from 6,630 in 1992 to around 346 by the end of 1997.
 Congress approved a law in September, which is to take effect in late 1999, that
 gives illegitimate children the same legal rights (e.g., of inheritance) as those en-
 joyed by children born to a married couple.
 People With Disabilities.-Congress passed a law in 1994 to promote the integra-
 tion of the disabled into society, and the Governmenfs National Fund for the Handi-
 capped has a $1.5 million budget. The 1992 census found that 288,000 citizens said
 that they had some form of disability. The disabled still suffer some forms of legal
 discrimination; for example, blind persons cannot become teachers or tutors. Al-
 though the law requires that new public buildings provide access for the disabled,
 the public transportation system does not make provision for wheelchair access, and
 a new subway line in the Santiago metropolitan area provides no facilitated access
 for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-According to the 1992 census, neariy 1 million persons,
 slightl less than 7 percent of the population, consider themselves as indigenous.
 The apuches from the south constitute over 90 percent of the indigenous popu-
 lation, but there are small Aimara, Atacameno, Huilliche, Rapa Nui, and
 Kawaskhar populations in other parts of the country. A committee composed of rep-
 resenttives of indigenous groups participated in drafting the 1993 law that recog-
 nizes the ethnic diversity of the indigenous population and gives indigenous people
 a voice in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, and traditions. It provides for
 eventual bilingual education in schools with indigenous populations, replacing a
 statute that emphasized assimilation of indigenous people. However, out of the pop-
 ulation that identifies itself as indigenous, about one-half remain separated from the
 rest of society, largely because of historical, cultural, educational, and geographical
 factors. In practice, the ability of indigenous people to participate in governmental
 decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural re-
 sources is margial. Indigenous people also experience some societal discrimination.
 The National Corporation for Indigenous Development (CONADI) was created in
 1994, and indigenous people directly elected representatives to this body in 1995.
 It advises and directs government programs that assist the economic development
 of indigenous people.
 In August eight Mapuche families rejected an offer from the Endesa power com-
 pany to exchange their traditional lands for other property as part of a hydroelectric
 project. Some of the other indigenous families that had signed land-transfer forms
 claimed that they had done so under pressure. The Indigenous Law allows for the
 exchange of traditional lands for property of equal or greater value, provided that
 the owners and CONADI approve. The Government argued that the electric services
 law that permits expropriation of property in the interest of providing energy for
 the general good took precedence over the Indigenous Law. The Government dis-
 missed the CONADI director and two board members when they disagreed with this
 position. The parties continued in negotiation at year's end.
 National/Racial Ethnic Minorities.-Chile assimilated a major European migra-
 tion in the last century ad as major Middie Eastern and Croatian migration in the
 early part of this century. Smaller racial and ethnic minority groups (Chileans of
 Asian descent and African-Chileans) experience some societal intolerance.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Workers have the right to form unions without prior
 authorization and to join existing unions. The work force is estimated at 5.7 million
 persons, of whom 3.7 million are salaried. The latest available statistics place union
 membership at approximately 655,000, or roughiy 12 percent of the entire work
 force. A 1995 law provides government-employee associations with the same rights
 as trade unions. However, this right is not enjoyed by police or military personnel,
 nor by employees of state-owned companies attached to the Ministry of Defense.
 Members of unions are free to withdraw from union membership.
 The 1992 Labor Code permits nationwide labor cen tals, and the Unified Workers
 Central (CUT), the largest and most representative of these, legalized its status in
 April 1992. Labor unions are effectively independent of the Government, but union
 leaders usually are elected from lists based on party affiliation and often receive di-
 rection from parties' headquarters. There are no restrictions on the political activi-
 ties or affiliations of unions or union officials. Registering a union is a simple proc-
 hEmployees in the private sector hav e right to strike, and the Government reg-
 ulates this right. However, some restrictions on the right to strike remain. The law
 proscribes employees of some 30 companies--largely providers of essential services
 
 
 544
 (e.g., water and electricity)-from striking; it stipulates compulsory arbitration to re-
 solve potential strikes in these companies. Public officials do not enjoy this right,
 although government teachers, municipal, and health workers have struck in the
 past. Public school teachers struck for almost a month in October. There is no provi-
 sion for compulsory arbitration in the public sector.
 Employersmustpayseverancebenefitstostrikingworkersand must show cause
 to fire workers. Employees who believe that they have been dismissed unfairly or
 dismissed because of       a de union activities file complaints with the Ministry
 of Labor. If the claim is approved, the employer must make special and additional
 compensatory payments. The buden of proof rests with the employer in cases in
 which employees allege illegal antiunion activity
 e CUT and many other labor confederations and federations maintain ties to
 international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Despite legal provisions for
 collective bargaining, most workers negotiate individual contracts. Employers say
 that this is due to the workers' preference, distrust of union leaders, and loyalty to
 companies. Union leaders counter that the Labor Code-which does not allow union
 shops-prevents successful organization in many sectors: Employers also may in-
 clude a clause in individual employment contracts that bars some classes of super-
 visory employees from collective bargaining. Employees may object to the inclusion
 of such clauses in their contracts and may appe  to the Ministry of Labor to excise
 them.
 The Ministry of Labor arbitrates about one-half of the complaints it receives.
 Workers may take unarbitrated cases to the courts. If complainants succeed in prov-
 ing that they were fired unjustly, the employer must pay discharged employees
 twice their normal severance payment. There are no statistics available concerning
 the disposition of complaints of antiunion behavior. Allegations exist that employers
 fire workers for union activity and attempt to avoid a complaint by immediately
 paying them some multiple of the normal severance pay.
 Temporary workers-defined in the Labor Code as those in agriculture and con-
 struction, as well as port workers and entertainers-may form unions, but their
 right to collective bargaining remains dependent- on employers agreeing to negotiate
 with unions of temporary workers. Likewise, inter-company unions enjoy the right
 of collective bargaining only if the employer agrees to negotiate with-such a union.
 Labor Code sanctions against unfair bargaining practices protect workers from dis-
 missal only during the bargaining process. Labor leaders complain that companies
 invoke the law's needs-of-the-company clause to fire workers after a union has
 signed a new contract, particularly when negotiations result in a prolonged strike.
 abor laws apply in the duty-free zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit forced or compulsory labor, and it is not known to occur. While the
 Labor Code does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, there
 were no reports of such practices.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 allows children between the ages of 15 and 18 to work with the express permission
 of their parents or guardians. Children 14 years of age also may work legally with
 such permission, but they must have completed their elementary education, and the
 work involved may not be physically strenuous or unhealthy. Additional provisions
 in the law protect workers under 18 years of age by restricting the types of work
 open to them (for example, they may not work in nightclubs) and by establishing
 special conditions of work (they may not work more than 8 hours in 1 day). Labor
 inspectors enforce these regulations, and compliance is good in the formal economy.
 The Labor Code does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children,
 but such practices were not known to occur (see Section 6.c.). Many children are em-
 ployed in the-informal economy. A government study estimates that 15,000 children
 between the ages of 6 and 11 and 32,000 children between the ages of 12 and 14
 are in the work force. UNICEF estimates that approximately 107,000 children be-
 tween the ages of 12 and 19 work (see Section 5). An August Catholic Church study
 estimated 50,000 children under the age of 15 worked. The majority of these were
 males from single-parent households headed by women; among these were children
 who worked more than 40 hours per week and did not attend school. The Ministry
 of Labor convenes regular meetings of a tripartite group (business-labor-govern-
 ment) to monitor progress in eradicating child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages, and the mini-.
 mum wage is adjusted annually. This wage is designed to serve as the starting wage
 for an unskilled single worker entering the labor force and does not provide a work-
 er and family with a decent standard of living. Only 11 percent of salaried workers
 earn the minimum wage. A tripartite committee comprising government, employer,
 
 
 545
 and labor representatives normally suggests a minimum wage based on projected
 inflation and increases in productivity. In May Congress approved the Government's
 proposal setting the minimum monthly wage at approximately $170 (80,500 pesos)
 as of June 1.
 The law sets hours of work and occupational safety and health standards. The
 legal workweek is 48 hours, which can be worked in either 5 or 6 days. The maxi-
 mum workday length is 10 hours, but positions such as caretakers and domestic
 servants are exempted. All workers enjoy at least one 24-hour rest period during
 the workweek, except for workers at high altitudes who voluntarily exchange a
 work-free day each week for several consecutive work-free days every 2 weeks.
 In late October, Congress approved new legislation (which became effective No-
 vember 9) modifying the Labor Code to provide domestic employees the same preg-
 nancy benefits as female employees who work outside private homes. The same leg-
 islation prohibits employers from requiring prospective female workers to take preg-
 nancy tests (see Section 5).
 Occupational health and safety are protected under the law and administered by
 both the Ministries of Health and of Labor. The Government has increased re-
 sources for inspections by over 60 percent since 1990 and targeted industries guilty
 of the worst abuses. As a result, enforcement is improving, and voluntary compli-
 ance is fairly good. A law that became effective in 1996 increased the number of
 annual occupational health and safety inspections and provided that they be carried
 out by an expanded labor inspection service in the Ministry of Labor. Insurance mu-
 tual funds provide workers' compensation and occupational safety training for the
 private and public sectors. There was a 24-percent decline in reported occupational
 injuries in 1997 compared with the previous 5 years, although 11 percent of the
 work force still submitted claims. Workers who remove themselves from situations
 that endanger their health and safety hpve their employment protected if a real
 danger to their health or safety exists.
