 ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia, independent since February 22, 1979, was
 a British dependency, and subsequently an associated
 state. When full independence was granted, St. Lucia
 had a well developed parliamentary system and conside-
 rable experience in local administration. The consti-
 tution of St. Lucia includes specific safeguards for
 the preservation of human rights.
 St. Lucia's economic development has been hampered
 by limited government revenues. The economy has a
 small but growing industrial base, but is most heavily
 dependent on agriculture. Both agriculture and industry
 were affected by Hurricane Allen, which struck the
 island in August 1980 and dealt a severe blow to efforts
 to build the economy. For the time being, the island
 will have to devote its scarce resources to rebuilding
 and rehabilitation.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited in Section 5 of the constitution
 and is not practiced.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punish-
 ment. There have been no allegations of such treatment.
 c.   Disappearances
 No incidents of disappearance of persons have been
 reported.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is constitutionally
 prohibited and this prohibition is respected in practice.
 The constitution contains a provision for preventive
 detention when a state of emergency is declared, which
 has not occurred since independence.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 "A fair hearing . . . by an independent and impartial
 court established by law" is required under Section
 8 of the constitution. Accused persons are presumed
 to be innocent until proven quilty. The constitution
 also guarantees the provision of legal counsel. There
 have been no allegations of denial of these rights.
 The country's appeals court is the regional West Indies
 Court of Appeal, which has a widely-held reputation
 for impartiality.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary search and entry are prohibited by the consti-
 tution and this prohibition is respected in practice.

 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 St. Lucia has a mixed economy. Foreign investment
 is encouraged, particularly in labor-intensive industry.
 The government has made strenuous efforts, within
 the limits of severe fiscal constraints, to meet the
 social and economic needs of the population. Hurricane
 Allen, in August 1980, dealt a sharp blow to the agricul-
 ture-based economy, throwing thousands of banana workers
 out of their jobs, and de-roofing houses, schools,
 and hospitals around the island. The government has
 made efforts to restore housing and public buildings
 to the state existing before the hurricane, but living
 conditions for the average citizen have not yet returned
 to the pre-hurricane level. There is a modest welfare
 scheme for indigents.
 Over the past five years, St. Lucia has channeled
 more than 20 percent of its total recurrent expenditures
 into education and health, reflecting the high priority
 given to those areas. In 1980, for the first time,
 patient care at the general hospital was made free
 of charge. Elementary school enrollment includes
 95 percent of those eligible. However, shortages
 of teachers and classroom space severely limit secondary
 school enrollment. Only about one third of primary
 school graduates enter junior secondary school (at
 age 12) and only one-third of those enter senior secon-
 dary (at age 15). Approximately three percent of
 the school population eventually graduate as potential
 university entrants. The government is making strenuous
 efforts to expand secondary education, but there is
 little likelihood of major changes in those statistics
 in the near future.
 In agriculture, the government has expressed concern
 about the antiquated land tenure system and has appointed
 a commission to make recommendations for reform.
 Meanwhile, the government has arranged a pilot land
 resettlement scheme to provide five to ten acre plots
 for 175 farmers.
 Women are not discriminated against in matters of
 employment. The manifesto of the ruling party includes
 a commitment to ensure equality of treatment of women
 in all spheres of St. Lucian life, including wages.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The St. Lucian constitution guarantees these freedoms,
 and they are respected in practice.
 St. Lucia has three newspapers, which represent various
 shades of opinion. There are privately-owned radio
 and television stations, and the government-owned
 Radio St. Lucia. There is no censorship of the media.
 There are no restrictions on public meetings; opposition
 groups are free to organize. Trade unions are free
 to organize and elect their own leaders without govern-
 ment interference. Unions in the private sector of
 the economy have the right to strike. The government
 
 
 526
 certification process is impartial, and available
 to all unions. There is no formal union participation
 in labor-related policy decisions, but political leaders
 maintain close contact with all union organizations
 and their views are taken into consideration in the
 decision-making processes.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The constitution guarantees these rights and they
 are honored in practice. These rights are all guaranteed
 in the constitution and are honored in practice.
 There have been no cases of refugee resettlement in
 St. Lucia.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 St. Lucia's two-party system continues to be vigorous,
 with the opposition playing a responsible and active
 role in and out of parliament. There is no bar to
 womens' participation in government, and they hold
 prominent positions in the St. Lucia civil service.
 in elective office, however, their role is more limited.
 The previous government had one woman minister; the
 ruling party ran a female candidate for parliament
 who was defeated in the last election.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged violations of Human Rights
 There have been no reports on St. Lucia by international
 human rights bodies nor any requests for investigation.
 St. Lucia has not signed the American Convention on
 Human Rights. The major domestic organization that
 follows human rights developments is the multi-denomi-
 national St. Lucia Christian Council.
