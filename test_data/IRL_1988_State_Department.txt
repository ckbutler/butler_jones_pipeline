 IRELAND
 The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a
 long tradition of orderly transfer of power. Individual
 liberties and civil rights are guaranteed by the 1937 Irish
 Constitution and subsequent Supreme Court interpretations.
 A civilian police force maintains public safety. Successive
 Irish governments have had to deal with the spillover into the
 Republic of violence in Northern Ireland. The violence led
 Irish authorities to adopt special legislation in 1984 granting
 the police increased powers to detain and interrogate those
 suspected of acts of terrorism. During 1988 the Government
 continued to apply such special legislation with restraint.
 The Irish economy performed well in 1988 despite continued
 fiscal austerity and unemployment at about 18 percent. Exports
 were strong, and the government budget deficit was reduced.
 The Government and people of Ireland attach great importance
 to the observance and maintenance of human rights, both in
 theory and practice at home and abroad. They place strong
 emphasis on human rights in formulating foreign policy, and
 Ireland plays an active role on human rights questions in the
 United Nations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no political killings in the Republic in 1988. In
 the past, politically motivated killings have occurred as a
 spillover from the violence in Northern Ireland. In these
 cases, such groups as the Provisional Irish Republican Army
 (PIRA) or the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) usually
 claim responsibility. The Government uses the full force of
 law to pursue and prosecute such cases wherever possible.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment is respected in practice by the Government. From
 time to time, allegations have been made that individual
 policemen have used physical abuse during interrogations or
 have mistreated prisoners. As an adjunct to the Omnibus
 Criminal Justice Act of 1984, Parliament passed the Garda
 Siochana (Complaints) Act of 1986. The Act provides for the
 investigation and adjudication of complaints about the conduct
 of members of the police. In 1987 a Complaints Board and
 Complaints Appeal Board were set up pursuant to the Act to
 consider breaches of discipline and related matters.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that a person shall be deprived of
 personal liberty only in accordance with the law. The same
 
 
 1102
 IRELAND
 section of the Constitution provides for a judicial
 determination of the legality of a person's detention and
 requires in such cases that the arresting authorities make
 written explanation to the court about the person concerned.
 Neither in law nor in practice is anyone subject to arrest for
 the expression of political or religious views. Arrest is
 carried out openly, and the right to a fair and speedy trial
 with full right of legal counsel exists in law and practice.
 Detention without charge is restricted. It is permitted for a
 maximum of 48 hours, however, in cases covered by the Offenses
 Against the State Act of 1939, legislation designed to "prevent
 actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and
 the authority of the State." This legislation was reactivated
 in 1972 and broadened to include other "scheduled offenses"
 against peace and order. The police can now arrest and detain
 for questioning anyone suspected of any offense involving
 firearms, explosives, membership in an unlawful organization,
 or malicious damage to property. After the 48-hour period,
 the person must be brought before a magistrate, presented with
 written charges, and given legal representation.
 The Omnibus Criminal Justice Act of 1984 gives some increased
 powers to the police in the area of detention for
 interrogation. Critics of the 1984 Act have argued that those
 increased powers, which did not come into effect until 1987
 following implementation of the companion complaints
 procedure, are out of proportion to the threat addressed and
 are unhealthy for democracy. Defenders of this legislation
 counter that two issues of human rights are at stake: the
 right of citizens to be protected against crime, along with
 the safeguarding of individual rights from abuse by police.
 Neither incommunicado detention nor exile is used. With
 regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. The courts are independent, and jury
 trial is the norm. The Constitution provides, however, for
 the creation of "special courts" to deal with cases where the
 "ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective
 administration of justice, and the preservation of public
 peace and order." The Offenses Against the State Act of 1939
 formally set up such courts and provided that they may try
 persons for offenses against national security, particularly
 cases of political violence perpetrated by terrorist groups
 likely to intimidate regular juries. Rather than having
 juries, these courts have panels of judges, each consisting of
 an uneven number of judges, but in any event not less than
 three. Their verdicts are by majority vote. Rules of evidence
 generally are similar to those of regular courts, except that
 the sworn statement of a police chief superintendent that the
 accused is a member of an illegal organization is considered
 prima facie evidence of such membership. Court sessions are
 usually public but may exclude certain persons, other than
 genuine press representatives. There is provision for free
 legal aid and appeal against conviction or sentence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Though not specifically provided for in the Constitution, the
 basic human right of noninterference with personal privacy,
 
 
 1103
 IRELAND
 family, and home is affirmed by the Supreme Court and generally
 observed. The Constitution, however, provides that the State
 shall enact no law "providing for the grant of the dissolution
 of marriage." A proposal to amend the Constitution to permit
 divorce in limited circumstances was overwhelmingly defeated in
 a 1986 nationwide referendum. In the same year, the European
 Court of Human Rights ruled that the absence of divorce is not
 a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are provided for by the Constitution and
 generally respected in practice. The State endeavors to insure
 that organs of public opinion, while preserving liberty of
 expression (including criticism of government policy), are not
 used to undermine public order, morality, or the authority of
 the State. Furthermore, "publication or utterance of
 blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter" is an offense
 punishable by law.
 Ordinarily, official censorship is directed largely toward
 pornographic material- Nonetheless, the state-owned radi and
 television network, on the basis of the constitutional
 provisions dealing with publfc order and the authority of the
 State, denies air time to members of a list of organizations
 including (Provisional) Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of
 the illegal Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). In 1982
 this prohibition was challenged before the Irish Supreme Court
 and upheld on constitutional grounds. All political parties
 not on the list are given access to both public-owned radio
 and television facilities and major independent daily
 newspapers. Criticism of the Government in such media is not
 only allowed but flourishes. Academic freedom is the norm.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are ensured by the Constitution and respected
 in practice. Certain terrorist organizations, such as PIRA
 and INLA, however, are illegal, and membership in them is an
 offense against national security. Political parties or groups
 associated with such organizations, such as (Provisional) Sinn
 Fein, are not proscribed.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Ireland is 94 percent Roman Catholic. The Constitution
 guarantees freedom of religion. There are no restrictions
 upon freedom of worship or association. Discrimination in
 employment, education, and other fields based on religious
 grounds has not been alleged. Some Irish laws, such as the
 prohibition against divorce, reflect the point of view of the
 majority of the population. The area of family law--including
 the rights of illegitimate children--is the subject of current
 debate in which minority religious communities have felt fully
 at liberty to take a vocal and active role.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement within the country, as
 well as freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and
 voluntary repatriation. Irish authorities have accepted
 displaced persons only on a limited basis and firmly apply
 international definitions to those who claim refugee status.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ireland has enjoyed a consistent history of orderly transfer
 of power by elections since the end of the Irish Civil War in
 1923. The country has several political parties and provision
 for independents to stand for election to either house of the
 Irish Parliament. The constitutional requirement that
 elections be held at least every 7 years has always been met.
 Ireland uses a proportional voting system, and the secrecy of
 the ballot is fully safeguarded.
 Women hold prominent positions in the political parties, the
 Parliament, and Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Irish governments generally cooperate with independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights abuses, although they
 have not always been receptive to prisoners' rights groups.
 Amnesty International (AI) is active, as is the Irish Council
 for Civil Liberties. Both operate freely and without hindrance
 in Ireland as the principal independent organizations
 interested in domestic human rights issues.
 Ireland has had the vice-chairmanship of the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission, reflecting concern by both the Government and
 people for worldwide respect 'for basic human rights. This
 concern is reflected as well in support for AI's activities in
 other countries.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government social services provide adequate shelter, nutrition,
 health care, and education without regard to race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. People whose
 means are inadequate and who are not entitled to other benefits
 may receive pensions or other payments from public funds.
 Women now constitute 31 percent of the paid work force.
 Although the Constitution recognizes the woman's role in terms
 of "her life within the home," women have been entering the
 workplace in growing numbers, particularly married women. The
 Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment
 Equality Act of 1977 seek to provide protection and redress
 against sex and pay discrimination. Their operation is
 monitored by the Employment Equality Agency. The number of
 cases has fallen in recent years, but this has not been
 accompanied by real progress in eliminating the differential
 in the key index of average hourly earnings in industry,
 leading the agency itself to admit that legislation alone
 cannot eliminate discrimination. In 1987 the Government moved
 to repeal an antiquated half-century prohibition against night,
 
 
 1105
 IRELAND
 Sunday, and shift work by women in industry that is accountable
 for some of the gap in hourly earnings between the sexes.
 In addition to equal pay issues, family law, rape law reform,
 and social welfare discrimination are priorities for Ireland's
 women's movement in the human rights field.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike.
 There is no basic law governing trade union activities. The
 right to join a union is guaranteed by law, as is the right to
 refrain from joining. Most businesses (covering over 56
 percent of the labor force) are unionized.
 The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), which represents
 unions in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, has 81
 member unions with 670,000 members. Both the ICTU and the
 unaffiliated unions are independent of the Government and of
 the political parties. The ICTU is affiliated with the
 European Trade Union Confederation-
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor unions have full freedom to organize and to engage- in
 free collective bargaining. Most terms and conditions of
 employment are determined through collective bargaining.
 Labor legislation and practice are uniform throughout the
 country. As part of the industrial relations machinery, the
 Labour Court, consisting of an employer representative, a
 trade union representative, and an independent chairman, may
 investigate trade disputes, recommend the terms of settlement,
 engage in conciliation and arbitration, and set up joint
 committees to regulate conditions of employment and minimum
 rates of pay for workers in a given trade or industry.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14 years with the written
 permission of the parents. Irish laws limit the hours of
 employment for 15-year-olds to 8 hours per day and 40 hours
 per week. Those from 16 to 17 years of age may work up to
 9 hours per day and 40 hours per week. These provisions are
 effectively enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no general minimum wage legislation. However, some
 56,000 workers are covered by minimum wage laws applicable to
 specific industrial sectors, mainly those which tend to pay
 lower than average wages. The 1987 average weekly wage of
 $285 for production and transport workers was generally
 adequate to provide an acceptable standard of living. Working
 hours in the industrial sector are limited to 9 hours per day
 and 48 hours per week. Overtime work is limited to 2 hours per
 day, 12 hours per week, and 240 hours in a year. Four basic
 laws dealing with occupational safety provide adequate
 coverage. An extensive system of public health insurance
 offers health protection.
