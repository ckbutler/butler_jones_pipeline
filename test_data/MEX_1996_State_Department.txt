 MEXICO
 Mexico is a federal republic with an elected president, a bicameral legislature, and
 a constitutionally mandated independent judiciary. The Institutional Revolutionary
 Party (PRI) has won every presidential election since the party's founding in 1929
 many of which involved credible allegations of fraudulent practices. Most national
 and international observers, however, regarded the August 1994 presidential elec-
 tions as free and honest. The success of these elections carried over in 1995 into
 most state elections, with only one state election marred by allegations of serious
 fraud. In 1996 most state elections were fair and orderly. A few, such as the munici-
 pal race in Huejotzingo, Puebla, provoked serious postelectoral conflicts, most of
 which have been resolved. In November the Congress approved a package of further
 electoral reforms, including full autonomy for the Federal Electoral Institute and
 elections for Mexico City's local government. Due to disagreements on a number of
 issues, especially campaign spending limits and rules governing coalitions, however,
 the main opposition parties' legislators voted against the law. Despite opposition
 criticism of the PRs decision to press for adoption of certain provisions on cam-
 pgn financing in the reform package, the law includes the basic elements that had
 n agreed upon by the opposition.
 Several southern states, most notably Guerrero, Tabasco, Oaxaca, and Chiapas,
 continued to suffer politically motivated violence. The Government and the
 Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) remain committed to a negotiated set-
 tlement and peace talks continued throughout the year. On February 16, the parties
 signed an agreement on the rights of indgenous people. The army and the EZLN
 have not clashed since the Government unilaterally declared a cease-fire on January
 12 1994. A new group of uncertain origin and size, the Popular Revolutionary Army
 (EiPR), made its appearance on June 28. The Government considers the EPR a ter-
 rrist organization and has vowed to bring the group to justice.
 Po~ice Tores maintain internal security. The army is responsible for external secu-
 rity but also has domestic security responsibilities. The security forces, including the
 federal and state judicial police, federal highway police, and local police, are under
 the control of elected civilian officials. owever, corruption is rife within police
 ranks. Members of the security forces continued to commit numerous human rights
 abuses.
 Mexico has a market-based, mixed economy, which the Government has been pro-
 gressively deregulating and opening. An ambitious program of privatization has re-
 duced state-owned companies from more than 1,150 to less than 200. About 29   -
 cent of gross domestic product (GDP) comes from manufacturing, 20 percent from
 commerce, 6 percent from agriculture, and 45 percent from service industries. There
 is significant subsistence agriculture, and 25 percent of the populace lives in rural
 areas. Leading exports include automobiles, manufactured and assembled products
 (including electronics and consumer goods), and petrochemicals. Although per capita
 GDP in 1994 was about $4,200, it fell to about $2,800 in 1995 as a consequence of
 currency devaluation and the recession. In 1996 there was steady improvement in
 macroeconomic indices such as GDP, external account balance, and foreign currency
 reserves and some modest recovery in employment. The microeconomic situation,
 however, did not improve significantly. Consumption wages, and employment re-
 main far below 1994 levels; this has produced higher levels of crime and social ten-
 sion. There are severe and growing inequalities in income distribution, with large
 numbers of people living in extreme poverty in rural areas, shanty towns, and urban
 slums.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, although se-
 rious problems remained in some areas, and some states present special concerns.
 Major abuses included extrajudicial killings, torture, illegal arrests, arbitrary deten-
 
 
 tions, poor prison conditions, illegal searches, violence against women, discrimina-
 tion against women and indigenous persons, some limits on worker rights, and ex-
 tensive child labor in agriculture and in the informal economy. The Government
 contiued, with limited success, its attempt to end the "culture of impunity" sur-
 runding the securit forces through reforms in the Federal Attorney General's of-
 fice (PGR).These incuded the dismissal of over 1,250 corrupt officials, new recruit-
 ment and training procedures, and closer supervision of federal police and prosecu-
 tors. The Government also continued its support for the government-funded Na-
 tional Human Rights Commission (CNDH) and the implementation of a wide-rang-
 ing package of other police and judicial reforms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Interity of te Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings.-Police and vigilantes acting on be-
 half of local landowners continued to commit extrajudicial killigs while dislodging
 pasant squaatters from rural lands in several states. To expand communal rand
 oldings, for decades peasants have invaded private lands and petitioned for govern-
 ment recognition of the seizures.
 _Some lare landowners and local political bosses in Chiapas maintain private mi-
 litias to defend their property from peasant land invasions and to intimidate local
 opposition. This problem is especially acute in some northern regions of the state,
 where the groupPeace and Justice ("Pazy Justicia"), headed by autonomous local
 political bosses loosely affiliated with the P RI, is based. State authorities do not ef-
 fectively impede the establishment of these militias, which reportedly often employ
 police and military personnel.
 According to statistics compiled by the District Attorney's office for Chiapas state,
 approximately 500 peasants have been killed in the last 3 years as a result of vio-
 lence in the northern municipalities of Tila, Sabanilla, Salto de Agua, and Tumbala.
 The Fray Bartolome de las Casas Center for Human Rights reported that at least
 2,000 indigenous families have abandoned their lands for fear of violent attacks by
 the Peace and Justice group. Human Rights Watch/Americas similarly reported ex-
 plsions of peasants from Miguel Aleman, Nuevo Linar, Susuchumil, Tzaquil, and
 Usipa on account of the fact that they were supporters of the national Democratic
 Revolutionary Party (PHD).
 On May 5, in Bachajon, Chiapas, an autonomous local paramilitary group also
 loosely affiliated with the PHI (the "Chinchulines"), was involved in vioience with
 peasants arising out of longstanding land disputes. Members of the Chinchulines
 pa aritrarilydetained villagers the day before. In retaliation for this and previous
 actions taken against them, the villagers attacked the house of the Chinchulines'
 leader and shot and killed him and another member of that group. Following the
 slayings, the Chinchulines pursued the peasants and in the resulting clash two
 more Chinchulines were killed, ases l  two peasants. The Chinchulines then set
 fihe to a number of houses belonging to the peasants. They also unsuccessfully at-
 tempted to burn a Jesuit residence in Bachajon. In total, 6 Chinchulnes and peas-
 ants were killed, 23 houses and businesses burned to the ground, and 14 vehicles
 destroyed. State police were sent to the area and arrested 28 people for the violence.
 According to the Miguel Agstin Pro Juarez Center for Human Rights, there were
 nine killings as a result of drug trafficking in the region of San Lucas Ateyaquilto,
 axaca. Local political bosses ("caciques") have benefited not only from alleged nar-
 ctic ties but also from their ability to seize the lands deserted by peasants fleeing
 the violence. Drug traffickers also resorted to killings to intimidate the indigenous
 peoples of the Tarahumara region in the north.
 In the Huasteca region of Northern Veracruz, citizens complain of a perceived
 militarization in the area caused by the presence of army troops. Police continued
 to evict, detain arbitrarily, and destroy the homes of peasant leaders in the state
 of Veracruz. Land disputes in the state, especially those involving ranchers and in-
 digenous persons, are the principal cause of such violence. Police oftn fail to inves-
 tigate killings of peasants by ranchers.
 On April 10, citizens of Tepoztlan, Morelos, were marching on the "Emiliano Z-
 pata Route" to Tlaltizapan in order to present a petition to President Zedillo protest-
 ing the planned development of a golf course on communal lands. The police stpped
 the protesters and flred shots; the protesters responded by fleeing and defending
 themselves with rocks. In the melee, police shot and killed one protester, Marcos
 Olmedo. The Governor of Morelos denounced the shooting, saying that police are
 under standing instructions not to use firearms against demonstrators. The authori-
 ties arrested one policeman in connection with the shooting, and he remained in
 custody at year's end.

 There has been an increase in the number of public lynchings occurring through-
 out the country, primarily in rural communities with limited access to the criminal
 justice system. According to pess reports, 21 people were killed by lynching from
 September 1995 to August 19.
 At the request of President Zedillo, a panel of three Supreme Court justices con-
 ducted an inquiry into the June 28, 1995 slaying of 17 peasants in Aguas Blancas,
 Guerrero. Guerrero state police killed the peasants while they were en route to pro-
 test the Government's failure to deliver promised herbicides. Many were members
 of the Peasant Organization of the Southern Sierra (OCSS), a small, leftist organiza-
 tion, formerly linked to the PRD. The justices rejected the conclusions of the Guer-
 rero state attorney general's office that heavily armed policemen had acted in self-
 defense and that the peasants had fired first. The justices agreed with the conclu-
 sions of a CNDH investigation which determined that a film of the scene that offi-
 cials had used to exonerate themselves had been tampered with, that at least one
 deliberate execution occurred, and that police placed weapons into the hands of the
 dead peasants in order to give the appearance that the peasants were armed and
 belligerent.
 The justices also concluded that Guerrero Governor Ruben Figueroa shared re-
 sponsibility for the massacre. Following the broadcast of an unedited, undoctored
 version of the film, clearly implicating the state police, and the start of the Supreme
 Court investigation, Governor Figueroa requested indefinite leave from his position.
 On March 13, the Guerrero state legislature named Angel Aguirre Rivero interim
 governor to replace Figueroa. In July, however, the Guerrero state legislature voted
 to exonerate Figueroa for any involvement he had in the Aguas Blancas killings.
 Nonetheless, he remains out of office. Then-CNDH president Jorge Madrazo called
 on the Guerrero state government to comply fully with the CNDI-s-, recommenda-
 tions including a thorough reorganization of the state police. In accordance with
 CNDHI recommendations, former special prosecutor MigueI Angel Garcia Dominguez
 (who later left his position to become a state supreme court justice in Guanajuato)
 brought criminal charges against some state officials and ordered the arrest of 10
 policemen involved in the killings.
 On December 29, an unknown killer murdered Rene Jaramillo Pineda, factional
 leader of the National Teachers' Union and chief of technical education in Guerrero,
 who was also a prominent supporter of former Governor Figueroa.
 In January federal judicial police arrested 4 ex-officials and 18 state policemen
 in conjunction with the Aguas Blancas killings. They included the former state po-
 lice operations director, Manuel Moreno Gonzalez, fir t deputy state attorney gen-
 eral Rodolfo Espino, former director general of state security Esteban Mendatt
 Ramos, and Gustavo Martinez Galeana, former chief of state security for the Costa
 Grand region of Guerrero. Then-CNDH president Madrazo said that in spite of the
 arrests of the four state government officials, other, higher ranking officials cited
 in the CNDH's recommendation as bearing responsibility for the crime remained
 free.
 Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of ex-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, re-
 mains in prison pending trial as an alleged conspirator in the assassination of then-
 PRI Secretary General Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu in September 1994. In addition
 to charges for the murder of Ruiz Massieu, Raul Salinas has also been charged with
 "unexplainable enrichment" (corruption) for allegedly amassing a fortune estimated
 in excess of $100 million during his brother's presidency.
 Mario Ruiz Massieu, former Deputy Attorney General (and brother of Jose Ruiz
 Massieu), remains in the United States pending ongoing deportation efforts. The
 Government has charged him with obstruction of justice for concealing Raul Salinas'
 role in Jose Ruiz Massieu's murder.
 Gaston Ayala Beltran, a former state judicial police officer, remains in custody for
 the May 10, 1995, murder of Jalisco state Attorney General Leobardo Larios
 Guzman. Three other alleged gunmen of the Tijuana drug cartel were arrested in
 connection with the murder, and they remain in custody.
 On August 7, Othon Cortez Vazquez, the alleged second gunman in the March
 1994 assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, was released
 for lack of evidence. The PGR is appealing the decision.
 On May 10, an appeals court overturned the conviction of police officer Jose Anto-
 nio Verduzco Flores or beating U.S. citizen Mario Amado to death in 1992 in a Baja
 California jail, allowing Verduzco to go free. No new charges have been brought. The
 state District Attornes office was conducting a review of the Amado case.
 There were no new developments in the 67 cases of violence (including murders)
 against PRD activists in which CNDH has issued recommendations since 1992. The
 authorities have fully complied with 28 recommendations but only partially com-
 plied with the remaining 39.
 
 
 b. Disappearance.-There were credible reports by the media and NGO's of dis-
 appearances during sweeps by security and military forces in Oaxaca and Guerrero
 in attempts to round up EPR members. While denying that any individuals had
 been illegally detained, the Government offered to investigate each alleged dis-
 appearance. Many local NGO's report a disappearance when the authorities arbi-
 trarily or illegally detain a person for questioning and release the suspect within
 days or weeks. In Oaxaca, for example, local human rights organizations indicated
 that all those reported as missing under such conditions were later accounted for.
 According to the Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez Center for Human Rights, 18 persons
 in Sinaloa state and 1 person in Chihuahua disappeared in 1996, probably due to
 the actions of drug traffickers.
 Amnesty International's 1996 report stated that two people who disappeared in
 1995 still remain missing. On May 24, 1995, OCSS leader Gilberto Romero Vasquez
 disappeared after his organization had presented a series of demands to state au-
 thorities. Such demands later led to the Aguas Blancas massacre. Amnesty Inter-
 national also reported that in October 1995, Cuauhtemoc Ornelas Campos, a jour-
 nalist and human rights activist, disappeared after receiving anonymous threats for
 publicly criticizing human rights abuses by local officials.
 For the period of May 1995 to May 1996, the CNDH reported that it was able
 to conclude 38 cases of presumed disappearances. Of those cases, 33 of the people
 were found living, and the remaining 5 were found dead or with evidence of having
 died. This brings the total of cases of presumed disappearances investigated by
 CNDH to 153, of which 93 persons were found to be living and 36 dead or with evi-
 dence of having died.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture; however, it continues to be a serious human
 rights problem. Members of the security forces continued to torture and abuse de-
 tainees. The most commonly used methods of torture were threats, beatings, as-
 phyxiation, and electric shocks. Soldiers also reportedly used torture against mem-
 rs of the EPR (see Section 1.g.).
 There are persistent reports by NGO's of widespread use of torture bypolice and
 security forces. Although the CNDH reported in May that torture dropped frm the
 15th to 17th most common type of complaint, the actual number of complaints of
 torture increased by 31 percent, with a total of 59 complaints during the year. Of
 the 59 complaints alleging torture received by the CNDH, it referred 16 to state
 human rights authorities having jurisdiction over such matters. Of those cases ban-
 ded by the CNDH, 16 involved actions taken in 1996, 23 in 1995, and the remain-
 ing 4 occurred prior to 1995. As of publication of its 1995-96 report, the CNDH had
 issued recommendations in five of those cases, in all of which the authorities in-
 volved were in the process of taking corrective action.
 The CNDH, however, does not maintain statistics on torture complaints made to
 state human rights commissions. Of the 31 states and the Federal District, only the
 states of Hidago and Puebla lack laws prohibiting torture. Poorly trained and
 equipped to investigate crimes, police officers continued to attempt to solve crimes
 by rounding up likely suspects and then exacting confessions from them. Many state
 human rights commissions received reports of torture allegedly committed by police.
 According to the Human Rights Commission for the Federal District, for the period
 from October 1995 to September 1996, torture had dropped to 33rd on its list of
 most common complaints, with 16 cases reported.
 The authorities punish few officials for torture, which continues to occur mainly
 because confessions are the primary evidence in many criminal convictions. Many
 victims do not report, or do not follow through on, their complaints against the po-
 lice for fear of reprisals.
 On January 3, 1997, a Federal District appeals court freed seven alleged
 Zapatistas, convicted on August 20 on charges including possession of illegal weap-
 ons and explosives and sentenced to prison terms of 6 to 9 years. Police had arested
 the seven and detained them since February 8, 1995, after their safe house was dis-
 covered in Yanga, Veracruz. Defense attorneys had protested the conviction and said
 their clients would appeal, stressing that the CNDH found that the defendants had
 been tortured by security forces.
 In some cases police officers dismissed in one state find law enforcement employ-
 ment in another. The CNDH discovered that even when the authorities censured
 some officers in one law enforcement job, they moved on to other positions and were
 subsequently charged a ain with human rights abuses. In an effort to remedy this
 situation, the CNDH publishes lists of censured public servants in its annual report
 and monthly newsletters. In addition, the Government has established a national
 security register to keep track of censured police officers and address this problem.
 
 
 499
 
 Prison conditions are poor. Many prisons are staffed by undertrained and corrupt
 guards, and some lack adequate facilities for prisoners and are overcrowded, despite
 an early release program endorsed by the CNDH and legal reforms reducing the
 number of crimes that carry mandatory prison sentences. Prisoners complain that
 they must purchase food, medicine, and other necessities from guards or bribe
 guards to allow the goods to be brought in from outside. Drug and alcohol use is
 rampant in prisons. Frequently, prisoners exercise authority within a prison, dis-
 placing prison officials. Conflicts between rival prison groups, often involved in drug
 trafficking, continued to spark lethal violence. While the authorities prosecuted a
 few prison officials for abusing prisoners, it was more common to dismiss them or
 to charge them with only minor offenses.
 The penal system comprises 3 federal penitentiaries, 8 prisons within the Federal
 District, 274 state prisons, and 150 municipal jails for a total of 435 facilities. Ac-
 cording to the Secretary of Government's Program for Prevention and Social Re-
 adaptation, 1995-2000, the prison population has increased annually by 25 percent,
 resulting in the space designed to hold 91,548 prisoners becoming overcrowded. As
 of December 1995, there was an excess of 2,026 prisoners for the space available.
 According to a study conducted by the CNDH, from March 1994 to March 1996,
 over 50 prison riots occurred. Influence peddling, drug and arms trafficking, coer-
 cion, violence, sexual abuse, and protection payoffs are the chief methods of control
 used by prisoners against fellow prisoners in a form of self-government within the
 system.
 A 5-day riot that began on July 3 at the Cereso One prison in Ciudad Victoria,
 Tamaulipas, resulted in 23 police injured, 12 prisoners injured, and 1 prisoner dead.
 Some prisons, contrary to law, do not separate male and female populations. Offi-
 cials sometimes encourage women to form sexual liaisons with male prisoners and
 guards. In some cases, officials coerce women into sexual relationships.
 The CNDH has a program to inspect prisons (from May 1995 to May 1996, the
 CNDH made 77 visits to 54 prisons in 25 states) and to investigate prisoner com-
 plaints.
 There is no specific law or regulation regarding the ability of NGO's to visit pris-
 ons. In practice, such prison visits are allowed and are common. For example, mem-
 bers of the Democratic Lawyers National Front represented prisoners alleged to be
 members of the EZLN and were allowed to visit them in prison. Similarly, rep-
 resentatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross were allowed to visit
 with the alleged EZLN members.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention; however, the police continued to arrest and detain citizens arbi-
 trarily. The law provides that the District Attorney may not detain an accused per-
 son more than 48 hours before presenting the person before a judge, but it makes
 an exception for persons apprehended in the act of committing a crime. In Novem-
 ber Congress amended the Penal Procedures Federal Code to apply this exception
 to acts committed up to 72 hours prior to detention. The Mexican Commission for
 Defense and Promotion of Human Rights strongly criticized this change. The Con-
 stitution provides that the authorities must try an accused person within 4 months
 if the alleged crime carries a sentence of less than 2 years, or within 1 year if the
 crime carries a longer sentence. The law requires that prisoners awaiting trial be
 housed separately from those convicted. In practice, judicial and police authorities
 frequently ignored these time limits. According to the CNDH and NGO's, the au-
 thorities often held criminal defendants with convicted prisoners and for longer than
 allowed by law before going to trial.
 Arbitrary arrest and detention continued to be among the most common human
 rights abuses. For the period May 1995 to December 1996, the CNDH reported 303
 findings of arbitrary detention and 36 cases in which it found that authorities held
 prisoners incommunicado. The Human Rights Commission for the Federal District
 reported 272 complaints of arbitrary detention for the period from October 1995 to
 September 1996. It found the most common complaint to be delay in the administra-
 tion of justice, with 602 complaints. The Commission was critical of numerous arrest
 orders in the Federal District being ignored or unresolved.
 In April 1995, the police arrested Mauricio Franco Sanchez for physically blocking
 efforts to build a golf course on an environmentally protected area in Tepoztlan,
 Morelos. In January 1996, a court sentenced Franco to a term of 10 years and 7
 months, but he was released on July 8. The police also arrested several other mem-
 bers of the Tepoztlan United Committee who protested construction of the golf
 course and held them on charges of participating in a murder. Several human rights
 groups contend that the police are really holding these individuals because they pro-
 tested construction of the golf course. In response to local protests, the developers
 
 
 500
 of the proposed golf course and housing and resort complex canceled the project in
 Aril.
 Detention of opposition political activists is neither widespread nor systematic but
 does occur frequently for short periods of time. Judges often failed to sentence indig-
 enous detainees within legally mandated periods.
 For the period from June 1994 to December 1996, the CNDH reviewed 7,823 files
 of indigenous persons detained in Mexican jails. The Commission recommended the
 immediate release of 1,887 persons. By year's end, the authorities had released
 1,069 of them; 818 cases were still pending. Of those states with the largest num-
 bers of indigenous prisoners, the CNDH reviewed 2,111 cases in Oaxaca, and rec-
 ommended 403 releases, of which 272 have been accomplished; 1,106 cases in
 Veracruz, with 331 recommendations for release and 198 releases; and 639 cases in
 Puebla, with 154 releases recommended, and 63 releases took place.
 Federal prosecutors continued to adhere to the recommen ation by the National
 Indigenous Institute (INI) that they drop charges against first-time offenders ac-
 cused of drug cultivation, as drug traffickers often forced indigenous defendants,
 who do not understand the legal significance of their actions, to grow the crops.
 Many detainees report that officials ask them to pay bribes for release before for-
 mal arraignment; many of those arrested report that they are able to bribe officials
 to have them drop charges before they go -efore a judge. Corruption is rampant
 throughout the system.
 In an effort to instill a greater sense of professionalism and root out corruption
 in the Mexico City police force, and in the aftermath of clashes between police and
 protesting teachers in May, President Zedillo replaced Police Commissioner David
 Garay with General Enrique Salgado Cordero. Sagado named about 40 military of-
 ficers to key positions on the metropolitan police force. Many sectors of society, in-
 cluding human rights gups expressed concern that this would result in increased
 militarization of the Mexico ity police. Other broad sectors of society supported the
 move. Salgado announced a 22-point reform program, which includes human rights
 training for all police, a review of the institutional structure, and greater economic
 resources for the police.
 Robberies committed by policemen are common. In a number of cases in northern
 border states, judges, police, and persons posing as attorneys extorted large sums
 of money ($3,000 to $10,000) from tourists to fI" real or fabricated infractions.
 State human rights commission authorities in Coahuila widely published a toll-free
 telephone number for reporting police abuses, but, according to the Coahuila Human
 Rights Commission, there were few if any such calls.
 Most citizens view the police as corrupt and unhelpful: 64 percent of crime victims
 in Mexico City did not report incidents to law enforcement authorities. According
 to a reliable 1995 poll, 75 percent of those surveyed felt that the justice system was
 riddled with corruption. Police academies in some states, such as Coahuila, Du-
 rango and Sonora, sought to improve police conduct by offering special courses
 aimed at greater professionalization. However, such progress among the various po-
 lice forces is highy uneven.
 On August 16, then-Attorney General Antonio Lozano dismissed 737 federal judi-
 cial police officers as part of an effort to professionalize the police, control corrup-
 tion, and combat organized crime and drug trafficking. These dismissals followed
 the gradual removal of over 500 PGR personnel since Lozano took office in Decem-
 ber 1994. Lozano also announced creation of a technical administrative commission
 to establish guidelines and internal controls for federal police personnel. This com-
 mission will monitor the performance of federal police officers and determine if they
 should remain on the force.
 These reforms are part of a wide-ranging package to reduce corruption and pro-
 mote professionalism, which includes new training and recruitment procedures for
 the PGR, closer supervision of PGR officers, and a reorganization of the PGR's struc-
 ture. In addition, CNDH president Madrazo launched, together with the Human
 Rights Commissions for the 31 states and the Federal District, a nationwide initia-
 tive to increase awareness of victims' rights. On December 2, Lozano resigned as
 Attorney General and was replaced by CNDH president Madrazo. President Zedillo
 emphasized that one of the new Attorney General's tasks was to complete the re-
 form and cleanup of the PGR.
 The law does not permit exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is nominally independent but in the
 past has been influenced by the executive branch, and corruption and inefficiency
 were commonplace.
 The federal court system is composed of 98 district courts, over which are 32 cir-
 cuit courts of appeal and a Supreme Court. In 1995 President Zedillo proposed and
 Congress approved extensive judicial reform legislation. These reforms included: Se-
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 501
 lecting most lower and appellate federal court judges and law secretaries by com-
 petitive examinations; creating an independent judicial council to administer the
 federal courts (except the Supreme Court, which administers itself); and requiring
 two-thirds of the Senate to confirm the appointment of a Supreme Court justice. The
 reforms also provided the Supreme Court with the authority to strike down a law
 for unconstitutionality (one-third of the Congress, one-third of a state congress, or
 the Attorney General must ask the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality
 of a law before it can be declared unconstitutional). Significant efforts to implement
 these reforms were made in 1996. The first groups of federal judges chosen by exam-
 ination entered the system.
 The judicial trial system is based on the Napoleonic Code and consists of a series
 of fact-gathering hearings at which the court receives documentary evidence or testi-
 mony. In addtion, officials may add notarized documents to the official case file
 without authentication. While the law requires that these hearings must be open
 to the public, in practice the courts ignore this law. Journalists covering judicial pro-
 ceedings must rely on statements of attorneys outside the courtroom as to what oc-
 curred inside. A judge alone in chambers reviews the case file and makes a final
 written ruling based-thereon. The record of the proceeding is not available to the
 public;, only the parties and, by special motion, the victim may have access to the
 official file.
 While there is a constitutional right to an attorney at all stages of criminal pro-
 ceedings, in practice, the authorities often do not assure adequate representation for
 many poor defendants. Attorneys are not always available during the questioning
 of defendants; in some instances a defense attorney will attempt to represent sev-
 eral clients simultaneously by entering different rooms to certify that he was
 present although he did not actually attend the full proceedings. In the case of in-
 digenous defendants, many of whom do not speak Spanish, the situation is often
 worse. The courts do not routinely furnish translators for them at all stages of
 criminal proceedings, and thus defendants may be unaware of the status of their
 case.
 Some human rights groups claim that activists arrested in connection with land
 disputes and other civil disobedience activities are in fact political prisoners. The
 Government asserts that the system fairly prosecutes those charged in sometimes
 violent land invasions for common crimes, such as homicide and damage to prop-
 erty.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the rights to privacy, family, home, and correspondence.
 The law requires search warrants, but there are credible claims that unlawful
 searches without warrants are common.
 On November 21, 1995, Congress passed the General Law for the Coordination
 of the National System of Public Security, and the Government created a National
 Council for Public Security on March 7. It is composed of the heads of the Govern-
 ment's main offices related to internal security such as the Secretariats of the Inte-
 rior, Defense, Navy, the PGR, and chief of the Mexico City police. It is also respon-
 sible for coordinating joint actions between local and federal police, assisting with
 international cooperation programs, and preparing legislation on security matters
 for the Congress.
 On November 7, Congress passed the Federal Law against Organized Crime
 which, anmong other changes, allows for electronic surveillance with a judicial order.
 The law prohibits electronic surveillance in cases of electoral, civil, commercial,
 labor or administrative matters.
 g. se of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-There were no reported clashes between troops stationed in Chiapas and the
 EZLN during 1996. The military continues to deny any responsibility for abuses
 committed during the early stages of the Chiapas rebellion in 1994. The military
 authorities who have jurisdiction have failed to punish any military personnel or
 government officials for committing abuses, although the CNDH issued an interim
 report in May 1994 finding that there was reason to believe that the military had
 injured or killed civilians in aerial attacks, and that there were summary execu-
 tions, illegal detentions, and instances of torture.
 Amnesty International reported that on February 9, 1995, soldiers kidnaped two
 indigenous men, Alfredo Jimenez Santis and Mario Alvarez Lopez. The soldiers tor-
 tured and beat the men for 5 days at a military installation in the state capital
 Tuxtla Gutierrez and then released them. The authorities took no disciplinary ac-
 tion against the soldiers.
 The Chiapas women's rights organization, "Women of San Cristebal de Las
 Casas," has documented 50 cases of rape during 1995 in the municipalities of
 
 
 502
 Altamirano, San Andres Larrainzar, Amatenango, San Cristobal, and Ocosingo.
 They alleged that some were committed by security forces.
 On February 9, 1995 the authorities arrested Javier Elorriaga Berdegue, a jour-
 nalist covering the EZLN conflict, and charged him with terrorism, conspiring
 against the State, and rebellion. In May after his 1-year judicial proceeding was
 over, a court sentenced Elorriaga to 13 years' imprisonment. On June 7, however,
 an appeals court overturned Elorriaga's conviction and released him from prison.
 Army troops were also deployed in Guerrero following the June 28 appearance of
 the EPR on the 1-year anniversary of the Aguas Blancas killings. Sweeps conducted
 by police and military personnel resulted in a number of arrests. Many NGO's ex-
 pressed concern that the security forces tortured some of the detainees. There were
 reports of torture in connection with arrests by security forces searching for mem-
 bers of the EPR in the state of Guerrero. Soldiers detained Jose Nava  nrade, a
 member of the Organization of Towns and Settlers of Guerrero, on July 2 and alleg-
 edly tortured him in an attemp tto force him to confess membership in the EPR.
 Information regarding this andsimilar cases was presented to the Inter-American
 Commission on Human Rights when the commission visited Mexico in July. Am-
 nesty International also reported that the authorities arrested Hilario Mesino
 Acosta of the OCSS on July 3 and allegedly tortured him, accusing him of being
 an EPR member. At year's end, they were holding Mesino in the state prison in Aca-
 pulco, Guerrero.
 On the night of August 28, the EPR carried out 18 small-scale actions in 7 states,
 ranging from attacks on municipal police stations in Guerrero and Oaxaca to hand-
 ing out propaganda on roads in Chiapas. These attacks left 14 dead and 23 wound-
 e   Police and military personnel deployed to search for the group in the states
 where there was reported EPR activity and arrested about 45 alleged EPR mem-
 bers. Many human rights groups reported that some of the persons detained were
 tortured or mistreated by the authorities. Following the emergence of the EPR,
 human rights groups noted an increase in the presence of army troops in the
 Huasteca area of Veracruz and in parts of Oaxaca.
 The law does not require civil trial of soldiers involved in civil crimes, and the
 military continues to handle such cases. The Constitution provides for military juris-
 diction for crimes or offenses involving any violation of military discipline. In cases
 in which a member of the military commits a crime and is arrested by civil authori-
 ties, the military has the right to immediately request transfer of the case to mili-
 tary jurisdiction. Several NGO's complained about the growing militarization of the
 country and expressed the fear that military abuses would not be subject to civil
 jurisdiction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice. Mass
 media are not subject to formal censorship from any element of government. Direct
 criticism of the Government, especially in print media in Mexico City, is severe and
 commonplace. Journalists and international scholars persuasively argue that edi-
 torial independence in many, if not most, of Mexico's news organizations is tilted
 towards the Government by a complex system that has developed over the years.
 The key elements of the system are: Coincidence of interest between media owners
 and the Government; broadcast licensing;, official advertising (some of it disguised
 as news coverage); a state-run newsprint sales company; and a variety of cash and
 noncash payments to journalists from various levels of government. One important
 editor reports that he is the subject of government-inspired rumor mongering.
 In June an appeals court overturned journalist Javier Elorriaga Berdegue's con-
 viction on charges brought after he was arrested while covering the ELZN (see Sec-
 tion 1.g.).
 The greatest concentration of official influence is in television. Television broad-
 casters give a contribution of air time-in the form of a 12.5 percent tax on advertis-
 ing revenues -instead of actual cash payments. This system lowers effective tax
 rates of the broadcasters and gives the Government guaranteed access to this pow-
 erful medium. The giant Televisa chain dominates television, and its extremely close
 relation to the Government is openly acknowledged. The second national network,
 TV Aztecs, has come under a coud since the imprisoned Raul Salinas, brother of
 the former President, acknowledged loaning its principal shareholder part of the
 network's purchase price-although there is no evidence of criminality, and TV
 Azteca is clearly more distant from the Government than Televisa.
 The Government has the power to grant or withdraw broadcast licenses. Media
 observers continue to allege privately that the Government delays issuance of broad-
 cast licenses as an implicit control over broadcasters, but they have not proven any
 
 
 503
 allegations of broadcast licensingdelays by the Government. There have also been
 printed allegations of favoritism by the Government in granting broadcast licenses,
 but again, such allegations have never been proven. This possibility may lead to
 self-censorship by some broadcast media.
 The CNDH reviews all reports of attacks on journalists that it receives. The
 CNDH received 17 allegations of attacks on journalists in the exercise of their pro-
 fession during the latest reporting year (May 1995 to May 1996). There were 11
 such complaints in the previous year. Most reports received by the CNDH were from
 outside Mexico City, and most alleged violent acts or intimidation. The 1995 murder
 of a newspaper reporter in Tijuana was still under investigation by state authorities
 in Baja California.
 The Constitution recognizes academic freedom in higher education, and the Gov-
 ernment respects this provision in practice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice. The only
 requirement for holding demonstrations is that groups wishing to meet in public
 areas inform local police authorities; public demonstrations are held frequently.
 The Constitution provides for the right to organize or affiliate with political par-
 ties, and the Government respects this right in practice. Opposition and independ-
 ent associations functioned freely without government interference or restriction.
 The Federal Electoral Code recognizes national political associations. Such political
 associations can participate in elections through an agreement with one political
 party but are not allowed to use their names or symbols during the election cam-
 paigns. Private associations do not have legal status until they receive their official
 designation from the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE). In November the IFE recog-
 nized 24 citizen organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right to practice the re-
 ligion of one's choice, and the authorities generally respect this right in practice.
 However, local authorities sometimes infringed on this right (see Section 5). The law
 bars clergy from holding public office and from advocating partisan political posi-
 tions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of free movement, and the Gov-
 ernment does not generally restrict movement of its citizens into, out of, or within
 the country.
 The law provides protection for foreigners who face political persecution.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 With the UNHCR, the Government assisted with the repatriation of Guatemalan
 refugees desiring to return home who had fled their country during the civil war
 in the 1980's and granted others wishing to stay in Mexico official immigrant resi-
 dency status. The Government agrees, in ractice, with the principle of first asylum
 and reviews each claim on a case-by-case iasis with the assistance of the UNHCR.
 During the first half of 1996, Mexico expelled 57,502 "undocumented" or illegal
 immigrants, the majority of whom were Guatemalans. After Guatemalans, the larg-
 est groups were Salvadorans and Hondurans. Many of those expelled were en route
 to the northern border with the United States. There were no reports of forced re-
 turn of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Illegal immigrants rarely file charges in cases of crimes committed against them.
 The authorities generally immediately deport illegal immigrants who come to their
 attention; therefore, a pending case brought by an llegal immigrant is subject to
 dismissal once the immigrant has been deported In an effort to promote the human
 rights of migrants and to inform them of their rights the CNDH and the Secretary
 of Government published in May a "Guide to Human Rights for Migrants." The Gov-
 ernment is translating the guide into several indigenous dialects. Additionally, in
 Augst, the Interior   iistr~ established two additional Grupo-Beta type units
 (multiagency migrant protection units) along its southern border with Guatemala.
 In June and July, the Government negotiated agreements with Guatemala and
 Belize designed to make legal entry and exit more transparent and safer.
 Until 1995 children who were in Mexico illegally did not have the right to matric-
 ulate in public schools. According to new Education Secretariat guidelines, any child
 may now be registered for public school with a Mexican or foreign birth certificate.
 Implementation of the new guidelines varies widely from state to state, however.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment through periodic elections. The PRI dominates politics and has controlled
 
 
 504
 the Government since the party was founded in 1929. It has won every presidential
 election since then and has maintained power, in part, by relying on public patron-
 age, use of government and party organizational resources, and, in the past, elec-
 toral fraud. However, the Government no longer restricts the functioning of political
 opponents.
 In 1996 state and municipal elections were held in the states of Baja California
 Sur, Coahuila, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Mexico, Nayarit, and Quintana Roo. These elec-
 tions were generally peaceful and orderly.
 An electoral reform agreement among the major political parties was approved in
 Aut. The ruling PR   an    e opposition National Action Party (PAN), the PRD,
 and Labor Party agreed to a package of constitutional amendments that includes
 tighter financial regulation of election campaigns; a revised formula for public fund-
 ing, including access to electronic media; a reduction in the number of congressional
 representatives allowed for any one party from 315 to 300; putting electoral law vio-
 lations under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court; full autonomy for the Federal
 Electoral Institute; and the fnst-ever direct popular election of a mayor for Mexico
 City. However, due to disagreements on issues such as campaign spending limits
 and rules governing coalitions, PAN and PRD legislators opposed thelegislation im-
 plementing the accords. Since the PRI has a majority in both houses, Congress ap-
 proved the reform package in a party-line vote in November.
 The PAN protested manipulation of the electoral appeal pocess of the November
 1995 municipal elections in Huejotzingo, Puebla, an on t at basis had refused to
 participate in national electoral reform talks. Negotiations between the Government
 and the PAN resolved the dispute. On May 15, the PRI mayor of Huejotzingo
 stepped down from office, and pursuant to a vote in the state legislature was re-
 placed by a PAN official. Shortly thereafter, national electoral reform talks resumed
 and resulted in the agreement described above.
 A severe failure in the electoral process has been the lack of any meaningful pros-
 ecution of those accused of electoral crimes. Despite numerous accusations of fraud
 in various state races, the authorities declined to prosecute any electoral crimes.
 The placing of electoral law violations under the jurisdiction of the recently re-
 formed Supreme Court is a step to address this problem.
 Another continuing major obstacle to electoral reform is the deeply entrenched
 antidenocratic tradition of unchecked power exercised by local bosses over peasants
 in rural areas. These bosses often exercise some measure of control over virtually
 every aspect of peasants' lives, including how they vote. One NGO that studied the
 results of the August 21, 1994, elections in a remote district found that there were
 30 percent more votes for the PRI in polling places where no independent observers
 were present.
 Although there is no systematic exclusion of women and indigenous persons, they
 are underrepresented in politics. Women, however, hold numerous congressional
 seats and continue to increase their representation in political offices. At the begin-
 ning of his administration, President Zedillo appointed three women to his Cabinet:
 The Comptroller General, the Secretary of Tourism, and the Secretary of the Envi-
 ronment, Natural Resources, and Fisheries. In addition, there are 67 women in the
 500-member Chamber of Deputies and 16 in the 128-member Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate largely without government re-
 striction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. The
 number of NGO's dedicated to the defense of human rights has nearly doubled in
 the last 2 years. As of May, 376 NGO's monitor human rights problems, compared
 with 191 in November 1993. Government officials are generally cooperative and re-
 sponsive to NGO views, and the Congress has established a citizen participation
 committee to act as a liaison with NGO's. In July the Inter-American Commission
 on Human Rights visited Mexico at the invitation of President Zedillo and met with
 over a hundred human rights groups.
 However, many serious problems remain. For example, Amnesty International re-
 ported that leaders and members of numerous human rights NGO's received death
 threats for criticizing the human rights situation in the country. These included
 David Fernandez Davalos and Jose avanderos Yanez, director and lawyer respec-
 tively of the Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez Human Rights Center (PRODH) in Mexico
 City; Graciela Zavaeta Sanchez, president of the Mahatma Gandhi Regional
 Human Rights Commission in Oaxaca; Lourdes Saenz, member of the Citizens for
 Human Rights in Nuevo Leon; Francisco Goitia and Javier Nunez, president and
 lawyer respectively of the Human Rights Committee of Tabasco; Emelia Gonzalez
 Sandoval, founding member of the Human Rights Defense and Solidarity Commis-
 
 
 505
 sion of Chihuahua; and Maria Teresa Jardi and Julian Andrade Jardi of the Fund
 for Assistance, Promotion and Development in Mexico City. Death threats were also
 received by Pilar Noriega, Digna Ochoa, and Enrique Flota, lawyers for the PRODH
 representing alleged members of the EZLN.
 To address human rights abuses, the Government established the CNDH in 1990.
 Since that time, the CNDH has received a total of 45,110 complaints of which it
 has concluded its investigations in 43,784 cases; it is still processing the remainder.
 Of those cases in which it made recommendations that appropriate action be taken
 against the offenders, its recommendations have been totally or partially followed
 95 percent of the time. The CNDH cited 55 recommendations which authorities had
 been "negligent" in implementing during the past 6 years.
 For the period of May 1995 to May 1996, the CNDH made 116 recommendations
 to government authorities. Of these, the authorities fully complied with 33, partially
 complied with 68, and rejected 4, while 18 were in various stages of processing.
 CNDH efforts resulted in sanctions against 282 public servants, as follows: 161
 criminal actions; 10 dismissals; 17 declared incompetent for public service; 46 sus-
 pensions; 44 reprimands or warnings; and 4 fines. The CNDH publishes the names
 of all sanctioned public servants. In some cases, authorities applied multiple sanc-
 tions, but CNDH statistics list cases under the most severe sanction applied.
 In its review of the various state human rights commissions' decisions, by Septem-
 ber the CNDH had issued 78 recommendations for reconsideration or renewal of ac-
 tion. State commissions complied completely with 70 of the recommendations and
 partially with 8.
 Some NGO's note that the CNDH lacks both autonomy and enforcement author-
 ity. Additionally, some contend that it has become too large and bureaucratic and
 that the state commissions are ineffectual.
 In March 1995, the Federal District Attorney General's office announced the open-
 ing of a new subsection for human rights to address abuses in Mexico City, by far
 the most populous jurisdicition. The office handled an average of two complaints per
 yJaganst Federal District poice offiers, as well as other cases. In December the
 a opened an offie to strengthen ommunication with NGO's.
 Then-Defense Minister General Antonio Riviello imprisoned General Jose Fran-
 cisco Gallardo Rodriguez in November 1993 on a range of charges, including embez-
 zlement and dishonoring the military. Gallardo claims that the embezzlement
 charges, which date back 7 years, had previously been abandoned for lack of evi-
 dence. He maintains that military authorities are persecuting him because of an
 academic dissertation calling for the establishment of a military human rights om-
 budsman's office. The army continues to hold Gallardo but has reduced the previous
 inordinately high level of security of his incarceration. The IACHR considered the
 Gallardo case in October, and the commission called for his immediate release and
 for the Government to indemnify him for damages suffered as a result of his impris-
 onment.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that men and women are equal before the law. It also ro-
 vides that education should sustain the ideals of "fraternity and equal rights of all
 mankind, avoiding privileges of race, sects, groups, sexes, or individuals." These pro-
 visions are not effectively enforced.
 Amnesty International cites Mexico as one of the countries in which homosexual
 men and women are most likely to be victims of abuse and violence. Liborio Cruz,
 a 19-year-old male prostitute, was beaten to death by a group of men in Mexico City
 in June 1995. At least 12 homosexuals and 9 male prostitutes were killed in Tuxtla
 Gutierrez between 1991 and 1993. An independent prosecutor took over the inves-
 tigation of the Tuxtla Gutierrez murders in April 1994 but had made no progress
 in solving them by the end of 1996.
 Women.-The most pervasive violations of women's rights involve domestic and
 sexual violence, which is believed to be widespread and vastly underreported. Do-
 mestic assault is a crime, but in 10 states the "right to correct7 a wife and children
 is not a crime unless this abuse involves cruelty or excessive frequency. Women are
 reluctant to report abuse or file charges, and, even when notified, the police are re-
 luctant to intervene in what society considers to be a domestic matter. The munici-
 pality of Chimalhuacan, Mexico state, where the average time for police action on
 rape cases is 2 months, is a typical example of the difficulty rape victims experience.
 This is attributable to police inexperience in handling these cases, lack of investiga-
 tive techniques, and unwillingness to get involved in what are often considered do-
 mestic affairs.
 
 
 506
 The Attorney General's office for the Federal District operates rape crisis centers
 around the city. Few women, however, avail themselves of the centers' services. Out
 of a municipal female population of more than 10 million, only 627 approached the
 centers. The majority were girls: 27 percent were between the ages of 13 and 17,
 and 25 percent were under the age of 13. Some women who availed themselves of
 the centers' services reported abusive, humiliating, and unprofessional behavior by
 police and medical examiners who work in the centers.
 Although the Constitution provides for equality between the sexes, neither the au-
 thorities nor society in general respect this in practice. The legal treatment of wom-
 en's rights is uneven. Women have the right to own property in their own names
 and to file for separation and divorce. However, in some states a woman may not
 bring suit to establish paternity and thereby obtain child support, unless the child
 was a product of rape or cohabitation; the child resides with the father; or there
 is written proof of paternity.
 The Constitution and labor law provide that women shall have the same rights
 and obligations as men, and "equal- pay shall be given for equal work performed in
 equal jobs, hours of work and conditions of efficiency." However, women are gen-
 erally paid less and are concentrated in lower paying occupations. Labor law in-
 cludes extensive maternity protection, including 6 weeks off efore and 6 weeks off
 after childbirth, time off for breast feeding in adequate and hygienic surroundings
 provided by the employer, and, during pregnancy, full pay and no dismissals, heavy
 or dangerous work or exposure to toxic substances. There are reports that, in order
 to avoid these expensive requirements, some employers deliberately violate these
 provisions and expose pregnant women to difficult or hazardous conditions to make
 them quit; this reportedly occurs particularly in the low-wage, low-skill, high-turn-
 over end of the in-bond export processing (maquila) industry. These reports claim
 that state and (for health and safety) federal labor authorities are unable or unwill-
 ing to enforce those provisions. Indeed, the number of maquila plants far outstrips
 what state and federal inspectors can handle. Discrimination in hiring does not
 seem to be addressed in labor law. Many lower wage employers discriminate in
 favor of women in hiring but against pregnant women because their benefits make
 them more expensive. Many employers require women to certify that they are not
 pregnant at the time of hiring. Others test applicants for pregnancy.
 In 1995 the CNDH found that the largest number of complaints against health
 care institutions involved negligence or abuse during childbirth by medical person-
 nel and charges of forced sterilization. It said that the number of such complaints
 had grown, in large part due to women's increased awareness of their rights. The
 Constitution states that all persons have the right to make free, responsible, and
 informed decisions on the number of children they choose to have. The 1984 General
 Health Law provides for criminal action against those who pressure a woman to un-
 dergo sterilization procedures or perform such procedures without the woman's con-
 sent. In a number of cases charges have been brought against doctors for sterilizing
 a woman or inserting an Ti without her consent. The scope of this problem is dif-
 ficult to quantify, although a number of NGO's and government agencies follow the
 issue, because women may not realize that these procedures have been performed
 on them or may be reluctant to come forward and file a complaint. The CNDH has
 recommended that medical administrators train their staffs to be more aware when
 dealing with such patients. The Government has instituted a number of mecha-
 nisms, including better training and medical review boards, to address the problem.
 Children.--Cildren under the age of 18 make up over 40 percent of the popu-
 lation. While the Government is committed to children's health and education, it
 has failed to allocate sufficient resources to fulfill that commitment. Nine years of
 education are compulsory. There is no societal pattern of abuse against children, but
 children's advocates report many such cases. The United Nations Children's Fund
 (UNICEF) classifies Mexico as "lacking adequate strategies" to combat malnutrition
 among children, and reports that 30,000 children die each year of causes related to
 malnutrition. According to UNICEF, the Department of the Federal District, and
 the National System for the Integral Development of the Family, more than 13,000
 children live on the streets of Mexico City, many the victims of family violence. The
 children themselves often become involved with alcohol, drugs, prostitution, and
 petty thievery. Police in Hermosillo, Sonora, conducted "sweeps" of street children,
 incarcerating many for short periods, in order to "clean up" the city.
 While the Government and NGO's conduct a number of programs for street chil-
 dren, corrupt polie exacerbate the problem by pressuring chldren to commit petty
 crimes and extorting profits from them. The CNDH has a program for protection
 of children's rights which includes educating children on their rights and reviewing
 legislation to ensure compliance with relevant international conventions. In January
 the Human Rights Commission for the Federal District opened the "     House,"
 
 
 507
 
 a space designed for children 8 to 11 years of age to help teach them about human
 rights and obligations. Over 26,000 children visited it.
 Peopple With Disabilities.-The law requires access for disabled persons to public
 facilities in Mexico City but not elsewhere in the country. In practice, however, most
 public buildings and facilities do not comply with the law. Recognizing that disabled
 persons often suffer employment discrimination, the Federal District instituted a
 new tax rebate program for businesses employing disabled persons. For the first
 time, the Public Education Sub-Secretariat for the Federal District mandated that
 all public and private schools grant access to physically (although not mentally) dis-
 abled children and that schools make the necessary arrangements (e.g., installation
 of ramps) to facilitate access. The National Public Education Secretariat printed
 27 000 textbooks in Braille in 1995.
 Indigenous People.-The indigenous population has long been victim of discrimi-
 natory treatment. The Chiapas uprising focused unprecedented attention on the de-
 mans of that state's indigenous persons for increased economic and social rights.
 Among its basic demands, the EZLN called on the Government to enact measures
 to protect indigenous cultures, provide more opportunity for employment, and invest
 in schools, clinics, and infrastructure projects. The Government, through the INI
 and the CNDH, operates programs to educate indigenous groups (many members of
 which do not speak Spanish) about their political and human rights, and it gen-
 erally professes respect for their desire to retain elements of their traditional cul-
 ture. The CNDH organized training courses on human rights for indigenous commu-
 nities in Chiapas, Hidalg, Mexico, Michoacan, Oaxaca, Chiapas and Nayarit. The
 courses were taught in the communities' indigenous languages.
 More than 130-NGO's are dedicated to the promotion and protection of indigenous
 rights. Indigenous people do not live on independently governed reservations, al-
 though some indigenous communities exercise considerable local control over eco-
 nomic and social issues. These communities apply traditional law to resolve a vari-
 ety of disputes, including allegations of crimes. However, these groups remain large-
 ly outside the country's olitical and economic mainstream, a result of longstanding
 patterns of economic and social development and in many cases their ability to par-
 ticipate in decisions affecting their lands, cultural traditions, and allocation of natu-
 ral resources is negligible.
 The 1992 reforms in agrarian law were expected to promote economic develop-
 ment in the countryside, but indigenous groups generally perceived the reforms as
 intended to break up indigenous communal lanholdings and prevent the groups
 from obtaining title to new lands. A 1991 amendment to the federal law requires
 that an interpreter be present at every stage of criminal proceedings against indige-
 nous persons and stipulates that "their customs and traditions shall be taken into
 account." However, the courts continue to sentence indigenous people without the
 benefit of interpreters. The CNDH had reviewed the cases of 7,823 jailed indigenous
 persons and sought the release of 1,887. Of those, 1,069 have been released since
 June 1994, largely through CNDH efforts.
 The General Education Act states that "teaching shall be promoted in the na-
 tional language (i.e., Spanish) without prejudice to the protection and promotion of
 indigenous languages. However, many indigenous persons speak only their native
 languages. Non-Spanish speakers are frequently taken advantage of in commercial
 transactions involving bilingual middlemen, and have great difficulty finding em-
 ployment in Spanish-speaking areas. Over 50 indigenous languages are currently
 spoken in Mexico.
 Although the law provides some protection for the indigenous, and the Govern-
 ment provides indigenous communities support through social and economic assist-
 ance programs, legal guarantees and social welfare programs are not sufficient to
 meet the needs of all indigenous persons.
 Religious Minorities.-In the highlands of Chiapas and other indigenous areas,
 traditional leaders sometimes acquiesced in, or actually ordered, the expulsions of
 Protestants beloning primarily to evangelical groups. In many cases the expulsions
 involved the burning of homes and crops, beatings, and, occasionally, killings.
 In San Juan Chamula, Chiapas, where local authorities have expelled an esti-
 mated 30,000 evangelicals over the past 30 years, the evangelicals and the local au-
 thorities reached a truce in December 1995. Since that time, there have been no fur-
 ther expulsions of evangelicals from San Juan Chamula. The local authorities
 agreed that children of the evangelicals would be allowed to return to public school,
 from which they had been excluded for 3 years. However, in September, the children
 of evangelicals were once again excluded, and in retaliation, evangelical groups oc-
 cupied these schools. By October the situation for the most part had been resolved,
 and at year's end the evangelicals' childen were attending public school in all but
 one community, Arvenza II, where the parents chose to keep their children at home.
 
 
 508
 In July the evangelicals began constructing a temple in the community of Arvenza
 I. Following protests by the local authorities, and in order to avoid a collapse of the
 December 1995 truce, the evangelicals agreed to halt temporarily construction of the
 temple. In September the traditional leadership in San Juan Chamula forced the
 mayor to step down and replaced him with a new leader opposing construction of
 the temple. By year's end, however, temple construction was allowed to resume.
 Several evangelical members were jailed and fined in San Juan Yahe, Oaxaca. In
 addition, reliable press reports noted continued expulsions of evangelicals by that
 community because the evangelicals' faith violated the 'customs and traditional
 practices" of the community.
 The Federal Government Office of Religious Affairs actively promotes religious
 tolerance and held symposiums in July in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas empha-
 sizing the constitutional right of freedom of religion.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Federal Labor Law (LFT)
 provide workers with the right to form and join trade unions of their choice. About
 30 percent of the total work force is unionized, mostly in the formal sector, where
 about one-half the labor force is employed. This implies a formal sector unionization
 rate nearly twice that high.
 No prior approval is needed to form unions, but they must register with the Fed-
 eral Labor Secretariat (STPS) or state labor boards (JLCA) to obtain legal status
 in order to function. Registration requirements are not onerous. There are credible
 allegations, however, that the STPS or JLCA occasionally withhold or delay reg-
 istration of unions hostile to government policies, employers, or established unions
 or register extortionists or labor racketeers falsely claiming to represent workers.
 To remedy this latter problem, STPS officials require evidence that unions are genu-
 ine and representative before registering them.
 Like the Federal Labor Board (JFCA), the JLCA are tripartite. Although trade
 union presence on the boards is a generally positive feature, it can lead to unfair
 partiality in representation disputes; the member from an established union may
 work to dissuade a JLCA from recognizing a rival organization. The matter of trade
 union registration was the subject of followup activities in 1996, pursuant to a 1995
 agreement reached in ministerial consultations under the Nort American Agree-
 meat on Labor Cooperation (NAALC), the side agreement on labor to the North
 American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
 Unions form federations and confederations freely without government approval.
 Most unions belong to such bodies. They too must register to have legal status. The
 largest trade union central is the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), tradi-
 tionally a sector of the ruling PRI, hut affiliation is individual, and this is to be em-
 phasized in new reforms, both within the PRI and in legislation under consideration
 in the Congress. The Federal Employee Union Federation (FSTSE), the Revolution-
 ary Worker and Peasant Confederation, and most of the 35 separate national
 unions, smaller confederations, and federations in the Labor Congress (CT) are also
 allied with the PRI. However, several are not, including the large teachers' union,
 which severed its PRI ties several years ago, freeing its minority factions to cooper-
 ate openly with other parties, particularly the PRD. Rivalries within and between
 PRI-allied centrals are strong. There also are a few small labor federations and
 independent unions outside the CT which are not allied to the PRL One is the
 small, left-of-center Authentic Labor Federation (FAT). Most FAT members sym-
 pathize with the PRD, but the FAT is independent and not formally tied to the
 PRD.
 Union officers help select, run as, and campaign for, PRI candidates in federal
 and state elections and support PRI government policies at crucial moments. This
 gives unions considerable influence on government policies but limits their freedom
 of action to defend member interests in other ways, particularly when this might
 harm the Government or PRI. The CT, especially the CTM, is well represented in
 the PRI senatorial and congressional delegations.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Conference Committee of Experts
 (COE) has found that certain restrictions in federal employee labor law, adopted at
 FSTSE request, violate ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association, which Mexico
 has ratified. These provisions allow only one union per jurisdiction, forbid union
 members to quit the union, and prohibit reelection of union officials. Again in 1996,
 the COE and the ILO Committee on Application of Standards (CAS) reiterated their
 criticism and asked the Government to amend these provisions. A Supreme Court
 decision invalidated similar restrictions in the laws of two states, but the decision
 applied only in the specific instances challenged.

 There were developments regarding union representation in the new Environment
 Secretariat, an issue raised again in the CAS debate and in a submission under the
 NAALC. This Secretariat, formed late in 1994, merged the small former Fisheries
 Secretariat with much larger sections from the Agricultural and Social Development
 Secretariats. In early 1995, the Fisheries Union applied to the Federal Employee
 Labor Tribunal (TFCA) to change its name to union of the new secretariat. The
 TFCA denied the request. The TFCA is bipartite, with FSTSE as well as govern-
 ment members. Following the TFCA decision, the FSTSE, applying its statutes,
 convoked a convention with delegates elected by secret ballot, to form a new union
 and elect its officers. The TFCA recognized the new union and withdrew recognition
 from the old. The new union thus benefited from the contractual relationship giving
 union delegates time off with pay for union work. The dissolved union appealed to
 a court, which upheld the appeal and returned the matter to the TFCA. The TFCA
 restored the Fisheries Union's registration and revoked that of the new union (again
 upholding the legal provision allowing registration of only one union per entity, vio-
 lating ILO Convention 87). The unregistered union continued benefiting from time
 off and dues. The TFCA held a representation election ("recount"-see Section 6.b.)
 for employees to choose by secret ballot between the two unions. The Fisheries
 Union lost by a wide margin and challenged the validity of the election, charging
 irregularities, but the TFCA confirmed the election results.
 In April the Federal District municipal government reached agreement with the
 jailed [eaders of the SUTAUR-100 union of the bankrupt former public municipal
 bus company Ruta-100. The Government agreed to concede and allow the union to
 operate two of the new private bus companies to replace Ruta-100. The Government
 also agreed to appeal to the courts to release the leaders from jail while SUTAUR
 reached a settlement with the former members who had sued it to recover money
 from the union pension and other funds. The union leaders were released on bail
 in July and the first of the two union enterprises began operating at the end of Au-
 gust.
 The Constitution and the LFT provide for the right to strike. The law requires
 6 to 10 days' advance strike notice, followed by brief government mediation. If fed-
 eral or state authorities rule a strike "nonexistent" or "illicit," employees must re-
 main at work, return to work within 24 hours, or face dismissal. If they rule the
 strike legal, the company or unit must shut down totally, management officials may
 not enter the premises until the strike is over, and the company may not hire strik-
 er replacements. Provisions for maintaining essential services are not onerous. The
 law makes filing a strike notice an effective, commonly used threat, but few strikes
 actually occur, usually to protect a failing company's assets from creditors and
 courts until an agreement is reached on severance pay. On the other hand, informal
 stop pages are a fairly common tactic, but are uncounted in statistics and seldom
 last long enough to be recognized or ruled out of order.
 The law permits public sector strikes, but formal public sector strikes are rare.
 Informal ones are more frequent. Informal stoppages by dissident factions of the na-
 tional teacher union shut down many schools in several states and the Federal Dis-
 trict in late May and June, and demonstrations disrupted traffic in the capital, until
 settlements were reached which included pay for strike days and unpaid overtime
 to make up lost work and complete the school year.
 During the first 11 months of 1996, the JFCA reported that 7,690 strike notices
 were filed and 51 legal strikes occurred in federal jurisdiction, involving 54,394
 workers and the loss of 653,020 work days. Although there were fewer legal strikes
 than during the same period in 1995, they involved more workers and resulted in
 more lost workdays. There were no reports that federal or state labor authorities
 stretched legal requirements to rule strikes nonexistent or illicit, or used delays to
 prevent damaging strikes and force settlements.
 The Constitution and the LFT protect labor organizations from government inter-
 ference in their internal affairs, including strike decisions. This can protect undemo-
 cratic or corrupt union leaders. The law permits closed shop and exclusion clauses,
 allowing union leaders to vet and veto new hires and force dismissal of anyone the
 union expels. Such clauses are common in collective bargaining agreements.
 In 1995 employer organizations abandoned earlier efforts to push for labor law re-
 form to limit union leaders' power and give employers a free hand. In effect, Govern-
 ment, employers, and unions had negotiated reforms through tripartite national
 agreements and collective bargaining at the enterprise level, and through coopera-
 tion in programs to increase, and compensate for, productivity. With government
 blessing, after nearly a year of negotiation, national labor and employer organiza-
 tions agreed in August on a joint effort to build a new labor culture of mutual re-
 spect and cooperation to boost productivity, wages, and competitiveness.

 Unions are free to affiliate with, and are often active in, trade union internation-
 als.
 b. The Right to Oranize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 LFT strongly uphold the right to organize and bargain collectively. Interest by a few
 employees, or a union strike notice, compels an employer to recognize a union and
 negotiate or ask the federal or state labor board to hold a union recognition elec-
 tion. LFT prounion previsions led some employers to seek out or create independent
 "white' or company unions as an alternative to mainstream national or local unions.
 Representation elections are traditionally open, not secret, although this seems to
 be changing. Traditionally, management and union officials are present with the
 presiding labor board official when workers openly declare their votes, one by one.

 As the economic crisis deepened in 1995, tGovernment, at union insistence,
 agreed to end the system of annual national pacts negotiated bY the Government
 and major trade union, employer, and rural organizations, which had voluntarily
 limited free collective bargaining for the past decade. Wage restraints no longer
 exist, except for those caused by the economic recession and difficult situation of
 most employers. The Government and major employer and union organizations con-
 tinue to meet occasionally to reaffirm the 1995 'Alliance for Economic Recovery" (in
 October they signed an "Alliance for Growth") and agree on new tax breaks or mini-
 mum wage increases, but the Government has kept its commitment to free collective
 bargaining without guidelines or government interference. Wages in most union con-
 tracts appeared to keep pace with inflation in 1996, after losing ground in 1995.
 Mexico s record in internal union democracy and transparency is mixed. Some
 unions are democratic, but corruption or authoritarian and strong-arm tactics are
 common in others. The few protests alleging such practices this year included the
 hospital local of the Mexico City public sector municipal employees' union. The elec-
 tion seemed to have been conducted reasonably fairly, but the losers protested the
 results, seized union offices until driven out, and demonstrated in the streets, draw-
 ing blood from themselves to protest inadequate hospital supplies. Another protest
 involved factory committee leaders trying to improve conditions at a US.-owned
 maquila factory in Sonora. The committee leaders were fired with the complicity of
 an allegedy-CTM "leader"' who had a protection ontract. The telephone union, rep-
 resenting the fired former factor committee leaders, the Union of Goods and Serv-
 ices, and the Communications Worer of America filed a submission for review by
 the U S. National Administrative Offie, under provisions of the NAALC.
 The public sector is almost totally organized. Industrial areas are heavily orga-
 nized. Even states with little industry have transport and public employee unions,
 and rural peasant organizations are omnipresent. The law protects workers from
 antiunion disrimination, but enforcement is uneven in the few states with low
 unionization.
 Unionization and wage levels in the in-bond export sector vary by area. Wages
 have been lower in this sector than in most of industry, especially in low technology
 facilities and in the west, but the gap has narrowed and may now be minimal. Some
 observers allege poor working conditions, inadequate wages, and employer and gov-
 ernment efforts to discourage unionization in this sector. There is no evidence that
 the Federal Government opposes unionization of the plants, which tend to be under
 state jurisdiction, but some state and local governments in the west are said to help
 some employers discourage unions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor. There have been no credible reports of forced labor for man years, with the
 exception of abuses of refugees and illegal immigrants in Chiapas (see Section 2.d.).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law bans child labor and sets
 the minimum legal work age at 14 years. The activities of those 14 and 15 years
 of age are so restricted as to be uneconomic (no night or hazardous work and limited
 hours). The ILO reported that 18 percent of children 12 to 14 years of age work,
 often for parents or relatives. Enforcement is reasonably good at large and medium-
 sized companies, especially in export industries and those under federal jurisdiction.
 Enforcement is inadeuate at the many small companies and in agriculture. It is
 nearly absent in the informal sector, despite government efforts. Most child labor
 is in the informal sector (including myriad underage street vendors) or in agri-
 culture and rural areas. The CTM agricultural union's success years earlier in ob-
 taining free transport for migrant seasonal workers from southern states to fields
 in the north inadvertently lec[ to a significant increase in chld labor. The union and
 employers were unable to convince indigenous farm workers to leave their families
 at home, and many have settled near worksites in the north. The union has had
 some limited success in negotiating with employers to finance bilingual education
 
 
 near worksites and in obtaining social security child care centers, but it has had
 difficulty in persuading member families not to bring their children into the fields.
 Riots over pay delays in the San Quintin valley in Baja California drew media at-
 tention to the child labor and other problems of indigenous worker families there
 and surred the state government to pledge action to end child labor and other so-
 cialils
 The Federal Government increased the number of obligatory school years from 6
 to 9 in 1992 and made parents legally liable for their children s attendance, as part
 of a reform to upgrade labor force skills and long-term efforts to continue increasing
 educational opportunities for and participation by youth. It has a cooperative pro-
 gram with UNICEF.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution and the LFT provide for a
 daily minimum wage. The Tripartite National Minimum Wage Commission (govern-
 ment labor, and employers) usually sets minimum wage rates each December, effec-
 tive January 1, for the whole year, but any of the three parties can ask that the
 board reconvene during the year to consider a changed situation. As part of the Alli-
 ance, (see Section 6.b.) labor, employers, and the Government agreed in 1995 to ask
 their representatives on the Commission to increase the minimum wage 10 percent
 on December 1, 1995, instead of the usual January 1 increase, and another 10 per-
 cent on April 1 1996. They later agreed to make the April increase 12 percent. In
 December the Wage Commission adopted a 17 percent increase, based in part on
 the Government's projection of a 15 percent annual inflation rate for 1997. Orga-
 nized labor's unhappiness with the 17 percent increase (some labor organizations
 had demanded an increase of at least 25 percent) produced some suggestions that
 the official increase be challenged in court because it does not meet the constitu-
 tional requirement to be adequate to cover basic costs of living, including recreation.
 By year's end, however, no legal action of this sort had been ified.
 In Mexico City and nearby industrial areas, Acapulco, southeast Veracruz state's
 refining and petrochemical zone, and most border areas, the minimum daily wage
 after April 1 was $3.01 (22.60 new pesos). However, employers actually paid mini-
 mum wage earners $3.42 (25.76 new pesos) due to a supplemental 14 percent fiscal
 subsidy (negative income tax or tax credit, which the Government refunds to em-
 ployers). These income supplements to the minimum wage, agreed in annual tri-
 partite pacts, are for all incomes less than four times the minimum wage, decreas-
 ing as wages and benefits rise. In Guadalajara, Monterrey, and other advanced in-
 dustrialized areas, the minimum daily wage (before the fiscal subsidy) was $2.79
 (20.95 new pesos). In other areas, it was $2.54 (19.05 new pesos). There are higher
 minimums for some occupations, such as building trades.
 Few workers (only 14 to 18 percent of the workers covered by social security) earn
 only the minimum wage. Industrial workers average three to four times the mini-
 mum wage, earning more at bigger, more advanced and prosperous enterprises.
 The law and contract arrangements provide workers with extensive additional
 benefits. Legally required benefits include free social security medical treatment and
 pensions, individual worker housing and retirement accounts, substantial Christmas
 bonuses, paid vacations, and profit-sharing. Employer costs for these benefits add
 from about 27 percent of payroll at marginal enterprises to over 100 percent at
 major firms with good union contracts.
 The LFT sets 48 hours as the legal workweek, although with pay for 56 hours.
 Workers asked to exceed 3 hours of overtime per day or required to work overtime
 on 3 consecutive days must be paid triple the normal wage. For most industrial
 workers, especially under union contract, the true workweek is 42 hours although
 they are paid for 7 full 8-hour days. This is why unions jealously defend the legal
 ban on hourly wages.
 The law requires employers to observe occupational safety and health regulations
 issued jointly by STPS and the social security institute (IMSS), and to pay contribu-
 tions that vary according to their workplace safety and health experience ratings.
 LFT-mandated joint management and labor committees set standards and are re-
 sponsible for workplace enforcement in plants and offices. These meet at least
 monthly to consider workplace needs and file copies of their minutes with federal
 labor inspectors, who assumed jurisdiction for nil such inspections in 1987, sup-
 planting state inspectors and considerably strengthening inspection. The inspectors
 schedule visits largely in response  t ihese workplace ommittees.
 Individual employees or unions may also complain directly to inspctors or safety
 and health officials. Workers may remove themselves from hazardous situations
 without jeopardizing their employment. Plaintiffs may bring complaints before the
 Federal        oar at no cost to themselves.
 STPS and IMSS officials report that compliance is reasonably good at most large
 companies. Federal inspectors are stretched too thin for effective enforcement if
 
 
 512
 companies do not comply voluntarily and fulfill their legal obligation to train work-
 ers in occupational health and safety matters, although the number of inspectors
 was increased in 1995. There are specal problems in construction where unskilled,
 untrained, poorly educated, transient labor is common, especially at many small
 sites and companies. Many unions, particularly in construction, are not organized
 effectively to provide training, to encourage members to work safely and healthily,
 to_ participate in the joint ommittees, or to insist on their rights. The STSP com-
 pleted work in 1996 on a comprehensive reform of regulations and procedures (re-
 sulting from extensive consultations through NAFTA cooperative mechanisms) con-
 cerning workplace health and safety.
