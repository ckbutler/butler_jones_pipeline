 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic and a multi party, parliamentary democracy.
 Executive power is vested in the President. The Cabinet, consisting of the Prime
 Minister and 16 ministers who are responsible to Parliament, works with the Presi-
 dent in governing the country. Legislative power is held by the unicameral Par-
 liament. -Judicial power is exercisedby an independent judiciary that includes the
 Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court.
 The security apparatus is controlled by elected officials and supervised by the
 courts.
 Finland has a mixed economy with state-owned, privately owned, and publicly
 owned companies. Citizens are free to pursue their legitimate private interess, hold
 private proeerty and engage in economic activity without government interference.
 During 1992 there were no reported violations in Finland of fundamental human
 rights. Members of national minorities and women enjoy the same economic and po-
 litical rights as all other citizens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Killing for political motives by the
 Government or opposition political organizations does not occur.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported cases of disappearance, abduction, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment
 is provided for by law and is respected in practice. By law, prisoners must be treat-
 ed justly with respect for their human dignity and without distinction on the basis
 of race, sex, language, nationality, religious or political conviction, social position,
 wealth, or any other grounds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest and im-
 prisonment or exile is provided for in law and respected in practice. Police may hold
 a suspect for up to 7 days without charge. The suspect has access to a lawyer during
 that time. Once arrested, the accused must be given a court hearing within 8 days
 in a city or within 30 days in rural areas. The State pays legal fees for indigent
 defendants.
 Circumstances surrounding an arrest are subject to judicial review at the time the
 accused is brought to trial. If found to have been innocent of the crime charged, the
 accused may apply to the same court for civil damages, and the arrest is deemed
 invalid.
 Bail as such does not exist in Finland. While those accused of serious crimes must
 be held in custody pending trial, those charged with minor offenses may be released
 on personal recognizance at the court's discretion. Preventive detention is author-
 ized only during a declared state of war for narrowly defined offenses such as trea-
 Ran. mutiny, and arms trafficking. Supervisory personnel from the Ministry of Jus-
 
 
 tice and the Ministry of the Interior, as well as the Parliamentary Ombudsman and
 the Chancellor of Justice, have authority to enter prisons and to order the release
 of prisoners held without charges. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The right to fair public trial is provided for by
 law and respected in practice. Finnish citizens and aliens legally residing in Finland
 have the right to competent counsel. The law provides that charges must be clearly
 stated and that civilians may not be tried by military courts except in time of war.
 The general court system includes municipal courts, courts of appeal, and the Su-
 preme Court. The President appoints Supreme Court justices, who in turn appoint
 the lower court judges. The judiciary is not subject to political interference.
 In addition to the general courts, a presidentially appointed Supreme Administra-
 tive Court adjudicates appeals from government decisions on administrative and tax
 matters. Other special courts handle labor matters, water rights, and prisoners'
 rights. Local courts may decide to conduct a trial behind closed doors in juvenile,
 matrimonial, and guardianship cases, or when publicity would offend morality or en-
 danger the security of the State. In national security cases, the judge may withhold
 from the public any or all information pertaining to charges against individuals, ver-
 dicts, and sentencing. Sanctions may be imposed if such information is made public.
 Provisional tribunals are constitutionally prohibited.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, including prohibition of eavesdropping
 and mail tampering, are provided for by law and respected in practice. The police
 are not allowed to tap telephones under any circumstances. A law was passed in
 1992 giving police access to telephone records, and a bill has been introduced in Par-
 liament to permit wiretapping under controlled conditions. Senior police officials
 rather than judges have the authority to issue search warrants; there is no indica-
 tion that this power is abused. The police are subject by law to judicial scrutiny.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press is provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice. There have been no reports of
 abuse or legal decisions restricting freedom of the press. A law remains on the books
 allowing the Government to censor films for foreign policy reasons, but it is not ap-
 plied. Full academic freedom exists.
 b.. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association is provided for by the Constitution. Public demonstrations require
 prior notification to the police. The Government encourages voluntary organizations
 and subsidizes private groups formed to achieve public purposes. These associations
 are permitted to maintain relations with other international groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Finland has two state religions: Lutheran and Eastern
 Orthodox. A special tax supports the state churches; non-members can be exempted
 from the church tax by changing their census registration from the church-main-
 tained registry (where most people are registered) to the civil registry. Other de-
 nominations and religions enjoy unrestricted freedom of worship. About 88 percent
 of the population belongs to the Lutheran Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Finns are free to travel within the Nordic countries-Finland, Sweden,
 Norway, Denmark, and Iceland-without passports and need not apply for exit visas
 for travel to other countries. No restrictions have been placed on emigration or repa-
 triation.
 The granting of political asylum is a matter of frequent public debate, especially
 because of increasing numbers of asylum seekers. In the first 8 months of 199,
 2,847 people applied for asylum in Finland, compared with 2,124 in all of 1991. As
 y as 1989 there were only 174 asylum seekers annually. The largest groups
 of asylum seekers in 1992 were Yugoslavs, Russians, Romanians, Somalis, and
 Kurds. The Government states that it grants asylum in accordance with the stand-
 ards of the 1951 United Nations Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relatingto the
 Status of Refugees and not to people wishing to escape economic hardship. Finnish
 authorities accept relatively small numbers of refugees and asylum seekers, who re-
 ceive generous assistance once admitted. Finland automatically gives Ingrians (eth-
 nic Finns from Russia) resident status and resettlement assistance.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Finland is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which all citizens over the
 age of 18 elect their representatives from among multiple lists of candidates, re-
 resenting a wide spectrum of political ideologies. The country has the Iongest trai
 tion of women's suffrage in Europe (since 1906) and there are at present 77 women
 
 
 769
 representatives (of a total of 200) in Parliament and 6 female ministers (of a total
 of 17) in the Cabinet.
 Elections to Parliament take place every 4 years, as do municipal elections. At
 present, there are nine political parties in Parliament, of which four form a non-
 Socialist coalition, headed by a Center Party Prime Minister. Presidential elections
 are held every 6 years. Legislation passed in July 1991 provides for direct presi-
 dential elections beginning in 1994.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several organizations in Finland monitor human rights performance, including
 the Finnish Red Cross, the government-sponsored Equality Council the Minorities
 Rights Group, and The Women's Rights Union. In conjunction with the Swedish-lan-
 guage university in Turku, a Human Rights Institute was founded in 1985 with the
 stated purpose of conducting human rights research, performing studies, and dis-
 tributing information on human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, education, and health care are available to all inhabitants without
 discrimination. Sami (Lapps), who constitute less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the
 population, benefit from legal provisions protecting minority rights and customs.
 Sami language and culture are supported financially by the Government. The Sani
 receive subsidies to enable them to continue their traditional lifestyle, which re-
 volves around reindeer herding. Sami have full political and civil rights and are able
 to participate in decisions affecting their economic and cultural interests. Swedish
 is established as a second official language; about 8 percent of the population speaks
 Swedish as a native language.
 The government-established Council for Equality coordinates and sponsors legisla-
 tion to meet the needs of women as workers, mothers, widows, and retirees. In 1985
 Parliament passed a comprehensive equal rights bill which ensured equal treatment
 for women in the workplace. The Government's Equality Ombudsman monitors com-
 pliance with regulations against sexual discrimination. Of 102 complaints to the
 Ombudsman in the first 9 months of 1992, violation of the law was established in
 28 cases.
 The law provides for stringent penalties for violence against women; this provision
 is vigorously enforced by the police and the courts. The Union of Shelter Homes has
 14 such homes for female victims of violence, while municipalities and other commu-
 nities support 50 similar units all over the country. The Government Statistics Of-
 fice estimates that 10,000 to 12,000 police calls each year relate to domestic vio-
 lence, estimated by Shelter Home officials to be less than half of the number of ac-
 tual incidents.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions are constitutionally guaranteed the
 right to organize assemble peacefully, and strike-rights which are respected in
 practice in both the public and private sectors. Trade unions enjoy a protected sta-
 tus and play an important role in political and economic life. About 85 to 90 percent
 of the work force is organized. Finland's principal labor confederation is the Central
 Organization of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), with about 1 million members, mostly
 in blue-collar trades.
 Two other central organizations and several unaffiliated unions cover white-collar,
 professional, and technical employees. The two confederations divide along jurisdic-
 tional rather than political lines. All trade unions are democratically organized and
 managed and are independent of the Government. The majority of the SAK is close-
 ly associated with the Social Democratic Party, which its unions helped to create.
 There is also a significant minority faction aligned with the Left Alliance, compris-
 ing various leftist groups and the remnants orfFinland's defunct Communist Party.
 The trade unions engage freely and actively in Nordic and international labor activi-
 ties. The right to strike was exercised 251 times in 1991, according to government
 statistics; 160,000 employees participated.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively exists in law and practice and is exercised extensively. Finland
 is a highly organized society in which over 80 percent of both workers and employ-
 ers are members of trade unions and employers' collective bargaining associations.
 With very few exceptions, collective agreements since 1968 have been based on na-
 tionwide incomes policy agreements negotiated by central employees' and employers'
 organizations and the State. The nationwide agreements cover the general level of
 wage and salary increases, other terms of employment, and a "social policy package"
 which provides for vacation, holidays, sick pay, maternity and paternity leave, tray-
 
 
 770
 el costs, taxes, and rents. Workers are effectively protected against antiunion dis-
 crimination, which is prohibited by law.
 Finland has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Comp uaory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chidren.-Sixteen-year-olds may work a full
 8-hour day. Children between ages 14 and 16 nm do "light" work for up to 6 hours
 a day, or 36 hours a week, during school vacations only. Finland has compulsory
 education legislation, and child labor laws are effectively enforced by health and
 safety authorities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated national minimum wage,
 although all employers-including nonunionized employers--are required to meet
 the minimum wages agreed to in collective bargaining  aeements in their indus-
 trial sector. These minimum wages are sufficient to provide a worker and family a
 decent standard of living. The standard legal workweek must not exceed 40 hours;
 in practice, most contracts call for a workweek of about 37-38 hours. Finland's na-
 tional occupational health and safety laws are both strict and comprehensive. They
 are effectively enforced by government inspectors and actively monitored by the
 unions.
