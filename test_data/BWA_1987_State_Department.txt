 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multiparty democracy with free elections, an
 independent judiciary, a small police force, and a
 well-disciplined army subordinate to civilian authority.
 Under the Constitution, executive power is vested in the
 President, who is chosen in a national election for a 5-year
 term. The most recent election was in 1984. The President,
 Quett K.J. Masire, selects the Cabinet from the National
 Assembly. One party continuesto dominate the country's
 politics: the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which has held
 a majority in the National Assembly since independence and at
 the end of 1987 controlled 28 of 34 elective seats.
 Botswana encourages private enterprise and free trade. All
 citizens, including those whites who accepted Botswana
 citizenship, are free to participate in the economic and
 political life of the country. Exploitation of the country's
 mineral resources has stimulated economic growth (excluding
 mining) by 5.4 percent from 1983-87. Mining alone grew at an
 average rate of 31.9 percent in the same period. The diamond
 subsector recorded a price increase of 14.5 percent in 1986.
 Per capita gross domestic product increased from $69 in 1966
 to about $1,000 in 1987. About 75 percent of the population
 live in rural areas and are dependent for their livelihoods on
 subsistence farming.
 Botswana's human rights record generally remains very good.
 Citizens receive equal protection under the law; domestic
 political violence is rare; public debate, including that in
 the press, is lively; and several women hold positions of
 importance in the public and private sector. Botswana
 suffered continued pressure from neighboring South Africa in
 1987, which has forced the Government to retain special
 security procedures such as roadblock checkpoints.
 Botswana has maintained a reputation of courteous and
 efficient handling of travelers. Therefore, an incident of
 particular concern was the April 1987 fatal shooting of an
 unarmed British/Zimbabwean national by a Botswana Defense
 Force (BDF) soldier at a roadblock checkpoint. Appropriate
 procedures were initially followed, including arrest of the
 soldier and police and BDF investigations, but no action was
 taken against the soldier, who has since returned to duty at
 roadblocks. No trial was held, the results of the
 investigations were not made public, and there is no evidence
 that checkpoint procedures have been improved to preclude a
 similar occurrence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government has never been accused of involvement in
 political killings. There is no guerrilla or insurgency
 activity directed against the Government. However, a bomb
 blast in Gaborone in March, for which the Government
 eventually blamed the South African Government, resulted in
 the deaths of three persons.

 b. Disappdarance
 There were. no reports of politically motivated disappearance
 in 1987. The Constitution provides for theprotection of
 personal liberty. .The National Security Act of 1986 grants
 the.Government the:authority to hold detainees incommunicado
 on-security.grounds for an indefinite period of time; however,
 therephave been no arrests or detentions made under this Act.
 S6me persons have been arrested under existing criminal
 statutes dealing with possession of firearms, weapons, or
 contraband. There is no evidence that the National Security
 Act has seriously affected judicial procedures or led to the
 "disappearance" of any detainees.
 'c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There have been some reports of improper treatment by the
 police-of persons in custody during .1987. This includes a case
 in which a defendant alleged that his confession had been
 coerced, and the magistrate ruled the confession inadmissible
 due to "improper police procedures.". ,The.ruling did not
 specify-that physical abuse had occurred, but there-have been
 other reports of-physicalmistreatment by police. There are
 no 4ndications that systematic abuses are officially-condoned
 or ermitted..
 Prison conditions allow for adequate diet, health care, and
 visits.fromfamily, hembers. Flbgging is permitted for
 infractions of prison rules and is mandatory punishment for
 rape, attempted.rape, armed robbery, burglary, housebreaking,
 and related offenses. Traditional tribal courts presided over
 by a chief, where jurisdictionisw Limited to minor offenses,
 may also sentence individuals to be flogged.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention,.Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Botswana Constitution contains a provision protecting
 citizens froma-rbitrary arrest. This provision stilA applies
 despite. th passage of the 1986 National Security Act.
 Preventive .detention is illegal, -and habeas corpus exists both
 in law and ptactice. Police are required to bring a suspect
 before a magistrate for charging ithin 48 hours of his
 arrest.- There is a functioning system of bail, and defendants
 have access.*to lawyers of their own choosing.
 In security case  not covered under the 1986 Act, the suspect
 must be- arraigned within-96 hours-of his arrest. "In
 nonsecurity cases, suspects. must be released after 48 hours
 unless the magistrate issues a warrant of detention, which is
 valid for 14 days. Every 14 days the policemust appear
 before the magistrate and show they are making progress in the
 case. To date there have been mo known abuses of this system.
 Forced :-abor-is illegal and is not practiced.
 e.' Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a f-air. public trial is provided by law and
 honored-in practice; trials involving national security,
 however, may be closed to. the public. Defendants are entitled
 to counsel; consultation between defendants and.counsel may be
 held in private. There are clearly defined appeal procedures.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and the military
 
 
 20
 BOTSWANA
 and consists of a High Court (which is the trial court with
 general civil and criminal jurisdiction), Court of Appeals,
 local magistrate courts, and customary courts. The High Court
 has ruled that there exists the right against self-
 incrimination in the courts. Moreover, silence cannot be
 construed as guilt, and the burden of proof remains with the
 prosecution except in security matters. Since no case has yet
 been tried under the National Security Act, legal practice
 under its provisions is not yet clear. There are no political
 prisoners in Botswana.
 Botswana created a Customary Court of Appeal in 1986,
 permitting cases tried in the traditional court system (which
 exists alongside the magistrates courts) the right to appeal
 judgments in familial and property cases. Since this Court
 began operating in February 1986, 204 criminal appeals and 197
 civil appeals have been heard.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are safeguarded by law and respected in
 practice. A search warrant issued by a magistrate is required
 for an official to enter a private residence, except in cases
 of suspected diamond theft, drug trafficking, or national
 security matters. There were no reported instances in which
 this authority was used for diamond or drug-related cases in
 1987, and the Government did not state whether the powers of
 search contained in the new National Security Act were used.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are guaranteed by the
 Constitution and are respected in practice. The
 government-owned newspaper and radio continue to report
 statements by all opposition parties. Three independent
 weekly newspapers publish articles on a wider range of views
 than the government-owned media. Two non-Motswana editors of
 one of the independent newspapers were declared prohibited
 immigrants during 1987, and returned to their countries of
 origin--Zambia and South Africa. There was some concern that
 politics may have been a motivating factor in this decision.
 There has been no confirmation of this, however, and the
 newspaper has continued to publish without visible changes in
 reporting style or content. The independent press, along with
 an effective judiciary and a functioning democratic political
 system, combine to uphold freedom of speech and of the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is a well-established tradition in
 Botswana, exemplified by the Kgotla, a communal gathering
 similar to a New England town meeting, in which citizens
 freely question leaders and voice opinions on local politics.
 Kgotla meetings are used regularly by political candidates and
 members of Parliament, including ministers, to explain their
 programs to the people. Large gatherings require local police
 approval, which is routinely given. Demonstrations are
 permitted so long as order is maintained. Organizers are
 required to submit a detailed plan for any demonstration and
 are personally responsible for ensuring that the plan is
 followed.

 BOTSWANA
 Unions have the right to organize, to bargain collectively,
 and to strike.after exhausting established procedures, which
 require that the Government be invited to arbitrate the
 dispute. In practice, strikes are very rare and usually
 quickly settled. Unions have chafed under government
 regulations which prohibit financial contributions to unions
 from outside Botswana and require that all union leaders
 continue to work full-time in the trade their union
 represents, thus preventing employment of paid, full-time
 union organizers. Unions are important in the country's
 largest industries (mining-related) but have not yet developed
 a base in other sectors of the economy. Completely
 independent of government control or party affiliation, unions
 in Botswana actively represent their members.
 Unions associate freely with international organizations, and
 members attend international conferences. The Botswana
 Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU).is affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and is also a
 member, of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 the Southern African Trade Union Coordination Council
 (SATUCC). The Government expelled the Malawian Executive
 Secretary 9f SATUCC in 1986, which caused the Secretariat to
 leave. Botswana. Recently the Government has expressed an
 interest.in having the executive secretariat return to
 Botswana with different personnel.
 c. , Freedom of Religion
 Open practice of religion is permitted and encouraged. There
 is no state religion. While most residents identify
 themsev.eswlth Christian denominations, active groups of
 MuS lims, Hindus, Baha'is, and others practice their faiths
 freely. 'Religious affiliation is neither an advantage nor
 disadvaktagepolitically.or soaially. Religious conversion is
 permited,, and missionaries are allowed to enter the country
 and proselytize. 'Foreign clergy are also permitted to enter
 Botswanpand, to serve.expatriate congregations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Botswana citizens are subject to virtually no restrictions on
 emigration or repatriation. Domestic and foreign travel are
 unrestricted and passports are easily obtained. Refugees
 documented by the United Nations.High Commissioner for
 Refugees (tNHCR)- are generally required to live in the
 settlement at Dukwe inknorthern Botswana where conditions are
 relaeively good, due mainly to contributions of international
 donor organizations. 'Refugees may be authorized to live
 elsewhere for reasons such as employment or schooling.' As
 with other foreigners in Botswana, refugees are not permitted
 to accept jobs which could be filled by local citizens.
 Due to allegations from some neighboring countries that.
 refugees'are using Botswana as a sanctuary in which to pursue
 activities against the governments of their respective home
 countries, Botswana has declared that Dukwe residents found
 outside the-camp without permission will be considered to have
 abandoned-refugee status and will be repatriated as a
 deterrent to questionable activities by other refugees.
 Amnesty International, in its 1987 report, stressed its
 concern about the Government's forcible repatriation of
 several refugees to Zimbabwe in 1986. Recent involuntary
 
 
 22
 BOTSWANA
 repatriations of Zimbabweans seemed to concern economic
 migrants who did not seek protection offered by the
 Government. The UNHCR has registered its concern that all
 refugees have full opportunity to meet UNHCR personnel prior
 to repatriation. The Government has indicated its willingness
 to provide protection officers access to refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Botswana is ruled by a government freely elected by its
 people. In the 1984 national election (the fifth since
 Botswana became independent), an estimated 70 percent of the
 eligible voters registered, and 86 percent of the registered
 voters actually cast their ballots. In 1986 Botswana held an
 important by-election in which an opposition party candidate
 won by a sizable majority despite a hard-fought campaign by the
 country's ruling party. Another by-election in 1987 resulted
 again in an opposition candidate retaining the parliamentary
 seat vacated by a colleague who had lost it as a result of a
 conviction on possession of a stolen vehicle.
 There are five parties in Botswana, three of which are
 represented in the country's National Assembly. Opposition
 parties are particularly strong in the urban areas, including
 Gaborone, Jwaneng, and Francistown. However, one party, the
 Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), continues to dominate the
 country's politics, having held a majority in the National
 Assembly since independence in 1966.
 The political rights of women and minority groups are
 generally observed. For example, there are two female members
 of Parliament, one the Minister of External Affairs, the other
 the Executive Secretary of the majority party. Several
 members of minority ethnic groups are also represented in the
 National Assembly; one white Member of Parliament is also a
 cabinet minister, and the Speaker of the National Assembly is
 white. Several cabinet ministers are from small minority
 ethnic groups.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Botswana cooperates with international agencies concerned with
 human rights, most notably the UNHCR, which maintains offices
 within Botswana. There are no Botswana-based organizations
 set up to observe, report, or contest human rights violations.
 The Government consistently has responded promptly and
 forthrightly to inquiries on the human rights situation in
 Botswana but usually refrains from public comment on alleged
 human rights violations in neighboring countries. However,
 Botswana condemns apartheid and advocates positive
 socioeconomic development in South Africa.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While 95 percent of the population is made up of Tswana who
 are divided into eight subgroups, ethnic differences do exist
 in Botswana, though they play a marginal role in the country's
 politics. Only the approximately 50,000 Basarwa, or Bushmen,
 remain generally unrepresented in government.  Because the
 Basarwa live primarily in remote, rural areas and have little
 contact with the population centers of Botswana, they remain
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 relatively unaffected by government educational and economic
 assistance programs and, consequently, have participated only
 marginally in the country's political life'. The Government
 does not oppress oi deny them rights, and they have full
 voting rights.
 Women hold'approximately 24  ercent of the paid jobs in
 Botswana. <An estimnated 41 per6nt of central government
 employees are women, many of them, as noted, in high-level
 pos-ions. While there is little overt discrimination,
 stat-stics suggest that soclal custom elevates the perquisites
 and privileges of men above those of women. Some 40 percent
 of rural-households are-headed by women. Generally speaking,
 women*s economic opporthities--access to capital, labor,
 draft, animals, seeds for farming--are significantly worse than
 those of-inen. Wdmen may chQosi'between civil marriage, in
 which'ali property is-held in.common, or customary marriage,
 which recognizes individual'property brought to a marriage.
 Most w6men are not 'aare of the implications of these
 alternatives, however. "Often a married woman is unable to
 obtain a baik loan'without the signature of her husband, and
 an unmarried woman must obtain the signature of her father.
 The Government has assisted in the publication of a women's
 rights'hgndbook, and has established preference points for
 wom6 seekindovernment-sponsored development loans.
