 BRAZIL
 Brazil is a constitutional federal republic with a directly elected president, a bi-
 cameral legislature, and an independent judiciary. Brazil's population of 145 million
 represents over half the population of South America. Fernando Collor, who took of-
 rice in 1990 as the first directly elected President in 29 years, was impeached on
 corruption charges on September 29. On December 29, Collor resigned, and Vice
 President Franco assumed the presidency as provided for under the Constitution.
 The Senate convicted Collor on impeachment charges, and deprived him of the right
 to hold public office for 8 years. Possible indictment on common criminal charges
 is pending. Politicians and military leaders maintained policies of strict adherence
 to constitutional processes during this period of political turbulence. Municipal elec-
 tions held in October and second-round elections held in November were fully free
 and fair.

 Public security responsibility is shared by federal, state, and local police, with the
 state police bearing the greatest responsibility for most law enforcement activity.
 The armed forces have a constitutional mission to preserve internal order but au-
 thority to engge the military in domestic secuity matters is restricted to the Presi-
 dent. Accrding to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, total military
 expenditures or 1989 were approximately $6.2 billion. Efforts to reduce military
 spending have been implemented over the past several years and are likely to con-
 tinue. Numerous local ad state           icers were implicated in human rights
 abuses, including extrajudicial kilings and serious physical abuse of detainees. A
 few auch police officers were charg   ad   unished, but most officers accused of
 these abuses acted with impunity.
 Brazil's economy has a strong agricultural base, extensive mineral resources and
 a relatively high degree of industralization. Economic ad administrative reform
 initiatives designed to move Brazil toward a market economy have had little effect
 in alleviating the extremes of wealth sad poverty or bringing shout social change.
 Income distribution remains niarked by wide disparities, with the poorest 50 per-
 cent of the population sharing only 11 percent of national income.
 The principal human rights problems in Brazil continued to be the high incidence
 of extrajudicial killings and death threats against rural activists by landowners and
 their agents, and extrjudicia killings of criminal suspects and minors by vigilante
 groups including police. In urban areas, widespread violence, most notably against
 women and groups suffering racial discrimination, is fostered by an ingrained cli-
 mate of impunity. Reports of killings of peasants and union organizers involved in
 land disputes continued, as did reports of confrontations involving the landless.
 Cases of egregious human rights violations generally are not effectively investigated
 or prosecuted, and a widespread climate of impunity remained the single largest ob-
 stacle to effecting improvement in human rights in Brazil.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra udicial Killing.-Extrajudicial killings have become
 commonplace and are one of Brazil's most serious human rights problems. Several
 hundred Brazilians die annually at the hands of landowners, hired thugs, vigilante
 groups, and plicemen in urban gang wars, police actions, and in rural conflicts.
 Brazilian and international human rights organizations make credible charges that
 state and local policemen and hired- gunmen kill persons suspected of common
 crimes, including street youths and children. There have been credible reports that
 some judges and prosecutors obstructed cases against persons accused in killings of
 urban street children. Federal, state, and local authorities generally fail to take
 legal action against those responsible for such killings. Police often fail to conduct
 complete investigations; human rights groups charge that this is because they co-
 operated with the hired gunmen or their employers to carry out the crimes.
 Conflicts between rural landholders and the landless continued in 1992, in part
 because of the failure of the Government to settle conflicting land tenure claims. Ap-
 proximately 25 to 30 persons died in rural conflicts during the year. This compares
 with 49 such killings registered in 1991. The victims included labor leaders and
 other activists helping to organize agricultural unions. According to human rights
 groups and legislators, killings and death threats against rural figures in many
 parts of Brazil remain common as a result of the virtual impunity provided by the
 justice system. Out of more than 1,000 killings related to land disputes during the
 1980'S, only a handful of persons had come to trial by the end of 1992.
 Justice in the state of Pars and in other parts of Brazil is generally slow and fre-
 quently fails completely to punish perpetrators of violence against rural workers and
 landless people. On Februay .28, an appeals court in Acre overturned the conviction
 of Darli Alves, convicted of conspiracy in the 1988 murder of rubber-tapper leader
 Chico Mendes. The court found the conviction to be unjustified by the evidence pre-
 sented. The case was remanded to the court of first instance for retrial, but no date
 has been set. Alves' son Darci, who confessed to and was convicted of shooting and
 killingMendes, remains in prison. A number of cases of rural murders in southern
 Para have been transferred to Belem, the state capital, at least partly in response
 to human rights concerns that local law enforcement and judicial officials would not
 properly investigate and punish human rights offenders.
 In January two rural laborers disappeared near Marsha, in Para state, and rural
 union leaders pursuing the case received death threats soon afterwards. The Sec-
 retary of Public Safety for Para later signed an open letter denouncing human
 rights leaders for making charges without presenting evidence; the Para chapter of
 the Catholic Church's Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) made credible charges that
 
 
 345
 iel andprosecutors did not fulfill their responsibility to seek such evidence.
 a91 threats were levelled in August against Nivaldo Vieira do Nascimento of the
 CPT in Conceicao do Araguaia, Para. As of December, the local prosecutor had not
 acted on the case. On December 3, Francisco Geronimo da Silva of the Rural Work-
 ers Union (STR) was shot and killed in an ambush near Imperatriz, Maranhao, and
 his colleague, Valdemar Pereira Barros, President of the union, was wounded. A fed-
 eral and state police investigation had yielded no findings as of mid-December. On
 April 10, Marano Domingos Freire, leader of the small farmers association of
 Matapagipe, Pernambuco, was shot and wounded. Suspects were indicted in July,
 but for the crime of causing bodily harm, not attempted murder a trial date has
 not been set. Also on April 10, Jose Alves da Souza of the STR in Sitio Novo,
 Tocantins, was shot and wounded in the third attempt on his life since 1985. Luiz
 Francisco Farias Moura, an STR activist in Buriti, Tocantins, received repeated
 death threats in September.
 Vigilante actions to control rising urban crime continued to be a major human
 rights problem during the year. Brazilian and international human rights groups
 made credible charges that policemen, often acting off-duty as members of vigilante
 groups, killed persons suspected of common crimes, including street youths. A 1991
 poll showed that, out of 31,000 uniformed policemen in Rio de Janeiro state, 27 per-
 cent, or 8,000, had at some point been invited to join vigante hit squads. Human
 rights groups also criticized the excessive use of force br the police in Sao Paulo
 state. In the first 9 months of 1992, the police in Sao Pau o state had already killed
 over 1,200 criminal suspects in the course of arrest, the large majority of them in
 the city of Sao Paulo.
 Violence against minors is widespread; 167 were killed in Rio de Janeiro from
 January to April, according to police records, while 306 were killed in Sao Paulo be-
 tween January and July. Studies and spot surveys indicate that most minors killed
 in large cities were between the ages of 16 and 18 and were often suspected of
 criminal activity. Most were black and poor. A February 1992 report by a Par-
 liamentary Commission of Enquiry stated that the participation of police in the kill-
 ing of minors is "far from exceptional" and that police killings are the third largest
 cause of homicides of children and adolescents. Authorities often fail to act against
 those responsible for such killings, and police often fail to conduct complete inves-
 tigations because they either cooperate or sympathize with the killers. Some pros-
 ecutors and judges are also accused of obstructing cases against persons accused of
 killing minors.
 On July 17, the body of a 14-year-old street youth known as Paulo Henrique was
 found in Rio de Janeiro, a few miles from the tourist section of Copacabana, where
 he was reportedly a known nuisance. Bystanders said they saw uniformed police-
 men force him into a car and drive off the night before the boy's body was found.
 On May 5 in Lagarto, in the state of Sergipe, Erivan Jose da Silva, 14, and Jose
 Fernandes de Almeida 15 were forced into a car and driven away; their bodies
 were discovered the followFing evening. Of two police officers arrested for the
 killings, one escaped from police custody while under heavy guard.
 In May the Brazilian Center for Children and Adolescents (CBIA), the Social Wel-
 fare Ministry's agency charged with ameliorating children's living conditions, spon-
 sored a 5-day conference of all state governors in Brasilia. The event culminated in
 the May 20 signing by the governors of a compact, committing them to achieve spe-
 cific goals to promote child welfare and specific targets in the reduction of violence
 against children, within specified time frames. Past government actions to deal with
 this problem focused largely on statements of intent or on legislation but fell short
 of taking systematic, effective measures to protect human rights and punish abuses.
 Human rights monitors also became targets of death threats. Workers at a dioce-
 san han n rights center in Caceres, Mato Grosso state, received telephone threats
 in Apr, and one woman was threatened with rape as a warning. In June Carlos
 Ivanir dos Santos, executive secretary of a Rio de Janeiro human rights group, re-
 ceived repeated death threats. Sao Paulo journalist Caco Barcellos, who wrote a
 book accusing specific policemen of participating in killings of minors, received
 death threats in early September. On November 11, Jesuziris da Almeida Silva, an
 attorney who represents prisoners in Carandiru prison, claimed she was beaten by
 Sao Paulo police.
 An Octob er 2 riot in Sao Paulo's Carandiru Prison was put down so violently that
 111 prisoners were killed. The events were investigated by several Brazilian com-
 missions of inquiry, as well as representatives of local and international human
 rights groups. Police officials initially charged that the prisoners were armed and
 shooting at the police, although this has not been substantiated. Some investigators
 have stated that prisoners were indiscriminately fired on, chased down, and shot in
 their cells after surrendering. Eighty percent were victims of firearms, with an aver-
 
 
 346
 age of five shots in each body; 20 percent were killed by bayonets and knives. Pris-
 one'rs were reportedly forced to run a police gauntlet after the shootings. Govern-
 mental authorities were criticized for withholding news of the death toll until late
 the following afternoon, just minutes before polls closed in the municipal elections.
 Six police officials were suspended from their jobs, and the State Secretary of Secu-
 rity was fired.
 gn December 3, the state legislative assembly released a report largely exonerat-
 ing the police. On December 14, the Human Rights Commission of the Federal Min.
 istry of Justice, which includes among its members the Attorney General of Brazil
 and the President of the Brazilian Bar Association, released a nine-volume report
 on the incident which placed full blame on the Sao Paulo state government and
 military police for carrying out "the largest slaughter in prison history.* It rec-
 ommended the expulsion from duty of the 350 policemen who participated in the
 attack on the prison. The military police investigation, conducted by the state attor-
 ney general's office, is not yet complets. Its fiding are legally the most relevant
 for determining who was responsibe for the massacre and-or istituting criminal
 proceedings against them.
 Obstruction of justice by local elites and widespread public apathy aggravated the
 prblem of extrajudicial killings. Rural landowners intimidate local populations and
 law enfoement authorities in order to impede investigations into killings of rural
 laborers and landless peoples' advocates. The high crime rate, the failure to appre-
 hend most criminals, the slowness and reputedcorruption of the criminal justice
 system, and the legal requirement to release those charged pending trial contribute
 to public atie  Tnce in police brutality and killings of criminal suspects. Investiga-
 tions into these incidents are hampered because witnesses hesitate to cooperate
 with authorities for fear of retribution or because they and the general public often
 sympathize with the actions of vigilantes.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated abductions in
 1992. There were, however, numerous reports of disappearances of prsons purport-
 edly involved in common crimes, which appeared to be the result of vigilante action
 (see Section L.a.). For example, two robbery suspects, 18-year-old Roberto de Costa
 and 16-year-old Natalino Batista, alleged to the public prosecutor that they were
 beaten and subjected to electric shocks in police custody. Shortly after a police in-
 quiry was opened, de Castro was shot at, and later both were missing on the same
 day.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution, which contains severe legal penalties for
 torture and acquiesence in torture. However, there continued to be many credible
 reports of widespread police beatings and torture of criminal suspects and landless
 peasants to extract information, confessions, or money, and sometimes to punish.
 Human rights groups estimate that as few as 10 percent of police brutality cases
 are reported in some areas as the victims are generally poor, afraid, and unaware
 of their legal rights.
 Most prison facilities are severely overcrowded. The Carandiru facility, site of the
 October 2 massacre, held over 7,000 inmates, though it was designed for only 3,000.
 Conditions are often primitive; inmates threatened to riot in September when meal
 service broke down in Sao Paulo prisons. Vigilante "justice" is frequently meted out
 by prisoners. A prisoner convicted of rape was electrocuted by his cellmate on March
 8 in Franco da Rocha prison in Sao Paulo state. On September 12 and 13, a prisoner
 in a police holding facility arrested for rape was himself subjected to sexual assault
 by fell ow inmates. Victims of torture and etings by prison guards often have little
 effective recourse. Eight prison guards charged in the 1989 suffocation of 18 inmates
 in a San Paulo prison have not been tried. Three guards charged with starting a
 tre that killed 26 prisoners at a Rio de Janeir prison also have yet to face trial.
 Detention facilities for minors are particularly lacking, despite Brazil's advanced
 code for treatment of underage infractrs. Federal government sources admit to the
 overcrowding but have not yet solved the problem Sao Palo's major juvenile deten-
 tion facility experienced 2 days of riots in April in protest over mistreatment and
 poor conditions. On October 23, minors burned down the facility when one detainee
 claimed to have been bitten by a detention facility guard. One minor died in the
 incident and 40 were injured. Military police observing the incident refused to inter-
 vene.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution limits arrests to those
 caught committing a crime or those arrested by order of a judicial authority, except
 in cases of soldiers charged with violating military rules and regulations or with
 military crimes as defined by law. The constitutional provision for judicial deter-
 mination of the legality of detention is respected, although some convicted inmates
 are kept after the expiration of their sentences due to poor record keeping. The law
 
 
 347
 permits provisional detention for up to 5 days in certain circumstances during a po-
 lice investigation or during the prosecution phase of a case. This period may De ex-
 tended until the case comes to trial or until a judge rules that reasons for the deten-
 tion no longer exist. Provisional detention is used infrequently.
 Illegal and incommunicado detention without a judicial order, particularly of
 street youths and children, remained a problem. In preparation for the June 1992
 world environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro, police threatened and pressured
 several hundred street youths to leave Rio de Janeiro city limits. Those who re-
 mained were ultimately held in makeshift facilities in the city of Niteri, across
 Guanabara Bay.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is an independent branch of Govern-
 ment. The judicial system, with the federal Supreme Court at its apex, includes
 courts of first instance and appeals courts. The states organize their own judicial
 systems but must adhere to the basic principles in the federal Constitution. Brazil
 also has a system of specialized courts dealing with military, labor, electoral, juve-
 nile, family, and narcotics matters, among others. Separate police courts manned by
 police officials rule on charges of police brutality. Police courts are generally reluc-
 tant to punish their colleagues for human rights abuses.
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for by law and is generally respected
 in practice, although human rights observers charge that local judges are sometimes
 biased in favor of landowners in ordering evictions in cases involving squatters'
 claims and in murder cases involving rural activists. There were also credible re-
 ports of instances where judges and prosecutors impeded investigations into killings
 of street children. Defendants are entitled to counsel and must be made fully aware
 of the charges against them. In cases in which a defendant cannot afford an attor-
 ney, one must be provided at public expense; private attorneys are appointed by
 courts to represent poor defendants when public defenders are unavailable. Defend-
 ants and their attorneys have the right to be informed of the evidence on which
 charges are based. Only cases of willful crimes against life are tried by jury; all oth-
 ers are tried by a judge.
 The judicial system is inefficient and continues to have a serious backlog, many
 cases are not tried for years. The need for court reform is widely recognized in the
 legal and judicial community. Some judges have acknowledged that the judicial sys-
 tem is so inefficient and outdated that it is incapable of playing an effective role
 in controlling crime.
 Killing of suspected criminals by irate citizens, arising out of public rage at crime
 levels and a perceived failure of the judicial system to render justice, is a significant
 problem in Brazil. Dozens of cases are reported annually, in all regions of the coun-
 try. A robber was beaten to death on the spot by patrons of a restaurant in
 Campinas, Sao Paulo state, which he tried to rob on New Year's Eve. An alleged
 murderer was killed, and his and his relatives' houses were burned down, by neigh-
 bors of the murder victim in the Sao Paulo neighborhood of Jardim Rosemary on
 March 12.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home. There
 were no reports of illegal entry for political reasons, but illegal entry into homes
 without a warrant occurs in searches for criminal suspects. Wiretaps are unconstitu-
 tional except for purposes of criminal investigation and prosecution and then only
 when authorized by a judicial authority in circumstances defined by law. Charges
 that armed forces units had tapped then-Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello's
 telephone were denied by the Ministers of Justice and the Army and the Secretary
 of Strategic Affairs. The inviolability of private correspondence is respected.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The right to free speech and to a free press is
 provided for in the Constitution and is broadly exercised. The press and broadcast
 media routinely discuss controversial social and political issues, and opposition
 viewpoints are aired freely. Most radio and television stations are privately owned;
 the Government, through Congress, controls licensing authority. Newspapers are
 privately owned and vigorously report and comment on government policies and per-
 formance. The 1988 Constitution abolished all forms of censorship. Prior review of
 films, plays, and radio and television programming is practiced only to determine
 a suitable viewing age.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assembleeacefully, and this right is respected in practice. Permits are
 not required for out oor political or labor meetings, and they occur throughout
 Brazil with frequency. Protests calling for the resignation or impeachment of Presi-
 
 
 348
 dent Color, involving hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in several cities on
 various days in August and September, occurred without incident.
 c. Freedom of Rel iion.-There is no favored or state religion. Most Brazilians be-
 long to the Roman Catholic Church, but spiritualism has many adherents, and Prot-
 estantism has been expanding in recent years. All faiths are free to establish places
 of worship, train clergy, and proselytize, although the Government reserves the
 right to control entry into Indian lands. Various missionary groups continued to
 complain that visas or missionaries and other foreign religious personnel are sys-
 tematically delayed by immigration authorities. Church sources ascribe the delays
 to mistrust on the part of some Brazilian authorities of the foreign missionary pres-
 enoe.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, except for the
 t ectd Indian areas, nor are there any restrictions on emigration or return.
 razl admit, few immigrants, does not formally accept refugees for resettlement,
 and is selective in granting asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government
 through free elections, a right exercised in Octber municipal elections and in run-
 offs for some cities which occurred in November. Executive and legislative offices
 throughout the country at local, state, and national levels are filled through demo-
 cratic direct elections among candidates representing many political parties. Presi-
 dent Collor was impeached on September 29 and suspended from office on October
 2 pending his trial by the Senate under the constitutional process for impeachment.
 He resigned on December 29 and Vice President Franco assumed the presidency as
 provided for in the Constitution. Collor was convicted by the Senate on December
 30 and deprived of his right to hold public office for 8 years.
 Voting is secret and mandatory for all literate Brazilian citizens aged 18 to 70,
 except military conscripts who may not vote. It is voluntary for minors aged 16 to
 18, or the illiterate, and for those aged 70 and over. Women have full political
 rights under the Constitution, and they are increasingly active in politics and gov-
 ernment. Women participate widely in political life and hold numerous high offices,
 including ministries and national secretariats. Very few members of the large black
 population hold senior positions in government or the political parties. In the 1992
 elections, however, Benedita da Silva, the only black female Federal Deputy, was
 narrowly defeated for Mayor of Rio de Janeiro after running a strong campaign.
 Indians were given the franchise under the 1988 Constitution but continuing
 legal tutelage and the remoteness of many groups impede their fuli participation in
 the civic life of mainstream Brazil. In 1992 Congress took under consideration legis-
 lation to implement indigenous rights granted under the 1988 Constitution (see Sec-
 tion 5). Several nongovernmental organizations and the National Indian Foundation
 (FUNAI), the Indian affairs agency of the Justice Ministry submitted proposals em-
 phasizing the protection of Indian interests and welfare. dongresssional representa-
 tives of landed interests from states with large Indian reserves inserted clauses call-
 ing for a continuation of the practice of 'tutelage" for Indians, by which full civic
 rights are accorded only to Indians who demonstrate the ability to understand mod-
 em civil society.
 Ostensibly paternalistic, tutelage is generally criticised by Indian rights advocates
 as a tool to prevent Indians from exercising their rights, particularly as they conflict
 with landed and developmental interests. The proposed bill also contains provisions
 that would require local legislative approval of Indian land demarcations in addition
 to the executive branch measure by which the Yanomami and other reserves were
 demarcated in 1991. Progress in reporting the bill to the Chamber was slowed by
 legislative preoccupation with the impeachment of President Collor and by local
 elections.
 A provision in the 1988 Gonstitution calling for a 1993 plebiscite to review the
 Constitution was moved from September to April 1993 through due legislative proc-
 ess. The plebiscite will consider the question of changing from a presidential to a
 parliamentary form of government and from a republic to a monarchy.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Brazilian nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) actively investigate allegations
 of human rights violations and often initiate legal proceedings. Several international
 NGO's either maintain offices in Brazil or visit periodically. There were several in-
 stances in which human rights monitors were the subject of death threats (see Sec-
 
 
 349
 tion L.a.). However, both Brazilian and foreign human rights organizations report
 that the Federal Government under the Collor administration and some state gov-
 ernments were more responsive than previous administrations to inquiries about
 human rights problems.
 The Foreign Ministry accepts international approaches on human rights questions
 and transmits human rights inquiries to relevant federal and local authorities.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, and nationality is unconstitu-
 tional, and racial discrimination, illegal since 1951, is a crime for which bail is not
 allowed. Nonetheless poor, uneducated, and darker-skinned Brazilians encounter
 substantial de facto discrimination. The black population is disproportionately con-
 centrated in the lowest economic stratum. Surveys of murders of minors in major
 cities show that the victims are disproportionately black. While 40 to 60 percent of
 Brazil's population is of African or other non-European ancestry, few senior officials
 in government and the armed forces are black. There are relatively few blacks in
 senior private sector management positions. Black consciousness organizations have
 challenged the view that Brazil is a racial democracy and denounced discrimination
 in housing, education, the workplace and societ at large. These organizations com-
 plain that blacks are more likely to e stopped by police and deprived of their civil
 rights and that they bear the brunt of police brutality.
 In September, self-styled neo-Nazi gangs emerged in Sao Paulo state, advocating
 white supremacy. Graffiti calling for "death to northeasterners," in reference to the
 generally poor, often black immigrants from the rural northeast of Brazil, was
 spray-painted on various public buildings. Neo-Nazi gangs also desecrated Jewish
 cemeteries in Porto Alegre on September 26 and painted swastikas on the Israelite
 Societyrbuilding in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, on September 30. Comprehensive
 data detaiing the nature and patterns of racial discrimination are few, in part be-
 cause discrimination against blacks does not receive great attention by the -Govern-
 ment, the media, or the general public. Discrimination becomes an issue when a
 well-known person is involved, such as in the September 26 complaint of a retired
 soccer star that he was barred from a Sao Paulo nightclub because he is black.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex in employment and sala-
 ries, and provides for 120 days of paid maternity leave. The provision against wage
 discrimination is rarely enforced, however, and, as a reaction against the maternity
 leave law some employers seek sterilization certificates from prospective employees
 or try to tire or avoid hiring women in their childbearing years.
 There is a high incidence of physical abuse of women in Brazil. Major cities annu-
 ally report several thousand cases of violence against women, including wife-beat-
 ing, murder, and rape. A study by the international human rights group Americas
 Watch concluded that over 70 percent of reported cases of violence against women
 takes place in the home. It also concluded that rape is seldom investigated and is
 rarely prosecuted.
 There is still a strong cultural bias against the filing of complaints by victims of
 abuse or their families, although officials claim that women are now more willing
 to make official complaints. However, effective Government action on such com-
 plaints remains the exception. Although the archaic concept of "defense of honor"
 was struck down by the Supreme Court in March 1991, local courts still acquit men
 who kill their unfaithful wives and prosecution of such cases is often slow. In fact,
 the trial court concerned in the Supreme Court ruling in March 1991, on remand,
 defied the higher court's ruling and on August 29, 1991, again acquitted the defend-
 ant, on the grounds of honor, for killin his wife and her lover. Recife professor Jose
 Fernando Gomes shot and paralyzed his wife Katia Camarotti and killed her sister
 in January 1991, in anger over his wife's plans to divorce him. Before being brought
 to trial, he was murdered by an unknown assailant.
 There were allegations that the "defense of honor" is also applied to violence
 against and murders of homosexuals. One group, Grupo Gay da Bahia, claims that
 a homosexual is murdered every five days in Brazil, most often by hustlers who kill
 and rob their victims, and that in the few cases where charges are filed, the accused
 generally are acquitted or receive very light sentences. The group also claims to
 nave documented the existence of 12 paramilitary groups dedicated to killing homo-
 sexuals and transvestites, one of which (Commando da Caca aos Gays) publicly
 claimed responsibility for killing and mutilating several transvestites in Rio de Ja-
 neiro.
 In March a book published by a leading newspaper company detailed dozens of
 cases of child prostitution, largely in the more remote northern regions of Brazil.
 Girls as young as 10 years of age reportedly work as prostitutes in cities and in
 towns supported by prospecting activity. In many cases, adolescent girls are lured
 
 
 350
 
 to the region with promises of employment, only to be told that they owe the costs
 of their upkeep and transportation to their employers and must serve as prostitutes
 to pay off those "debts."
 Women's organizations have been active in promoting women's rights and lobby-
 ing the Government in such areas as combatting violence against women, respecting
 the constitutional rights of women and promoting sensitivity to women's issues
 through courses and seminars, including courses or local police. Such efforts to
 date, however, have resulted in very little effective government action.
 There are approximately 250,000 Indians in Brazil. The Constitution gives Indi-
 ans the exclusive use of the riches in the soil, rivers, and lakes located on  eir
 lands. The Federal Government has the responsibility to demarcate and protect In-
 dian lands. It also has the authority to develop Indian lands, but the Indians must
 receive a share of the proceeds from any such exploitation. Brazilian Indians may
 bring suits in court to defend their rights and interests, and in such suits the Con-
 stitution stipulates that they are to be provided the assistance of a public prosecu-
 tor.
 Land and property rights disputes between Indians and non-Indians continued to
 lead to violence in 1992. One Yanomami and two prospectors were killed in a clash
 on February 19. Namrbiquara Indians attempting to evict illegal prospectors from
 their reserve were met with armed resistance in Uanuary. In May Guajajara Indians
 clashed with federal police who entered a village on Guajajara lands in search of
 evidence of marijuana trafficking by village residents. In early November,
 Guajajaras protested an alleged lack of police action in investigating the murder of
 a Guajajara by blockading a nearby highway and detaining passing motorists. Nego-
 tiation and the p.3mise of a police investigation led to the release of the detainees.
 The threat of violent confrontation between police and indigenous people was avert-
 ed in June when Kaiapo chief Paulinho Paiakan surrendered to authorities peace-
 fully on rape charges, after refusing to answer court summonses in connection with
 the case.
 Illegal rospecting on Indian lands continues. Prospectors evicted from Yanomami
 landsy OperationlFree Jungle have begun to return, and large numbers migrated
 to other indigenous areas in Roraima. On September 17, Makuxi Indians blockaded
 a road over which supplies to illegal prospectors are transported. They had sought
 eviction of the prospectors for months, but FUNAI indicated that it lacked the re-
 sources to carry out an eviction operation. While the Government has demarcated
 many new indigenous lands in the past year, enforcement of Indian rights is ham-
 perd by a lack of resources for effective policing of the extensive borders of re-
 serves, and by powerful local interest groups.
 The Yanomami Reserve demarcated in 1991 by the Collor Administration was the
 target of promilitary, nationalist legislators, who seek to exclude a 150-mile-wide
 strip of land adjacent to the border from the reserve as a matter of national secu-
 rity. Indian affairs experts oppose such exclusion, as the natural territory of the
 Yanomami extends over the border into Venezuela, which has established a
 Yanomami reserve there.
 Effective health care for Indians, a federal government responsibility, is also im-
 peded by lack of funds. Illegal prospectors bring new diseases, particularly malaria,
 into Indian populations which have no immunity against such diseases. Private do-
 nations support some health care costs in the Yanomami territories, but many Indi-
 ans still must travel long distances to find health care facilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Brazil's Labor Code has longprovided for union rep-
 resentation of all Brazilian workers (excepting military and "militarized" police and
 firemen), but imposed a hierarchical unitary systemfunded by a mandatory "union
 tax" on workers and employers. Under a restriction known as "unicidade," the Code
 prohibits multiple unions of the same professional category in a given geographical
 area. It also stipulates that no union's geographic base can be smaller than a mu-
 nicipality. Workers in a union whose numbers increased (as when an industry grew)
 could petition the state to split a preexisting union into two or more unions. The
 1988 Constitution freed workers to organize new unions out of old ones without
 prior authorization from the Government, but retained other provisions of the old
 code. The retention of unicidade and of the "union tax" continues to draw criticism
 both from elements of Brazil's labor movement and from the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 In practice, however, unicidade has proven less restrictive in recent years, as
 more liberal interpretations of its restrictions permitted new unions to form and
 compete, in many cases, with unions and federations that had already enjoyed offi-
 cial recognition. The sole bureaucratic requirement for new unions is to register
 
 
 351
 with the Ministry of Labor which, by judicial decision, is bound to receive and record
 their registration. The primary source of continuing restriction is the system of
 labor courts, which retains the right to review the registration of new unions and
 adjudicate conflicts over their formation. Approximately 20 percent of the Brazilian
 work force is organized, with just over half of that number ailiated to an independ-
 ent labor central. Attacks on rural labor leaders continued (see Section l.a.).
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike (excepting, again military and
 "militarized" police and firemen, but including other civil servants). Enabling legis-
 lation passed in 1989 stipulates that essential services remain in operation during
 a strike and that workers notify employers at least 48 hours before beginning a
 walkout. The Constitution prohibits government interference in labor unions but
 provides that "abuse" of the right to strike (such as not maintaining essential serv-
 ices, or failure to end a strike after a labor court decision) will be punishable by
 law.
 Port workers and stevedores, airport workers, public and private bus drivers and
 fare collectors, public and private teachers, and federal and state government em-
 ployees went on strike in 1992. Formerly the ruling of abusiveness was virtually
 automatic; over the last several years the courts have applied the law with more
 discretion. However, in 1992, several regional labor courts, after ruling strikes abu-
 sive, acted to make unions responsible for "damages" claimed by businesses as a re-
 suit of strikes. The amount of financial liability was to be determined subsequently
 by civil courts. The first unions to be affected were public transportation workers
 in Sao Paulo, Campinas, and the Federal District, and port worker and stevedore
 unions nationwide.
 Although Brazilian laws make no provision for a central labor organization three
 major groups have emerged-the Sole Workers Central (CUT), the General Workers
 Confederation (CGT), and Forca Sindical. The centrals do not have legal standing
 to represent professional categories of workers; however, all three centrals can effec-
 tively acquire such standing by affiliating with existing state-wide federations or na-
 tion-wide confederations. Unions and centrals are free to affiliate internationally. In
 1992 Forca Sindical and CUT affiliated with the ICFTU, as the CGT had done pre-
 viously.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize is pro-
 vided for by the Constitution, and unions are legally mandated to represent work-
 ers. With some government assistance, businesses and unions are working to ex-
 pand and improve mechanisms of collective bargaining. Nevertheless, the labor
 court system exercises normative powers with regard to the settlement of labor dis-
 putes, thereby discouraging direct negotiation. Existing law charges these same
 courts, as well as the Labor Ministry, with responsibility for mediation in the pre-
 liminary stages of dispute settlement. Wages are set by free negotiation in many
 cases, and in others by labor court decision. Beginning in 1990, the Federal Govern-
 ment attempted to control salary increases in order to limit inflation, but the at-
 tempts appeared to have little effect on wage settlements.
 The Constitution incorporates a provision from the Labor Code that prohibits the
 dismissal of employees who are candidates for or holders of union leadership posi-
 tions. Nonetheless, dismissals take place, with those dismissed required to resort to
 a usually lengthy court process for relief. In general, enforcement of laws protecting
 union members from discrimination lacks effectiveness. Union officials estimate that
 some 5 percent of such cases raching the labor court system are resolved within
 days through a preliminary judicial order. The other 95 percent generally take 5 to
 10 years (and sometimes more) to resolve.
 Labor law applies uniformly throughout Brazil, including the free trade zones.
 However, the unions in the Manaus Fe Trade Zone, like rural unions and many
 unions in smaller cities, are relatively weaker vis-a-vis industry as compared to
 unions in the major industrial cities in the Southeast.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-While the Constitution prohibits
 forced labor there have been repeated credible charges that it exists in Brazil, de-
 spite federal government assertions that it is taking steps to halt the practice and
 prosecute perpetrators. In 1992, on the basis of "amply documented reports," the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) noted "serious deficiencies" in the applica-
 tion in Brazil of the international conventions on the abolition of forced labor.
 The ILO cited reports of "thousands of workers, including children and young per-
 sons, who are subjected to forced labor in various sectors of the rural economy and
 in mining." In rural areas in particular, reports of forced labor are commonplace and
 include forced prostitution of children. In 1992 the Pastoral Land Commission de-
 nounced a notable increase of instances of persons confined to farms and forced to
 work without pay (from 1,599 cases in 1990 to 4,883 cases in 1991), and projected
 a continuation of the problem into 1992. A 1992 estimate put the total number of
 
 
 352
 persons working under coercion at 70,000. State and federal authorities often do not
 investigate reports of compulsory labor, claiming lack of resources. Local police
 admit that overseers or owners of many farms withhold pay from migrant laborers
 and use force to retain and intimidate them. Jurisdiction for such violations falls
 to the Ministry of Labor which has allocated insufficient resources for enforcement.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age under
 the Constitution is 14, except for apprentices, and legal restrictions are also set in
 the Constitution to protect working minors under age 18. Legal restrictions on child
 labor are often not enforced, however, and the problem is widespread. (The ILO
 noted in 1992 that the constitutional provision for apprenticeships under age 14 is
 not in accordance with ILO Convention 5 on minimum age in industry.) By law, the
 permission of the parents or guardians is required for minors to work, and provision
 must be made for them to attend school through the primary grades. All minors are
 barred from night work and from work that constitutes a physical strain. Minors
 are also prohibited from employment in unhealthful, dangerous, or morally harmful
 conditions.
 Despite these legal restrictions, however, official figures state that 17.2 percent
 of all children between the ages of 10 and 14 are working. The actual percentage
 is probably somewhat higher, perhaps as high as 25 percent countrywide, with the
 highest regional percentage in the northeast. Many, perhaps most, of these working
 minors are working in violation of the law. Accurate statistics on illegal child labor
 are not available. Economic conditions often compel children to contribute income
 to their families (or their own upkeep if they have left home). Enforcement of child
 labor laws is severely limited because the Ministry of Labor, the responsible agency,
 deploys too few inspectors and accepts a widely held view that it is better for these
 minors to work than to be involved in street crime. Further, in 1992 the ILO noted
 reports of a decrease in the number of labor inspections since 1990.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-As of January 1993, the national minimum
 wage wi be adjusted every 2 months in accordance with a law on salary policy
 passed in December 1992. The Interunion Department for Socioeconomic Studies
 and Statistics estimates, however, that the minimum wage is a little less than one-
 third of the minimum necessary (based on the standard set by the Constitution) to
 support a family of four. The most recent available national survey (for 1990) shows
 that 35 percent of economically active individuals, including minors of 10 to 14
 years of age earn no more than the minimum wage. The 1988 Constitution limits
 the standard workweek to 44 hours, and the Labor Code mandates at least one con-
 secutive 24-hour rest period per week. It expanded pay and fringe benefits and es-
 tablished new protections for agricultural and domestic workers; however, not all of
 its provisions have been enforced.
 Many Brazilian workers suffer from unsafe working environments. Occupational
 health and safety standards are set by the Fundacentro, which is under the Min-
 istry of Labor. Enforcement of these standards is inconsistent because the Ministry
 deploys insufficient resources for adequate insp ion and enforcement. There are
 also credible allegations of corruption within the enforcement system. If a worker
 has a problem in the workplace and has trouble getting relief directly from his em-
 ployer, he or his union may file a claim with the regional labor court, although in
 practice this is frequently _a cumbersome, protracted process.
 Brazilian law requires the establishment in work places of Internal Commissions
 for Accident Prevention (C1PA). Employee members of these commissions are pro-
 tected under law from being fired for commission activities. Such firin, however,
 do occur, and legal recourse usually requires years for resolution. The 991 figures
 for workplace accidents and fatalities showed a decline from 1990, but the 677,404
 reported accidents, of which 4,523 were fatal and 19,972 caused permanent disabil.
 ities, undoubtedly understate the problem, because they measure only the some 23.7
 million covered workers in a work force of approximately 56 million.
