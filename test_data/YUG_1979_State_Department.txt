 YUGOSLAVIA
 In contrast to the citizens of other Communist countries,
 Yugoslavs enjoy broad freedom of movement and access to many
 foreign publications and to radio broadcasts. Yugoslavia
 has a very good record on freedom of emigration, and the
 government emphasizes the fulfillment of economic needs.
 At the same time, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia
 (LCY) maintains a monopoly of political power and the
 Government enforces significant restrictions on freedom of
 political expression and the right to participate in
 political decision making. The Government does not tolerate
 public criticism of President Tito, the LCY, or the
 principles of socialist self-management, or of the unity of
 Yugoslavia's diverse peoples.
 Yugoslavia is a multi-national, non-aligned state with a
 stormy and violent past. Yugoslavia has a serious concern
 about the terrorism sometimes employed by emigre political
 organizations. Other problems include the persistence of
 ethnic and national animosities within the country,
 disparity of levels of economic development from region to
 region and continued ideological and political differences
 with surrounding states. These problems have led the LCY
 and the Yugoslav Government to adopt a number of creative
 reforms, such as decentralization of political and economic
 institutions, but have also contributed to a restrictive
 policy with regard to many aspects of individual political
 behavior.
 In recent years challenges both inside and outside the Party
 from the nationalist, liberal and pro-Soviet forces have
 made the Yugoslav leadership noticeably more critical of
 breaches in political discipline. Simultaneously however,
 the overall question of individual rights appears to be
 gaining more attention from government authorities and is
 increasingly becoming a legitimate subject of discussion.
 Recent indications include public questioning of the
 application of a "political suitability" test for employment,
 public discussion of the rights of defendants in trials
 involving recorded evidence and approval of a system of
 compensation for individuals who have been falsely arrested.
 In addition, the number of political arrests appears to be
 down from the high level of several years ago.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The Constitution guarantees the integrity of the person and
 expressly prohibits forced confessions. Although the
 Department of State knows of no confirmed instances of
 systematic torture, there are indications that it does occur
 at times. Amnesty International reports the receipt of some
 allegations that people have been beaten, ill-treated or
 threatened during pre-trial detention. However, its use is
 not condoned and can become a legal issue. For example, in
 December 1978 and January 1979, a retrial took place in
 Zagreb of a number of persons previously convicted of an
 attempt on President Tito's life in 1975. Reports indicate
 that the retrial was ordered because confessions had been
 obtained, at least in part, by torture. In some instances
 sentences were reduced.

b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 While conditions within Yugoslav prisons appear generally to
 be strict, but not inhuman, there have been allegations of
 mistreatment. For example, a small number of political
 prisoners has reportedly been held in solitary confinement
 for extended periods. The Yugoslav press has reported
 beatings of prisoners by police. In one case, two policemen
 were given sentences for having beaten prisoners. Amnesty
 International reports particularly bad conditions in Croatia
 and Bosnia-Hercegovina. Numerous reports have referred to
 the alleged denial of proper medical treatment to prisoners
 with special medical problems. In at least one such case,
 the GOY did transfer the individual from prison to house
 arrest for a period of time.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Yugoslavs are generally free from arbitrary arrest, although
 large numbers of suspects have reportedly been detained for
 questioning-after alleged terrorist acts. There are Western
 press reports that the Yugoslav police kidnapped emigre
 opponents of the Yugoslav Government and placed them on
 trial in Yugoslavia. The requirement to bring a defendant
 before a judge within 24 hours of arrest is designed to
 bring about "judicial awareness" of the reason for
 detention. Normally arraignment quickly follows arrest.
 Indictment must be brought within three months, except that
 the investigating judge can request from the court an
 extension of three months or even longer if justification
 for a deferral is presented. The accused has the right to
 counsel from the time he or she is brought before a judge.
 Prisoners may receive visits from family members, but this
 right is sometimes restricted on the grounds that it would
 prejudice the investigation.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally open to the public except in cases
 involving military or national security questions when the
 judge has the authority to hold proceedings in camera. In
 cases of crimes relating to national defense-and -security
 and to matters concerning service in the Yugoslav military,
 civilians may be tried in military courts. The court may
 also, in cases involving classified materials, appoint a
 military officer as counsel for the defense rather than
 civilian counsel. The trial record does not necessarily
 provide a full transcript and all testimony is recorded in
 the words of the presiding judge. Government controls on
 the media also affect the degree and nature of publicity
 accorded the proceedings. The accused has the right to
 counsel, and Yugoslav lawyers have often vigorously defended
 their clients. The Government, however, has not always
 remained impartial in judicial proceedings, particularly in
 cases of political interest. In some cases there have been
 reports that the authorities influenced the testimony of
 witnesses. Amnesty International reports cases where
 persons accused of political crimes have not had access to
 lawyers of their choice. This organization has also
 reported that threats have been used to dissuade a lawyer
 from taking a case and that various obstructions have been
 put in the way of lawyers who do. In ordinary criminal and
 civil proceedings, the courts act according to the law and
 constitution and the defendants' civil rights are generally
 respected.
 
 
 702
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The Yugoslav code of criminal procedure contains elaborate
 provisions for conducting searches, including the
 requirement for a court order except under certain limited
 circumstances. There are no indications of widespread
 violations.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Government has vigorously promoted programs for the
 fulfillment of basic needs for food, shelter, health care,
 and education. There is an extensive system of social
 security and other benefits for those who are old, disabled
 or without employment. While deficiencies in these areas
 exist, they are primarily due to economic constraints rather
 than insensitivity to basic human needs or deliberate
 policies or neglect. Moreover, the Government has been
 attempting to correct lapses in its program of social
 services. For example, 1978 legislation extended social
 security and health benefits to all private farmers, a group
 that previously had only limited access to social welfare
 programs.
 Yugoslav taxes on personal incomes are set on the local
 level and are in principle progressive. However, direct
 taxation provides only a minor part of Yugoslav revenues.
 The real burden for ordinary citizens is indirect taxation,
 e.g., sales and turnover taxes, which is regressive.
 There is evidence that some individuals in privileged
 positions, both in the political and the business sectors,
 use their positions to acquire perquisites, but there is no
 indication that significant economic resources are being
 diverted for these purposes. While there are differences in
 per capita income levels between the various Republics,
 wealth within individual Republics is fairly evenly
 distributed. The poor are largely victims of structural
 features of the economy, and the Government seeks to improve
 their lot.
 The Yugoslav economy is decentralized with a high degree of
 autonomy on the Republic, and even local, level.  There are
 great discrepancies between the level of economic
 development in the more well-off northern republics and the
 sss developed south. However, the Government acknowledges
 past shortcomings and has embarked on new efforts to aid
 these 'ess developed areas through investments and programs
 to build industry and infra-structure and to expand social
 services.    s substantial number of Yugoslav workers are
 ampioyed in the countries of Western Europe, especially in
 the Fede:al Republic of Germana'.
 City-country differences also remain although the different
 styles of life in urban and rural environments make
 statistical comparisons somewhat misleading. There is still
 a movement of the population to the cities with a resultant
 strain on housing and other requirements of life. According
 to Yugoslav statistics, 137,000 housing units with a total
 of 9.2 million square meters of space were constructed in
 1978.
 
 
 703
 Access to education and employment is on merit. While
 individual dissidents have encountered discrimination from
 the authorities, little evidence is available concerning the
 denial or restriction of such access to the families of
 dissidents.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 In practice public, political dissent is frequently suppressed.
 In particular, the Government does not tolerate criticism of
 the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and its leadership,
 of basic domestic and foreign policies, or of the self-
 management system or the unity of the country's diverse
 ethnic groups. When the Government does take action against
 such criticism, it resorts to arrest and trial, and fines,
 warnings, imprisonment, or a mix of these. In late 1978 and
 periodically throughout 1979, several Yugoslav political
 leaders publicly criticized opposition groups and certain
 dissidents, criticism which was echoed in the Yugoslav
 media. Recently, the authorities took legal action against
 an unauthorized literary journal. Under Yugoslav law,
 dissidents can be charged with a variety of vaguely defined
 political crimes (e.g., hostile propaganda, counter-revolution,
 association against the state, and making statements
 prejudicial to brotherhood and unity) and sentenced to
 prison terms of up to ten years. Amnesty International
 reports imprisonment in several cases for criticism of the
 Government in private conversations.
 Various private organizations have reported on the human
 rights situation in Yugoslavia and have criticized
 restrictions on political expression and the arrest of
 persons espousing dissident political views. .In 1977,
 Freedom House estimated that there were 500 political
 prisoners while the International League for Human Rights
 placed the number at 600. Amnesty International disclosed
 in 1978 that it had been working for 86 Yugoslav prisoners
 either as adoption or investigation cases. Yugoslav
 authorities themselves have acknowledged the existence of
 political prisoners and at various times have cited figures
 ranging from 500 to 700. On the basis of official and
 unofficial reports the number of persons currently
 imprisoned in Yugoslavia on political charges would seem to
 be within that range. Amnesties, while not routine, have
 been granted from time to time, usually on the occasion of
 Yugoslav National Day, November 29.
 Yugoslav media are responsive to Party direction although a
 degree of objectivity and even of selective criticism is
 permitted. Publication and circulation of written materials
 are subject to regulations involving registration and post-
 publication censorship. Published material, films, and
 recorded material from other countries including Western
 European countries and the United States are readily
 available although there is censorship of individual items.
 Amnesty International reports several instances where
 Yugoslavs have been imprisoned for possessing or circulating
 certain "emigre" journals critical of the Government.
 Freedom of religious practice and assembly is guaranteed by
 the Constitution. In practice, it is generally honored so
 long as religious organizations do not engage in activities
 
 
 704
 considered political. At the same time, constraints are
 imposed on proselytizing activities and religious education
 for children. Seminaries exist for training adults as
 priests. There are no rabbinical seminaries. Public
 political gatherings are permitted only on the authority of
 official bodies. In practice, the right to political
 assembly is exercised exclusively by groups supporting
 government policy.
 Historic prejudices and animosities continue to exert their
 influence, and the nationalities question remains one of the
 key issues facing Yugoslavia. A nation of minorities, the
 Yugoslav Government has done a great deal to insure the
 legal and social rights of the many different nationalities
 and ethnic groups making up the Yugoslav nation. The use of
 the major local language is required in official
 communication between Belgrade and the various Republics,
 and these languages are also used in the local schools and
 in the local media. Appropriate national flags of other
 countries are displayed on certain occasions in the various
 regions of Yugoslavia, e.g., the Albanian flag in the
 Albanian enclave of Kosovo and the Turkish and Albanian
 flags in the Republic of Macedonia. Some social
 discrimination continues to be expressed, but the Government
 policy is one of strict legal equality.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within the country is guaranteed in the
 Constitution and is not significantly infringed upon in
 practice. The vast majority of Yugoslavs travel abroad at
 will, and in 1979 the law on travel documents extended the
 validity of passports and exit visas from two to five years.
 In November 1979, the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia
 ruled that Yugoslavs would no longer need exit permits to
 travel to those countries with which Yugoslavia had
 diplomatic and consular relations. A small number of
 dissidents has been denied passports on national security
 grounds. Recently published amendments to the law on the
 entrance of foreigners to Yugoslavia mention the right of
 asylum and provide for government assistance to persons
 granted that right. Hundreds of thousands of Yugoslav
 workers are currently employed in Western Europe. There are
 no restrictions on emigration.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Constitution has provisions guaranteeing participation
 in the political process, and the "self-management" system
 encourages wide participation in the decision-making process
 on both political and economic issues. 'There is evidence
 that major policy decisions at every level are subject to
 broad discussion. Nevertheless, the LCY's control of-
 political power and restrictions against unauthorized
 political expression set limits on such participation.
 The 1974 Constitution guarantees the equality of citizens
 regardless of sex. The government is committed to improving
 the status of women and its performance is generally good.
 Women are represented in most walks of life, including high-
 level government positions, and receive equal pay for equal
 work. The main problems of equal treatment of the sexes
 occur in those areas of the country where economic
 development has lagged or where traditional eastern or rural
 attitudes about female roles prevail.
 
 
 705
 Under the worker self-management system, there are no
 independent labor unions and, there is no guarantee of the
 right to strike: all labor disputes are expected to be
 resolved by the workers' council in deliberation with
 management. On the other hand, strikes are not expressly
 forbidden. Work stoppages have occurred over pay levels and
 working conditions, and these have generally resulted in the
 correction of specific grievances.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 Although the government has shown a willingness to discuss
 and raise general questions of human rights in international
 forums, including meetings of the non-aligned countries and
 the CSCE review meetings, it remains very sensitive to any
 charges of human rights violations within Yugoslavia. The
 government generally views the adjudication of political
 crimes as an internal matter and not subject to outside
 investigation on grounds of national sovereignty. In 1976,
 however, Yugoslav officials met with representatives of
 Amnesty International to discuss the charges of political
 repression and individual cases of arrest and imprisonment.
 Yugoslavia also has allowed foreign observers to observe
 political trials, for example from the International League
 for Human Rights and from Amnesty International. In 1977,
 Yugoslavia hosted the first follow-up meeting to the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and
 publicly acknowledged that human rights were a legitimate
 subject for international discussion.
