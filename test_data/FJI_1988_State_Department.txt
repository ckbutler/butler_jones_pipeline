 FIJI
 Fiji is a multiracial society with a population of 46 percent
 indigenous Fijians and 48 percent ethnic Indians. It was a
 parliamentary democracy until May 1987, when the army took
 over from a newly elected government. Coup leader Lt. Col.
 (now Major General) Sitiveni Rabuka cited the predominance of
 Indians in that government as a primary reason for the coup.
 Fiji is led by President Rata Sir Penaia Ganilau, the former
 Governor-General, who issues decrees on the advice of the
 Cabinet. An interim civilian government, formed in December
 1987 when Major General Rabuka's military regime voluntarily
 stepped down, is headed by Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese
 Mara, who held that office for 17 years prior to the April
 1987 elections. The Cabinet is mostly made up of civilians
 and includes Fiji Military Forces (FMF) Commander Rabuka and
 four other military officers. The military, which staged two
 coups in 1987, remains very influential, especially in
 security matters.
 The interim Government promulgated the Internal Security
 Decree (ISD) in June 1988, following the discovery of a
 substantial cache of arms that had been smuggled into Fiji.
 It was suspended on November 17, 1988. The ISD granted broad
 powers of detention and search without charge or warrant to
 the security forces (police and military). The ISD also
 granted the Government power to censor the press and close
 academic institutions. The use of the search and detention
 powers was generally restrained and limited to use in
 connection with the arms investigation. The judiciary, which
 remains independent, asserted its powers on several recent
 occasions to free persons held under the decree. Rabuka
 announced in September that members of the security forces had
 been disciplined for "excesses" committed under the Decree but
 gave no details.
 Fiji's economy suffered a severe decline in the wake of the
 first coup in May 1987, but has made significant progress
 toward recovery. Sugar is the mainstay of the economy, and
 tourism is the second largest foreign exchange earner. The
 Government is promoting light manufacturing for export as a
 long-term means of diversifying the economy away from
 dependence on sugar and tourism.
 The human rights situation in Fiji improved substantially
 after the interim Government took over. In the first half of
 the year limited freedom of the press was restored, reports of
 improper detention and search all but disappeared, and
 tensions eased. Fears of renewed tension arose after the June
 arms discovery. A few dozen people were detained for
 questioning; all, however, were either charged or released
 within a few days. As of December 1988, no one remained in
 jail without charge. Reports of physical abuse were few. The
 press was not subject to advance censorship but exercised
 considerable restraint in view of the wide powers available to
 the Government under the ISD. The ban on political meetings
 and demonstrations was lifted. A draft constitution is
 currently under review by the multiethnic Constitution
 Advisory and Review Committee.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings by the Government
 or any political groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden under Fiji's Fundamental Freedoms Decree
 and not practiced. Physical abuse of detainees has been
 reported but is neither widespread nor condoned. This
 represents a marked improvement over 1987, when there were
 numerous credible reports of physical abuse of detainees after
 the second coup in September. Corporal punishment is allowed;
 strokes of the cane are administered under medical supervision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Until its suspension, the ISD allowed detention without trial
 in national security cases, subject to review every 6 months.
 Several dozen people were detained under this provision, all
 of whom have been released, most after a few days' detention;
 some were held.up to 2 weeks. Some detainees initially were
 held incommunicado. Most detainees reported having been
 treated well. There are no long-term political detainees in
 Fiji. Twenty-one people were arrested and charged in
 connection with the arms case. Of these, 19 were granted bail
 by the courts. Exile is not practiced formally, but at least
 one.-political activist holding dual Fiji/New Zealand
 citizenship was deported despite his preference for remaining
 in Fiji. A number of Fiji citizens resident abroad would
 likely be subject to arrest or detention if they returned to
 Fiji.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 *e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The court system, reorganized after Fiji's withdrawal from the
 Commonwealth in September 1987, remains modeled on the British
 system. Magistrates' courts try minor offenses. A high court
 has original jurisdiction in serious cases. A Court of
 Appeals and a Supreme Court complete the legal structure. The
 Chief Justice chairs all three higher courts. No special
 courts exist; military courts try only members of the armed
 forces. The judiciary is independent, as demonstrated when a
 judge granted bail to most of the defendants in the arms
 smuggling case, despite the objections of the prosecution. In
 a September opinion ordering the release from house arrest of
 one of the defendants, the Chief Justice cautioned the
 security forces against abuse of power and unreasonable
 detention. Due process rights are similar to those found in
 English common law. Right to a public trial is guaranteed.
 Defendants have a right to counsel and there is a Public
 Defender's Office. Right of appeal is maintained. In
 practice, many trials and appeals have been delayed due to
 
 
 802
 FIJI
 understaffing of the court system. Habeas corpus and bail are
 normal procedure, so most defendants have not experienced
 undue imprisonment before trial. There were no political
 prisoners at the end of the year.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general, privacy of the home is respected in Fiji. The ISO
 allowed warrantless searches. Homes and businesses of persons
 suspected of links with the arms shipment were searched, some
 repeatedly. Some people complained of harassment. Search
 warrants are required for normal searches in criminal cases.
 Membership in political organizations is not compulsory.
 Political contributions or activity are not required from
 civil servants as a condition of service. Surveillance of
 individuals believed to represent a security threat is carried
 out to some degree. Many political dissidents believe their
 telephones and mail are monitored, but no concrete evidence is
 available.
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Political speech was constrained under the ISD, but has been
 largely restored since November. Prior to suspension of the
 ISO, public speeches tending to create racial division or
 threaten the public order were banned under it, but the ban
 was not strictly enforced. No charges were filed under these
 provisions. While not barred completely from expressing their
 views, dissidents had exercised restraint in criticizing the
 Government. Opposition political figures stated the ISD
 inhibited ful-l and open discussion on the draft constitution
 and so the Fiji Cabinet suspended the ISD,. This action had
 the effect of encouraging dialogue on the draft constitution
 and was seen as an attempt by moderates to underline support
 for human rights.
 Broadcast and print media were subject to censorship under the
 ISD. In practice, the media operates without prior censorship
 but with considerable self-restraint. Statements about the
 political situation by p6litical opposition figures and
 foreign governments are reported, however. The editor of the
 only daily newspaper was detained for several hours last
 summer when the newspaper printed a wire service story that
 erroneously quoted Rabuka as denying the authority of the
 civilian regime. He was released once he established that the
 wire service, not the newspaper, had made the error. Some
 time later, the chief reporter of the same paper was detained
 for 2 days for reasons that remain unexplained. While these
 incidents indicate that the press is still less than free, the
 situation was much improved over 1987, when the newspapers
 were closed for 6 weeks. Foreign reporters are required to
 obtain a visa to enter Fiji. Some television crews from
 Australia and New Zealand have been denied visas.
 Fiji is home to the University of the South Pacific (USP), a
 regional institution. The USP has been a center of opposition
 political activity. The Government has made it clear that it
 wants the USP, and especially its expatriate staff, out of
 Fiji domestic politics. Some politically active expatriate
 staff members have been denied extension of their work
 permits. A number of Fiji citizen university lecturers were
 detained for periods of up to 2 weeks after the arms
 
 
 803
 FIJI
 discovery. While the ISD gave the Government the power to
 close any higher educational institution and to approve or
 disapprove teachers, these provisions were not used during the
 year and were suspended in November.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Assembly for political purposes is no longer restricted.
 However, permits for political demonstrations generally are
 not granted. One group of about 20 people was arrested and
 charged with parading without a permit for a demonstration in
 downtown Suva on the anniversary of the May 1987 coup. They
 were granted bail; at year's end the case still had not been
 heard. The ISD allowed the Government to restrict other kinds
 of public assembly, but the provision was not used. Even
 while the ISD was in effect, Indian community leaders used
 public holidays to hold political discussions of the draft
 constitution. Political parties are currently operating, and
 party headquarters, including that of the deposed coalition,
 remain open. Party activity is expected to resume when
 elections are scheduled, possibly late in 1989. Organizations
 of a political nature are allowed to operate and issue public
 statements.
 For discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed and honored in practice.
 The draft constitution declares Fiji a Christian country but
 guarantees protection for all religions. All Sunday
 commercial activities except those dircctly related to
 tourism, sugar harvesting, or emergency services are banned.
 The Sunday bans are opposed by Indians and urban residents,
 but popular among rural Fijians. Some Christian leaders also
 oppose the Sunday bans. Despite statements by General Rabuka
 about "Christianizing" the Indian community, there has been no
 attempt to translate this idea into public policy. No
 significant restrictions affect foreign clergy, missionary
 activity, charitable works, religious publishing and
 education, or other normal activities of religious
 organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the
 country. The ISD allowed the Government to prohibit certain
 people from entering or leaving Fiji. A few people were
 unable to depart if they were free on bail pending further
 investigation of arms charges. The most notable case was that
 of a Fiji Indian lawyer resident in New Zealand who came to
 Fiji to take care of some business and was unable to depart
 for about a month. He sued, then eventually dropped the suit
 when he was allowed to leave. There are some Fiji citizens
 resident abroad who could be subject to detention if they
 returned to Fiji. Opposition politicians and labor leaders
 were able to travel abroad and return to Fiji in 1988, an
 improvement over the situation which prevailed under the
 military Government in September-November 1987. Fiji citizens
 are free to emigrate. According to official statistics,
 between 8,000 and 10,000 have done so since May 1987. Most of
 the emigrants are Indians, many of them professionals, but
 Fijians and others have also left. Several thousand have
 
 
 804
 FIJI
 claimed refugee status, especially when applying for admission
 to Canada, but neither the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 nor any government have recognized those claims. There are no
 refugees in Fiji, and no forced resettlement programs.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Fiji is governed by an interim Government comprising a Prime
 Minister and a Cabinet appointed by the President. The
 Cabinet includes senior politicians from Prime Minister Mara's
 Alliance Party as well as technocrats, five army officers, and
 some ethnic Fijian nationalists. There are two Indian
 Ministers. The interim Government has announced that it
 intends to implement a new constitution and elections by the
 end of 1989. The Cabinet approved and published a draft
 constitution containing traditional human rights guarantees in
 September 1988. The draft provides for a single-house
 Parliament with 28 elected Fijian members, 22 Indians, 1
 Rotuman (Rotuma is a Polynesian island that is part of Fiji
 but ethnically distinct) and 8 others. In addition, the Great
 Council of Chiefs (GCC) will name eight members (one of whom
 is to be the commander of the armed forces). The Prime
 Minister can name up to four cabinet ministers from outside
 the elected and appointed members. These would then become
 Members of Parliament.
 The draft constitution will be put to a multiethnic
 Constitution Advisory and Review Committee (CARC) to gather
 comments from all of Fiji's communities and to report these
 opinions to the Cabinet. A revised draft will be submitted to
 the GCC for review. The document will then be returned to the
 Cabinet for final review and transmitted to the President for
 approval and promulgation. The GCC is an all ethnic-Fijian
 advisory body composed of Fiji's highest traditional chiefs.
 Provincial representatives to the GCC are designated by
 provincial councils. The GCC has no administrative role in
 government but its approval is a sign of legitimacy within the
 ethnic Fijian community. The President and Prime Minister are
 both members by virtue of their high traditional positions.
 Representation in the new Parliament will not be entirely
 proportional to population. Indians, who slightly outnumber
 Fijians, will be underrepresented. The other population
 elements (neither Indian nor Fijian) will be slightly
 overrepresented. In addition, the allocation of Fijian seats
 favors the east, which has traditionally dominated Fijian
 politics. The Constitution is intended to ensure political
 dominance by the indigenous Fijians, while reinstating a form
 of parliamentary democracy and providing sufficient
 representation for the Indian community to protect its
 communal interests.
 Political parties are expected to reemerge when elections are
 scheduled. It appears there will be at least four parties:
 The Alliance, representing the moderate Fijian establishment;
 the Fiji Labour Party, which led the deposed coalition
 government; the National Federation Party, the other coalition
 partner and the traditional defender of Indian communal
 interests, and a new party to be formed from the Taukei
 movement, which promotes the predominance of ethnic Fijian
 interests.
 Elections are to be held by secret ballot, with voting only by
 communal constituencies. This is a major change from the 1970
 
 
 805
 FIJI
 Constitution, which provided for a complex system of
 cross-voting allowing Indians a say in the selection of some
 Fijian representatives and vice versa. As in the old system,
 a government can sit for 5 years, during which period it must
 call an election.
 Women generally take a secondary role in political life but
 are not excluded. There are two women in the current cabinet:
 the Minister for Women's Affairs and Social Welfare (a Fijian
 Chief) and the Minister for Indian Affairs (a well-known
 Indian politician). The current Permanent Secretary of
 Foreign Affairs is also a woman.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights groups in Fiji. The Fiji
 Government regards externally based investigations of the
 political and human rights situation in Fiji as a violation of
 its sovereignty. Nonetheless, there were two such
 investigations in 1988, one by a group of visiting Australian
 Members of Parliament and the other by the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (tCFTU). Both were allowed
 to proceed with their work. Government officials met with the
 Australian delegation but refused to receive the ICFTU group.
 No action was taken against Fiji citizens who met with the two
 groups.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The stated purpose of the 1987 military coups was to ensure
 the political supremacy of the indigenous Fijian people and tor
 protect their traditional way of life and communal control of
 land. To this end a number of measures have been taken that
 favor the Fijian community over the other racial groups in
 Fiji. The most obvious is the reapportionment of the new
 Parliament to guarantee a preponderance of Fijians. The
 Government is also committed to raising the proportion of
 Fijians and Rotumans in the public service to 50 percent or
 more. Many Fijians felt that the precoup Public Service
 discriminated in favor of Indians, who controlled most of
 middle management due to their higher educational level.
 After the coups, a number of Indian civil servants were
 forcibly retired and many others left the country. The new
 constitution will reserve a number of positions for ethnic
 Fijians, including the Presidency, head of the Public Service
 Commission, and Commissioner of Police.
 Control of land is a highly sensitive issue in Fiji. About 85
 percent of the land is held communally by indigenous Fijians.
 Most cash crop farmers are Indians, who lease their land from
 the Fijian villages. Freehold land title is not an indigenous
 concept; current crown (6 percent) and freehold (9 percent)
 lands were alienated from customary owners during the colonial
 period. The present land ownership arrangements.were
 instituted to protect the interests of the indigenous Fijians.
 Many Indians, particularly farmers, feel that the absence of
 secure land tenure discriminates against them. The military
 coups were prompted, in part, by Fijian fears that Indians
 sought to take away their land.
 Women in both the Fijian and Indian communities have
 functioned primarily in traditional roles, although some women
 
 
 806
 FIJI
 rise to high places in the public service, politics, and
 business. Women can attain high status in Fiji's traditional
 chiefly system, although it is unusual. The prime minister's
 wife is, in her own right, Fiji's second highest-ranking
 Chief. Women have full rights of property ownership and
 inheritance, and a number have become successful entrepreneurs.
 However, women are paid less than men, a discrepancy that is
 especially notable in the garment industry, where workers,
 mostly young Indian girls, are subject to a special minimum
 wage much lower than that in other sectors. Reliable current
 statistics on representation of women in traditional men's
 occupations, business management, and the professions are
 unavailable. However, relatively-few women are employed in
 these areas. There is a small but active women's rights
 movement. A recent area of focus has been violence against
 women. The movement has pressed for more serious treatment in
 the courts of rape, which tends to draw prison sentences of
 only a few years. The Chief Justice late in the year issued
 sentencing guidelines calling for more severe penalties.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to form and join unions, elect their own
 representatives, publicize their views on labor matters, and
 determine their own policies. Strikes are legal. Suva city
 council workers struck early in 1988 without interference from
 the central Government. Unions must register with, but are
 not controlled by the Government. The central labor body, the
 Fiji Trades Union Congress (FTUC), is closely associated with
 the opposition Fiji Labour Party and the deposed Bavadra
 Government. The FTUC is a member of the ICFTU and is part of
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) tripartite
 representation. The Labor movement is led largely by ethnic
 Indians. Persons with close ties to the Government have
 started rival unions primarily for ethnic Fijians; these
 unions are more amenable to political cooperation with the
 Government. The Government offers the same protection to the
 persons and property of union leaders as to other citizens. A
 number of union leaders were detained for questioning after
 the arms discovery; all were released within a day or two and
 reported being treated properly. There have been a few
 incidents of vandalism against the homes and cars of union
 leaders. The incidents, which were well organized, remain
 unsolved. There is no evidence to link such actions to the
 Government.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Fiji law recognizes the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. Key sectors of the economy including sugar and
 tourism are organized, and collective bargaining is the norm.
 Currently, nationwide wage guidelines are in effect. These
 guidelines replaced a mandatory wage cut and freeze put into
 effect after the 1987 coups. Accordingly, collective
 bargaining over wages is restricted. Prior to the coups a
 tripartite forum of employers, unions, and government oversaw
 labor negotiations. The tripartite forum has been abolished;
 its restoration is a key demand of the FTUC. The Government
 has agreed to consider reestablishing the forum, but no action
 has been taken to date. Legislation protects workers from
 summary dismissal without just cause. The courts often rule
 in favor of workers in such cases. The unions are generally
 successful in preventing discrimination against workers for
 
 
 807
 FIJI
 union activities. When the Government announced plans to set
 up export processing zones (EPZ's), it indicated an intention
 to bar labor unions. However, the Government reversed itself
 quickly after protests from the unions. Labor legislation is
 applied uniformly throughout the-country, including in the
 EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor does not exist in Fiji. Both the 1970
 Constitution and the draft constitution give protection from
 forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under 12 may not be employed in any capacity.
 Children (under age 15) and -young persons" (age 15-17) may
 not be employed in industry or work with machinery.
 Enforcement generally is effective, with the possible
 exception of family members working on family farms or
 businesses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No national minimum wage has been established. Certain
 sectors have minimum wages set by the Ministry for Employment
 and Industrial Relations. These are in the $0.75-1.00 per
 hour range, except in the garment industry where it is only
 about 50 cents. The minimum wage will support a barely
 adequate standard of living, except in the garment industry,
 where wage standards are based on the assumption that workers
 are young people still living- at home and not expecting to
 support a household. Fiji has workplace safety regulations, a
 Workmen's Compensation Act, and an accident compensation
 plan. A tribunal sets awards for workers injured on the job:
 Government enforcement of safety standards suffers from a lack
 of trained enforcement personnel, but the unions do a
 reasonable job of monitoring safety standards in organized
 workplaces.
