 ARMENIA
 One month after the aborted Moscow coup in August 1991, Armenia declared its
 independence from the Soviet Union. Since that time, it has sought to build a West-
 ern-style parliamentary democracy as the basis of its form of government. President
 Levon Ter-Petrosyan, elected in 1991, is Head of State and, as such, appoints a
 Prime Minister to preside over the Government. The Government in 1992 suffered
 from a lack of structure and organization and has been plagued by rivalry between
 the Presidency and the Parliament. In addition, Parliament failed to adopt a new
 constitution in 1992, profoundly hampering both executive and legislative effective-
 ness and further slowing any movement toward substantive political and economic
 reform. The Armenian National Movement, which supports the President, is the
 largest party in the Supreme Soviet (legislature) with 52 seats out of 240; the re-
 maining seats are splintered among 11 other parties and "unions."
 Armenia established its own Ministry of Defense in 1992 and named a com-
 mander-in-chief (now called chief of staff) of Armenian armed forces in August. Ar-
 menian border guards, subordinate to the Ministry of Defense, patrol the Republic's
 borders with Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Nakhichevan, an exclave of Azerbaijan; Rus-
 .la, hr -,"    na ennntinlip tn mnnitnr Armenia's borders with Iran and Turkev. In

 addition, other security organizations from the Soviet period include the National
 Security Ageny (successor to the Committee for State Security-KGB) and the Min-
 istryof Intern  Affairs.
 The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, an overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian enclave
 within Azerbaijan, dominates the lives of Armenians. It has been the most serious
 territorial dispute in the former Soviet Union in terms of casualties and suffering.
 Since 1988 when the enclave voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia,
 thousands have died, thousands more have been injured, and hundreds of thousands
 made refugees. Armenian support for the separatists has led to a crippling Azer-
 baijani economic blcade, whch strangles landlocked Armenia's foreign trade and
 greatly hampers imports of food and fuel-nearly three-quarters of which transited
 erbaijan under Soviet rule.
 The country is sufferin from an acute economic crisis brougt on by Azerbaijan's
 blockade, the disintegraton of the Soviet Union, and the ainrmath of the 1988
 earthquake. Industrial production has fallen by some 85 percent, contributing to
 ver  high unemployment and hyperinflation. About 95 percent of the population are
 estmated to live below the officially recognized poverty line. There are severe short-
 ages of fuels, electricity, and essential foods. In the winter of 1992-93, the blockade
 continues to hinder humanitarian relief efforts. Consequently, death by freezing and
 starvation threatens large numbers of the disenfranchised in Armenia, to include
 refugees, ensioners, the unemployed, and children.
 Under these conditions, the observance of human rights in Armenia appears pre-
 carious. The legal system is anarchic and unchanged from former Soviet practice.
 Old laws coexist with and contradict new laws, new laws sometimes contradict each
 other, and even provisions of the same law can be contradictory. Although the
 multipartysystemappearstobewell accepted, the absence of a new constitution
 and the rivalry between the branches of government hampr the exercise of both
 executive and legislative powers and retard progress towards political and economic
 reform. Parliament enacted a new law on iformaton, which provides for freedom
 of speech and press, but no other new legislation has been adopted to safeguard
 freedom of assembly and association, freedom of religion, freedom of movement, and
 worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No political or other extrajudicial
 killings are known to have occurred in 1992.
 b.Disappearance.-No abductions by government, nonofficial oropposition .forces
 are known to have been committed. However, hostage-taking y oth sides in the
 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has been widespread (see Section 1.g. and the Azer-
 bajan Country Report).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 In 1992 three official reports of police brutality were ried, but the number of actual
 incidents of beatings and sicar mistreatment is probably higher.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Egie.-The draft constitution includes safe-
 guards to prevent arbitrary arrest or detention. However, legislative reforms of the
 judicial system have yet to be instituted. According to written procedure, prelimi-
 nary detention may not last more than 72 hours.
 A suspect has the right to call his lawyer, and the police must also notify the sus-
 pet's relatives if so aned. After an arrest, the suspect may be jailed for 3 months
 until completion of the investigation, or upto 9 months by special order of the pros-
 ecutor. Bail is not used in Armenia, and there is no trial by jury. Once the authori-
 ties bring a civil or criminal case against a person, by present statute both tyres
 of cases must go to trial within 1 month. One judge and two lay assessors decide
 the verdict in Armenian court cases.
 In September Government, security forces arrested the Minister of Civil Aviation
 and four of his deputies for alleged illegal activities, includingbribe taking, graft,
 and embezzlement. Senior civil aviation management protested the Minister's ar-
 rest, claiming that the Government had presented insuhicient proof of illegal activ-
 ity and demanding that it release those arrested on their own recogizance. At
 years end, the former minister and his deputies remained under arrest.
 In June a political battle between President Ter-PetrIsyan and Hrair Marukyan,
 leader of the international bureau of the influential opposition Dashnak party (Ar-
 menia Revolutionary Federation) which spearheaded public demonstrations and de-
 mands in Parliament for the President's resignation, resulted in Marukyan's expul-
 sion from the country. The President accused Marukyan (a Greek national) and his
 partv of having violated numerous laws affecting political organizations and of hay-
 
 
 698
 ing collaborated with the KGB since 1988. Based on these accusations but without
 providing due process, the President ordered Marukyan to leave the country within
 48 hours. He also invited Markyan to sue for libel if the latter denied the validity
 of the accusations. As a result of this incident, several local members of the
 Dashnak party (but not the organization itself) initiated a lawsuit against the Presi-
 dent. Under existing laws, however, only an organization can sue the President of
 the country. The case therefore went before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,
 who also could find no legal basis for continuing the investigation. Marukyan, who
 left the country as ordered, has himself brought no individual lawsuit against Ter-
 Petrosyan. The case subsequently was closed pending Parliament's passage of new
 laws addressing this issue.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system in Armenia consists of district
 courts and the Supreme Court. The former try approximately 99 percent of all cases.
 To handle the remaining caseload, the Supreme Court is split into three separate
 bodies: the first reviews serious crimes (murder, rape and crimes committed by
 high-level officials); the presidium reviews all cases which the above body inves-
 tigates, providing rulings on any contested verdicts; and the court of appeals inves-
 tigates the legitimacy of decisions handed down by district courts. Soviet criminal
 law and procedures still obtain in Armenia. The 1mistry of Internal Affairs contin-
 ues to conduct preliminary investigations of criminal cases; and the Ministry of Jus-
 tice monitors the organizational structure and functioning of the court system for
 both criminal and civil cases.
 Trials generally are public. Defendants have the right to attend their trial,
 confront witnesses, and present evidence. The court appoints an attorney for any de-
 fendant who needs one. The presumption of innocence does not exist. Defendants
 as well as the prosecutor have the right of appeal. Supreme Court judges are ap-
 pinted by the Supreme Soviet an institution whose present members were elected
 during the Soviet period. Similarly, presiding district court judges were elected by
 "public" vote in 1986. At the present time, therefore, neither group can be consid-
 ered completely independent and free from political influence.
 There are no known political prisoners in Armenia.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-At
 present, there is no legal protection for the privacy of citizens, their communica-
 tions, and their correspondence. The National Security Agency continues to function,
 but it is unclear whether this organization still has the authority to wiretap the
 telephone of a suspect and to intercept correspondence in the absence of a specific
 court order.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The conflict over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave
 in Azerbaijan, continued in 1992. The conflict pits the Armenian segment of the
 ulation of the region (77 percent in the 1989 Soviet Union census) against the ov-
 ernment of Azerbaijan. The Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians receive material and
 moral support from Armenia, though not always with the Armenian Government's
 approval. Volunteers from Armenia are fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh. President
 Ter-Petrosyan, who rose to prominence and power on the issue of Nagorno-
 Karabakh's status, has attempted to distance his Government from the Nagorno-
 Karabakh Armenians' independence movement and has refused to recognize the
 independence of the self-proclaimed "Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.' Having given
 substantial support to the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, opposition grou s-par-
 ticularly the Dashnaks-have criticized Ter-Petrosyan for this stand, a we  as for
 his reluctance to create a national army.
 The conflict has led to a series of economic blockades: Azerbaijan of Armenia and
 Nagorno-Karabakh; and Armenia of the Azerbaijani region of Nakhichevan, which
 is separated from the rest of Azerbaijan by Armenia. For both countries, these
 blockades have exacerbated the human suffering caused by the war. For further in-
 formation on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, see the report on Azerbaijan.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Parliament passed a law on information that
 provides for freedom of speech and the press. These freedoms were widely exercised;
 nearly every political party and organization publishes its own newspaper or jour-
 nal, and a myriad of newspapers and periodicals are available to the general public.
 Because of the Azerbaijani blockade, a general shortage of paper sometimes delayed
 or prevented publication. The Government continued to control access to the paper
 supply, but there was no indication that it used this control to influence the print
 me dia.
 At year's end, Parliament was considering legislation to privatize 49 percent of
 television and radio. In the meantime- t.hp Government nmmiaed to uive a certain
 
 
 699
 amount of television and radio air time at no cost to opposition parties, which may
 also purchase additional air time. Members of the opposition claimed with some jus-
 tification that the Government rarely fulfilled these promises completely, sometimes
 shortening television and radio broadcasts or postponing the programs Io odd hours.
 Academic freedom was not restricted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoiation.-No laws existed in 1992 to
 guarantee the right of peaceful assembly and association, but public demonstrations
 were commonplace. The procedures for obtaining permits are not onerous, and secu-
 rity personnel and militia routinely perform crowd control during demonstrations.
 The Ministry of Justice registers political parties and organizations. The Govern-
 ment did not attempt to control the political opposition through the registration
 process: in the 18 months prior to year's end, over 25 political parties were reg-
 istered.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Armenian Apostolic Church has played a central role
 in the lives of Armenians for centuries and claims some 80 percent of the people
 as adherents. However, all members of Armenian society, including its minorities,
 enjoy freedom of religion in practice. No legislation provides this right at present.
 d.ydom of Movement Within the Country. Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 atriation.-The Government did not restrict internal or international travel for pol-
 icy reasons, but the continued validity of pertinent Soviet laws affected inter.
 national travel. The Yerevan Office of Visas and Registration (OVIR), a vestie of
 Soviet bureaucracy, still withholds passports to Armenians lacking "invitations for
 travel abroad, and did so on several occasions. OVIR also impeded free travel
 through delays and various bureaucratic obstacles. Parliament did not pass the pro-
 posed new law on citizenship in 1992; the law would authorize new passpot and
 effectively eliminate the need for the OVIR and exit visas. At present all Armenian
 citizens continue to carry Soviet passports.
 Some 200,000 people, virtually the entire ethnic Azeri population of Armenia, are
 refugees in Azerbaijan. After the 1988-89 anti-Armenian pogroms in Azerbaijan
 connected with the conflict over control of Nagrno-Karabakhi, these people were
 subjected to discrimination and intimidation, often accompanied by violence in-
 tended to drive them from the country. Many were deported, and the rest fled.
 There are conflicting claims on the number of people killed during the deportationsr
 Azeri refugees claim 160, the Armenian Government states that fewer than 30 died
 during this process. It is unclear if these people will be able to re.turn, as is also
 the case for the nearly 400,000 Armenian refugees who fled Azerbaian after the p-
 groins. Both groups of refugees complain that they were stripped of their posses-
 sions, movable and immovable, and received little or no compensation. The plight
 of the refugees in Armenia is particularly desperate because of the country's dire
 economic situation.
 Each year since 1990, approximately 250-300 members of Armenia's small Jewish
 community have emigratedt Israel_; fewer than 1,000 now remain. For those Jews
 with visas in hand, the only obstacle put in the way of their emigration stemmed
 from the annual military draft. Accrding to local Jewish representativesp however
 government authorities quickly swept aside this minor obstacle, and steady emigra
 tion continues.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Democracy is not yet ru-mly established in Armenia. However, Armenian citizens
 have so far been able to demonstrate the right to change their governient peace-
 fully. In the 1990 elections, relatively free by Soviet standards, the Armenian Na-
 tional Movement defeated the Communist Party. Although not elected in a truly
 multiparty election, Parliament began to function as such as members of the Com-
 munist Party quit that organization, becoming "independent" or joining any number
 of different party factions. Armenia then began to build the foundations of a West-
 ern-style parliamentary dengcracy as the basis of its political system. The next par-
 liament    elections are scheduled for 1995, but the ratification of a new constitu-
 tion may lead to earlier elections.                       .          ..
 In the 1990 elections, the Communist Party succeeded in ensuring a sizable per-
 centage of parliamentary seats for itself, regardless of election results. Although
 therenad been a movement to liquidate it after the August 1991 coup, the Party
 remained intact but inactive. As of late 1992, the Party continues to be a legal polit-
 ical entity officially registered with the Ministry of Justice. While its membership
 and influence remain limited, in mid-November the Communist Party again began
 publishing its own newspaper.
 Thrugl universal suffrage in a multicandldate election, the Armenian people
 elected President Levon Ter-Petrosyan as President in October 1991. By law, mer-
 
 
 700
 bers of the executive branch, including the President himself, may not belong to any
 political party. Presidential elections are scheduled for 1995.
 More than 25 political parties were registered over the past 18 months, 12 of
 which are officially represented in the fragmented Parliament. The Armenian Na-
 tional Movement, which supports the President, has just 52 deputies. Because of fre-
 Ruent defections and splits, the strength of the other parties, such as the Dashnak,
 Ramkavar, Self-Determination Union, and Republican parties, in the legislature
 vanes.
 In the absence of a new constitution, the Government's legitimacy is based upon
 the 1990 law on the presidency and the 1991 law on parliament. The former created
 the office of president, an institution which did not exist in the Republic before that
 time. The law laid out the term of office, what powers belonged to the presidency,
 and what appointments he or she has the authority to make. The law on the par-
 liament established a multiparty system. In an effort to improve government effi-
 ciency, the President took steps to ensure opposition members' participation in the
 formation of public policy. In September, for example, he asked representatives of
 several influential opposition parties to sit on the National Security Council and ap-
 pointed an opposition party leader (and former prime minister) to be State Minister
 or Defense Issues.
 Women in practice play only a limited role in government and politics. The high.
 est ranking woman in government is the Minister of the Environment.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several local human rights groups in Armenia. The Government does
 not impede investigations, either by domestic or international human rights organi-
 zations, into alleged charges of human rights abuse.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 No laws have been passed since independence to protect against discrimination
 based on race, sex, religion, language, or social status. Virtually the entire Azeri
 population of Armenia, some 200,000 people, were deported or fled in 1988-89 (see
 Section 2.d.) as a result of an officially sanctioned campaign of discrimination and
 intimidation, often accompanied by considerable violence. Because the Government
 does not expect any Azerbaijanis to return to Armenia, to date no official measures
 have been taken to protect them should they decide to return.
 In contrast to the treatment of the ethnic Azeri population, Armenia's other na-
 tional minorities do not suffer discrimination. These include small communities of
 Russians, Jews, Kurds, Georgians, Greeks, and Assyrians. Historically, the anti-
 Semitism found in other parts of the former Soviet Union did not exist in Armenia.
 In practice, deeply ingrained, traditional attitudes discriminate against women.
 Armenia remains a male-dominated society, with the universal expectation that
 women will do the housework and raise the family even if they have another full-
 time job. No statistics exist on rapes or other physical violence perpetrated against
 women. Officially, only a handful of cases (around 15 or 20) have gone before the
 courts. Given societal attitudes, it is likely that numerous other such cases go unre-
 ported and unpublicized.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The absence of a new constitution hinders advance-
 ment of legal guarantees providing workers the right to form or join unions of their
 own choosing without previous authorization. The existing trade unions are hold-
 overs from the Soviet period and were not freely chosen by workers.
 Armenia joined the International Labor Organization in November as its 161st
 member.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Despite passage of a law
 privatizing state enterprises, to date nearly all enterprises, factones, and organiza-
 tions remain under state control. As a result, voluntary direct negotiations between
 unions and employers without the participation of the Government cannot take
 place. At the same time, no legislation specifically addresses the right to organize
 and bargain collectively. The Government continues to establish overall wage levels
 and to set minimum wage standards. There are no export processing or other special
 economic zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no legal prohibition of
 forced or compulsory labor, but reportedly it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Parliament has not yet passed re-
 form legislation addssing the minimum age for employment of children. The statu-
 tory minimum ave for emo ovment under Soviet law is 16.

<pre>
 701
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is set by governmental de-
 cree, not by legislation. At present, the minimum wage does not provide a decent
 living for a worker and family, nearly 95 percent of whom live below the officially
 recognized poverty level. Industrial enterprises presently operate at only 10 to 15
 percent of capacity in the current, exceptionally depressed economic climate. By ex-
 isting statute, "employed" workers at these idle factories continue to receive two-
 thirds of their base salary.
