 CZECH REPUBLIC
 The Czech Republic is a constitutional parliamentary democracy with a bfcameral
 Parliament. Following early elections in June, former parliamentary speaker Milos
 Zeman formed a Government comprising almost exclusively members of his left-of-
 center Social Democratic Party. The Parliament elects the President for a 5-year
 term. President Vaclav Havel was reelected in January and remains an internation-
 ally recognized advocate of human rights and social justice. Although the country
 essentially has completed the reform of political and economic structures initiated
 after the 1989 "velvet revolution," some institutions are still in a state of modifica-
 tion and transformation. The judiciary is independent.
 The Ministry of the Interior oversees the police. The civilian internal security
 service, known as the Security and Information Service (BIS), is independent of
 ministry control but reports to Parliament and the Prime Minister's office. Police
 and BIS authorities- generally observe constitutional and legal protection of individ-
 ual rights in carrying out their responsibilities. However, occasional reports persist
 of human rights abuses by some members of the police, although fewer than in pre-
 vious years.
 The economy is market-based, with over two-thirds of gross domestic product
 (GDP) produced by the private sector. Poorly. performing capital markets and lack
 of corporate restructuring contributed to a slowdown in growth in 1997, following
 rapid GDP growth in 1995 and 1996. Macroeconomic indicators remain favorable:
 Low national debt, a low if growing budget deficit, strong foreign currency reserves,
 relatively low inflation, low but rising unemployment, and recent but steady im-
 provement in the current account. The work force is employed primarily in industry,
 retail trade, and construction. Leading exports are machinery and transport equip-
 ment, and intermediate manufactured products. GDP per capita in 1997 reached ap-
 proximately $5,000.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 discrimination and sporadic skinhead violence against the Romani community re-
 main problems. A 1997 commission on Romani issues achieved mixed results. Prob-
 lems persist with the discriminatory impact on Roma of the 1993 Citizenship Law,
 despite partial remedies legislated in 1996. Lengthy pretrial detention is a problem,
 due to a lack of resources for the judicial system. There is some violence against
 women. Trafficking in refugees and economic migrants, often by elements of orga-
 nized crime, into and across the country is a growing concern. In September the new
 Government appointed well-known former dissident and U.N. Human Rights Com-
 mittee expert Petr Uhl to the newly created position of Commissioner for Human
 Rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 Incidents of racist violence by skinheads resulted in several killings (see Section
 5).
 In November secret police agent Ladislav Macha was sentenced to 5 years in pris-
 on for his role in the torture and death of a Catholic priest in 1950.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and there were no reports of such practices.
 The police force was restructured significantly, and many new officers have been
 recruited since the 1989 revolution. For the first time in recent years, recorded inci-
 dents of crime by police declined. Nevertheless, public approval ratings for police re-
 main low. In the past, there were reports of police physical abuse, shakedowns, and
 malfeasance often directed at foreigners and Roma. However, complaints more often
 centered during the year on police failure sometimes to take sufficient action in
 cases of threats or attacks against Roma.
 There were some accusations that special police units used unwarranted force to
 contain a group of anarchists and radical environmentalists that incited a riot in
 central Prague in May, tipping over cars and smashing shop windows. Several dem-
 onstrators and policemen were treated in area hospitals for injuries following the
 
 
 1227
 incident. Although none of the officers faced criminal charges following the resulting
 investigation, some were reprimanded, and the case is still under review. A subse-
 quent march including the same radical groups in August took place without inci-
 dent.
 The case of a Brno policeman charged with using excessive force to break up a
 late-night party outside a theater in 1995 was investigated internally and now
 awaits a formal court decision. In November secret police agent Ladislav Macha was
 sentenced to 5 years in prison for his role in the torture and death of a Catholic
 priest in 1950.
 The Office for the Documentation and Investigation of the Crimes of Communism
 (UDV-see Section i.e.) continued to investigate cases of torture from the Com-
 munist era. Former secret police agent Jozef Kafka was convicted in August of tor-
 ture and abusing public office for his actions in the 1981 interrogation of dissident
 Vlastimil Trestak. Kafka was ordered by the court to pay approximately $1,700
 (50,000 crowns) in damages to Trestak and was barred from serving in a govern-
 ment or civil service position for 4 years.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. There is overcrowding
 in some prisons; as of August the prison system was at 114 percent of capacity.
 The Government permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law forbids arbitrary arrest and de-
 tention, and the Government observes this prohibition in practice. Police may hold
 persons without charge for up to 48 hours, during which time they have the right
 to counsel. The previous 24-hour limit, as outlined in the Charter of Basic Rights
 and Freedoms, was amended by Parliament in early 1998 following numerous re-
 quests by law enforcement officials.
 The lack of experienced police investigators and a still-evolving legal environment
 have contributed to a backlog of court cases. Pretrial detention may last up to 4
 years for cases considered "exceptionally grave" under the Criminal Code. Pretrial
 detention for most crimes may last 2 or 3 years, with mandatory judicial review in-
 tervals beginning at the end of the first 6 months of detention. If the court does
 not approve continued detention during a judicial review, the suspect must be re-
 leased. In practice few pretrial detainees are held for longer than 2 years. The law
 does not allow bail for certain serious crimes. A suspect may petition the appro-
 priate investigating authorities at any time for release from detention. The average
 length of pretrial detention increased from 89 days in 1989 to 225 days in 1998. The
 number of pretrial detainees in July was 3,357, nearly 50 percent of the 7,184 total
 prison population. Attorney and family visits are permitted. The authorities follow
 these guidelines in practice.
 The law prohibits exile, and the Government observes this prohibition in practice.
 Since 1993 local courts and foreign police have expelled to Slovakia "Slovaks"
 without proper citizenship or residency papers. Some of these expulsions involve
 "Slovak" Roma who have never been in Slovakia. In May a judge in Teplice ordered
 the expulsion of a Rom named Milan Sivak, even though he formally received Czech
 citizenship in February. The Appeals Court later overruled this expulsion sentence.
 By the first half of 1997 (latest available statistics) a total of 851 "Slovaks" had been
 administratively or judicially expelled by the authorities. A February presidential
 amnesty (which was expected to affect three-quarters of all expulsion sentences
 issued between January 1, 1993 and February 2, 1998) granted amnesty to those
 receiving expulsion sentences for crimes in which the punishment is less than 5
 years' imprisonment. However, according to one nongovernmental organization
 (NGO) that follows this issue, some courts have not implemented this amnesty.
 Since the recent amendment of the Criminal Code, fewer courts have imposed an
 expulsion sentence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is impartial and independent in practice. Judges are not fired or trans-
 ferred for political reasons.
 The court system consists of district, regional, and high courts. The Supreme
 Court is the highest court of appeal. In addition, a separate Constitutional Court
 decides cases concerning the constitutionality of legislation.
 The law stipulates that persons charged with criminal offenses are entitled to fair
 and open public trials. They have the right to be informed of their legal rights and
 of the charges against them, to consult with counsel, and to present a defense. The
 state provides lawyers for indigent defendants in criminal and some civil cases
 through the bar association. All defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and
 have the right to refuse to testify against themselves. They may appeal any judg-
 ments against them. The authorities observe these rights in practice. In January the
 Ministry of Interior appealed a presumption of innocence case decided in favor of
 
 
 1228
 a student who was referred to in the-media as the perpetrator, rather than the sus-
 pect, of a crime based on public police statements.
 The 1991 lustration law, passed to prevent Communist-era collaborators from en-
 joying high state responsibilities, continues to bar many former Communist Party
 officials, members of the people's militia, and suspected secret police collaborators
 from holding a wide range of elective and appointive offices for 5 years, including
 appointive positions in state-owned companies, academia, and the media. In 1995
 Parliament extended this legal constraint to the year 2000, overriding a veto by
 President Havel. Some private employers also have required applicants to produce
 lustration certificates proving noncollaboration. By year's end, the special govern-
 ment office handling lustration requests processed approximately 12,000 lustration
 certificates at the request of individuals, bringing the total since 1991 to 360,000.
 During the- year, some 2.5 percent of applicants did not receive confirmation of a
 clear record because of suspected collaboration, a slightly lower percentage than the
 overall average of 3 percent since 1991. Those who did not receive confirmation of
 a clear record may file a civil suit against the Interior Ministry for a charge similar
 to slander. In the period from mid-October 1996 to September 1997, 31 such suits
 were filed. Of these 31 suits, about half of those decided to date were "fully success-
 ful," and another quarter were "partially successful."
 Defenders of the lustration law argue that individuals who systematically de-
 stroyed the lives of others in order to gain advantages for themselves within the
 Communist system should not be entrusted with high state responsibilities. How-
 ever, the lustration law has been criticized for violating human rights principles
 prohibiting discrimination in employment and assigning collective guilt. It has also
 been criticized because the screening process is based on the records of the Com-
 munist secret police, which many believe are incomplete or unreliable. Citizens un-
 justly accused of collaboration may suffer diminished career prospects and damaged
 personal reputations. The 1997 Agenda 2000 report by the European Union notes
 the law's continuing existence with some concern.
 Some actions taken by state authorities and the Communist Party during the
 1948-1989 Communist regime are being investigated as criminal acts under a 1993
 law by a government office (UDV) established for this purpose. The UDV was estab-
 lished in 1995 and incorporated into the structure of the police. In investigations
 of 99 cases, it recommended action against 42 individuals; 27 cases ended in crimi-
 nal punishment. The UDV is screening an additional 300 cases for action under its
 mandate. It targets priniarily cases of: Torture (see Section 1.c.); border shootings;
 treason connected with the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia; state per-
 secution of opponents of the Communist regime; and investigation of Czech authori-
 ties who negligently allowed exposure of Czech citizens to hazardous waste after the
 nuclear accident in Chernobyl.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Elec-
 tronic surveillance, the tapping of telephones, and the interception of mail require
 a court order. Government authorities respect these prohibitions in practice, and
 violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and of
 the press, and the Government respects this right in practice. Individuals can and
 do speak out on political issues and freely criticize the Government and public fig-
 ures. A wide variety of newspapers, magazines,- and journals, owned by a variety
 of Czech and foreign investors, are published without government interference. The
 press and media continue to operate under Communist-era laws. In 1997 the Presi-
 dent signed into law a measure revoking a 36-year-old statue on the "defamation"
 of the President, which became effective in January. Although another Communist-
 era law against defamation of the Republic remains in effect, the last convictions
 under this statute occurred in 1996.
 The electronic media are independent. There are 3 television stations, 1 public
 and 2 private, and more than 60 private radio stations, in addition to Czech Public
 Radio. The leading television channel, Nova, is privately owned, partially by foreign
 investors. Citizens also have access to foreign broadcasts via satellite and cable, and
 increasingly, via the Internet.
 A nine-member Television and Radio Council has limited regulatory responsibility
 for policymaking and answers to the parliamentary media committee, which exer-
 cises broad oversight of the Council and approves its members. The Council can
 issue and revoke radio and television licenses and monitors programming.
 The law provides for academic freedom but forbids activities by established politi-
 cal parties at universities
 
 
 1229
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of persons to assemble peacefully. The Government respects this right in
 practice, although it may restrict assemblies that promote hatred and intolerance,
 advocae suppression of individual or poitical rights, or would otherwise jeopardize
 the safety of the participants. Poice generally do not interfere with spontaneous,
 peaceful demonstrations that lack a permit. However, the law forbids political party
 activity at universities.
 The Constitutionprvides for the right of persons to associate freely and to form
 political parties, and the Government respects this right in practice. Either the gov-
 ernment or the President may submit a proposal to the Supreme Court calling for
 a political party to be disbanded, but there have been no such cases since 1989. Or-
 ganizations, associations, foundations, and political parties are required to register
 with local officials or at the Interior Ministry, but there is no evidence that this reg-
 istration is either coercive or arbitrarily withheld. A 1997 draft report to the Cabi-
 net by the Minister without Portfolio called on the Interior Ministry to reexamine
 the official registrations of organizations propagating racial hatred or fascism, but
 no action has been taken to date.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The state subsidizes all religions that
 are officially registered with the Ministry of Culture. There are 21 state-recognized
 religions. To resster a church must have at least 10,000 adult members perma-
 nently residing in the country, or for registration as a member of the World Council
 of Churches, 500 adult members permanently residing in the country. Churches reg-
 istered prior to 1991 are not required to meet these conditions. Unregistered reli-
 gious groups, such as the small Muslim minority, may not own community property
 legally, although they are otherwise free to assemble and worship in the manner
 of their choice. Their members can and do issue publications without interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of movement to travel domestically and
 abroad, as well as for emigration and repatriation. Czechs who emigrated during the
 period of Communist rule frequently return to visit or live and are able to regain
 Czech citizenship if they relinquish their claim to any foreign citizenship. Citizen-
 ship is not revoked for political reasons. Nonetheless, the United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has expressed concern to the Government that its
 1993 citizenship law has created a problem of statelessness, especially among Roma
 (see Section 5).
 The Government provides first asylum and cooperates with the UNHCR and other
 humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The law includes provisions for
 granting refugee and asylee status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention Re-
 lating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. A legal and institutional
 framework is in place for the processing of refugees and asylees, although the cur-
 rent law is under revision to close a few gaps. The Czech Republic is both a transit
 and destination country. The Government fully funds an integration program to as-
 sist those granted refugee status in locating housing and receiving other social as-
 sistance. A reception center, three camps, and six integration centers are provided
 for refugees.
 In the last 8 years, 17,887 asylum applications were filed, of which over 10 per-
 cent (1,817) received formal refgee status for resettlement. Asylum applications
 doubled from 2,109 in 1997 to 4,086 in 1998. From January to August, 46 persons
 received refugee status, some of them from cases filed in 1997. Citizens from Af-
 ghanistan, the former Yugoslavia, India, and Iraq led those requesting asylum dur-
 ing the year, a change from previous years when Bulgarians, Romanians, and Arme-
 nians constituted the largest groups of asylum seekers. During the year, the Gov-
 ernment granted citizenship to 3,800 former citizens of Slovakia and 974 former citi-
 zens of other countries, including Ukraine, Bulgaria, Vietnam, the former Soviet
 Union, Syria, and Afghanistan. In addition, migrants from economically disadvan-
 taged countries in Central and Eastern Europe often enter the Czech Republic to
 take up illegal residency or in transit to the West. By September border police re-
 corded 31,029 illegal entry attempts, which was 1,690 more than in all of 1997. The
 majority were citizens of the former Yugoslavia.
 A growing concern is trafficking in large groups of refugees and economic mi-
 grants into and across the country, which lacks specific laws criminalizing alien
 smuggling. Organized rings promoting illegal employment abroad operate with im-
 punity, freely advertising their services in dozens of local papers and on the Inter-
 net. In spite of existing legislative gaps, the police are taking action against large-
 scale trafficking rings under organized crime statutes. In June police arrested 19
 members of an international alien smuggling ring believed to have smuggled more
 than 3,000 illegal migrants to the West during the past 3 years. In August another
 
 
 1230
 group of traffickers with 76 migrants was stopped at the Czech-Slovak border. The
 Czech organizers-were arrested and charged with illegal border crossing and face
 possible sentences of 6 months to 3 years in prison. The illegal migrant groups in
 these cases were composed primarily of Kosovar Albanians, Iraqis, and Afghans,
 most of who claimed asylum in the Czech Republic. There were no reports of the
 forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government by
 democratic means, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free,
 and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Citizens above the age of
 18 years are eligible.to vote by secret ballot in republic-wide and local elections. Op-
 position groups, including political parties, function- openly and participate without
 hindrance in the political process. Citizens may join political organizations or vote
 for the political party of their choice without government interference. Some per-
 sons, predominantly Roma, who were enfranchised citizens under the former
 Czechoslovakia, were unable to obtain Czech citizenship at the time of the split with
 Slovakia, despite birth or long residency in the Czech Republic. They lack voting
 and other rights due to restrictions under the existing citizenship laws (see Section
 5).
 The Government of Prime Minister Milos Zeman took office in August following
 general elections in June. The Government consists almost exclusively of members
 of the Prime Minister's left-of-center Social Democratic Party, the first nonrightist
 government since 1989. The primary opposition grouping consists of three center-
 right parties. The Constitution mandates elections to Parliament at least every 4
 years, based on proportional representation in eight large electoral districts. To
 enter Parliament, a party must obtain 5 percent of the votes cast in the election.
 The President is elected by Parliament and serves a 5-year term. The President has
 limited constitutional powers but may use a suspense veto to return legislation to
 Parliament, which can then override that veto by a simple majority.
 No restrictions exist, in law or in practice, on- women's participation in politics.
 Nevertheless, relatively few women hold high public office. None of the 19 cabinet
 ministers are women. The 200-member Chamber of Deputies has only 29 female
 deputies, including 1 deputy speaker. There are 9 female Senators in the 81-member
 Senate; 1 of the Senate's 4 vice chairmen is a woman. In December a woman, Libuse
 Benesova, was elected president of the Senate.
 No seats are reserved in either house for ethnic minorities. Slovaks, of whom
 there are an estimated 300,000, are almost all "Czechoslovaks" who elected to live
 in the Czech Republic after the split. Many serve in high positions in the civil serv-
 ice. For the most part, these Slovaks define their interests in the context of Czech
 politics, not along ethnic lines; there is no Slovak party in the Parliament.
 Most of the estimated 200,000 to 250,000 Roma have not been fully integrated
 into Czech political life (see Section 5). The political culture generally defines Roma
 as outsiders. Roma themselves have been unable to unite behind a program or set
 of goals to advance their interests within the democratic structures of the country.
 Few Roma serve in local government structures, although some have been appointed
 to advisory positions in government ministries. There is one representative of
 Romani background in the Parliament.
 In the June parliamentary election, the extreme rightwing Republican Party,
 whose leaders and deputies espouse virulently anti-German and anti-Romani poli-
 cies, failed to cross the- 5-percent threshold, thus failing to gain parliamentary rep-
 resentation for the first time since 1990.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups operate without government restriction, and government of-
 ficials generally are cooperative and responsive to their views. The best-known
 human rights groups are the Czech Helsinki Committee and the Tolerance Founda-
 tion (an umbrella organization), and there are also many single-issue groups.
 In September U.N. Human Rights Commission expert Petr Uhl was appointed to
 a newly-created position as Commissioner for Human Rights. As such Uhl succeeds
 Minister Without Portfolio Jaroslav Basta as head of the government Council for
 Nationalities and of the Interministerial Commission for Romani Community Af-
 fairs. Uhl pointed to his appointment as evidence that the Government views con-
 sistent protection of human rights as an "inseparable part of its efforts to establish
 a rule of law."
 
 
 1231
 
 In each house of Parliament there is a petition committee for human rights and
 nationalities, which includes a subcommittee for nationalities. A government-spon-
 sored Council for Nationalities advises the Cabinet on minority affairs. In this body,
 Slovaks and Roma have three representatives each; Poles and Germans, two each;
 and Hungarians and Ukrainians, one each. There is also a government commission
 staffed by members of the NGO and journalistic communities that monitors inter-
 ethnic violence. In 1997 the Government created an Interministerial Commission for
 Romani Community Affairs, which achieved only mixed results (see Section 5). In
 December the Government created the Council for Human Rights to be the consult-
 ing and coordinating body of the Government on human rights issues. Commissioner
 Uhl was appointed chairman of the Council.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law provides for the equality of citizens and prohibits discrimination. Health
 care, education, retirement, and other social services generally are provided without
 regard to race, sex, religion, disability, or social status. In practice Roma face dis-
 crimination in such areas as education, employment, and housing.
 Women.-The actual extent of violence against women is unknown, and public de-
 bate about it is rare, despite the efforts of womens' groups to focus public attention
 on the problem. The press occasionally reported on the problem of violence against
 women and trafficking in prostitutes. Studies indicate that 11 to 19 percent of
 women report that they have experienced sexual violence at the hands of their hus-
 bands or partners. Official government statistics recorded a slight drop in the num-
 ber of rape cases in 1997, from the annual range in recent years of 500 to 800 cases.
 Approximately 80 percent of the cases are solved. A 1997 study by the Sexology In-
 stitute found that only 3 percent of rape victims report the crme.
 Legislation does not specifically address spousal abuse; however, the Criminal
 Code covers other forms of domestic violence. An attack is considered criminal if the
 victim's condition warrants medical treatment (incapacity to work) for 7 or more
 days. If medical treatment lasts less than 7 days, the attack is classified as a mis-
 demeanor and punished by a fine not exceeding $100 (3,000 crowns or one-fourth
 of the average monthly wage). Repeated misdemeanor attacks do not impose stricter
 sanctions on the abuser. The police lack specialist personnel trained to deal with
 domestic violence and do not maintain regular contact with welfare and medical
 services.
 Gender studies experts say that women are ashamed to report rape or speak
 about it and that the police are not equipped to help, either by attitude or training.
 A total of 54 state-supported shelters with 771 beds accept women in most major
 cities and towns, and local NGO's provide medical and social assistance to women.
 According to NGO's, the situation has improved in recent years, but there still are
 not enough shelter spaces to meet the demand.
 Forced prostitution is illegal; prostitution is not, although local communities have
 the right to regulate it and enforce restrictions. Outside larger cities, the problem
 is particularly prevalent in the western border regions, where international vehicu-
 lar traffic is heaviest. Trafficking in prostitutes is punishable by a prison term of
 up to   years, with a term of up to 12 years if the victim is under the age of 15.
 (Adults can be prosecuted for engaging in sexual activity with a minor under the
 age of 15.) Security professionals report that the country is both a transit and a des-
 tination country for traffickers of women from farther east. Specific laws prohibit
 trafficking in women and children, and the authorities cooperate with other nations
 to enforce these laws, resulting in successes in several high profile cases.
 The media rarely mention the issue of sexual harassment; other social concerns
 take priority in the national consciousness. There are no legal definitions or laws
 prohibiting sexual harassment. The Czech language has no standard term to ex-
 press "sexual harassment." One NGO monitoring this problem reported that the
 lack of sensitivity on this issue does not mean that sexual harassment does not
 exist; rather, some inappropriate or offensive behaviors may be too common for com-
 ment. In a 1995 study by the Sociology Institute, 43 percent of women reported ex-
 periencing-some form of sexual harassment in the workplace during their career. A
 study by the Defense Ministry in 1996 found that nearly half of female soldiers ex-
 perienced harassment on duty. The concerns of women's groups over workplace sex-
 ual harassment often are ignored or dismissed.
 Women are. equal under the law and in principle receive the same pay for the
 same job. Women represent roughly half of the labor force, -although they are dis-
 proportionately employed in professions where the median salary is relatively low.
 According to the director of the Public Opinion Research Institute, women's median
 wages lag behind those of men by roughly 25 percent, although the gap is narrow-
 
 
 1232
 
 ing. Women enjoy equal property, inheritance, and other rights with men. The un-
 employment rate for women now exceeds that for men by more than one-third, and
 a disproportionately small number of women hold the most senior positions.
 In 1991 the Government passed an employment law that bans discrimination on
 the basis of sex, religion, and national origin. However, in practice employers re-
 main free to consider sex, age, or even attractiveness when making hiring decisions,
 since this does not necessarily constitute "discrimination" under current legal inter-
 pretation.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its committment to children's welfare
 through its programs for health care, compulsory education through age 15 (through
 age 14 in special schools), and basic nutrition. Girls and boys enjoy equal access to
 health care and education at all levels.
 Child abuse and trafficking in children continued to receive occasional press at-
 tention. In November 1997, the members of an international pedophile ring were ap-
 prehended, and citizens of several nationalities are now in pretrial detention await-
 ing the outcome of the official investigation. Since 1990 the number of reported
 cases of child abuse roughly doubled; this increase appears to be the result of an
 increased awareness of the problem. According to a special envoy of the U.N.
 Human Rights Commission who visited in 1996, there is no evidence of a societal
 pattern of child abuse. A children's crisis center was established in 1995 and is 70-
 percent state supported. According to its director, around 1 percent of children are
 neglected, mistreated, or sexually abused, but only about one-tenth of such cases are
 registered by the police. According to NGO's, there are approximately 10,000 chil-
 dren living in institutional settings and 4,000 foster families supported by the Gov-
 ernment and various NGO's.
 Romani children are often relegated to "special schools" for the mentally disabled
 and socially maladjusted. Both a government program and various private initia-
 tives exist to prepare Romani children for mainstream schools.
 People With Disabilities.-The disabled suffer disproportionately from unemploy-
 ment, and the physically disabled experience difficulty in obtaining access to build-
 ings and public transport. Access to education also can be a problem, due to the lack
 of barrier-free access to public schools, although there is at least one barrier-free
 school in each district. Although NGO's report that access is improving, many build-
 ings and public transportation remain inaccessible to those in wheelchairs. A 1994
 Economic Ministry regulation requires architects to ensure adequate access for the
 disabled in all new building projects, as well as in older buildings undergoing res-
 toration. This regulation is applied in practice. However, the Government has not
 mandated access for the disabled to other buildings. Businesses in which 60 percent
 or more of the employees are disabled qualify for special tax breaks. Numerous
 NGO's support social assistance programs to diminish the disadvantages faced by
 the disabled. For example, in 1997 the Olga Havlova Foundation contributed more
 than $67,000 (2 million crowns) to institutions and individuals to purchase rehabili-
 tative aids and special fittings for wheelchairs not covered by insurance. These
 NGO's report that, although problems persist, the situation of the disabled is receiv-
 ing more attention and is vastly improved from only a few years ago. The integra-
 tion of the disabled into society has not been the subject of significant policy or pub-
 lic debate.
 Religious Minorities.-Religious groups with 10,000 or more adult members may
 register with the Ministry of Culture. Only registered religions are eligible for state
 subsidies. The Jewish community, which numbers only a few thousand, constitutes
 an exception, since it was recognized by the state before 1989. Smaller groups still
 lack a legal mechanism by which they may own community property, although they
 are free to assemble, worship, and publish according to their beliefs (see Section
 2.c.).
 In March skinheads attacked a Jewish couple in Trutnov. In November 41
 headstones in a Jewish cemetery in the same town were destroyed or desecrated in
 a attack by vandals; four youths under the age of 21 were arrested and charged for
 the incident. A 21-year-old suspect faces up to 3 years in prison if convicted, where-
 as three other suspects under the age of 18 face a maximum of 1/2 years in prison.
 Also in November, skinheads stabbed a Czech soldier who identified himself as Jew-
 ish when attempting to intervene in a restaurant fracas. Police confirmed the exist-
 ence of over 20 underground magazines with small circulations propagating fascism,
 racism, and anti-Semitism.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-After ethnic Slovaks, the largest minority is
 the Romani population, officially estimated to number between 200,000 and 250,000.
 Roma live throughout the country but are concentrated in the industrial towns
 along the northern border, where many eastern Slovak Roma were encouraged to
 
 
 1233
 
 settle in the homes of Sudeten Germans transferred to the West more than 40 years
 ago.
 Roma suffer disproportionately from poverty, unemployment, interethnic violence,
 discrimination, illiteracy, and disease. They are subject to deeply ingrained popular
 prejudice, as is repeatedly affirmed by public opinion polls. For example, in a July
 poll 29 percent of the respondents agreed that Roma who commit criminal offenses
 should be punished more severely than other criminals. A court case charging edi-
 tors of a Republican magazine-with publishing offensive statements against Roma
 was filed with a Prague district court in January and was pending at year's end.
 However, in the June parliamentary election the extreme rightwing Republican
 Party, whose leaders and deputies espouse virulently anti-German and anti-Romani
 policies, failed to cross the 5-percent threshold, thus failing to gain parliamentary
 representation for the first time since 1990.
 The state funds television and radio programs for Roma on public stations and
 also supports Romani press publications. During the year, more and better informa-
 tion on Romani issues was available in the mainstream press and other sources.
 However, efforts by NGO's and individuals in the health and education fields to im-
 prove living conditions for the Roma have had only minimal impact, sometimes due
 to the attitudes or intransigence of local authorities. Romani leaders themselves
 have had limited success in organizing their local communities, which are often dis-
 united and where many are reluctant to foster contacts with the majority.
 Members of skinhead organizations and their sympathizers most often perpetrate
 interethnic violence. Roma are the most likely targets of such crimes. Sixty persons
 were convicted of "racially motivated" crimes in the first 6 months of the year. A
 March report by police authorities reported over 400 cases involving "extremist' ele-
 ments between January 1996 and June 1997.
 In September two young men were convicted and sentenced to 62 and 8 2 years
 in prison for throwing a young Romani mother, Helena Bihariova, into an icy river
 in February, where she drowned. Although initially investigated as a racially moti-
 vated murder, the lead prosecutor, who cited lack of a racial motive or malicious
 criminal intent in the case, reclassified it as involuntary manslaughter. Yet another
 case occurred in the town of Orlova where Milan Lacko, a Romani father of five,
 in May was beaten by a group of skinheads and left lying in the street, where he
 was run over and killed by a truck. Three suspects were charged with a racially
 motivated crime and taken into custody, although they were later released pending
 completion of the investigation and trial. In October four persons were found guilty
 in the attack and received suspended sentences of between 15 and 22 months. The
 prosecutor plans to appeal what many consider to be surprisingly light sentences
 for this case in which the victim died. In January and February, two incidents of
 firebombing of Romani residences took place, in Krnov and Orlov respectively.
 Eleven suspects detained for terrorizing Romani residents in Domazlice in 1997
 were charged with disturbing the peace, violence against groups and individuals,
 and racial crimes. Their case was being heard before the district court in Domazlice.
 In a well-publicized retrial, several skinheads were found guilty of murder and sen-
 tenced to 8, 72, and 7 years respectively for causing the 1995 drowning death of
 a Rom named Tibor Danihel after an earlier court found them guilty only of neg-
 ligence.
 Tensions rose between Roma and law enforcement personnel during the year, re-
 sulting in a number of Romani-instigated assaults on local police officers. One po-
 liceman was seriously injured after being beaten by five unidentified Romani men
 who yelled racial slurs at him in May in Liberec. In Usti Nad Labem, a group of
 approximately 40 Roma attacked 3 city policemen responding to a report of disturb-
 ing the peace in the neighborhood. Four suspects later were convicted of assault on
 a public official, and one remains in prison. In February in Nove Mesto Pod
 Smrkem, several Roma were arrested and charged with a racially motivated crime
 after assaulting and taunting a pair of local officers patrolling the town. Local
 Romani organizations generally denounced these attacks and offered their assist-
 ance in the investigations.
 Racial and ethnic tensions and discrimination were the subject of increased media
 attention during the year. Even when federal authorities have spoken out on these
 problems, local attitudes often proved impervious to change. The most highly pub-
 licized example occurred in the city of Usti Nad Labem, where city authorities in
 May announced their intention to construct a 15-foot high wall as a "noise and hy-
 giene barrier" between a primarily Romani apartment complex and its residents'
 neighbors across the street. City spokesman Milan Knotek stated that the wall
 would separate the "decent people' from the "problematic community" of Roma.
 Both the Roma and several human rights groups described the wall as an attempt
 to create a ghetto. Following national and international protests, the city delayed
 
 
 1234
 
 the proposal and fostered community interaction to resolve the situation. By year's
 end, no construction had begun, and plans were changed to construct a lower fence,
 a new playground for neighborhood children, and new sidewalks.for all area resi-
 dents. In December President Havel paid a goodwill visit to the site and pledged
 financial resources from his wife's charity foundation for mediation by conflict reso-
 lution experts. In a strong statement condemning the construction of the wall, the
 Zeman government asked the Commissioner for Human Rights to meet with local
 officials to dissuade them from their plan, but warned that it would use all legal
 and administrative remedies to stop construction should dialogue fail.
 Roma wishing to integrate face practical difficulties in the areas of employment
 and education. A government-commissioned report estimated unemployment among
 Roma at 70 percent, with many unemployed Roma subsisting on government sup-
 port or earnings from illegal activities. Some employers refuse to hire Roma and ask
 local labor offices not to send Romani applicants for advertised positions. Many
 Roma are qualified only for low-paying jobs as manual laborers, since very few com-
 plete secondary education. A higher than average share of the Romani population
 applies for partial or full disability pensions due to the occurrence of advanced-stage
 malignant diseases resulting from the neglect of preventive health practices or the
 lack of available medical care in areas with above-average Romani populations.
 The integration of Romani children into mainstream schools is frequently impeded
 by language and cultural barriers. Official estimates indicate that less than 20 per-
 cent of the Romani population completed the ninth grade, and less than 5 percent
 completed high school. A significant number of Romani children are transferred at
 an early age to "special schools" for the mentally disabled and socially maladjusted.
 According to unofficial government estimates, Romani children make up 60 percent
 or more of pupils placed in these "special schools," although Roma comprise less
 than 3 percent of the population. Some Romani parents do not send their children
 to school regularly due to a fear of violence, the expense of books and supplies, or
 the lack of a strong cultural emphasis on education among some Roma. In May
 Romani parents in the Ostrava area protested the allegedly inadequate protection
 of the local Romani community by keeping their children home from school for sev-
 eral days, an action criticized as inappropriate by some government officials and na-
 tional Romani leaders. Some Roma refuse to cooperate with programs for the com-
 pulsory vaccination of children or are refused treatment by general practitioners
 who have full quotas of subsidized patients.
 In 1993 the government created the framework for a number of yearlong pro-
 grams (so-called zero grades) to prepare disadvantaged youths for their first year
 in school. Many districts with high concentrations of Roma participate in the pro-
 gram, which is funded solely by local authorities. Nearly 90 zero grades were open
 during the year, and another educational initiative introduced Roma "assistant
 teachers" into the primary and special school system. Their function is to help
 teachers communicate with Roma pupils and encourage cooperation between schools
 and Romani parents. There are now 62 Romani assistant teachers in the school sys-
 tem. Some districts tracking local Romani students report that up to 70 percent of
 the children who attend zero-grade training successfully enter and remain in main-
 stream schools. NGO's support additional studies and private initiatives to prepare
 Romani children for mainstream schools.
 Roma also face discrimination in housing and other areas of everyday life. Despite
 constitutional prohibitions on discrimination, a civil law framework to implement
 these provisions has not been incorporated into specific offenses under the Criminal
 Code. The Government took a positive step toward protecting the rights of Roma
 in March, when the Senate repealed a 1958 law forbidding nomadic lifestyles. Some
 restaurants, pubs, and other venues refuse service to Roma and post signs prohibit-
 ing their entry. In some cases, local authorities intervened to have such signs re-
 moved. However, in May pub owner Ivo Blahout from Rokycany was acquitted of
 refusing service in 1996 to Romani patrons in a retrial of the country's first promi-
 nent antidiscrimination case. Despite additional supporting evidence presented at
 the retrial, the regional court held that the prosecution had failed to prove that
 Blahout had committed a crime.
 Beginning in 1997, over 1,200 Roma submitted applications for refugee status in
 Canada and the United Kingdom (UK) after a national television program portrayed
 these countries as inclined to accept, and be generous toward, Romani immigrants.
 However, few asylum applicants were successful, and over 600 persons returned to
 the Czech Republic in 1998 after their asylum applications were denied. According
 to a September statement by the British Ambassador, Only 3 of 560 Romani appli-
 cants had received asylum in the UK since the summer of 1997. Nonetheless,
 Romani families continued to emigrate in 1998.

 In July the office of the Minister Without Portfolio released a report analyzing the
 efforts of the Government to improve the situation of Roma, based on proposals that
 it adopted in 1997. This report showed mixed efforts and accomplishments towards
 the goal. No progress was made in addressing the problems of Romani children leav-
 ing foster care without Czech citizenship or residency or towards creation of pro-
 grams designed specifically to deal with crime prevention and drug addiction in the
 Romani communities. Federal support (primarily monetary) for the reconstruction
 of the museum of Romani culture in Brno was counteracted by local obstructionist
 efforts of the Brno city council to prevent refurbishment of the building. However,
 a Health Ministry grant agency successfully launched a research project to collect
 data on the health problems of Roma, for whom no separate statistics previously
 were available, so that concrete proposals for organizational and preventive meas-
 ures might be made. The Labor Ministry created and filled 58 district-level positions
 (out of 81 districts nationwide) with "Roma advisors" or "Roma assistants" to aid
 local authorities on Romani issues. Eventually 20 Roma were placed in the 58 avail-
 able positions. Some Romani leaders, while conceding the difficulties in finding edu-
 cationally qualified or trained Romani applicants to fill these positions, expressed
 regret that only a third eventually were filled by Roma.
 The Interministerial Commission for Romam Affairs was created to analyze gov-
 ernment measures proposed by individual ministries, to collect information and in-
 form the Romani community about government activities, to allocate grants to sup-
 plementary programs for the Romani community, and to deal with housing, edu-
 cation, and discrimination issues. The Commission, which began operations on De-
 cember 31, 1997, has received mixed reviews. The lack of an operating budget and
 unpaid members' limited availability hampered operations. Some NGO's and
 Romani leaders credited the Commission for working on policy statements and
 pushing the Government to fill district-level Romani advisor positions with individ-
 uals of Romani descent. Others criticized the Commission for the lack of a clear,
 continuing mandate and a low level of direct communication with the Romani com-
 munities that it was created to help. In December the Commission was expanded;
 it now includes 12 government representatives and 12 Romani representatives, as
 well as the Commissioner for Human Rights and his deputy.
 The 1993 Citizenship Law, created when the Czech Republic and Slovakia split,
 is a continuing concern, despite partial remedies legislated in 1996. Under the 1993
 law Czechoslovaks of Slovak nationality ("Slovaks") were able to opt for Czech citi-
 zenship until December 1993 (later extended to June 1994) under conditions more
 favorable than those faced by non-Czechoslovaks in the normal naturalization proc-
 ess. Nonetheless, these Slovaks had to present proof of a clean criminal record for
 the previous 5 years and residency in what is now the Czech Republic for 2 years.
 Romani leaders and human rights groups protested that these provisions were de-
 signed to discriminate against Roma, most of whom were designated as being of Slo-
 yak nationality by a 1969 law. After June 1994, the Slovaks could apply only for
 naturalization, a more stringent process. The practical result of the law was that
 an unknown number of Slovaks resident in the Czech Republic at the time of the
 spit--a great many of them Roma-found themselves without Czech citizenship.
 Some failed to meet the law's requirements; others never applied, either out of neg-
 ligence or ignorance of the consequences. Many of these Roma were long-term resi-
 dents of, or born in, the Czech Republic.
 The UNHCR and the Council of Europe repeatedly have criticized the 1993 law
 for its disproportionately discriminatory impact on Roma. Without Czech citizenship
 under the law, many Roma who are long-term residents or were born in the Czech
 Republic have no right to work, vote, or receive health insurance and other social
 benefits. The 1996 amendment permitted the Interior Ministry to waive the require-
 ment for a clean criminal record and allowed several thousand Roma to obtain citi-
 zenship. By December a total of 3,956 applicants had received waivers of the clean
 criminal record requirement, 1,368 in 1998. However, thousands more await resolu-
 tion of their citizenship status. Citizenship petitions were rejected or discontinued
 in 468 cases. By October the Czech Helsinki Committee's citizenship advisory sec-
 tion still was assisting approximately 6,000 Roma to resolve their citizenship status,
 a process that can take from 6 to 9 months. Advisers estimate that anywhere from
 10,000 to 15,000 additional persons remain undocumented. One adviser cited cases
 where local authorities informed places of employment, schools, benefit offices, and
 local police when Romani applicants made citizenship applications, thereby prevent-
 ing them from receiving current benefits (or causing them to lose those they may
 have had), as well as notifying authorities that the applicants were deportable.
 By mid-year approximately 800 minor children in foster care who lack Czech citi-
 zenship or permanent residency status were registered by the Helsinki Committee
 citizenship project. The actual number is believed to be higher as only one-third of
 
 
 1236
 
 foster care facilities communicate 'such cases to the citizenship project. Typically, the
 children are ethnic Roma who formally were deemed Slovak citizens following the
 Czech-Slovak split. All noncitizen children in foster care may claim permanent resi-
 dency, but this is canceled on their release, leaving them without the benefits of citi-
 zenship or residency. Some may face deportation. Even in children's homes where
 the directors take an active interest in resolving the problem, legal expenses and
 local bureaucratic intransigence' present significant barriers. In 1997 the Interior
 Ministry cooperated with the Czech Helsinki Committee to inform the directors of
 state institutions about the harsh consequences of releasing a child with unresolved
 citizenship or permanent iesidericy status.
 Isolated incidents of violence against nonwhites continued. In March a Congolese
 doctor was beaten in Prostejov; a judge later handed down more lenient sentences
 for the attackers than the law prescribed, citing their later repentance for the crime.
 Skinheads in separate incidents in Prague metro stations in May attacked two Indi-
 ans and an Algerian. Skinheads also attacked and beat a nonwhite American in the
 Prague metro in November. In March a 19-year-old skinhead who killed a Sudanese
 student in Prague in November 1997 was sentenced to 142 years in prison.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides workers with the right to form and
 join unions of their own choice without prior authorization, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice. Union membership continued to decline in 1998.
 Most workers are members of unions affiliated with the Czech-Moravian Chamber
 of Trade Unions (CMKOS). The CMKOS is a democratically oriented, republic-wide
 umbrella organization for branch unions. It is not affiliated with any political party
 and carefully maintains its independence. ,
 Workers have the right to strike, except for those whose role in public order or
 public safety is deemed crucial. The law requires that labor disputes be subject first
 to mediation and that strikes take place only after mediation efforts fail.
 There were four strikes in the agricultural sector and one each in the education
 and transportation sectors.
 Unions are free to form or join federations and confederations and affiliate with
 and participate in international bodies. This freedom was exercised fully.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining, which is generally carried out by unions and employers on a com-
 pany basis. The scope for collective bargaining is more limited in the government
 sector, where wages are regulated by law.
 There are 11 free trade zones. Their workers have and practice the same right
 to organize and bargain collectively as other workers in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including that performed by children, and it is/not practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Agr for Employment.-The
 Labor Code stipulates a minimum working age of 15 yeafs, although children who
 completed courses at special schools (schools for the mentally-disabled and socially
 maladjusted) may work at the age of 14. These prohibitions are efforcedj: practice.
 The law prohibits forced or bonded labor by children, and the Government effec-
 tively enforces this prohibition (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.--The Government sets minimum wage stand-
 ards. In December the Government increased the minimum wage from approxi-
 mately $86 (2,650 crowns) to approximately $108 (3,250 crowns) per month. The av-
 erage is approximately $375 (11,600 crowns) per month. Average net wages are 2.1
 times as high as official sustenance costs. The minimum wage provides a sparse
 standard of living for a worker and family, although allowances are available .to
 families with children that raise the standard of living to an adequate level. Re-
 training efforts, carried out by district labor offices, seek to provide labor mobility
 for those at, the lower end of the wage scale. The enforcement of minimum wage
 standards was not an issue during the year.
 The law mandates a standard workweek of 422 hours. It also requires paid rest
 of at least 30 minutes during the standard 8- to 8 2-hour workday, as well as an-
 nual leave of 3 to 4 weeks. Overtime ordered by the employer may not exceed 150
 hours per year or 8 hours per week as a standard practice, although the local em-
 ployment office may permit overtime above this limit. The Labor Ministry enforces
 standards for working hours, rest periods, and annual leave.
 Government, unions, and employers promote worker safety and health, but condi-
 tions in some sectors of heavy industry are problematic, especially those awaiting
 privatization. Industrial accident rates are not unusually high. The Office of Labor
 Safety is responsible for enforcement of health and safety standards. Workers have
 
 
 1237
 the right to refuse work endangering their life or health without risk of loss of em-
 ployment.
