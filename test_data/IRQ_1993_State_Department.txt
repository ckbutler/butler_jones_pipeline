 lRQ*
 Political power in Iraq is concentrated in a repressive one-party apparatus under
 the domination of Saddam Hussein. The provisional Constitution of 1968 stipulates
 that the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) governs Iraq through the Revolutionary
 Command Council (RCC) which exercises both executive and legislative authority.
 Saddam Hussein wields decisive power as Chairman of the RCC, Secretary General
 of the Regional Comm'ind of the ABSP, and President of the Republic.
 Ethnically and linguistically, the Iraqi population includes Arabs     Kurds
 Turcomans, Yazidis, and Armenians. The reigious mix is likewise varied: Shi'a and
 Sunni (both Arab and Kurdish) Muslims, Christians (including Chaldeans and As-
 syrians) and Jews. Ethnic divisions have resulted in civil uprisings in recent years,
 especially in the north and south. The Government has reacted against the people
 in those areas with severely repressive measures.
 The Government's security apparatus, which includes militias attached to the
 President, the ABSP, and the Interior Ministry, has been responsible for widespread
 and systematic human rights abuses; security forces play a central role in maintain-
 ing the intimidation and fear on which government power rests.
 The Government controls Iraq's oil-based economy and owns all the major indus-
 tries. Damaged by the Gulf war and subjected to a series of U.N. sanctions as a re-
 sult of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait the economy remains in poor condition. U.N.
 sanctions ban all Iraqi exports and all imports except food, medicine, and materials
 and supplies for essential civilian needs. Iraq's failure to comply with United Na-
 tions Security Council resolutions has led to repeated Security Council extensions
 of the sanctions.
 Iraq's abysmal record on human rights did not improve in 1993. Systematic viola-
 tions of human rights continued in virtually all categories in 1993; these included
 mass executions of political opponents, widespread use of torture, extreme repres-
 sion of ethnic groups, disappearances, denial of due process, and arbitrary detention.
 Furthermore, tens of thousands of political killings and disappearances remained
 unresolved from previous years. Owing to the efforts that the Government takes to
 conceal its human rights abuses, however, it is difficult to know precisely the details
 and numbers of such practices. Citizens do not have the right to change their gov-
 ernment, and the freedoms of expression and association do not exist, except in
 Kurdish-controlled areas in the north.
 Indiscriminate military operations in the south-which included burning and
 razing of villages, emplacement of bombs in civilian areas, and the forced relocation
 of noncombatant inhabitants-were directed primarily against Shi'a Arabs living in
 the southern wetlands. In the north, the regime maintained an internal embargo
 on the importation of food, medicine, and fuel. Elsewhere, it diverted humanitarian
 supplies to its own supporters and the military. In violation of U.N. Security Council
 resolutions, the Government also continued its flagrant interference with the inter-
 national community's provision of humanitarian assistance. Relief workers were
 harrassed, intimidated, and, in some cases, killed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The Iraqi regime has a long record
 of executing perceived opponents. In 1993, as in past years, the U.N. Special
 Rapporteur expressed dismay at Iraq's liberal use of the death penalty for a full
 range of political offenses such as insulting the President or the Ba'ath Party.
 Throughout the fall of 1993, there were numerous credible reports that the regime
 had executed a number of persons (including some members of Saddam Hussein's
 family and tribe) who were allegedly involved in a coup plot against him. High-rank-
 ing civilian, military, and tribal leaders were reported among those killed.
 The Free Iraqi Council (FIC), an Iraqi oposition organization based in London,
 reported a mass execution of prisoners at the Al-Radwaniyah prison near Baghdad
 in August (see also Section 1.c.). At the end of the year this incident remained
 unconfirmed.
 As in 1992, numerous Shi'a civilians from southern Iraq reportedly were arrested
 and removed to detention centers in the central part of the country. Shi'a witnesses
 who survived arrest and detention later reported that some of their comrades had
 been executed (see also Section 1.g.).
 *Because the United States has no embassy in Iraq, this report draws to a large extent on
 non-U.S. Government sources.
 
 
 1185
 Political killings and terrorist actions also were frequent in the north and often
 were directed against civilians and third-country nationals involved in the relief ef-
 fort. Seven relief workers (one Australian, one Belgian and five local employees of
 international nongovernmental organizations) were killed, and several others were
 inured.
 in January an Assyrian delegate to the local legislature in the north was killed
 under suspicious circumstances. That same month, a car bomb in Irbil killed 11 ci-
 vilians and injured 128; regional authorities alleged that Iraqi authorities were re-
 sponsible. In January a man carrying explosives was arrested in Dohuk; while in
 the custody of the local authorities, he claimed he had been recruited by Iraqi forces
 to place the explosives in a U.N. vehicle in exchange for 200,000 Iraqi dinars. In
 many of these incidents, however, it was not possible to determine who was respon-
 sible-Iraqi agents- local Kurds who had been coerced or recruited for pay; agents
 of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Turkish-based Kurdish resistance move-
 ment; or lone perpetrators.
 In 1993 new information was developed concerning the so-called Anfal campaign
 ("Spoils" in Arabic) of 1988, in which tens of thousands of Kurds reportedly lost
 their lives. The Anfal remains the most prominent example of political killing in
 Iraq. Most of the Kurds who were initially arrested during the Anfal have never
 been seen again and are presumed to have been killed in official custody (see Sec-
 tions 1.b. and 1.g.).
 b. Disappearance.-As in previous years, Iraqis continued to disappear without
 explanation, reportedly while in the custody of government authorities. In February
 the U.N. Special Rapporteur reported that he was continuing to receive "regular and
 consistent reports on disappearances." He stated that he was in possession of the
 names of 5,000 persons whose cases had not yet been addressed by the U.N. Work-
 ing Group on Enforcement on Involuntary Disappearances. These were in addition
 to the 9,447 names that the Working Group already had transmitted to the Iraqi
 Government in prior years and another 2,000 cases that the working group is pres-
 number of disappeared persons for whom the U.N. has documentation
 (more than 16,000 cases), the Special Rapporteur noted that most date from the
 Anfal period but that 500 are as recent as 1992. Amnesty International (A) re-
 ported that it has the names of more than 17,000 Kurds who disappeared during
 the Anfal and are presumed dead. It is not clear to what extent the Amnesty Inter-
 national and U.N. records duplicate each other or represent different lists of dis-
 appeared Kurds.
 As aresult of his investigations, the Special Rapporteur stated, he had arrived
 at the conclusion that the total figure for disappeared Kurds during Anfal could
 number in the "tens of thousands." Middle East Watch places the figure at between
 50,000 and 100,000.
 In addition to the Anfal disappearances, two other examples of outstanding large-
 scale disappearances are the Barzani arrests of 1983, in which thousands of rel-
 atives and tribesmen of the late Kurdish nationalist hero Mustapha Barzani were
 rounded up and taken into custody, and the al-Khoei case of 1991, in which the late
 Grand Ayatollah Abdul Qasim al-Khoei and 108 of his associates-including Iraqis,
 Iranians, Indians, Pakistanis, Lebanese, and Bahrainis--were arrested. None of the
 Barzani detainees were ever seen again. In the al-Khoei case, the Ayatollah died
 while under house arrest in al-Najaf, and only two of the persons arrested with him
 were ever seen again.
 In 1993 AI, having received no satisfactory response to its repeated inquiries to
 the Government in regard to the al-Khoei disappearances, published a report on
 these unresolved cases, calling Iraq's response "inadequate, vague, or contradictory."
 Iraq has failed to return or account for a large number of Kuwaiti citizens and
 third-country nationals taken to Iraq during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and has
 denied any knowledge of missing persons. U.N. Security Council resolution
 (UNSCR) 687 requires Iraq to "facilitate" the search for and the repatriation of
 those still missing. In March the Government of Kuwait transmitted to the Govern-
 ment of Iraq, through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the
 case files of more than 600 persons still believed to be missing in Iraq. For the first
 time, Iraq publicized the names of the missing. However, it stated that it had no
 information indicating that the missing persons ever had been in Iraqi custody.
 Except for 15 who were reportedly executed in 1992, there has been no accounting
 for a group of 146 Iraqi Turcomans from the Kirkuk area, reported to have been
 detained since May and June 1992. A group of 19 Iraqi Army officers reportedly ar-
 rested in the summer of 1992 also have disappeared.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although Iraq is a party to international human rights conventions which abjure
 
 
 1186
 the use of torture and the Constitution forbids thepractice, torture is routinely con-
 ducted by the Iraqi security services. The Special Rapporteur reported in February,
 as he has in previous years, that the Government of raq continues to engage in
 systmatic" torture, both physical snd psychological. According to persons who have
 let Iraq after release from prison, techniques employed by the security services in-
 clude electric shocks administered to the genitals and other sensitive areas, beat-
 ings, burnings with hot irons, suspension from ceiling fans, dripping acid on the
 skin, rape, breaking of limbs, denial of food and water, and threats to rape or other-
 wise harm relatives.
 Certain prisons in Iraq have long been notorious for routine mistreatment of pris-
 oners. AI.Rashidiya prison, on the Tigris River north of Taji, reortedly contains tor-
 ture chambers in its basement. Another prison, Al-Shamma iya, located in east
 Baghdad, is reportedly the site of bth torture and disappearances.
 AI-Radwaniyah prison (see Section l.a.), a former prisoner-of-war facility near
 Baghdad, is reprtedly the site of torture and arbitrbarykillings including mass exe-
 cution by firing squad. According to Middle East Watch, A -*adwaniyah was the
 principal detention center for persons arrested following the civil uprisings of 1991.
 Many persons taken into custody in connection with the uprisings have not been
 seen since. Two executions by firing squad reportedly took place at Al-Radwaniyah
 in 1992 and another in August 1993.
 The Special Rapporteur and A' named both Al-Radwaniyah and another Baghdad
 prison, Abu Ghraib, as sites where torture and disappearances have recently oc-
 curred. Multiple executions also reportedly took place at Abu Ghraib in the fall of
 1993, in retaliation for alleged coup plots against the Government (see Section l.a.).
 onIraqi security forces are alleged to have engaged in the rape of captured civilians
 during the Anfal campaign of 1988 and the occupation of Kuwait and subsequent
 Gulf war of 1990-91. However, the Iraqi Government has never acknowledged or
 taken any action to investigate these reported crimes.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution and Legal
 Code explicitly prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, these practices are widely
 used. Inliis February 1993 report, the U.N. Special Rapporteur cited more than 100
 detention and interrogation sites, including military and security bases and such
 unconventional locales as mosques, pubic buildings, and supermarket basements.
 In his November report, the U.N. Special Rapperteur reported that approximately
 100 persons were arrested in Basra on Augt 26, ostensibly because they were
 not carrying identification papers. The Special Rapporteur also reported that the re-
 gime continued in 1993 to target Shi' clergy for arbitrary arrest and other human
 rights abuses.
 Several foreign nationals were arrested arbitrarily and held in Iraq in 1993, and
 others who were arrested in previous years remained in detention. On April 25 an
 American citizen and oil worker living in Kuwait disappeared near the Iraqi-Ku-
 waiti border and in May was charged by Iraqi authorities with illegal entry and es-
 pionage. He was tried, found guilty of illegal entry, and sentenced to 8 years in pris-
 on. Sbsequently, he was released on November 15. (See also Section i.e. for details
 of similar cases illustrating the lack of fair trial.)
 While there is currently no known polit of exiling Iraqi citizens abroad, the re-
 fusal of Iraqi authorities to allow tens of aousands of Kurds and Turcomans to re-
 turn to their homes in Kirkuk and Mosul amounts to a policy of internal exile (see
 Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Revolutionary Court system was
 abolished in 1991, the change was cosmetic. Iraq retains a bifurcated judicial sys-
 ter, encompassing distinct treatment for all cases deemed to have a security compo-
 nent and a more conventional court system to handle other charges. The President
 may override any court decision, and there are no checks on his power.
 The procedural rules appicable in the reglar (i.e., nonseurity) curt system
 theoretically provide manyasic protections. However, the regime often assigns to
 the security courts cases which, on their merits, would appear to fall under the ju-
 risdiction of the regular courts.
 The regular courts provide for investigation by police and then by an inquiry
 judge, who may refer a case to the courts or dismiss it. Trials are open to public
 view, and defendants are entitled to counsel-at government expense if the defend-
 ant is indigent. Charges and evidence are  ent    or review by counsel. Judges
 try criminal cases; the area no juries. Convictions may be appealed to the Court
 of Appeal and then to the Court of assation, Iraq's high court.
 There are no Shari'a (Islamic) courts as such in Iraq; however, family courts ad-
 minister Shari's law according to Iraqi custom.
 Special security courts have jurisdiction in all cases involving espionage and trea-
 son, peaceful political dissent, smuggling, currency exchange violations, and drug
 
 
 1187
 
 trafficking. Defendants are often held incommunicado, and confessions extracted by
 torture are admissible and often serve as the basis for conviction. In theory, verdicts
 may be appealed to the Chairman of the RCC. In practice, many cases appear to
 endin summary execution shortly after trial.
 An array of ABSP and presidential decrees defines political dissent as encompass-
 ing a wide range of activities. Persons suspected of engaging in dissent are routinely
 imprisoned without charge or trial or after trials that do not meet minimum stand-
 ards o fairness.
 Two British citizens, arrested in 1992 for illegal entry, continued to be held for
 most of 1993. They had been given prison sentences of 7 and 10 years, respectively.
 Referring to these two cases in his February report, the U.N. Special Rapporteur
 commented on the "disproportionately lengthy sentences for the crimes allegedly
 committed." In December the British prisoners were abruptly released after British
 officials interceded with President Saddam Hussein. (See also Section 1.d. for details
 of a similar case illustrating arbitrary arrest.)
 Because the Government rarely makes public acknowledgement of arrests or
 imprisonments, it is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners. Many of
 the tens of thousands of persons who have disappeared or been killed in recent
 years were originally held as political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government frequently disregards constitutional protections of the right to privacy,
 particularly in situations in which national security is deemed to be involved. Iraq
 broadly defines security offenses, and security authorities in virtually all cir-
 cumstances are exempt from the legal requirement to obtain a search warrant be-
 fore entering a suspect's home. Among the targets of such abuse in 1993 were the
 Shi'a Arabs of the southern marshes (see Section 1.g.).
 Despite constitutional safeguards for the confidentiality of mail and telegraphic
 and telephone correspondence, official telephone monitoring and censorship of pri-
 vate mail are common practice.
 Pervasive networks of informers maintained by the security services and the
 ABSP serve to deter dissident activity and instill fear of the authorities. As the U.N.
 Special Rapporteur noted in his February report, 'The networks incorporate mul-
 tiple security and intelligence services which are themselves supported by webs of
 agents and informants watching one another and ultimately accountable to the
 President alone."
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Throughout 1993, Iraqi armed forces conducted indiscriminate land-based
 attacks against the civilian population in the southern marshes. These wetlands his-
 torically have been inhabited largely by Shi'a Muslims, who have been joined in re-
 cent years by significant numbers of Iraqi army deserters and refugees from other
 areas of Iraq. As a result, the marshes have become the site of guerrilla resistance.
 The Allied no-fly zone over southern Iraq, imposed in 1992, continued in 1993 to
 protect the Shi a marsh dwellers from attacks by Iraqi helicopter gunships and
 fixed-wing aircraft. In defiance of the no-fly zone, Iraqi forces in 1993 stepped up
 their use of land-based artillery to shell marsh villages.
 In January a number of villages in the Al-Amarah marshes were reported burned
 to the ground. In April opposition sources reported that government forces had
 killed some inhabitants and burned homes in two villages in Maysan governorate
 and had removed survivors to other locations. In June, according to the U.N. Special
 Rapporteur, civilian settlements in the Al-Hammar marshes were subjected to a 4-
 day bombardment, followed by a razing of their homes by armored vehicles and
 tanks. In August opposition sources reported attacks on the village of Al-Ksara in
 the Al-Aziz region of Maysan governorate. Many of these attacks appeared targeted
 at unarmed civilian populations, particularly suspected opposition sympathizers.
 Many civilians were killed or wounded, and an estimated 6,500 refugees fled to
 Iran, where they joined between 50,000 and 60,000 who had fled in previous years.
 Iraqi government efforts to divert water sources and drain the marshes made con-
 siderable headway in 1993. The U.N. Special Rapporteur as well as various human
 rights groups have reported that, as the marshlands dry, Iraqi military units are
 able to advance their land-based attacks on villages. In his November report to the
 U.N. General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur stated that he had viewed aerial
 and satellite photography confirming the destruction of numerous villages in the
 marshes. In March the European Parliament (EP) passed a resolution characteriz-
 ing the Baghdad leadership as "seeking the destruction of the marsh Arabs of south-
 ern Iraq" through the "systematic poisoning of water, the indiscriminate shelling of
 civilians, and the destruction of the resources and environment of the people by
 draining the marshes."
 
 
 1188
 In 1993 a team of Middle East Watch and US. Government researchers discov-
 ered, in a cache of Iraqi government documents seized 2 years earlier by the Kurds,
 a 1989 Iraqi plan to destroy the marshlands and the people living there. The plan
 *ppears to have been a proved at the highest levels of the Government. Mimster
 of Defense All Hassan Al- Majid, the same military leader who supervised the Anfal
 campaign in 1988, is now charged with directing the Government's so-called devel-
 opment plan for the marshes. The U.N. Special Rapporteur has noted the similarity
 between the genocide-type operations" directed against the Kurds and the oper-
 ations currently being conducted in the south. He concluded that "persons in the
 highest echelons of Government hold special and individual responsibility for a large
 number of the violations" and that "international law would not afford immunities."
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur also reported that he continued to receive detailed
 accounts of the discovery of mass graves in southern Iraq, which are thought to con-
 tain the bodies of persons killed following the post-Gulf war civil uprising of March
 1991. None of these reported grave sites have yet been investigated. However, foren-
 sic information obtained from mass grave sites in northern Iraq by forensic special-
 ists in 1992 was released in 1993; investigators found the remains of hundreds of
 persons presumed killed in the Anfal campaign carried out in 1988 by Iraqi military
 and security forces under the leadership of Ali Hassan Al-Majid. In April a new
 mass grave, containing up to 1,500 bodies, was found in Irbil in northern Iraq, and
 another grave with up to 100 bodies was found nearby. As of the end of the year,
 these graves had not been examined by forensic specialists.
 Based on forensic evidence obtained from previously examined graves and exten-
 sive documentation that the Kurds seized from Iraqi government offices during the
 civil uprisings of 1991, Middle East Watch and Physicians for Human Rights now
 estimate that between 50,000 and 100,000 Kurds were killed and up to 4,000 vil-
 lages may have been destroyed during the Anfal campaign. These human rights
 groups have built a substantial body of evidence suggesting that Iraqi government
 efforts to eliminate Iraqi Kurdish communities were widespread, systematically
 planned, and ruthlessly implemented.
 In northern Iraq, Operation Provide Comfort-the joint U.S., British, French, and
 Turkish command-continued in 1993 to inhibit attacks from the air on the inhab-
 itants of the region. However, the Iraqi military forces continued intermittent, some-
 times heavy shelling of northern villages by long-range artillery. The village of Al-
 Shariye was shelled every night for a week in late September. Also in September,
 one person was killed and two were wounded during shelling attacks on Taqtaq,
 near As Sulaymaniyah. In May Iraqi soldiers reportedly entered the security zone,
 firing on the town of Awaina, located about 10 kilometers inside the zone. Artillery
 sheling and bombardments reportedly preceded the attacks.
 Attacks on humaitaian relief efforts in northern Iraq ontinued throughout
 1993. In the winter and the spring, convoy trucks carrying relief supplies occasion-
 ally were destroyed by bombs as they crossed through Iraqi-controlled territory. In
 June and July, two U.N. guard oices were attacked four U.N. vehicles were
 bombed, and a motorcyclist threw grenades onto loaded convoy trucks. Later in the
 summer, attacks aginst nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) appeared to accel-
 erate. In one incident an NGO convoy was attacked by rocket-propelled grenades,
 leaving one relief worker critically injured. In another a bomb exploded on a Turk-
 ish truck carrying U.N.-consigned medicines. In December a bomb exploded in the
 offices of a Belgian NGO, killing two local employees. Some of these incidents point-
 ed to involvement by the Iraqi authorities; in others, it was impossible to determine
 who was responsible.
 Innocent civilians were killed occasionally in fighting between Kurdish guerilla
 forces and armed forces of the Kurdish Islamist League, a pro-Iranian party. In late
 December 72 persons were reported killed and 250 wounded in such clashes in Irbil
 and As Sulaymaniyah.
 Civilians also were the occasional victims of armed raids by the Government of
 Turkey, which conducted counterterrorism operations along the Iraqi-Turkish bor-
 der against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party). Relief workers reported that at
 least two women and seven children were killed in a Turkish raid near the northern
 town of Barzan on November 29. The Government of Turkey says Iraqi civilian
 deaths were unintended.
 The Kurdish population along the Iranian border suffered from Iranian shelling
 of civilian villages, as well as from sporadic Iranian military incursions into Iraqi
 territory.
 Innocent civilians continued to be killed or maimed by exploding landmines in
 northern Iraq. Many of the mines were originally set to deter Iranian forces during
 the Iran-Iraq war. However, the Iraqi army failed to clear the mines after that war
 ended in 1988 and before it withdrew from the north in 1991. The mines appear
 
 
 1189
 to have been haphazardly planted in civilian areas. The U.N. Special Rapporteur
 has repeatedly reminded the Iraqi Government of its obligations under the Land
 Mines Protocol, to which Iraq is a party, to protect civilians from the effects of
 mines.
 The U.S. Government in 1993 released to the U.N. Security Council a document,
 based on interviews with victims and eyewitnesses, charging that the Iraqi regime
 engaged in war crimes (willful killing, torture, rape, pillage, hostage taking, unlaw-
 ful deportation, and related acts) immediately prior to and during the 1991 Gulf
 war. The United States urged the Security Council to create a commission of inquiry
 to examine possible war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocidal actions per-
 petrated by the Iraqi Government.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and of the press do not exist
 in areas under Baghdad's control and political dissent is not tolerated in those
 areas. The Government and the ABSP own all print and broadcast media and oper-
 ate them as propaganda outlets for the regime. Opposition views are not reported.
 The Government periodically attempts to jam news broadcasts from outside Iraq
 (e.g., the Voice of America, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and radio stations
 maintained by Iraqi opposition groups in neighboring countries).
 In the northern security zone, which is protected by international forces and is
 administered by a local de facto government, several newspapers have appeared
 over the past2 years, as have opposition radio and television broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Except in northern areas
 under the protection of international forces, Iraqi citizens may not legally assemble
 or organize for any political purpose other than to support the regime. Two organi-
 zations, the Communist Party and al-Da'wa al-Islamiya ("Call of Islam") are out-
 lawed; membership in either is a capital offense. Though Iraqi authorities insist
 that the penalty has never been invoked i-i such cases, the Special Rapporteur has
 reported in previous years that persons have been executed for membership in these
 groups. No new cases were reported in 1993.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is circumscribed. The Government
 closely regulates and monitors Islamic affairs under a 1981 law giving the Ministry
 of Endowments and Religious Affairs authority over places of worship, appointment
 of clergy, publication of religious literature, and participation in religious councils
 and meetings.
 Although Shi'a Arabs (constituting between 55 and 60 percent of the population)
 are the largest ethnoreligious group, Sunni Arabs, who comprise only about 12 to
 15 percent of the population, have traditionally dominated Iraq economic and politi-
 cal life. Despite legal guarantees of sectarian equality, the Government has in re-
 cent years engaged in a succession of actions directed at the clergy and followers
 of the Shi'ite faith. Attacks on the Shi'a of the southern marshes in 1993 were gre-
 ceded by the Government's harsh response to the spring uprising of 1991, in w ich
 government forces damaged or totally destroyed Shi'a mosques, holy sites, libraries,
 and archives. Iraqi security forces in 1993 were still encamped in the shrine to
 Imam Ali at AI-Najaf, one of Shi'a Islam's holiest sites. There were credible reports
 that the security forces' desecration of the shrine included using it as an interroga-
 tion center. Also in 1993, security forces reportedly expelled foreign clerics from Al-
 Najaf, under the pretext that the clerics' visas had expired.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur in 1993 cited the following continued abuses of reli-
 gious rights by the Government: a ban on the call to prayer in certain cities, includ-
 ing Samara and Balad; a ban on the broadcast of Shi's programs on government
 radio or television; a ban on the publication of Shi'a books, even prayer books; and
 the prohibition of certain processions and public meetings commemorating Shi'a
 holy days. Moreover, the Government also intervened, through coercion, in the selec-
 tion of a replacement for the late Grand Ayatollah Abul Qasim al-Khoei, who had
 died in government custody in 1992 (see Section 1.b.). Late in the year, the Govern-
 ment a ppointed al-Khoei's successor.
 The Government has been less intrusive into the religious affairs of Iraq's Chris-
 tians-a small community of approximately 300,000. Their freedom of worship in
 churches of estabished denominations is leg[ally protected, but they may not pros-
 elytize or hold meetings outside church prmises.
 The Jewish community-which at its height following World War II was esti-
 mated at 150,000 persons-has almost totally disappeared. Only a few hundred re-
 main, nearly all in Baghdad. There is no recent evidence of overt persecution of
 Jews, but the regime restricts contact with Jewish groups abroad.
 Iraqi law does not imposes penalties for conversion from one religion to another.
 Muslims who convert may suffer a social stigma, however.
 
 
 1190
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government maintains close control over the movement of both
 citizens and foreigners. Within the country, sensitive border areas and numerous
 designated securiy zones are off-limits to all travelers; persons who either delib-
 erately or inadvertently stray into prohibited areas are immediately arrested (see
 Section 1.d.). Police checkpoints canbe found on highways and outside major towns.
 All citizens are presently limited to two trips outside Iraq annually, and some citi-
 zens reportedly are prohibited from international travel. Women are prohibited from
 traveling outside Iraq alone.
 There are no emigration restrictions for members of minority groups, although
 emigrants often must leave behind substantial property because of the difficulty of
 exporting assets. Currency exchange violations are considered security offenses, and
 penalties can be severe. In May the Government announced that such violations re-
 suiting in devaluation of the national currency are punishable by death.
 The Government continued to pursue its discriminatory resettlement policies, in-
 cluding demolition of villages andforced relocations. In May the Iraqi security serv-
 ice in Mosul ordered Kurdish residents to leave voluntarily within 30 days to central
 and southern Iraq or face deportation to Kurdish-controlled areas. Subsequently
 Kurdish families were reportedly required to register at security checkpoints. By
 late December, approximately 30 Kurdish families (200 persons), reportedly fearing
 expulsion by the Iraqi Government, had fled their homes in the Mosul area and had
 crossed into the Kurdish-controlled zone.
 The Government continued in 1993 to offer pecuniary inducements to Arab fami-
 lies from central Iraq to resettle in the north. However, the Government's resettle-
 ment policies were directed primarily at residents of the south. The Special
 Rapporteur noted in his November report that he had interviewed numerous wit-
 nesses who testified that marsh Shi'a arrested during the course of military oper-
 ations are regularly taken to the main southern cities and then transferred to deten-
 tion centers and prisons in central Iraq, primarily in Baghdad.
 It is estimated that more than 6,500 Shi'a refugees, most of whom had been dis-
 placed from their homes in the southern marshes by the draining of the marshes
 and indiscriminate shelling and burning operations of the Iraqi army, fled into Iran
 during the summer of 1993. According to some estimates, up to 40,000 other persons
 are still in imminent danger in the marshes (see also Section L.a.).
 Several tens of thousands of some 1.5. million refugees who fled the country in
 the wake of the re gme's bloody suppression of the civil uprising of 1991 remained
 abroad, mainly in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Turkey; lesser numbers are in Jor-
 dan and Kuwait. Of the 1991 refugees, approximatel 45,000 are in Iran, 23,000 in
 Saudi Arabia, 6,500 in Syria, and 4,000 in Turkey. Also still in Turkey are approxi-
 mately 5,300 Kurdish refugees who fled northern Iraq during the Anfal campaign
 of 1988, in the wake of chemical weapons attacks on their villages.
 The great majority of the refugees who fled in 1991, particularly the Kurds, repa-
 triated themselves either to the area of northern Iraq, over which the allies have
 proscribed overflights by Iraqi aircraft, or to other areas not under government con-
 trol. However, several hundred thousand Kurds who returned to Iraq still were un-
 able to go back to their former homes in Iraqi-controlled territory.
 Iraqi students abroad who refuse to return to Iraq are required to reimburse the
 Government for education received at government expense, whether in Iraq or
 abroad. Each student wishing to travel abroad must provide a guarantor. The guar-
 antor and the student's parents may be held liable if the student fails to return.
 The Government also requires employees leaving government jobs before 20 years
 of service to reimburse the State for the cost of their education provided at govern-
 ment expense. Amounts due can be recovered by confiscation, and nonpayment may
 result in imprisonment of family members.
 Non-Iraqi spouses of Iraqi citizens who have resided in Iraq for 5 years must take
 Iraqi nationality or leave the country. Naturalization is required after 1 year for the
 spouses of Iraqi citizens employed in government offices. Many foreigners have thus
 been obliged to accept Iraqi citizenship and become subject to official travel restric-
 tions. The penalties for noncompliance include loss of job, a substantial financial
 penalty, and repayment of the costs of education.
 Iraq does -aot recognize the concept of dual nationality. Many Iraqi "dual nation-
 als," especially the children of Iraqi fathers and mothers of non-Iraqi birth, have
 been denied permission to leave Iraq to vizit the country of their other nationality.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Iraqi citizens do not have the right to change their government. Only in the Kurd-
 ish-controlled region in northern Iraq have free and open local elections been held.
 
 
 1191
 
 Full political participation at the national level is confined to members of the Ba'ath
 Party (ABSP) estimated to number 1V2 million, or about 8 percent of the popu-
 lation. The ABSP governs the country under the provisional Constitution of 1968,
 and legislative and executive authority is vested in the RCC. The National Assembly
 is completely subordinate to the executive branch. General elections were last held
 for the 250-seat National Assembly in April 1989.
 Saddarn Hussein continues to wield decisive power over all instruments of govern-
 ment. He is President of the Republic, Chairman of the RCC, and Secretary General
 of the Regional (ie., raq-wide) Command of the ABSP. A personal or tribal relation-
 ship with Saddam Hussein is much more important for political advancement than
 is ABSF membership or ideological affiliation. Almost all of Iraq's most powerful of-
 ficials are either members of the President's family or long-time family allies from
 his home town of Tikrit. Although ABSP membership is not required for appoint-
 ment to senior military or government positions or election to the National Assem-
 bly it can be a powerful aid in attaining political influence.
 pposition political organizations are illegal and severely suppressed. Member-
 ship i the Communist Party is punishable by death (see Section 2.b.). In 1991 the
 RCC adopted a law theoretically authorizing the creation of political parties other
 than the ABSP. In fact, the law merely reinforced the preeminent position of the
 ABSP by prohibiting parties that do not support Saddam Hussein and the present
 Government. New parties must be based in Baghdad and are forbidden to have any
 ethnic or religious character.
 The Government does not recognize the various political grou ings and parties
 that have been formed among natural opposition constituencies-the Shi'a of south-
 ern Iraq and the Kurdish, Assyrian, and Turcoman communities in the north. These
 political groups continued to thrive notwithstanding their illegal status.
 A unique political situation exists ini northern Iraq, where since 1991 all govern-
 ment functions have been performed by local administrators, mainly Kurds. Follow-
 ing the March 1991 uprising, the Ira9i national administrators pulled out of north-
 ern Iraq. Local civil servants stepped in to fill the vacuum. In May 1992, local politi-
 cal parties participated in elections to choose assembly representatives and de facto
 government administrators, who manage the affairs of the security zone-which is
 protected by allied military forces--and adjacent liberated areas.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In 1993 the Government continued to deny allegations of human rights violations.
 It also refused to cooperate in the investigation of alleged violations. The one au-
 thorized human rights group in Iraq operates under official control and routinely
 corroborates official denials of violations. The Government did not allow the Special
 Rapporteur to visit in 1993 and objected to his recommendation that human rights
 monitors be stationed throughout Iraq. In March the U.N. Human Rights Commis-
 sion called on the U.N. Secretary General to send human rights monitors to "help
 in the independent verification of reports on the human rights situation in Iraq.
 In December the U.N. General Assembly endorsed the request of the Human Rights
 Commission for monitors for Iraq.
 Iraq has failed to comply with the provision of UNSCR 688 insisting that Iraq af-
 ford immediate, unrestricted access by humanitarian workers to all those in need
 of assistance in all parts of Iraq. In 1993 various organs within the U.N. system-
 the U.N. Human Rights Commission, the U.N. Subcommission on Prevention of Dis-
 crimination and Protection of Minorities, and the U.N. General Assembly-ado ted
 resolutions condemning the human rights violations of the Iraqi regime. These bod-
 ies also called for the Iraqi Government to allow the U.N. Special Rapporteur to
 visit the southern region to interview refugees. Iraq has refused to give access to
 the Special Rapporteur. Throughout 1993, the Government threatened, harassed,
 and assaulted employees of the United Nations and nongovernmental organizations
 (see Section 1.g.). The U.N. guard contingent-which protects U.N. personnel and
 operations--operated under severely reduced staffing in 1993, following the Govern-
 ment's refusal in 1992 to allow new guards into the country.
 The regime has refused to renew its Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with
 the United Nations on U.N. operations in Iraq. The United Nations has informed
 Iraq that the terms of the previous MOU are still operative and that the Govern-
 ment must comply with them. Nonetheless, the Government persisted in violating
 UNSCR 688 by interfering with the international community's provision of humani-
 tarian assistance to the Iraqi people (see Section 1.g.).
 In October the Government definitively refused to implement the provisions of
 UNSCR's 706 and 712, which would allow Iraq to sell oil and purchase humani-
 tarian goods, the equitable distribution of which the United Nations would monitor.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Government claims that it is committed to equality for women, who
 make up about 20 percent of the Iraqi work force. Laws have been enacted to pro-
 tect women from exploitation in the workplace and from sexual harassment; to per-
 mit women to join the regular army, Popular Army, and police forces; to require
 education for female children; and to equalize women's rights in divorce, land own-
 ership, taxation, suffrage, and election to the National Assembly. It is difficult to
 determine to what extent these protections are afforded in practice.
 Familial violence against women, such as wife beating and rape, is known to
 occur, but little is known about its extent. Such abuse is customarily addressed
 within the tightly knit Iraqi family structure. There is no public discussion of the
 subject, and there are no official statistics. Excessive violence against women is
 grounds for divorce and criminal charges, but suits brought on these charges are
 believed to be rare.
 Continuing analysis of documents and testimony concerning the Anfal campaign
 of 1988 indicate that many women and children, including infants, were killed by
 firing squad and in chemical attacks during that operation and that many more re-
 main unaccounted for.
 rhildren.-No information is available on whether the Government has enacted
 specific legislation to promote the welfare of children. However, the U.N. Special
 aRapporteur and various human rights organization have collected a substantial
 body of evidence pointing to the Iraqi Government's continuing disregard for the
 rights and welfare of children.
 The Government of Iraq's failure to comply with the terms of U.N. resolutions has
 led to a continuation of economic sanctions against Iraq. As a result, general eco-
 nomic and health conditions throughout Iraq have deteriorated seriously. Children
 have been particularly susceptible to the decline in the standard of living; increases
 in child mortality and disease rates have been reported.
 Under these circumstances, the Special Rapporteur observes, the Government of
 Iraq has special obligations to "take steps to the maximum of its resources" to en-
 sure that the most vulnerable groups in the population have adequate food and
 health care. The Special Rapporteur stated in his November report that Iraq's ongo-
 ing refusal to implement U.N. Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 (which
 would permit a one-time sale of oil in order to finance the import of humanitarian
 goods), has had an adverse effect on vulnerable populations, including children. The
 Special Ralprteur noted: "The Government's failure to act (regarding 706 and 712)
 bears heavily upon those in need and no doubt accounts for a significant portion of
 the large increases in mortality rates."
 The Special Rapporteur further reported that the Government's policy of diverting
 humanitarian aid to its own supporters also deprived vulnerable groups, including
 children, of essential food and medicines.
 Finally, the Special Rapporteur observed in his November report that the ongoing
 bombardment of civilian settlements in the southern marshes has resulted in the
 "deaths of large numbers of innocent persons, including women, children, and the
 elderly." The Special Rapporteur stated that he had interviewed numerous orphans
 who had survived military attacks which had killed their parents.
 National /Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-The striking cultural, religious, and linguis-
 tic diversity of Iraqi society is not reflected in the country's political and economic
 structure. Sunni Arabs, who constitute only about 12 to 15 percent of the country's
 population, have effectively controlled Iraq since independence in 1932. Shi'a Arabs,
 who make up 55 to 60 percent of the population and live mainly in the Baghdad
 area and the south, have long been economically, politically, and socially disadvan-
 taged. Like the Sunni Kurds of the north, the Shi'a Arabs of the south have been
 targeted forparticular discrimination and abuse, ostensibly because of their opposi-
 tion to the Government. Actions against the Shi'a have included large-scale forced
 resettlement and closure and destruction of Shi'a institutions (see also Section 2.c.).
 In the southern marshes, the traditional way of life of the Shi'a-fishing, herding
 water buffalo, cultivating rice, and selling hand-made reed mats-has al but been
 destroyed by ongoing military operations. Credible reports describe a continuing
 process of large-scale environmental destruction in the marshes caused by the Gov-
 ernment's burning, draining, and water-diversion projects. The army has con-
 structed canals, causeways, and earthen berms to divert water from the wetlands.
 Hundreds of square kilometers of marsh areas have been burned, imperiling the
 marshes' fragile ecosystem. The Government claims the marshes are being drained
 as part of a land-reclamation plan that will increase acreage of arable land, spur
 agricultural production, and reduce salt pollution in the Tigris and Euphrates riv-
 ers. However, the evidence of large-scale humanitarian and ecological destruction
 
 
 1193
 appears to belie the Iraqi claim. The destruction also has alarmed many in the
 international human rights community, including the U.N. Special Rapporteur, who
 filed a special report on the situation in the marshes in November.
 fraq's-Kurds, who make up between 20 and 25 percent of the population, histori-
 cally have suffered political and economic discrimination, despite the token presence
 of a small number in the national Government (see Sections fa., l.b and 1.g.).
 The outstanding current example of discrimination against the kurds and the
 Shi'a is the Government's ongoing embargo on the north and the diversion of basic
 supplies in the south, primarily to supporters of the regime. The total blockade of
 the north includes humanitarian necessities such as food, medicine, and fuel. Since
 August the embargo against the north also has included massive electric power cut-
 offs in specific areas, causing spoilage of medicines, breakdowns in local water-pu ri-
 fication systems, and loss of certain hospital services. A disaster was averted only
 by the prompt action of the United Nations and donor governments, who imported
 and installed temporary generators to alleviate the crisis.
 The repressive diversion of supplies in the south-combined with the military
 burning and razing operations (see Sections L.a. and 2.d.)-has limited the popu-
 lation's access to food medicine, drinking water, and transportation.
 Citizens considered to be of Iranian origin must carry special identification and
 are often precluded from desirable employment.
 People with Disabilities.-No information is available on the Government's efforts
 to assist people with disabilities or to indicate whether it has enacted legislation or
 otherwise mandated provision of accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although Iraq is a party to the 1919 Constitution
 of the International Labor Organization (ILO), which guarantees the freedom of as-
 sociation, trade unions independent of government control do not exist in Iraq. The
 Trade Union Organization Law of June 2, 1987, prescribes a monolithic trade union
 structure for organized labor.
 Workers in private and mixed enterprises and cooperatives-but not public em-
 ployees or workers in state enterprises-have the right to join local union commit-
 tees. The committees are linked to trade unions, which in turn are part ofprovincial
 trade union federations. At the top is a single umbrella organization, the Iraqi Gen-
 eral Federation of Trade Unions, which is linked to the Ba ath Party and is utilized
 to promote arty principles and policies among union members. The General Fed-
 eration is affiliated with the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and
 the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Union members have not been systematically targeted for human rights abuses.
 The right to strike is heavily circumscribed by the Labor Law of 1987, and no
 strike has been reported over the past two decades.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively is not recognized. Salaries for public sector workers (i.e., the bulk of the em-
 ployed) are set by the Government. Wages in the much smaller private sector are
 set by employers or negotiated individually with workers.
 The Labor Code does not protect workers from antiunion discrimination a failure
 that has been criticized repeatedly by the ILO's Committee of Experts. here are
 no export processing zones in Iraq.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Compulsory labor is theoretically
 prohibited by law. However, Iraq s Penal Code allows prison sentences--including
 compulsory labor-for civil servants and employees of state enterprises accused of
 breaches of labor discipline such as resignation from the job. According to ILO
 commitee reports, foreign workers in Iraq have been prevented from terminating
 their employment to return home because of government-imposed penal sanctions
 on persons who do so,
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under age
 14 is legally forbidden except in small-scale family enterprises. Children are never-
 theless frequently encouraged to work as necessary to support their families. The
 law stipulates that employees between the ages of 14 and 18 work fewer hours per
 week than adults.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The workweek in urban areas is 6 days, 7 to
 8 hours per day, for workers in the private and mixed sectors. These provisions do
 not apply to agrcultural workers, whose workweek and workday vary according to
 individual employer-employee agreements. Hours for government employees are set
 by the head of each ministry.
 Occupational safety programs are in effect in state-run enterprises, and inspectors
 theoretically make periodic inspections of private establishments. Enforcement var-
 ies widely.
