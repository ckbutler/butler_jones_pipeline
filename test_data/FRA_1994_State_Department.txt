 FRANCE
 France is a democratic republic with constitutional provisions for human rights,
 a directly elected president and parliament, and an independent judiciary.
 The military and security apparatus consists of the three traditional military
 services, a gendarmerie (national police and paramilitary force), and municipal po-
 lice forces in major cities. All are under effective government control. France's high-
 ly developed and diversified economy is primarily market-based.
 The Constitution extensively provides for human rights, and the Government has
 a good record of investigating and prosecuting violations of these provisions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajfudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings. A police officer who in 1993 was charged with involun-
 tary manslaughter for shooting a robbery suspect in the course of an arrest received
 in 1994 a suspended 1-year prison sentence. Still under investigation at year's end
 were two other 1993 cases of police use of force that resulted in death, and two 1994
 cases.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such treatment or punishment. While isolated instances of police
 misconduct have occurred, there is no evidence of a pattern of such abuses or that
 the investigation of such cases is routinely delayed or left incomplete.
 In November a police officer who was charged with assault and battery against
 a doctor from the Central African Republic was found innocent; the case is under
 apdrbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for freedom from arbi-
 trary arrest and imprisonment, and the Government fully respects this. Police must
 refer arrests to a magistrate within 4 days, or 2 days for drug and terrorism cases.
 Pretrial confinement is very rare. For misdemeanors other than some narcotics of-
 fenses, it normally is limited to 4 months, but in certain circumstances it can be
 extended by about 8 to 12 months.
 In August, after terrorists assassinated 5 French officials in Algeria, French police
 detained 26 resident non-French Muslims suspected of supporting Algerian terror-
 ists. The 26 were held several weeks before 20 were deported to Burkino Faso.
 French human rights groups argued that the detainees' constitutional rights were
 violated in that: they were never charged with a crime; they were not permitted to
 remain in their own place of residence; and those deported were not given a hearing.
 The Government asserts that the 26 presented an imminent danger to public order
 and security, and that it therefore acted within the law. At least seven deportees
 appealed to the administrative courts; by year's end a court overturned one deporta-
 tion order, involving several defendants, but the Government appealed this. The
 other cases await decision.
 For narcotics smuggling convictions the courts commonly assess not only a jail
 sentence but also a "customs fine" based on the contraband's estimated value, which
 
 
 811
 usually exceeds by far any financial assets of the convicted smuggler. Upon conclu-
 sion of the jail sentence, the prisoner is not released until the fmne is paid. Most
 prisoners cannot pay it, and so are further detained for up to 2 years-the period
 is determined by customs officials who, for as long as seems worthwhile, attempt
 to obtain the largest possible partial settlement from the detained prisoner and his
 or her family.
 There are no provisions for exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for the right to fair public trial,
 and the authorities respect this.
 Trials are normally public, although the defense can request a closed proceeding.
 All felonies are tried before juries. The press has free access to records of court pro-
 ceedings, although the prosecutor may not disclose information about cases being
 tried or investigated.
 The law provides for the right of appeal for those convicted of misdemeanors.
 Those convicted of felonies may appeal only on procedural grounds.
 France has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-French
 law provides for freedom from invasion of privacy, and the authorities respect this.
 Police must obtain a judicial warrant in order to search a private residence, except
 when responding to a crime in progress. They can conduct such a search only be-
 tween 6 am. and 9 p.m., except in special circumstances such as a crime in progress
 or a drug case. Telephone conversations may be monitored only under a court order
 in conjunction with criminal proceedings, except in national security cases.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and
 press, and the Government generally respects this. However, in August, following
 the terrorist murders of French citizens in Algria, it banned the distribution of five
 Middle Eastern-oriented publications, contending that they encouraged terrorism. It
 has also banned distribution of a skinhead publication, on the grounds that it pro-
 moted racist and lanti-Semitic violence. These bans remained in effect through
 year's end, with no reported protests of them.
 There are three state-owned and three private television networks, in addition to
 private cable channels. Hundreds of private radio stations also offer uncensored pro-
 gramming.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peacefud Assembly and Association.-The Government does not arbi-
 trarily restrict peaceful assembly or association. Sponsors of public events must give
 advance notification to local authorities, who normally raise no objection. A denial
 of permission can be appealed to the highest administrative court (the Council of
 State).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for separation of church and state, and
 the Government respects this. In 1989 the highest administrative court ruled that
 the "ostentatious" wearing of headscarves by Muslim female students violated a law
 prohibiting proselytizing mn schools. Afer much media attention-mainly unfavor-
 able--to the wearing of such headscarves, in September 1994 the Ministry of Edu-
 cation issued a directive that prohibits the wearing of "ostentatious political and re-
 ligious symbols" in schools. This does not specifyr the 'symbols" in question, and it
 leaves school administrators with considerable authority to do so. Reportedly, au-
 thorities in various schools subsequently invoked this directive to keep out a total
 of about 80 students wearing such scarves (while several hundred others continue
 to wear them in school). Some Muslims and Jews are protesting the measure.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation-The law provides for freedom of int rnal movement, foreign travel, emi-
 gration, and repatriation, and the Government does not hamper these rights. The
 Government participates closely with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
 assisting refugees to settle in France or elsewhere.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right and ability to change their government through periodic
 free and fair elections, with universal adult suffrage and secret balloting. They also
 occasionally exereise this right through national referendums on amendments to the
 Constitution.
 The citizens of the collective territry" of Mayott and the territories of French
 Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia determine their legal and politi-
 cal relationships to France by means of referendums, and they elect deputies and
 senators to the French Parliament.
 
 
 812
 Presidential elections by direct popular vote are conducted every 7 years. Rep-
 resentatives to the National Assembly, the lower chamber of Parliament, are di-
 rectly elected every 5 years, unless the Government is dissolved sooner. Senators
 are elected indirectly, by an electoral college for 9-year terms; elections for one-
 third of this chamber are held every 3 years. he President selects the Prime Min-
 ister from the party or coalition that has the parliamentary majority.
 There are no restrictions in law on the participation of women in politics or gov-
 ernment, but they remain significantly underrepresented in public offices, especially
 at the national level. In 1994, their numbers were 3 of 30 members of the Cabinet,
 17 of 321 Senators, and 34 of 577 deputies in the National Assembly. Some parties
 have established quotas for women on electoral lists or in party management.
 Section 4. Goveramental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of local and international human rights organizations operate free-
 ly in France. The French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights
 (NCCHR)-which has nongovernment as well as government members-monitors
 complaints and advises the Government on policies and legislation. It is an inde-
 pendent body within the Office of the Prime Minister.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Statutes ban discrimination based on race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or po-
 litical opinion. In March the Parliament amended the Penal Code to increase prison
 terms and fines for persons found guilty of discriminating on the basis of race, ori-
 gin, religion, or appearance, or of desecrating grave sites of a specific ethnic, reli-
 gious, national, or racial group; also, to make organizations as well as individuals
 liable to charges of discrimination, and to broaden the definition of crimes against
 humanity.
 Women.-The Penal Code prohibits abuse as well as violence against women, and
 specifically criminalizes wife beating. Amendments in March upgraded the crime
 from a misdemeanor to a felony. The penalty for rape ranges from 15 years to life
 in prison, with no differentiation between spousal and other rape. Some 13,000 inci-
 dents of wife beating were reported to police in 1990 (latest data). Most of the re-
 ported assaults on women-54 perent-were committed by spouses, and most of the
 rest by other male partners. About 60 private associations help battered women.
 The Government offers shelter, counseling, and financial assistance, and operates a
 telephone hot-line.
 While the law requires that women receive equal pay for equal work, this is often
 not the reality. Among professionals and managers, the mean discrepancy between
 wages of women and of men in comparable positions was 29.4 percent in 1993 (lat-
 est data), a slight improvement from 31 percent in 1986. In 1993 the pay gap among
 white-collar employees was 11.4 percent (in 1986, 18 percent), and 17 percent
 among    skilled  blue-collar  workers  (in  1986, 24  percent). Women     are
 underrepresented in the senior ranks of government service (they constituted 12
 percent in 1990-latest data) and industry. In 1987 the Government initiated a pro-
 gram to help women enter professions previously dominated by men. It reimburses
 a participating firm for up to 50 percent of a trainee's educational and other ex-
 penses. In 1993 (latest data), 119 women entered this program.
 Children.-There are strict laws against child abuse, particularly when committed
 by a parent or guardian. In 1993 (atest data) there were 6,500 cases of physical
 violence against children. Another 6,000 children were victims of mental cruelty or
 severe negligence. Special sections of the national police and judiciary are charged
 with handling these cases. The Government provides counseling, financial aid, foster
 homes, and orphanages, depending on the extent of the problem. Various associa-
 tions help minors seek justice in cases of mistreatment by parents.
 Some immigrants from countries where female genital mutilation (FGM) is cus-
 tomay subject their children to this. French authorities have prosecuted some cases
 involving FGM and have undertaken an information campaign to inform immi-
 grants that FGM is contrary to the law and will be prosecuted.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Anti-immigrant sentiments sparked inci-
 dents including occasional attacks by skinheads on members of the large Arab/Mus-
 lim and black African communities, and on the Jewish population. In March the an-
 nual report of the NCCHR (see Section 4) noted a sharp rise in attacks and threats,
 from 172 in 1992 to 342 in 1993. In response, the Government initiated a program
 to combat racism a ananti-Semitism through a campaign to promote public aware-
 ness and bring together local officials, police, and concerned associations; it also ini-
 tiated antiracist educational programs in Paris public schools, and (see Section 2.a.)
 
 
 813
 banned distribution of a skinhead publication. NCCHR data indicate there were 52
 arrests in 1993 and 56 during the first 9 months of 1994 for racist attacks or
 threats. (No data are available on convictions.)
 The NCCHR's report also implicitly criticized some of the 1993 revisions of the
 Immigration Law, asserting that "useless and vexing" bureaucratic hurdles in ob-
 taining documentation, such as identity papers, sometimes resulted in separation of
 spouses and even separation of children from parents.
 The police make aritrary identity checks in areas of high immigrant concentra-
 tion, particularly those with relatively many black or IMaghrebi residents. They
 stepped up these activities in August, when the Minister of Interior-responding to
 the assassinations of French officials in Algeria-ordered a widespread crackdown
 on suspected or potential terrorist ntworks in France.
 Religious Minoities.-The NCCHR report in March noted a sharp increase also
 in the number of anti-Semitic incidents, from 103 in 1992 to 299 in 1993. Govern-
 ment sources indicate that in 1994 some 20 Jewish and Muslim graves were dese-
 crated. No arrests were made for anti-Semitic attacks or threats in 1993, but there
 were eight arrests on such charges during the first 9 months of 1994. These cases
 are under investigation.
 In April a pro-Nazi militia officer, Paul Touvier, who was convicted of ordering
 the murder of Jewish prisoners in 1944, became the first French citizen to be con-
 victed of World War H crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to life imprison-
 ment.
 People With Disabilities.-The law provides extensive protection as well as welfare
 benefits for people with disabilities. Since 1988 the law has mandated that disabled
 persons make up at least 6 percent of all public and private enterprises with 20 or
 more employees. In some cases the Government will reimburse employers up to 20
 percent of the costs of employing a disabled person. A 1993 study concluded that
 the program was successful in meeting its goals in the public sector, while it found
 the private sector also largely in compliance, it noted that firms often chose not to
 hire the handicapped themselves but rather to take advantage of a provision permit-
 ting companies to pay into a special fund to help government agencies provide such
 employment.
 A 1991 law requires new public buildings to be accessible to the physically handi-
 capped.
 I& March the Government's Ombudsman reported that, despite governmental ac-
 tion, disabled people still faced considerable obstacles to the exercise of some of their
 rights. He       for greater coordination between central and local governments,
 private social workers, and the handicapped themselves and their families. The Gov-
 ernment has not yet responded to the Ombudsman's report.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 for all workers. Although less than 10 percent of the total work force is unionized
 (12 to 15 percent in the public sector, 5 to 6 percent in the private sector), trade
 unions exercise significant economic and political influence. They have legally man-
 dated roles (as do employers) in administering social institutions, including social
 security (health care and most retirement systems), the unemployment insurance
 system, labor courts, and the Economic and Social Council, a constitutionally man-
 dated consultative body.
 The unions are independent of the Government, however, and most are not
 aligned with any political party. Many of the leaders of the General Confederation
 of Labor and its unions belong to the Communist Party.
 Unions can freely join federations and confederations, including international
 ones.
 Workers, including civil servants, are free to strike except when a strike threatens
 public safety. As one-fourth of all salaried employees work for the Government,
 strikes in the public sector tend to be fairly numerous and receive extensive media
 coverage. In 1994 there were a few, brief strikes in both the public and private sec-
 tors; none brought out large numbers or involved long work stoppages.
 The law prohibits retribution against strikers or strike leaders, and the Govern-
 ment effectively enforces this.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers, including those in
 the three small export processing zones, have the right to organize and bargain col-
 lectively. The law strictly prohibits antiunion discrimination; employers found guilty
 of it are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 A 1982 law requires at least annual bargainin in the public and private sector
 on wages, hours, and working conditions at both plant and industry levels, but does
 not require that negotiations result in a signed contract. In case of an impasse, gov-
 
 
 814
 eminent mediators may impose solutions that are binding unless formally rejected
 by either side within a week. If no new agreement can be reached, the contract from
 the previous year remains valid. Over 80 percent of the private-sector work force
 is covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated at national or local levels.
 Trilateral consultations also take place on such subjects as the minimum wage, tem-
 porary work, social security, and unemployment benefits. Labor tribunals, composed
 of worker and employer representatives, are available to resolve complaints.
 The law requires businesses with more than 50 employees to have a works coun-
 cil, in which workers are consulted on training, working conditions, profit-sharing,
 and similar issues. Works councils, which are open to both union and nonunion em-
 ployees, are elected every 2 years.
 The Constitution's provisions for trade union rights extend to France's overseas
 departments and territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law  and the Government effectively enforces this. In its 1993 report,
 however, the ILO's Committee of Experts questioned the French practice of obliging
 French prisoners to work for private enterprises at less than the national minimum
 wage.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-With a few exceptions for those
 enrolled in certain apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may not
 be employed. Generally, work considered arduous or work between the hours of 10
 p.m. and 5 a.m. may not be performed by minors under age 18. Laws prohibiting
 child employment are effectively enforced through periodic checks by labor inspec-
 tors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-France has an administratively determined
 minimum wage, revised whenever the cost-of-living index rises 2 percentage points,
 and it is sufficient to provide a decent standard of living to a worker and family.
 The wage was $6.50 (35.56 francs) per hour. Following massive public demonstra-
 tions against a draft law that would have lowered the minimum wage for youths
 in some training programs, the Government rescinded it.
 The legal workweek is 39 hours, with a minimum break of 24 hours per week.
 Overtime is restricted to 9 hours per week.
 The Ministry of Labor has overall responsibility for policing occupational safety
 and health laws. Standards are generally high and well enforced. Workers have the
 right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations. The law requires that
 any enterprise with 50 or more employees have an occupational health and safety
 committee; over 75 percent of all enterprises, covering 75 percent of employees, had
 such committees as of 1992 (latest data).
