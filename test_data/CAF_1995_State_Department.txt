 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The Central African Republic became a democracy in 1993 following free and fair
 elections in which Ange Felix Patasse, candidate of the Movement for the Liberation
 of the Central African People, was chosen President. Citizens also elected an 85-
 member National Assembly in which no party achieved a majority. In 1994 a Con-
 stitution providing for multiparty democracy was accepted in a national referendum.
 The military and the National Gendarmerie, under the Minister of Defense, share
 internal security responsibilities with the civilian police force, under the direction
 of the Minister of Public Security. Under President Patasse, the Presidential Secu-
 rity Guard was reduced in size and responsibility. Security forces committed serious
 human rights abuses.
 The Central African Republic is a landlocked and sparsely populated country,
 most of whose inhabitants practice subsistence agriculture. Principal exports are
 coffee, cotton, timber, tobacco and diamonds. A 1994 devaluation of the currency had
 the effect of raising prices received by producers of these commodities, and thus
 boosted rural income. On the other hand, the devaluation raised the price of im-
 ports, which constrained consumption by civil servants and other workers. The Gov-
 ernment is the country's largest employer.
 The overall human rights situation improved considerably with the installation of
 the elected Government in October 1993. However, serious human rights abuses
 continued in certain areas. Police beatings of some detainees continued, and there
 were credible reports of routine summary executions of suspected bandits by secu-
 rity forces. In one well-publicized case, a suspect was killed while in police custody
 in Bangui. Other human rights abuses included harsh prison conditions, prolonged

 detention, limits on judicial independence and efficiency, restraints on press freedom
 to criticize the Government, a pattern of discrimination and violence against women,
 and discrimination against Pygmies.
 Local human rights monitors expressed concern over the extended detention in ex-
 cess of legal limits of ex-officials from the previous regime charged with corruption;
 some of these cases went to trial in September and were in progress at year's end.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings, but there were credible reports that army and gendarmerie forces routinely
 conducted summary executions of suspected bandits in border regions. The Govern-
 ment did not prosecute any officials for these killings, or for similar killings in 1994.
 In April presidential security forces arrested a young man and jailed him at the
 headquarters of an antibandit police unit. He was later observed by his parents to
 be unable to walk after an apparent beating;, he died the next day. No official was
 prosecuted.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Penal Code prohibits torture and specifies sanctions for those found
 guilty of physical abuse, the police continue to beat and otherwise abuse criminal
 suspects. There were reliable reports of abuse of prisoners. So far as is known, the
 Government did not punish those responsible.
 Prison conditions are deplorable. Cells are overcrowded, and the basic necessities
 of life, including food, clothing, and medical care, are in short supply and routinely
 diverted by prison officials for their personal consumption. Prisoners are frequently
 forced to perform uncompensated labor at the residences of government officials.
 Male and female prisoners are confined in separate facilities in Bangui but housed
 together elsewhere. Minors are routinely housed with adults and subject to abuse.
 Approximately half the male prison population are pretrial detainees. There is no
 system of bail.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law stipulates that persons detained
 in cases other than those involving national security must be brought before a mag-
 istrate within 96 hours. In practice, authorities often do not respect this deadline,
 in part due to inefficient judicial procedures. Judicial warrants are not required for
 arrest. By law, national security etainees defined as "those held for crimes against
 the security of the State" may be held without charge for up to 2 months. Although
 previous governments used the national security provision of the law to arrest oppo-
 nents for exercising internationally recognized human rights, the Patasse Govern-
 ment did not detain any person for such actions. In September the criminal court
 began its first session in 2 years. On the docket were the cases of Kolingba regime
 (1981-1993) officials charged with corruption who, in some cases, had been detained
 more than 18 months without trial. These cases were still underway at year's end.
 A parliamentary commission also investigating Kolingba-era corruption had pub-
 lished no conclusions by year's end.
 The law does not permit exile, and it does not occur in practice. The Government
 has repeatedly stated that any person in exile for strictly political, rather than
 criminal, reasons may return without fear of persecution. At the end of the year,
 there were no known political self-exiles. Former Empress Catherine, wife of former
 Emperor Bokassa, briefly returned from exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but there are reliable reports of periodic executive interference. The judiciary,
 which consists of regular and military courts, was reorganized in the 1994 Constitu-
 tion. Legislation implementing this reorganization was pending at year's end. In
 criminal cases, the accused are presumed innocent and have the right to legal coun-
 sel, to public trial, and to be present at their trials and confront witnesses. The Gov-
 ernment generally respects these safeguards in practice, but inefficient administra-
 tion of the law, shortages of trained personnel and material resources hinder the
 process. The criminal court, for example, did not convene for 2 years for lack of
 money. It did convene in September and worked its way through a full docket of
 cases. Court proceedings are open to the public and frequently broadcast on national
 radio.
 There were no reports of political prisoners, although some observers note that
 anticorruption statutes at times appear to have been applied more rigorously to
 former officials of the previous regime than to current officials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government on rare occasion abused the law which prohibits invasion of the home
 
 
 without a warrant in civil and criminal cases. Police did, however, use Title IV of
 the Penal Code, governing certain political and security cases, which allows them
 to search private property without special authorization. The Government also mon-
 itored the telephones of some opposition figures.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice. Citizens
 spoke freely and publicly about political developments criticizing the Government,
 the President's handling of certain issues, and political parties. Opposition leaders,
 in particular, used press statements, manifestos, broadsides, and copies of open cor-
 respondence to the Government to circulate their views. Although not all of this doc-
 umentation was published in the government-controlled media, the Government
 made no apparent effort to censure, seize, or halt circulation of these materials else-
 where.
 More than a dozen private newspapers published at varying intervals, openly dis-
 cussing a wide variety of views on political and social issues. Government officials
 sued several journalists following accusations of corruption published by their news-
 papers. Many journalists regarded this as official harassment. In August the editor
 of former President Kolingba's Rassemblement Democratique Centrafricaine (RDC)
 party newspaper was sentenced to 2years in prison for defamation after publishing
 an article which accused President Fatasse of conspiring to murder a labor leader.
 The Government owns and controls one newspaper, which appeared only sporadi-
 cally, a more regular wire service news bulletin, and a radio and television station.
 Government reluctance to allow opposition access to the media, criticized by the op-
 position as a blatant effort to impede its activities, lessened in the wake of an Au-
 gust televised opposition roundtable with the Minister of Communication. Although
 a church-run radio station, which had received authorization to broadcast in 1994,
 began operating in 1995, the Government refused to allow the establishment of
 other private radio stations for fear that they would become voices for the opposi-
 tion.
 The Government did not impede foreign journalists in their work. University fac-
 ulty and students belonged to many political parties and expressed their views with-
 out fear of reprisal.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly, but the Government at times restricted this freedom. A 1992
 decree requires organizers of demonstrations and public meetings to register with
 the Government 48 hours in advance and also prohibits political meetings in schools
 or churches. In August the Ministry of Territorial Administration denied the RDC
 permission to stage a march through Bangui, citing security reasons. After the RDC
 announced its decision to march anyway, the Government relented and the RDC
 held a peaceful march. In May, the Democratic Movement for the Renaissance and
 Evolution of Central Africa Party (MDREC) was forbidden to march by the Govern-
 ment which cited security reasons; MDREC subsequently held a public meeting at
 its headquarters without incident.
 Associations are required to register with the Government in order to enjoy legal
 status. All political parties must register with the Ministry of Public Security in
 order to participate legally in politics. While the Government usually grants reg-
 istration expeditiously, in one case it revoked a party's registration after the Min-
 istry of Justice mounted a legal challenge based on the party's religious nature.
 There are more than 20 registered political parties and a variety of nonpolitical
 associations. The Government allowed them to hold congresses, elect officials, and
 publicly debate policy issues without interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, but in-
 cludes fixed legal conditions and prohibits what the Government considers religious
 fundamentalism and intolerance. There is no state religion, and a variety of reli-
 gious communities are active. Religious organizations and missionary groups are
 free to proselytize, worship, and construct places of worship. However, religious
 groups must register with the Government, and any group whose behavior the Gov-
 ernment considers subversive remains subject to sanctions, although it imposed no
 sanctions in 1995. Jehovah's Witnesses, which the previous Government had
 banned, encountered no difficulties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-People are free to move within the country, but police and other offi-
 cials harass travelers unwilling or unable to pay bribes at checkpoints along major
 intercity roads and at major intersections in Bangui. The Government effectively
 prevented former President Kolingba and members of his family from leaving
 
 
 48
 Bangui. It denied former President David Dacko permission to travel abroad for
 medical treatment, but subsequently relented. Some citizens, when attempting to
 leave the country, were informed by immigration authorities that their names were
 on unspecified official lists which forbid their departure.
 There were no known cases of revocation of citizenship
 The Government continued working with the UnitedNations High Commissioner
 for Refugees in hosting Chadian and Sudanese refugees. It expelled more than 100
 recently arrived Rwandan citizens in September, although many subsequently re-
 turned. Approximately 500 others who were registered with the National Commis-
 sion for Refugees remained in the country without difficulty.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised their constitutional right to change their government by demo-
 cratic means in 1993 presidential and parliamentary elections. international observ-
 ers deemed the elections free and fair.
 The Constitution, adopted by national referendum in 1994, provided for multiple
 political parties and increased the powers and independence of the legislative and
 judicial branches at the expense of the executive branch.
 While running for office, President Patasse promised local elections in 1994, but
 these have never taken place. In the interim, the Government appointed three suc-
 cessive mayors of Bangui, which engendered criticism from prodemcracy forces as
 reneging on a commitment. By-elections were held in October to fill two empty Par-
 liament seats. The opposition harshly condemned these elections for alleged irreg-
 ularities.
 Women remained numerically underrepresented in politics. Three women can-
 didates were elected to the 85-member Parliament. Two of 26 Cabinet members are
 women.
 Pygmies (Ba'aka), who represent from 1 to 2 percent of the national population,
 are not represented in the Government and have little political power or influence,
 although they voted in large numbers in the 1993 election. In general, the Ba'aka
 have little ability to participate in decisions affecting their lands, culture, traditions,
 and the allocation of natural resources.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Central African Human Rights League (LCDH) is a nongovernmental organi-
 zation with multiple goals, including publicizing human rights violations and plead-
 ing individual cases of human rights abuse be ore the courts. In August the LCDH
 distributed widely an open letter to President Patasse which, while citing an overall
 improvement in human rights since the elections, criticized his Government for har-
 assment of the press, excessive pretrial detentions in violation of the law, summary
 executions of suspected bandits, and the death of a suspect while in police custody
 in Bangui (see Section L.a.). During the course of the year, several other nongovern-
 mental organizations, including the Movement for the Defense of Human Ri hts and
 Humanitarian Action and the Central African Red Cross, actively pursued human
 rights issues, including prison visits. The Government did not attempt to hinder any
 such activities.
 There were no known requests from international human rights organizations for
 visits.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution stipulates that all persons are equal before the law without re-
 gard to wealth, race, sex, or religion, but the Government does not effectively en-
 force these provisions and significant discrimination exists.
 Women.-Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs, but it is impos-
 sible to quantify its extent as data are lacking, and victims seldom make reports.
 The courts try very few cases of spouse abuse, although litigants cite this abuse dur-
 ing divorce trials or in civil suits for damages. Some women reportedly tolerate
 abuse in order to retain a measure of financial security for themselves and their
 children. The Government did not address this issue in 1995.
 Despite the Constitution's provisions, in practice women are not treated as equal
 to men economically, socially, or politically. Women in rural areas, moreover suffer
 more discrimination than women in urban areas. Sixty to 70 percent of urban fe-
 males go to primary school, while only 10 to 20 percent of their rural counterparts
 do. Overall, at the primary level females and males enjoy equal access to education,
 but a majority of young women drop out at age 14 or 15 due to social pressure to
 marry and bear children. Only 20 percent of the students at the University of
 
 
 Bangui are women. There are no accurate statistics on the percentage of female
 wage earners.
 Polygyny is legal, although this practice faces growing resistance among educated
 women. There is no legal limit on the number of wives a man may take, but a pro-
 spective husband must indicate at the time of the marriage contract whether he in-
 tends to take further wives. In practice many couples never formally marry because
 men cannot afford the traditional bride payment. Women who are educated and fi-
 nancially independent tend to seek monogamous marriages. Divorce is legal and
 may be initiated by either partner. The law does not discriminate against women
 in inheritance and property rights, but a welter of conflicting customary laws often
 prevails. Women's rights were strengthened in a new family code drafted by a Min-
 istry of Social Affairs-sponsored onference. For example, common law wives would
 have stronger domestic legal claims. The proposed new Code awaited National As-
 sembly approval at year's end.
 The Association of Central African Female Jurists' clinic advises women of their
 legal rights. It also published pamphlets in conjunction with the Ministry of Social
 Affairs on the dangers of female genital mutilation and on food taboos (see the fol-
 lowing subsection.)
 Children.-Although there is no official discrimination against children, the Gov-
 ernment spends little money on programs for children. There are a few church and
 other nongovernmental projects for youth. Crippling education strikes caused 3
 years of missed school. Schools restarted in late 1993 and have operated normally
 since that time. Nonetheless, most children are woefully behind in their studies, and
 a number have left school completely. Many Bangui street children make their way
 by begging and stealing. Several charitable organizations strive to assist them.
 Courts interpret the Penal Code as forbidding parental blows or injuries to chil-
 dren under 15. The proposed family code would strengthen children's rights; for ex-
 ample, illegitimate clren would have the same rights as those born in wedlock.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. This traditional prac-
 tice is found in certain rural areas, and to a lesser degree in Bangui, and is per-
 formed at an early age. A national health census indicated that 44 percent of fe-
 males have undergone FGM, but its incidence was declining with time.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no odified or cultural discrimination against
 the disabled. There are several government-initiated programs designed to assist
 the disabled, including handicraft training for the blind and the distribution of
 wheelchairs and carts by the Ministr of  cial Services. There is no legislated or
 mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Despite constitutional provisions, in practice some minorities
 are treated unequally. In particular, indigenous forest-dwelling Pygmies are subject
 to social and economic discrimination and exploitation which the Government has
 done little to correct. Pygmies often work for villagers at wages lower than those
 paid to members of other groups.
 Religious Minorities.-Muslims, particularly Mbororo (Peuhl) herders, claim to
 have een singled out for harassment by authorities, including shakedowns by po-
 lice, due to popular resentment of their presumed affluence. Muslims also bear the
 brunt of government antibanditry campaigns in the northwest part of the country.
 While Muslims play a preponderant role in the economy, few hold senior executive
 posts in government. About six Muslims serve in the National Assembly.
 The 1994 constitutional provision prohibiting religious fundamentalism is widely
 understood to be aimed at Muslims.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are about 90 ethnic groups, and in the
 ast there was little ethnic balance at the higher levels of government. Under the
 former Kolingba government, members of the minority Yakoma ethnic group held
 a disproportionate number of senior positions in the government, military, and
 state-owned firms. The Patasse Government has brought about a more representa-
 tive ethnic balance in government. Even so, observers note that members of north-
 ern ethnic groups close to the President are a majority in Patass's Cabinet and also
 receive favorable treatment in government appointments.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Labor Code, last revised in 1990, all
 workers ar free to form or join unions of their own choosing without prior author-
 ization. A relatively small part of the population has exercised rights of association,
 chiefly wage earners such as civil servants.
 The current Labor Code does not refer to trade unions by name, a change from
 previous versions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) had requested this
 change to reflect the proliferation of new unions. There are now five recognized
 
 
 labor federations, including the Organization of Free Public Sector Unions and the
 Labor Union of Central African Workers (USTC). The USTC and its member unions
 continued to assert and maintain their official independence from the Government.
 The USTC organized and conducted a major march, demanding payment of salary
 arrears owed by the Government. It also accused the Government of firing USTC
 members for political and tribal reasons.
 Unions have the right to strike in both the public and private sectors. A conten-
 tious strike by sugar workers in Bambari was resolved peacefully early in the year.
 To be legal, strikes must be preceded by the union's presentation of demands, the
 employer's response to these demands, a conciliation meeting between labor and
 management, and a finding by an arbitration council that the union and employer
 failed to reach agreement on valid demands. The union must also provide 8 days'
 notification in writing of planned strikes. The Labor Code states that if employers
 initiate a lockout which is not in accordance with the Code, then the employer is
 required to pay workers for all days of the lockout. Other than this, the Code does
 not provide for sanctions on employers for acting against strikers. It is not known
 to what extent this policy is actually followed.
 Labor federations are free to affiliate internationally. The USTC is affiliated with
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code accords trade
 unions full legal status, including the right to sue in court. It requires that union
 officials be employed full-time in the occupation as a wage earner, but they nonethe-
 less conduct union business during working hours. The Code does not secifically
 provide that unions may bargain collectively. While collective bargaining has none-
 theless taken place in some instances, the Government is usually involved in the
 process.
 Wage scales are set by the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service but have been only
 a tangential issue in labor negotiations; the nonpayment of salary arrears and high-
 er consumer costs attributed to the 1994 devaluation continued to be the major com-
 plaints of the unions. Public sector unions complained in September that, while ne-
 gotiations were under way regarding salary arrears, the Government unilaterally
 announced that it would issue 5-year interest-bearing treasury bonds in lieu of cash
 payments to workers due arrears.
 The law expressly forbids discrimination against employees on the basis of union
 membership or union activity. However, leaders of public sector unions, particularly
 teachers, complained of government discrimination against them and their mem-
 bers, most often through arbitrary reassignment to provincial posts. It punitively re-
 assigned several union activists in the civil service following a series of strikes early
 in the year. The Labor Code does not state whether employers found guilty of
 antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is specifically prohib-
 ited by the Labor Code, and there were no reports of such labor. Uncompensated
 prison labor for government officials is required.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under 14
 years of age is forbidden by law, but this provision is only loosely enforced by the
 Ministry of Labor and Civil Service. In practice, child labor is common in many sec-
 tors of the economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code states that the Minister of
 Labor, rather than the National Assembly, must set minimum wages by decree. Ag-
 ricultural workers are guaranteed a minimum of $15 (cfa 7,800) per month, while
 office workers are guaranteed $36 (cfa 18,000). Minimum wages differ among the
 various sectors. The minimum wage assures a family the basic necessities but is
 barely adequate to maintain a decent standard of living. Most labor is performed
 outside the wage and social security system, especially by farmers in the large sub-
 sistence agricultural sector.
 The law sets a standard workweek of 40 hours for government employees and
 most private sector employees. Household employees may work up to 55 hours per
 week. The law also requires that there be a minimum rest period of 24 consecutive
 hours on Sundays, although in certain circumstances the Sunday requirement may
 be waived.
 There are also general laws on health and safety standards in the workplace, but
 the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service neither precisely defines nor actively en-
 forces them, a matter about which the ILO has expressed concern to the Govern-
 ment for many years. The Labor Code states that a labor inspector may force an
 employer to correct unsafe or unhealthy work conditions, but it does not provide the
 righ for workers to remove themselves from such conditions.
