 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a federation of 13 states with a parliamentary
 system of government based on periodic multiparty elections.
 The ruling National Front has held power since 1957.
 Opposition parties actively contested these elections and
 currently control two state governments.
 The Government justifies internal security laws allowing
 preventive detention (and arrests under such laws) by citing a
 Communist insurgency which raged between the 1940's and 1960'p,
 as well as longstanding racial tensions and endemic narcotics
 trafficking problems. However, it applies these laws very
 broadly and admits that it uses them to detain persons when
 available evidence is insufficient to bring formal charges
 undei the criminal code. The Royal Malaysian Police is the
 lead agency for internal security matters and reports
 ultimately to the Minister of Home Affairs. Currently. Prime
 Minister Mahathir also holds the Home Affairs portfolio.
 Although in the past there have been credible reports of
 mistreatment of prisoners and detainees by the police and
 prison officials, there were no such reports in 1991.
 A free market economy, abundant natural resources, and a
 relatively small population have helped Malaysia become one of
 the developing world's most prosperous countries. Strong
 economic performance since 1988 has resulted in reduced
 poverty, a rising standard of living, and more equal income
 distribution, thus lessening political tensions between the
 races.
 Malaysia's human rights record was mixed during 1991, although
 there were some positive developments, such as the registration
 of a human rights society. Detention without trial,
 limitations on judicial independence, and restrictions on
 freedom of association and the press continued to be the
 principal human rights problems in Malaysia. Detention of
 three political critics under the Internal Security Act (ISA)
 undercut an otherwise improved human rights record in 1991.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person; Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings by the Government or by any other political
 organization.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance attributable to the
 Government or to opposition forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 .Treatment or Punishment
 In the recent past, there have been allegations of cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, but no new
 allegations of such abuses were made in 1991. Malaysian
 criminal law prescribes whipping as an additional punishment to
 imprisonment for those convicted of narcotics possession.
 Judges routinely include whipping in sentencing those convicted
 of such crimes as kidnaping, rape, and robbery. The whipping,
 
 
 916
 MALAYSIA
 which is normally carried out with a one-half inch thick wooden
 cane, commonly causes welts and scarring.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Three laws permit the Government to detain suspects without
 judicial review or filing formal charges: the 1960 Internal
 Security Act (ISA), the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance
 of 1969, and the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1985. Long-term
 detentions without trial continue to be used by the Government
 in cases alleged to involve national security, as well as in
 narcotics trafficking and other cases.
 According to the Government, the goal of the ISA is to control
 internal subversion. This act empowers the police to hold any
 person who may act "in a manner prejudicial to the security of
 Malaysia" for up to 60 days. Security authorities sometimes
 wait several days after a detention before informing the
 detainee's family. The Minister of Home Affairs may authorize,
 in writing, further detention for periods up to 2 years. Even
 when there are no formal charges, the authorities must inform
 detainees of the accusations against them and permit them to
 appeal to an advisory board for review every,6 months.
 Advisory board decisions and recommendations, however, are not
 binding on the Home Minister, are not made public, and are
 often not shown to the detainee. A number of ISA detainees
 have refused to participate in the review process under these
 circumstances.
 The Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance was instituted after
 intercommunal riots in 1969. Although Parliament regained its
 legislative power in 1971, the state of emergency declared at
 the time of the riots has never been lifted. According to the
 police, 189 persons were in detention under the Emergency
 Ordinance at the end of 1990; statistics for 1991 are not
 available.
 The 1990 total represented a decrease from previous years,
 since drug suspects are now detained under the Dangerous Drugs
 Act, which gives the Government specific power to detain
 suspected drug traffickers. Many of these detainees are
 suspected members of organized crime gangs or secret
 societies. Suspects may be held without charge for successive
 2-year intervals, with periodic review by an advisory board,
 whose opinion is binding on the Home Minister. However, the
 review process contains none of the due process rights that a
 defendant would have in a court proceeding. Approximately
 1,200 drug suspects were in detention under this statute at the
 end of 1990.
 There have been some cases of suspected narcotics traffickers
 and firearms offenders being rearrested under the preventive
 measures clauses of the Dangerous Drugs Act and Internal
 Security Act after an acquittal in court on formal charges
 under separate provisions of those acts.
 The Government generally does not publish statistics or make
 available authoritative information on the number of ISA
 detainees. On January 23, however, the Deputy Home Affairs
 Minister reported to Parliament that there were 142 detainees
 at the end of 1990. While the Deputy Minister did not provide
 details on these detentions, the figure represented an slight
 decrease from the 155 detainees he acknowledged in a similar
 parliamentary session in early December 1990. The Deputy
 Minister categorized the detainees as follows: 117 alleged
 
 
 917
 MALAYSIA
 former members of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM)
 undergoing "rehabilitation;" 8 suspected forgers; 7 held for
 espionage; 5 religious extremists; 4 detainees from the East
 Malaysian State of Sabah; and 1"suspected arsonist. Assuming
 these figures were accurate when announced, approximately 20
 religious-extremists would have been released in late 1990 or
 early 1991,-while an additional number of former Communists
 were detained for "rehabilitation." The Government has issued
 no general definition- of what constitutes religious extremism,
 but in this use it is generally accepted that the 5 are
 persons, largely from the opposition Islamic Party, who were
 detained in 1988 for suspicion of involvement in politically
 motivated cases of arson. The 117 alleged former members of
 the CPM, which led an insurgency active from the late 1940*s
 until it ebbed into insignificance during the 1980's, are
 entitled .to return to Malaysia under a 1989 peace agreement.
 According to the Government, however, the agreement stipulates
 that they satisfy certainconditions, including taking a
 loyalty oath "to King and country" and renouncing the CPM in
 writing. In 1990.and 1991, approximately 421-former CPM
 members applied for return to Malaysia under the agreement. An
 unknown number of-these turned themselves, over to Malaysian
 security authorities for "rehabilitation."t A -credible report
 indicates that this "rehabilitation" consists of detention
 without trial under the ISA at the Kamunting Detention Center
 in-Perak State. The figures for ISA detentions provided by the
 Government in January appear to support this conclusion. In
 addition, at least 13 additional former CPM members, who
 returned to Malaysia from Thailand under the accord during
 August, were arrested by police in September under the ISA for
 failing to make the loyalty pledge and written renunciation of
 the CPM. The Government subsequently announced that all 13 had
 met the requisite conditions and had been released. .A CPM
 spokesman in Thailand criticized the Government for insisting
 on these conditions, arguing that the agreement neither
 requires former-CPM members to sign such statements nor to
 undergo rehabilitation. The Government did not respond'to
 these charges.
 During 1991 three additional Malaysians from the east Malaysian
 State of Sabah, including the brother of the Chief Minister,
 were detained under the ISA. Two persons detained in January
 were held under. Section 73 (1) of the ISA, which permits police
 to detain people for up to 60 days. One was released in March
 upon expiration of the initial order; a 2-year detention order
 under Section 8 of the Act (which requires the approval of the
 Home Minister) was not sought in his case. The other person
 remains in detention after a 2-year order was signed in March.
 The Chief Minister's brother was detained-in.May for alleged
 involvement in a "secessionist plot." A 2-year detention order
 was signed in July,-and he-remains in detention.
 In 1988 and 1989, Parliament amended the ISA, as well as the
 other Acts authorizing preventive detention, to place severe
 limitations on judicial review of detentions. The Government
 argued that the amendments were necessary to prevent the courts
 from usurping the authority of the Executive Branch in making
 decisions on national security matters. Opposition leaders and
 the Bar Council publicly protested these amendments as a
 negation of recognized due process and accused the Government
 of using the concept of "national security" too broadly.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial is restricted in criminal cases where
 the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975 are invoked
 by the Attorney General. These regulations governing trial
 procedure normally apply only in firearms cases. In cases
 tried under these regulations, the standards for accepting
 self-incriminating statements by defendants as evidence are
 less stringent than in normal criminal cases. Also, the
 authorities may hold the accused for unspecified periods of
 time before formal charges are made. The Attorney General also
 has the authority to invoke these regulations in other criminal
 cases if the Government determines the crime to involve
 national security considerations, but such cases are rare.
 Ordinary civil and criminal cases are tried under a fair and
 open judicial system derived from the British model. The
 accused must be brought before a judge within 24 hours of
 arrest, and charges must be levied within 14 days. Defendants
 have the right to counsel, bail is available, and strict rules
 of evidence apply in court. Defendants may appeal court
 decisions to higher courts and, in criminal cases, may also
 appeal for clemency to the King or local state rulers as
 appropriate. Criminal trials are heard by a single judge
 without a jury, except in murder trials where juries are the
 norm. The defense in both ordinary criminal cases and the
 special security cases described above is not entitled to a
 statement of evidence prior to the trial.
 The public and the legal community has long regarded the
 Malaysian judiciary as committed to the rule of law. The
 judicial system traditionally exhibited a high degree of
 independence, seldom hesitating to rule against the Government
 in criminal, civil, or occasionally even politically sensitive
 cases. For example, the High Court ruled in February 1988 that
 the dominant party in the Government coalition was illegally
 constituted. However, the Government's dismissal of the
 Supreme Court Lord President and two other justices in 1988,
 along with a constitutional amendment and legislation
 restricting judicial review, resulted in less judicial
 independence and stronger executive influence over the
 judiciary. These developments create the possibility of a
 chilling effect on the courts, the bar, and private citizens
 who might otherwise seek legal remedies against government
 actions. The 1988 changes have also resulted in less
 willingness by the courts to challenge the Government's legal
 interpretations in politically sensitive cases.
 The Government announced late in the year that it was studying
 proposals to give it greater control over the Malaysian Bar
 Council, which has been critical of some Government policies.
 The strong tone of government statements raised concerns among
 local and international observers that the Bar Council's
 freedom of expression and independence were being threatened.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are normally respected and protected by law, but
 provisions in the security legislation described in Section
 l.d. allow the police to enter and search without a warrant the
 homes of persons suspected of threatening national security and
 to confiscate evidence. Under these acts, police have searched
 homes and offices, seized books and papers, monitored
 conversations, and taken people into custody without a warrant.

 MALAYSIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 press, some important limitations exist. For example, the
 Constitution provides that freedom of speech may be restricted
 by legislation "in the interest of security...(or) public
 order." Thus, the Sedition Act Amendments of 1970 prohibit
 public comment on issues defined as sensitive, such as
 citizenship rights for non-Malays and the special position of
 Malays in society. The Government has .not charged anyone under
 the Sedition Act since 1986, when a trial court acquitted a
 former president of the Bar Council.
 Press freedom is subject to important limitations under the
 Printing Presses and Publications- Act of 1984, under which
 domestic and foreign publications must apply annually to the
 Government for a permit. The Act was amended in 1987 to make
 the publication of "malicious news" a punishable offense,
 expand the Government's power to ban or restrict publications,
 and prohibit court challenges to suspension or revocation of
 publication permits.
 In practice, press freedom is restricted by the fact that the
 Government or companies controlled by the leading political
 parties in the ruling coalition own all the major newspapers
 and all radio and television stations. The. Government-linked
 mass media gives only limited and selective coverage to     -
 opposition political views. A Commonwealth election observer
 team reported that opposition parties were denied equal access
 to the media during the 1990 general election campaign.
 Despite government control of major publications, small-
 circulation publications-of opposition parties, social action
 groups, unions and other private groups actively cover
 opposition parties, and frequently print views critical of
 government policies. The Government exerts significant
 influence over these publications by requiring annual renewal
 of publishing permits. At least two-new independent newspapers
 were given permission to begin publication during.1991, but
 some establ'ished papers faced government limitations on their
 publishing licenses. In November the Government warned two
 newspapers published by opposition parties that the terms of
 their licenses limited distribution to party members only. One
 of -the parties brought legal action to quash enforcement of the
 license limitation. This plea was dismissed by the High Court
 on December 31. In December Prime Minister Mahathir, acting in
 his capacity as Home Minister, revoked the license of the
 newsweekly Mingguan Waktu. This weekly had published articles
 critical of Prime Minister Mahathir's-governance.
 In June 1990, Parliament enacted legislation making the
 Malaysian News Agency (Bernama) the sole distributor of foreign
 news in.Malaysia, formalizing previous practice. The
 Parliamentary opposition opposed the bill, arguing that it
 would increase Government control over foreign news. Although
 this law has not-restricted foreign news coverage or
 availability, under separate legislation the Government banned
 editions of two prominent international weekly newsmagazines in
 July and September, evidently for carrying articles and
 photographic essays critical of Government policies. In both
 cases, the Minister of Information did not explain the
 rationale for the-prohibition but simply cited his authority to
 
 
 920
 MALAYSIA
 deny circulation under Section 9 of the Press and Publication
 Act amendments.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the rights of freedom of peaceful
 assembly and association, but there are significant
 restrictions. These rights can be limited in the interest of
 security and public order, and the 1967 Police Act requires
 police permits for all public assemblies.
 In the aftermath of the intercommunal riots in 1969, the
 Government banned political rallies. While the formal ban has
 not been rescinded, both government and opposition parties have
 .held large indoor political gatherings dubbed "discussion
 sessions." Government and opposition candidates campaigned
 actively during national elections in October 1990 as well as
 in local and state elections during 1991. There are, however,
 some restrictions on freedom of assembly during campaigns.
 During the actual campaign period, political parties submit
 lists of times and places for their "discussion groups;" no
 police permit is required. Outside of the campaign period, a
 permit is required, with most applications routinely approved.
 In past campaigns, however, some opposition discussion group
 meetings have been canceled for lack of a police permit.
 During the September election campaign in Sarawak, state
 immigration officials barred Malay opposition politicians from
 peninsular Malaysia from entering the state to campaign.
 Government coalition members suffered no such exclusion.
 Sarawak officials stated they took their action under
 Provisions of the Immigration Act of 1959 but did not explain
 the rationale behind the decision.
 Other statutes limit the right of association, such as the
 Societies Act of 1966, under which any association of seven or
 more members must register with the Government as a society.
 The Government may refuse to register a new society, and has
 the power to revoke the registration of an existing society,
 although this power is rarely employed. The threat of possible
 deregistration under the Societies Act, however, may inhibit
 political activism by public or special interest
 organizations. Another law affecting freedom of association is
 the Universities and University Colleges Act; it mandates
 government approval for student associations and prohibits
 student associations, as well as faculty members, from engaging
 in political activity. Campus demonstrations must be approved
 by a university vice-chancellor. Although spontaneous
 demonstrations have occurred periodically in the past without
 permission, no unapproved demonstrations occurred in 1991.
 University authorities did approve a few demonstrations in
 January by students protesting the Gulf War.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion. Ethnic Malays are legally
 bound in some civil matters, such as family relations and diet,
 by Islamic religious laws administered by state authorities
 through Islamic courts. An Islamic religious establishment is
 supported with government funds, and it is official policy to
 "infuse Islamic values" into the administration of Malaysia.
 At the same time, the Constitution provides for freedom of
 religion, and the Government has refused to accede to pressures
 for the imposition of Islamic religious law beyond the Muslim
 community. Religious minorities,.which include large Hindu,
 
 
 921
 MALAYSIA
 Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian communities, are permitted to
 worship freely.
 The Government opposes what it donsideres extremist or deviant
 interpretations of Islam; in-October it imposed restrictions on
 the proselytizing activities of the Islamic sect Darul Arqam.
 These included enforcement of a prohibition on using government
 facilities for religious activities.
 There are persistent allegations that some state governments
 are slow in approving building permits for non-Muslim places of
 worship. The Government has limited the circulation of a
 popular Malay-language translation of the Bible, and some
 states restrict the use of Christian terms in the Malay
 language. In 1991 a social action group reported the
 demolition of a-Christian'church in a village populated by
 aboriginal peoples. According to the report, officials argued
 that the church building was erected several years ago without
 a license. Government officials refused to permit the church
 to be rebuilt.
 Conversion to reiigions other than Islam is permitted but not
 encouraged. Proselytizing of Muslims has long been proscribed
 by law in some states and strongly discouraged in other parts
 of the country.
 In a March 1990 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the primacy
 of the Constitution over inconsistent state laws by ruling that
 parents have the right to determine the religion of their minor
 children under the age of 18. The decision has eased fears of
 the non-Muslim community over state laws which in religious
 conversion cases set the age of majority at puberty based on
 Islamic law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign,
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Malaysians generally have the right to travel within the
 country and live and work where they please, but the Government
 restricts these rights in some circumstances. The states of
 Sabah and Sarawak have the independent right to control
 immigration into their territories; Malaysians from peninsular
 west Malaysia are required to present passports for entry.
 This power to regulate internal movement is sometimes exercised
 arbitrarily for political purposes (see Section 2.b.).
 The Government does not restrict emigration. Although in some
 cases the Government has refused to issue passports on security
 grounds, Malaysians generally are free to travel abroad, except
 to Israel. Former restrictions on travel to South Africa and
 to several Communist countries, including China, were
 eliminated in 1990 and 1991.
 Thousands of illegal workers from Indonesia arrive in Malaysia
 each year to fill entry-level jobs in the plantation and
 construction sectors of the economy. Although some ultimately
 are able to regularize their immigration status, others depart
 voluntarily after a few months, while some are formally
 deported as illegal migrants. Between March and July, however,
 separate groups of asylum seekers from the Indonesian province
 of Aceh (totaling approximately 149) arrived in northwestern
 Malaysia, allegedly fleeing violencestemming from a separatist
 rebellion in Indonesia. These asylum seekers requested refugee
 status. Despite expressions of concern by local and
 international human rights organizations and foreign
 
 
 922
 MALAYSIA
 governments, the Malaysian Government denied their requests,
 ruling that at least the earliest arrivals were "illegal
 immigrants" subject to deportation.
 Intervention in court proceedings by local human rights lawyers
 evidently halted--at least temporarily--a formal determination
 of illegal immigrant status for a group of 40 Acehnese asylum
 seekers who arrived in Malaysia in July. Some Acehnese have
 returned home; others remain in official custody, but the
 Government has taken no steps to deport them or repatriate them
 against their will. In addition, the Foreign Minister said in
 October that the Government would not force Acehnese
 asylum-seekers to return against their will but would encourage
 them to repatriate when they consider it safe to do so.
 In accordance with the Compehensive Plan of Action (CPA) on
 Indochinese refugees signed in 1989, Malaysia continued to
 screen Vietnamese boat people in its first-asylum camps.
 Malaysian military officers do the screening, with legal
 consultants from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) present during each interview. The Malaysian screeners
 and UNHCR consultants make every effort to develop the asylum-
 seekers' claims to refugee status. The Government discusses
 all disputed cases with the UNHCR before announcing a
 decision. An administrative appeal is available to denied
 cases.
 Having provided first asylum to more than 250,000 Vietnamese
 refugees since 1975, the Government began to deny first asylum
 to some arriving Vietnamese in May 1989 in contravention of its
 commitments under the CPA; 10,473 have been denied first asylum
 since May 1989. Since June 1990, passengers on all but two
 Vietnamese boats have been deiied first asylum, and no
 Vietnamese were granted first asylum in 1991. Credible reports
 indicate that Malaysian authorities put back to sea about 110
 Vietnamese asylum seekers from 4 vessels during 1991. There
 were no reports of new landings after early May 1991.
 1
 Before arrivals ceased in May, Malaysian authorities allowed
 Vietnamese boats to land, and normally held asylum-seekers in
 temporary camps closed to observers. The Government provided
 life jackets, boats, and essential supplies to asylum seekers
 put back to sea. Government authorities have not responded
 positively to concerns that this "redirection" of boat people
 placed them in additional danger.
 There have been some credible reports of abuses in the
 temporary camps, as well as of instances in which Malaysian
 authorities provided inadequate boats to asylum seekers put
 back to sea. The only reported deaths resulting from the
 denial of first asylum in recent years were four which occurred
 in mid-1989. Interviews with asylum seekers indicate that the
 Government takes positive steps to safeguard the lives and
 welfare of those denied first asylum and disciplines personnel
 involved in abusive behavior.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 By law'and in practice, Malaysians have the right to change
 their government through periodic elections, although electoral
 irregularities and campaign restrictions sometimes detract from
 the overall fairness of the process. Malaysia has a
 Westminster-style parliamentary system of government. National
 elections, required at least every 5 years, have been held
 
 
 923
 MALAYSIA
 regularly since independence in 1957. Through the United
 Malays National organization (UMNO), Malays dominate the ruling
 National Front coalition of ethnic-based parties which has
 controlled Parliament since independence. The Government
 coalition currently controls 11 of 13 states. Non-Malays fill
 a number of Cabinet posts, and at present ethnic Chinese
 leaders of a member party of the government coalition hold
 executive power in the State of Penang. In Sabah, the party in
 power is controlled by Sabah's predominant indigenous ethnic
 group and headed by a Christian.
 A new Malay political party called Semangat '46 (Spirit of '46)
 was registered in July 1989. Led by former UMNO leaders who
 unsuccessfully challenged Prime Minister Mahathir for the UMNO"
 leadership in 1987, the party joined the Parti Islam Semalaysia
 (PAS) and two small Malay opposition parties in an umbrella
 organization to contest general elections in 1990.
 Subsequently, the Chinese-based opposition Democratic Action
 Party and several small opposition parties formed a separate
 electoral pact with Semangat 46, called the People's Front. As
 a result, in the 1990 elections, the Government coalition faced
 the unprecedented prospect of a multiethnic, multiparty
 opposition linked into two groups which fielded single
 opposition candidates for virtually every seat. In these
 elections, the opposition won 53 seats and gained control of
 two state governments.
 Malaysian elections are procedurally free and fair, with votes
 cast secretly and recorded accurately. General elections in
 1990 were subject to intense scrutiny by both international and
 domestic observers. Among the international observers was a
 group dispatched by the Commonwealth of Nations, which reported
 that the elections were "properly and impartially" carried
 out. The Commonwealth observers criticized as campaign
 "imperfections," however, unequal media access for the
 opposition and irregularities in the electoral rolls. A local
 election monitoring group called Election Watch reported that
 the election was free, but criticized unequal opposition access
 to the media, problems with the electoral rolls, and subtle
 intimidation of voters by reference to the 1969 race riots.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In August 1989, a group of prominent Malaysians, including two
 former prime ministers (both now deceased), formally applied to
 the Registrar of Societies-to establish a nitional human rights
 society, the National Human Rights Association. The registrar
 delayed ruling on the application because, according to some
 observers, the Government objected to the prospect of having a
 potentially powerful critic of certain official policies. The
 application was approved in June 1991, however, and the society
 has begun to operate freely. A number of other organizations,
 including the Bar Council and public interest groups, devote
 attention to human rights activities. The Government tolerates
 their activities, but rarely responds to their inquiries or
 occasional press statements. The Government has not acceded to
 any of the -major international covenants on human rights,
 generally maintaining that such issues are internal matters.
 The Government-rejects criticism of its human rights record by
 international human rights organizations and foreign
 governments. The Foreign Minister argued in a speech before
 the nonaligned movement in September that social and economic
 
 
 924
 MALAYSIA
 rights are as important as civil and political rights, and that
 Western nations must not be allowed to impose their values on
 developing nations. Malaysian officials criticize local groups
 for collaborating with international human rights
 organizations. Representatives of international human rights
 organizations have visited and traveled in Malaysia, but
 frequently have no access to government officials.
 Foreign government officials have discussed human rights with
 their Malaysian counterparts, and private groups occasionally
 have done so. For example, in 1990 representatives of the
 American Bar Association (ABA) and the International Council of
 Jurists attended the trial of the Bar Council Vice President
 mentioned in Section l.e. The ABA representative met privately
 with the Attorney General to discuss the case.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Government implements extensive programs designed to boost
 the economic position of the ethnic Malay majority, which
 remains poorer, on average, than other Malaysians despite its
 political dominance. By favoring one segment of society, these
 government programs and policies limit, in varying degrees,
 opportunities for non-Malays in higher education, government
 employment, business permits and licenses, and ownership of
 newly developed agricultural lands.
 There are no laws or regulations restricting the political and
 economic rights of women. Government policy supports women's
 full and equal participation in government, education, and the
 work force. Women hold high-level political positions and
 judgeships and are well represented in the professions.
 Literacy rates for women are lower than for men, with a female
 literacy rate of 55 percent compared to a rate of 76 percent
 for the total adult population.
 The cultural and religious traditions of Malaysia's major
 ethnic groups heavily influence the condition of women in
 Malaysian society. In family and religious matters, Muslim
 women are subject to Islamic law. Polygyny is allowed and
 practiced, and inheritance law favors male offspring and
 relatives. The Islamic family law was revised in 1989 to
 provide better protection for the property rights of married
 Muslim women, and to make more equitable a Muslim woman's right
 to divorce. Non-Muslim women are subject to civil law.
 Changes in the civil Marriage and Divorce Act in the early
 1980's increased protection of married women's rights,
 especially those married under customary rites. A national
 women's policy was adopted by the Cabinet in late 1989 to
 upgrade the status of the Government department responsible for
 women's affairs and monitor the implementation of national
 policies to insure that women's rights are protected.
 While statistics on domestic violence, including wife beating,
 are sketchy, both the Government and women's organizations
 agree that the problem is growing. Currently there are no
 specific laws on domestic violence; cases of wife beating or
 child abuse normally are tried under provisions of the penal
 code governing assault and battery, which carry penalties of 3
 months to 1 year in prison and fines up to $750. During 1991
 child abuse became a major focus of public attention, chiefly
 through regular news media reports on the problem. A number of
 social and political organizations have urged Parliament to
 enact legislation addressing the problem of child abuse.
 
 
 925
 
 MALAYSIA
 Women's groups continued to press government officials
 responsible for women's affairs to issue recommendations on
 legislation dealing with domestic violence. -Problems center on
 the-definition of domestic violence and how Muslim women, "whose
 family and marital status is covered by Islamic law, should be
 treated in proposed civil-legislation.  Women's issues were
 the subject- of.a number-of seminars during 1991, and a Muslim
 women's group, Sisters in Islam, published two widely
 distributed pamphlets on the rights of women in Islam.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 By law, workers, with certain limitations, have the right to
 engage in trade union activity. Unions may organize
 workplaces, bargain collectively with employers, form
 federations, and join international organizations. The
 Industrial Relations Act specifically prohibits interfering
 with, restraining, or coercing a worker in the exercise of the
 right to form trade unions or participate in lawful trade union
 activities. The-Trade Unions Act, administered by the Director
 General of Trade Unions (DGTU), sets rules for organization of
 unions,.union recognition at the workplace, the content of
 union constitutions, election of officers, and financial
 reporting.- However, the Act's definition of a trade union
 restricts a union to representing workers in a "particular
 establishment, trade, occupation, or industry or within any
 similar.trades, occupations, or industries," contrary to
 International Labor Organization (ILO) guidelines.
 The DGTU may refuse to register a trade union. In some
 circumstances, he also has the power to withdraw registration
 of a trade union. When registration has been refused,
 withdrawn, or canceled, a trade union is considered an unlawful
 association.
 Dominated by American and Japanese firms, Malaysia's electronic
 components industry has been the focus of unsuccessful union
 -registration efforts since the late 1970's. The Government has
 used itspower to prevent electrical industry unions from
 organizing electronics workers and permits only "in-house"
 unions in the industry. Five such unions have been registered
 in the electronics industry; three have been recognized by the
 companies involved. All of the members of one of these unions
 were dismissed in 1990 following reorganization of the
 company's structure. The-union charged the company with
 union-busting and wrongful dismissal. The case was filed in
 September 1990. Opening motions were heard in June 1991, and
 the case is scheduled to be heard in February 1992. A,
 complaint about the case was also presented to the ILO. In
 1991 the ILO examined complaints dealing with Japanese and
 American electronics companies and again asked the Government
 to amend the legislation to bring it into accord with the
 principles of freedom of association. The Government has given
 no indication of its intent to do so.
 By law, federations of trade unions may cover only a single
 trade or industry or similar trades or industries. Only three
 national labor federations are currently registered: one for
 public servants, one for teachers, and one consisting of
 state-based textile and garment workers' unions.
 The Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC), the main labor body
 in the country, is registered as a society under the Societies
 Act, rather than under the Trade Unions Act. The Malaysian
 
 
 926
 MALAYSIA
 Labor Organization (MLO), recently set up as a rival labor
 center to the MTUC, is also registered as a society. Previous
 MTUC attempts to register as a trade union federation under the
 Trade Unions Act were denied because its membership was deemed
 too broad. In November 1988, Parliament approved legislation
 which granted both societies of trade unions and societies of
 employers the status and rights accorded trade unions, despite
 their status as societies. This legislation was intended to
 give the MTUC "standing" to represent union interests before
 the High Court.
 Unions maintain independence both from the Government and from
 the political parties. Individual union members may belong to
 political parties. While union officers are forbidden to hold
 principal offices in political parties, individual trade union
 leaders have served and currently serve in Parliament.
 Malaysian trade unions are free to associate with international
 labor bodies and have actively done so.
 Although strikes are legal and a number of them occurred in
 1991, the right to strike is severely restricted in practice.
 Malaysian law contains a list of "essential services" in which
 unions must give advance notice of any industrial action. The
 list includes sectors that do not normally qualify as
 "essential" under ILO definitions. The Industrial Relations
 Act of 1967 requires the parties to notify the Ministry of
 Human Resources that a dispute exists before any industrial
 action (strike or lockout) may be taken. The Ministry's
 Industrial Relations Department may then become actively
 involved in conciliation efforts. If conciliation fails to
 achieve a settlement, the Minister has the power to refer the
 dispute to the Industrial Court. The result, in effect, is
 compulsory arbitration. A strike or lockout is prohibited
 while the dispute is before the Industrial Court.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Malaysian workers have the legal right to organize and bargain
 collectively. Collective bargaining is widespread in those
 sectors where labor is organized. Designed to curb disruptive
 strikes, amendments in 1980 to Malaysia's Labor Law contain
 provisions, however, which the MTUC believes erode the basic
 rights of workers, restrict union activities, and result in
 government and employer interference in the internal
 administration of unions. Despite subsequent amendments, the
 MTUC believes the labor law is still deficient by ILO
 standards. Many union leaders also believe that the creation
 of the Industrial Court further weakened their collective
 bargaining rights.
 Labor standards in free trade zones (EPZ's) are identical to
 those in the rest of Malaysia. Workers at many companies
 located in the EPZ's are unionized, especially in the textile
 and electrical products sectors. Enterprises granted "pioneer
 status" (regardless of location) are protected from union
 demands for terms of employment exceeding those specified in
 the Employment Act of 1955 during the period of their "pioneer
 status" (normally 5 years). The restriction does not apply to
 wages or benefits covered by the Employment Act (see Section
 6.e.). In 1991 the ILO asked the Government to remove legal
 restrictions on the right to bargain in pioneer industries, in
 the public sector, and on dismissals without notice. Despite
 the existence of antiunion discrimination laws, there have been
 a number of instances in which union activists have been
 
 
 927
 MALAYSIA
 dismissed, allegedly for engaging in union activities. The ILO
 examined two such complaints in -1991 and is awaiting the
 Government's response. Redress .through the Industrial Court is
 slow.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Malaysia laws allow the use of imprisonment with required
 forced labor as a punishment for persons expressing views
 opposed to the established order or participating in strikes.
 The Government maintains that these laws have no force. There
 is no indication that forced or compulsory labor is practiced
 in Malaysia.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Children and Young Persons (Employment) Act of 1966
 stipulates that no child under the age of 14 may be engaged in
 any employment except light work in a family enterprise, in
 public entertainment, in work performed for the Government in a
 school or training institution, or in employment as an approved
 apprentice. Children may not work more than 6 hours daily,
 more than 6 days weekly, or at night. Periodic inspections by
 the Ministry of Human Resources effectively provide enforcement
 of this law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Malaysia lacks a national minimum wage, although the Wage
 Councils Act provides for a minimum wage in those sectors and
 regions of the country where it is perceived to be most
 needed. Under the law, workers in an industry who believe they
 need the protection of a minimum wage may ask for the
 establishment of a wage council. The Act assumes that workers
 in industries where unionization is widespread can bargain for
 wages directly with employers- and do not need the protection of
 a minimum wage. Approximately 140,000 workers in the over 7-
 million-member labor force are covered by minimum wages set by
 wage councils. Minimum wages set by the wage council have not
 been revised for many years and do not, in general, provide a
 decent standard of living for a worker and his family.
 However, prevailing wages in Malaysia, even in the sectors
 covered by wage councils, are higher than the minimum wages set
 by the wage councils.
 Contract workers, including numerous illegal immigrants from
 Indonesia, increasingly perform plantation work. Working
 conditions for these workers often are significantly below
 those of direct hire plantation workers, many of whom belong to
 the National Union of Plantation Workers. Additionally, many
 immigrant workers, particularly illegal ones, may not have
 access to Malaysia's system of labor adjudication. The
 Government has investigated this problem and has taken a number
 of steps to eliminate the abuse of contract labor. For
 example, it has expanded its programs legalizing immigrant
 plantation workers; it investigates complaints of abuses; it
 endeavors to inform workers of their rights, encourages workers
 to come forward with their complaints, and warns employers to
 end abuses.
 The Employment Act of 1955 sets working hours not to exceed 8
 hours daily or 44 hours weekly (5 1/2 days). This Act sets
 overtime rates, and mandates public holidays, annual leave,
 sick leave, and maternity allowances. Minimum standards of
 occupational health and safety are patterned after the British
 
 
 928
 MALAYSIA
 Factory Act, and enforced by a unit of the Ministry of Human
 Resources. All factories are supposed to be inspected at least
 once every 15 months, but insufficient personnel precludes
 strict enforcement.
