 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is a parliamentary democracy headed by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia,
 leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Opposition parties include the
 Awami League, the Jatiyo Party, the Jamaat-E-Islami, and several smaller parties.
 The opposition began a boycott of Parliament in March 1994; opposition members
 resigned from Parfiament en masse in December 1994. Throughout 1995 the opposi-
 tion demanded that the Government establish a caretaker government to conduct
 national elections, which were scheduled to be held in early 1996.
 The Home Affairs Ministry controls the police and paramilitary forces, which bear
 primary responsibility for maintaining internal security. The army and paramilitary
 forces are responsible for security in the Cittagong Hill Tracts (CRT), where a trib-
 al force has waged a low-level insurgency for 20 years. A cease-fire between govern-
 ment forces and insurgents generally held throughout the year, although each side
 accused the other of extensive violations. Some police officers committed a number
 of serious human rights abuses.
 Bangladesh is a poor country. Annual per capita income is approximately $210;
 about 40 percent of the country's 119 million people exist on incomes insufficient
 to meet minimum daily needs. Sixty percent of the work force is involved in farm-
 ing, which accounts for approximately 40 percent of the gross domestic product.
 There is a small industrial sector, based largely on the manufacture of garments
 and jute. Efforts to reform the economy have been hampered by political stalemate,
 public sector enterprises, and other entrenched interests.
 The Government continues to restrict or deny many fundamental rights. It contin-
 ues to use national security laws to detain political opponents and other citizens
 without formal charge. Police routinely use torture and other forms of mistreatment
 in interrogating suspects. More than 100 detainees died in police custody. The Gov-
 ernment rarely convicts and punishes those responsible for torture or causing un-
 lawful deaths. A large case backlog slows the judicial process. The Government
 places some limitations on freedom of assembly. Women, minorities, the disabled,
 and indigenous people face societal discrimination. Violence against women remains
 a serious problem, as does abuse of children. The Government continues to limit
 workers' rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Rlling.-According to government figures,
 101 persons died while in custody in the first 9 months of 1995. Government records
 indicated that post mortems were performed in all cases, and with one exception,
 there was no evidence reported that any prisoner died from mistreatment. However,
 numerous press and human rights reports concerning police abuse and deaths of
 prisoners indicate that this claim is inaccurate and masks serious abuse. In the one
 possible case of death by police mistreatment reported by the Government, the Gov-
 ernment indicated that the five police officials in question were suspended and
 charged in connection with the death. Police brutality appears to occur regularly,
 and overnment inaction allows it to continue. For example, in August a 14-year-
 old gl traveled by bus to the northern town of Dinajpur and was allegedly raped
 and   aten to death by policerom whom she had hitched a ride. The Home Min-
 istry issued a press note claiming that she died after jumping from the police vehi-
 cle. Large demonstrations took place in Dinaipur in which police killed seven people;
 several hundred demonstrators were reportedly injured. Public wrath over the Gov-
 ernment's handling of the incident eventually caused the Government to transfer
 the entire police force out of Dinajpur, suspend the three officers accused in the case
 and the district Superintendent of Police, and set up judicial committee to inves-
 
 
 1295
 
 tigate the girl's death. Partly at the recommendation of the committee, whose report
 has not been made public, the three officers were eventually dismissed from their
 jobs. Nonetheless, a climate of olice impunit from punishment remains a serious
 obstacle to ending torture and abuse, andthe kNUg that result from them.
 Violence, often resulting in killings, is a feature of the political process. Dem-
 onstrators from all parties, and even within parties, often clash with police and with
 each other during rallies and demonstrations. Between January and October, vio-
 lence among student political groups reportedly resulted in 10 deaths, hundreds of
 injuries, and the closure of dozens of educational institutions. In December armed
 violence between rival student groups at Bangladesh Agricultural University in
 Mymensingh led to four deaths. Clashes between polie and student activists at
 Chittagong Medical College in December led to the arrest of 84 students and the
 indefinite closure of the college.
 In March farmers and some students, primarily in the north-central part of the
 ountry, rioted over the shortage and high price of fertilizer during the peak of the
 rice cultivation season. Farmers in at least two areas attempted to loot government
 stocks. At least 19 persons were killed when police opened fire on rioters.
 In June the Government charged former President Mohammed Ershad with or-
 dering the 1981 murder of the alleged assassin of President Zia. Ershad had already
 been serving a 20-year sentence for corruption (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Pun shment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading pun-
 ishment, police routinely employ psychological and physical torture and other abuse
 during arrests and interrogations. Torture may consist of threats, beatings, and, oc-
 casionally, the use of electric shock. In April, two boys (ages 7 and 8) were detained
 by police and beaten and given electrica shocks in an effort to extract confessions
 regading the supposed theft of a pistol. The Government rarely convicts and pun-
 ishes those responsible for torture, and a climate of impunity allows such police
 abuses to continue.
 Most prisons are overcrowded and lack adequate facilities. There are three classes
 of cells: A, B, and C. Common criminals and low-level political workers are generally
 held in C cells which often have dirt floors, no furnishings, and poor quality food.
 The use of restraining devices on prisoners in these cells is common. Prisoners in
 the C cells reportedly suffer the worst abuses, including beatings or being forced to
 kneel for long periods. Conditions in B and A cells are markedly better, A cells are
 reserved for prominent prisoners (former President Ershad's cell is reportedly
 equipped with facilities beyond those avalable in other A clls). A government-ap-
 pointed ommittee of pnivate citizens monitors prisons monthly but does not release
 its findings.
 Former President Ershad is serving a 20-year sentence for conviction on two cor-
 ruption charges; he has 14 other corruption charges pending against him in court.
 He was also charged during 1995 with the 1981 murder of the alleged assassin of
 President Zia (see Section la.). In 1992 Ershad's supporters filed a writ of habeas
 orpus in the Supreme Court asserting that his iving onditions were inhumane
 an that he has been denied proper medical care. Ershad's treatment and condition
 came under particular scrutiny in November when he was diagnosed with jaundice.
 The Government appointed a five-member medical board to examine Ershad and
 monitor his health. Following visits to the jail, Ershad family members, who claimed
 that they had been denied proper visitation rights, alleged that the former Presi-
 dent's treatment was inadequate and that he required full hospitalization. The med-
 ical board recommended that Ershad be transferred to a cityhospital. Citingsecu-
 rity concerns, the Government kept Ershad in prison. Raushan Ershad, the ex-
 President's wife, undertook a 8-day hunger strike to press for his transfer. Toward
 the end of the year Ershad's health had improved, but he is reportedly recovering
 slowly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government continued to use na-
 tional security legislation, namely the Special Powers Act (SPA) of 1974, to detain
 citizens without formal charges. There was discussion among politicians and Mem-
 bers of Parliament about repealing the Special Powers Act, but no action has been
 taken.
 Under the SPA, the Government may detain anyone deemed "a threat to the secu-
 rity of the country" for 30 days. At the end of that time, it must either charge or
 release the detainee. In practice, detainees are sometimes held for longer periods
 without charge. If the Government files charges, detainees have 15 days to appeal
 the detention order to the Home Ministry, which may grant early release.
 After 6 months, a review panel composed of two High Court judges selected by
 the Law Ministry examines cases of detainees. If the Government adequately de-
 
 
 1296
 fends its detention order, the detainee remains imprisoned; if not, the detainee is
 released. Detainees are allowed to consult with lawyers while in detention, although
 usually not until a charge is filed. Detainees may receive visitors, and incommuni-
 cado detention is not practiced.
 From January thru September, the authorities detained 2,371 persons under the
 SPA. As of October, the courts had ordered 1,918 detainees released. Government
 figures indicate that 1,417 persons were in detention under the SPA at the end of
 September.
 The Government allowed another widely used statute, the Anti-Terrorism Act, to
 expire in November 1994, leaving 489 cases pending. During the year, 37 of the
 pending cases came to trial.
 In July police detained writer Farhad Mazhar under the SPA (see Section 2.a.).
 e. Denial f Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary displays a high degree of independ-
 ence, as mandated by the Constitution, especially at the higher levels. The judiciary
 often rules against the Government in criminal, civil, and even politically controver-
 sial cases. In one politically sensitive case, an Appellate Court in June ruled in favor
 of former President Ershad's appeal of a 1991 conviction of illegally possessing a
 firearm (a 9mm pistol given to him by Saddam Hussain) without a license.
 The court system has two levels, the lower court and the Supreme Court. Both
 hear civil and criminal cases. The lower court consists of magistrates, who are part
 of the administrative branch of government, and session judges, who belong to the
 judicial branch. The Supreme Court is divided into two sections, the High Court and
 the Appellate Court. The High Court hears original cases and also reviews cases
 from the lower court. The Appellate Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals of judg-
 ments, decrees, orders, or sentences of the High Court. Rulings of the Appellate
 Court are binding on all other courts.
 Trials are public. The law provides the accused with the right to be represented
 by counsel, to review accusatory material, to call witnesses, and to appeal verdicts.
 In practice, the largely rural, illiterate population does not always understand these
 rights, nor do the authorities always respect them. There is a system of bail. How-
 ever, if ball is not granted, the law does not specify a time limit on pretrial deten-
 tion. State-funded defense attorneys are provided in only a limited number of cases,
 and there are few legal aid programs to offer financial assistance.
 There is corruption within the legal process. Small sums must be paid to a num-
 ber of court officials in order for a civil suit to be fied. While these may appear
 to be processing fees, they are more in the nature of bribes; they are not estab~ished
 by statute or regulation, are paid to officials personally, and there is no accountabil-
 ity for failure to discharge duties p aid for. Defendants can sometimes pay to avoid
 being served with a notice or suit. Because of the difficulty accessing the courts and
 because litigation is time-consuming, alternate dispute resolution by traditional vil-
 lags leaders is popular in rural communities.
 The larg eat problem of the court system is the overwhelming backlog of cases. As
 of October, close to 500,000 cases were pending in criminal and metropolitan courts,
 and more than 25,000 people, or almost 60 percent of the country's total prison case-
 load, were awaiting trial. Government records show that the period between deten-
 tion and trial averages 23 weeks, but reports by the press and human rights groups
 indicate that delays of several years are not unusual.
 Although the Government claims that it holds no political prisoners, it has ar-
 rested some opponents under the SPA for plitical reasons (see Section 2.a.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires authorities to obtain a judicial warrant before entering a boe. However,
 human rights monitors assert that the police rarely obtain warrants, and officers
 violating the procedure are not punished. In addition, the SPA permits searches
 without a warrant. Some opposition members and CT tribal leaders maintain that
 the intelligence services illegally monitor their telephones and mail.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The Shanti Bahini, a tribal group, has waged a low-level onflict in the
 Chittageng Hill Tracts (CHT) since the early 1970's to deter Bengali settlers who
 seek to exploit the Tracts' fertile and sparsely populated land. Government settle-
 ment programs increased the number of Bengali inhabitants in the CHT from 3 per-
 cent of the region's total population in 1947 to an estimated 48 percent in 1995. Al-
 though the Government probit frther settlement of the area except for the pur-
 pose of startintg a business, such as rubber planting, citizens from the flatlands con-
 tinue to move m.
 All sides-indigenous tribes, settlers, and security forces-have accused each
 other of human rights violations. It is difficult to verify facts in specific incidents
 because government travel restrictions, tight security, dificult terrain, and unsafe
 conditions created by the insurgency limit access to the area.
 
 
 1297
 In late 1993, violence erupted in the remote town of Naniarchar when a tribal
 group demonstrated for removal of a security checkpoint. A group of Bengali settlers
 reportedly attacked the demonstrators and other persons in the town and looted and
 burned tribal homes. At least 27 people were killed and 100 injured before the police
 and army restored order. A government commission which investigated the violence
 has not issued an official finding.
 There was at least one major violent incident in the CHT in 1995. In March a
 clash erupted between the Hill Students Council, a group representing indigenous
 Marina students, and a non-tribal group, and later pollce, in Bandarban. Reports
 from the area claimed that at least 50 people on all sides were injured, and several
 hundred houses destroyed by fire. There were unconfirmed reports of two deaths.
 The Government appointed a committee to investigate the incident, but no report
 had been issued by year's end.
 The Government continued talks with Shanti Bahini's political wing, the Jana
 Sanghati Samiti (JSS), and the two sides agreed at short, regular intervals to ex-
 tend their cease-fire, the latest until March 31, 1996, when talks between the two
 groups were scheduled to resume. The Government also extended the amnesty for
 insurgents as long as the dialogue with the Shanti Bahini continues.
 Few Chakma tribal members who had fled the conflict in the CHT and sought
 shelter in refugee camps in India returned to Bangladesh in 1995. Officially there
 was no repatriation during 1995, in part because the Shanti Bahini allegedly dis-
 couraged refugees from repatriating; however, government officials note tha some
 refugees returned voluntarily and have been assisted in their resettlement. Some or-
 ganizations based in the Hill Tracts continue to assert that conditions were not suit-
 able for repatriation because of government repression.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 expression, and the press, subject to "reasonable restrictions" in the interest of secu-
 rity, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency, or morality, or to
 prohibit defamation or incitement to an offense. With some exceptions-a principal
 one being perceived criticism of Islam-the Government generally respects freedom
 of speeh.
 There are frequent public rallies and speeches in opposition to government poli-
 cies. Opposition political parties have continued to use public rallies as the main
 venue to express their views after they walked out of the Parliament in early 1994.
 Newspaper ownershi and content are not subject to government restriction. The
 press, numbering hundreds of daily and weekly publications, is a forum for a wide
 range ofvies
 Government seeks to influence newspapers by the placement of advertising.
 Some editors complain that the Government's placement of advertising to reward
 supporters and to punish critical newspapers leads to self-censorship.
 The Government now allows the import of newsprint, but most newspapers still
 rely on the cheaper, subsidized product from the country's one newsprint mill, which
 is government-owned. Although the Government claims that it allocates newsprint
 according  to  a  paper's  circulation, some  newspaper   owners  allege  that
 progovernment papers receive preference in the setting of distribution quotas.
 Foreign publications are subject to censorship. While there has been no official
 banning of foreign books this year, at least one English-language book has been
 kept from circulation. The Government banned a September issue of Time magazine
 and censored a December issue of Newsweek because they contained allegedly ob-
 scene photographs. In November the Government banned a book entitled "Woman"
 that allegedly offended religious beliefs. The book, written by a professor at Dhaka
 University, had been in circulation since 1992. The circulation of about 10 local
 books has been prohibited because of their perceived misrepresentation of Islam.
 In June three editors of the daily Janakantha, arrested in 1994 for printing a sa-
 tirical fable mocking Islamic clerics who misinterpret the Koran, were formally
 charged with attacking religious sentiments. Their appeal to the High Court is
 pending.
 .In July officers of the police Special Branch invoked the Special Powers Act to
 detain Farhad Mazhar, chairman of the Board of Editors of the weekly Bangla peri-
 odical Chinta. The Government was reportedly unhappy with a series of articles
 about the December 1994 Ansar Mutiny, a highly-publicized protest in the main
 Dhaka garrison of the Ansars, a para-ia    security force. Mazhar spent 28 days
 in prison before the High Court declared his detention illegal. F   ournalists ar-
 rested in October for defamation in connection with corruption charges made
 against a local official were released on bail later that month.
 
 
 1298
 In September a government minister fied a defamation suit against three news-
 paper editors for publishing a statement against him from one of the leaders of his
 own party. The court issued warrants for their arrest; in the subsequent hearing,
 the t=ree editors were granted bail.
 Feminist author Tasima Nasreen, whose writings and statements provoked death
 threats from some Islamic groups in 1993 and 1994, did not return to Bangladesh
 following her departure for Europe in August 1994. The Government charged
 Nasreen under a section of the Penal Code which stipulates punishment for anyone
 convicted of intentionally insulting religious beliefs. TheaHigh Court ruled in Janu-
 ary that the Government must provide a special authorization to bring charges
 against Nasreen because her alleged acts took place in a foreign country. The Gov-
 ernment opted to pursue the case in spite of several opportunities during the year
 to let it drop. In a subsequent hearing, the High Court granted the Government au-
 thorization to proceed with the case and ordered the trial, which has been postponed
 several times already this year, to proceed. Although the case was scheduled to re-
 sume in October, a series of legal maneuvers and postponements have continued to
 stall proceedings. The next hearing in the case is currently scheduled for early 1996.
 Nasreen may be tried in absentia. The Government has taken no action against
 those who issued death threats against Nasreen, even though such threats also  -
 late the law.
 The Government owns and controls radio and television, which provide more ex-
 tensive and favorable coverage of the Government than of the opposition. One legal
 rights group filed a case with the High Court seeking permission to operate inde-
 pendent television stations.
 The availability of Cable News Network and the British Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion's international news and features, rebroadcast for several hours a day on gov-
 ernment television, has considerably increased the public's access to international
 news. There are no restrictions on installation of satellite dishes, so some citizens
 have increased access to foreign media and entertainment.
 The Government's film censor board continues to exercise control over films.
 Three films, all produced locally, have been banned this year, primarily for alleged
 distortions of the National Independence Movement. In general, academic freedom
 is respected. However, research on sensitive topics, which may be perceived to be
 injurious to religious sentiments or traditional social customs, is not encouraged.
 Similarly, studies relating to bureaucracy and the military need special permission
 from the Government. Permission to pursue such research may not be formally de-
 nied, but researchers may find access to apprpriate materials and sources ex-
 tremely difficult. In a few cases, the published work may be banned.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoiation.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of every citizen to form associations, subject to "reasonable restrictions"
 in the interest of morality or public order and in general this right is respected. In
 practice, individuals are free to join private groups, but a local magistrate must ap-
 prove public meetings. Occasionally, the Government prohibits rallies for security
 reasons.
 The Government frequently, however, interferes with opposition rallies and public
 meetings. Government officials also often cite a statute which allows public assem-
 blies to be prohibited-to prevent possible violence-if two or more parties have
 scheduled rallies for the same time and place. Opposition leaders claim that the rul-
 in  party, after learning of planned opposition public gatherings, schedules other
 raies for the same time and place. Government authorities then cancel both events,
 effectively thwarting the opposition's right to public assembly.
 The Government and the opposition in October 1994 entered into a political dia-
 logue in which one agenda item was agreement on a code of conduct that would ad-
 dress issues such as public assemblies. The dialogue failed when the opposition re-
 fused to compromise on its demand for a careter government to supervise the
 next national elections; there was no further progress on the issue in 1995.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Approximately 90 percent of Bangladesh's 119 million
 people are Muslim. The Constitution establishes Islam as the state religion but also
 stipulates the right to practice the religion of one's choice. However, some members
 of the Iindu, Christian, and Buddhist minorities continue to perceive and experi-
 ence discrimination toward them from the majority community (see Section 5).
 The law permits citizens to proselytize. However, strong social resistance to con-
 version from Islam means that many of the missionary efforts by non-Muslims are
 aimed at Hindus and tribal groups.The Government allows various religions to es-
 tablish places of worship, train clergy, travel for religious purposes, and maintain
 links with coreligionists abroad. Foreign missionaries may work in Bangladesh, but
 their right to proselytize is not protected by the Constitution. Some missionaries
 have encountered difficulties in obtaining residence permits or reentry visas.
 
 
 1299
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 pafriation.--Citizens are able to move freely within the country. Travel by foreign-
 ers is restricted in the CHT and some other border areas. Citizens are generally free
 to travel abroad and emigrate. The right of repatriation is observed.
 Approximately 250,000 Rohingyas (Muslims from Burma's Arakan Province)
 crossed into southeastern Bangladesh in late 1991 and early 1992, fleeing repres-
 sion. Approximately 51,000 Rohingyas remain in 6 camps in he area of Cox's Bazar.
 The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Government were able
 to intercede in specific cases to avoid forced repatriation by Bangladeshi authorities.
 Efforts to repatriate the refugees slowed over the summer because Burmese authori-
 ties issued a limited number of clearances. The UNHCR estimates that the majority
 of the remaining refugees will repatriate in 1996.
 There are about 238,000 non-Bengali Muslims, known as Biharis, who have re-
 mained in Bangladesh since 1971 awaiting settlement in Pakistan (see Pakistan re-
 port).
 Bangladesh is not a party to the 1951 United Nations convention and its 1967
 protocol relating to the status of refugees. However, the Government generally co-
 operates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refu-
 gees, such as the Rohingyas. Occasional abuses such as the forced return or mis-
 treatment of individual refugees have been reported, but these appear to be the ex-
 ception rather than the rule.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Bangladesh is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which elections by secret
 ballot are held on the basis of universal suffrage. Members of Parliament (M.P.'s)
 are elected at least every 5 years. The Parliament has 300 elected members, with
 30 additional seats reserved for women who are chosen by Parliament.
 The last national elections were held in 1991 after the fall of the Government of
 H.M. Ershad. The BNP won a plurality of seats. It cooperated with the Jamaat-E-
 Islami Party to elect enough female legislators to give the BNP a slim majority and
 enable it to form a government. The opposition is led by Sheikh Hasina Wajed and
 her Awami League Party. While there are a large number of minor parties, the most
 significant opposition parties are the Awami League, the Jatiyo Party (former Presi-
 dent Ershad s party), and the Jamaat-E-Islami, the major Islamic political party.
 The Awami League and other opposition groups charged the BP with intimida-
 tion and vote-rigging in a parliamentary by-election in March 1994 in the district
 of Magura, which the BNP won. They began a boycott of Parliament and have tried,
 thus far unsuccessfully, to force the Government to resign in favor of a caretaker
 government, which would oversee new elections. The opposition Members of Par-
 liament resigned en masse on December 28, 1994. In June 143 opposition members
 formally lost their seats; the Constitution mandates that parliamentarians absent
 for 90 working days must surrender their seats. Parliament now consists largely of
 one party, the ruling BNP.
 In addition to the 30 parliamentary seats reserved for women (whose occupants
 are chosen by Parliament), women are free to contest any seat in Parliament. Some
 women were elected in their own right in the last national election, making for a
 total of 35 women M.P.'s before the boycott and resignation of major opposition
 party membrs.
 While seats are not specifically reserved for them, other minority groups, such as
 tribal peoples, are represented in the legislature. Prior to the opposition's resigna-
 tion, there were 12 members from minority groups in the 330-seat Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally permits human rights groups to conduct their activi-
 ties. In 1995 such groups published reports, held press conferences, and issued ap-
 peals to the Government with regard to specific cases.
 The Government is sensitive to international opinion regarding human rights is-
 sues. It sought to defend its handling of the Taslima Nasreen case but was open
 to dialogue with international organizations and foreign diplomatic missions.
 The Government has put pressure on individual human rights advocates. Al-
 though the Government issued a reentry visa in April to Father Richard Timm, a
 Catholic priest and human rights advocate who has worked in Bangladesh for over
 40 years, the process took more than a year and the visa was valid for only 3
 months. Father Timm reapplied for an extension in July, and in November received
 a 6-month visa, which can be renewed. In a similar case, after more than a year
 of deliberation, the Government granted a similar 6-month visa to Father Eugene
 
 
 1300
 Homrich, a long-time resident American priest, who has worked for many years in
 the Madhupur Forest region with the Garos, a minority group.
 The Government refused to register the Bangladesh Hu an Rights Commission!s
 Treatment Center for Trauma Victims, making it impossible for the Center to re-
 ceive funds from foreign donor organizations. Many representatives of local human
 rights groups were physically attacked by religious extremists who considered their
 activities "un-Islamic. The Government failed to bring to justice those who engaged
 in such violence.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "all citizens are equal before the law and are entitled
 to equal protection by the law." In practice, laws aimed at eliminating discrimina-
 tion are not strongly enforced. In this context, women, children, minority groups,
 and the disabled often confront social and economic disadvantages.
 Women.-Violence against women is difficult to quantify because of unreliable sta-
 tistics, but wife beating appears to be widespread. The Government allows programs
 that document and counter domestic violence. In 1995 human rights groups and the
 press reported many incidents of violence against women, in only some of which the
 perpetrators were reportedly prosecuted. In villages, vigilante groups, sometimes led
 by religious leaders, meted out humiliating, painful punishments, including whip-
 ping, to women accused of moral offenses. The Government has enacted laws specifi-
 cally prohibiting certain forms of discrimination ag ainst women, including the
 Antidowry Prohibition Act of 1980 and the Cruelty to Women Law of 1983. Enforce-
 ment of these laws is weak, however, especially in rural areas. The Government sel-
 dom rosecutes vigorously those cases that are filed. A new law, the Women Repres-
 sion law, was enacted in August but has been greeted with skepticism by women s
 groups, which argue that enforcement of existing laws rather than the promulgation
 of new ones should be the priority. Government records through September indicate
 that 78 persons were arrested under the Women Repression Law.
 Although there has been slow improvement over the last few years, women re-
 main in a subordinate position in society, and the Government has not acted to pro-
 tect their basic freedoms. Only 20 percent of women are literate, compared to 35
 to 40 percent of the general population. In rural areas, only 30 percent of primary
 school students are female; less than 25 percent at the secondary level, and below
 15 percent at the college and university level. Women are often unaware of their
 rights, owing to hi gh illiteracy rates and unequal educational opportunities. Strong
 social stigmas and lack of economic means to obtain legal assistance frequently keep
 women from seeking redress in the courts.
 According to the 1961 Muslim Family Ordinance, female heirs receive less inherit-
 ance than male heirs, and wives are more restricted in divorce rights. Men are per-
 mitted to have up to four wives. Laws provide some protection for women against
 arbitrary divorce and the taking of additional wives by husbands without the first
 wife's consent, but the protections generally apply only to registered marriages.
 Marriages in the countryside are often not registered because of the high fees.
 While employment opportunities have been stronger for women than for men in
 the past few years, this is almost entirely due to the growth of the garment indus-
 try, in which female workers are prevalent. Women still occupy only a small fraction
 of other wage-earning jobs, and hold fewer than 5 percent of government jobs. The
 Government s policy to include more women in government jobs has had limited ef-
 fect.
 Children.-The Government undertakes programs in the areas of primary edu-
 cation, health, family planning, and nutrition. The Government made universal pri-
 mary education mandatory in 1991, but stated that it could not fully implement the
 law because of a lack of resources. Little progress was made in 1995. The Govern-
 ment has also initiated programs that offer incentives for girls to remain in school.
 Human rights monitors continue to report that many children have been aban-
 doned, kidnaped, sold into bondage, and employed as prostitutes. One human rights
 group claims that there are about 29,000 child prostitutes. The law does not allow
 anyone under age 18 to engage in prostitution and stipulates a maximum sentence
 of life imprisonment for persons found guilty of forcing a child into prostitution.
 However, procurers of minors are rarely prosecuted. Prostitution is legal for those
 over 18 with government certification.
 International trafficking in both women and children, primarily to the Middle
 East, India, Pakistan, and Southeast Asia, is difficult to quantify but appears to be
 extensive. Twelve victims of a child-smuggling ring, ranging in age from 6 to 12 and
 allegedly enroute to Dubai to work as jockeys in camel racing, were repatriated from
 India in October. The Government has expressea concern about the problem and

 has been working with U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NG(Os)
 to seek ways to combat it.
 People With Disabilities.-The laws provide for equal treatment and freedom from
 discrimination for the disabled, but they often confront social and economic dis-
 advantages. The Government has not enacted specific legislation or otherwise man-
 dated accessibility for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Tribal peoples, especially in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, have
 a marginal ability to influence decisions concerning the use of their lands. Until
 1985 the Government regularly parceled out land in the Chittagong Hill Tracts to
 Bengali settlers.
 The Government has moved toward granting the tribal peoples more authority in
 the Chittagong Hill Tracts. In July 1991, tribal-dominated local government councils
 assumed control over primary education, health, family welfare and the agricultural
 extension rervice, although the real extent of their autonomy remains unclear. How-
 ever, government security forces continue to control law and order as well as land
 use (see Section 1.g.).
 Tribal peoples in other areas have also reported loss of land to Bengali Muslims
 through questionable legal practices and other means. For example, the Garo, who
 live in the Madhapur Forest region in north central Bangladesh, have encountered
 problems in maintaining their cultural traditions and livelihoods in the face of refor-
 estation projects. Human rights monitors in the region claim that the Garos are
 being harassed and intimidated into leaving their homes to make way for govern-
 ment-run, internationally financed projects.
 Religious Minorities.-Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists make up an estimated
 10 percent of the population. Although the Government is secular, religion exerts
 a powerful influence on politics. The Government is sensitive to the Muslim con-
 sciousness of the majority of its citizens and has sought the political support of the
 Jamaat-E-Islami, the country's largest Islamic political party.
 In scattered incidents throughout the country, Islamic extremists violently at-
 tacked women, religious minorities, and development workers. The Government gen-
 erally failed to denounce, investigate, and prosecute perpetrators of these attacks.
 Among the most serious attacks were those carried out against NGO's accused of
 conducting anti-Islamic activities. Some of the violence against NGO's was prompted
 when Islamic religious leaders claimed that NGO's denigrated Islam and coerced
 Muslims to convert to Christianity.
 Religious minorities are in practice disadvantaged in such areas as access to gov-
 ernment jobs and political office. Selection boards in the government services are
 often without minority group representation.
 Property ownership, particularly among Hindus, has been a contentious issue
 since independence, when many Hindus lost landholdings because of anti-Hindu dis-
 crimination in the application of the law. Reported cases of violence directed against
 religious minority communities have also resulted in the loss of property most re-
 cently in December 1992 after Hindus in India destroyed the Babri mosque. Such
 intercommunal violence has caused some members of religious minority groups to
 depart the country. However, there were no significant instances of intercommunal
 violence in 1995.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association,
 the right to join unions, and, with government approval, the right to form a union.
 Approximately 1.6 million members of the country's total work force of about 45 to
 50 million workers belong to unions. Only about 3 million workers are involved in
 the formal industrial sector. There is a large unreported informal sector, regarding
 which no reliable labor statistics exist. While a very small proportion of the labor
 force is unionized, unions are very strong in certain sectors such as jute, textiles,
 and transportation. Unions in these industries have been able on occasion to win
 government concessions on wages and other demands.
 For a union to obtain and maintain its registration, 30 percent employee partici-
 ation in the workplace is required. However, would-be unionists are technically for-
 bidden to engage in any labor "activities" prior to registration. Labor activists have
 protested that this requirement severely restricts workers' freedom to associate and
 orne.
 Wh the exception of workers in the railway, postal, telegraph and telephone de-
 partments, government civil servants are forbidden to join unions. This ban also ap-
 plies to security-related government employees such as the military and police. Ban-
 gladesh civil servants forbidden to join unions, such as teachers and nurses, have
 formed associations that perform functions similar to labor unions, that is, providing
 for members' welfare, offering legal services, and airing grievances. Collective bar-
 
 
 1302
 gaining, however, is prohibited. Some workers have formed unregistered unions,
 particularly university employees and workers in the construction and transport
 (both public and private) industries.
 A small number of workers in the export processing zones (EPZ's) have also skirt-
 ed prohibitions on forming unions by setting up associations. In the burgeoning gar-
 ment industry there have been numerous complaints of workers being harassed and
 fired in some factories for trying to organize unions.
 Ten to 15 percent of Bangladehs approximately 4,200 labor unions are affiliated
 with 23 officially registered National 1rade Union (NTU) centers (there are also sev-
 eral unregistered NTU's). There are no legal restrictions on political activities by
 labor unions. However, the calling of nationwide general strikes or transportation
 blockades by unions is considered a criminal rather than a political act and is thus
 forbidden. Some unions complained that the Government used its Antiterrorism
 Law as a means to suppress both opposition political workers and union members
 rather than bona fide terrorists. In November 1994, however, the Antiterrorism Law
 lapsed and the Government decided not to renew it-no arrests of labor leaders
 under the Antiterrorism Law had been made since 1993.
 While unions are not part of the government structure, they are highly politicized.
 Virtually all NTU centers are affiliated with political parties, including one with the
 ruling BNP. Some unions are militant and engage in intimidation and vandalism.
 Ilegal blockades of public transportation routes by strikers occurred several times
 during the year, with scattered and sometimes serious violence. The worst such case
 occurred in February, when clashes between striking jute and textile workers and
 police left several strikers dead. Pitched battles between members of rival labor
 unions occur regularly;, hundreds were injured (and at least two combatants died)
 in 1995 in various large jute and textile mills, as well as in the inland water trans-
 port sector. Fighting sometimes concerns control of rackets or extortion payoffs, and
 typ ically involves knives, guns, and homemade bombs.
 Workers are eligible for membership on their unions' executive staff, the size of
 which is set by law in proportion to the number of union members. Registration of
 a union may only be canceled by the Registrar of Trade Unions with the concur-
 rence of the Labor Court, but no such actions were known to have been taken this
 year. Several cases were filed, invariably by employers claiming that a union's mem-
 ership had fallen below the requisite threshhold, but because of a backlog and
 other administrative problems, these cases have not yet been adjudicated. There are
 no restrictions on affiliation with international labor organizations, and unions and
 federations maintain a variety of such links. Trade unionists are required to obtain
 government clearance to travel to International Labor Organization (ILO) meetings,
 but no denials of clearances were reported.
 The right to strike is not specifically recognized in the law, but strikes are a com-
 mon form of protest. The most prominent recent strikes were called by Inland Water
 Transport employees claiming that they were not receiving the required minimum
 wage, and by jute and textile workers seeking increased wages and benefits along
 with guarantees against future privatization and retrenchment. Employees orga-
 nized in professional associations or nonregistered unions also strike. In 1995,
 nurses, private elementary teachers, members of the nonadministrative cadre of the
 civil service, and the Bangladesh Medical Association (government-employed doc-
 tors) were among the striking groups. They sought better pay or benefits, a greater
 share of the public budget, inclusion in the public sector, or administrative reform.
 University teachers strike for short periods from time to time over the continuing
 problem of campus violence.
 General strikes continue to be used by the political opposition to pressure the
 Government to meet its political demands, causing significant economic and social
 disruption through loss of work hours and production. Wildcat strikes are illegal but
 occur frequently, with varying government response. Wildcat strikes in the trans-
 port sector are particularly common.
 The Essential Services Ordinance permits the Government to bar strikes for 3
 months in any sector it declares "essential." This ban, generally obeyed, has so far
 been applied to national airline pilots, water supply workers, shipping oerations
 employees and electricity supply workers. The bans tend to be renewed every 3
 months. The Government is empowered to prohibit a strike or lockout at any time
 before or after the strike or lockout begins and to refer the dispute to the Labor
 Court. Mechanisms for conciliation, arbitration and Labor Court dispute resolution
 were established under the Industrial Relations Ordinance of 1969. Workers have
 the right to strike in the event of a failure to settle. If a strike lasts 30 days or
 longer, the Government may prohibit the strike and refer the dispute to the Labor
 Court for adjudication. This has not happened since 1993.
 
 
 1303
 There are provisions in the Bangladesh Industrial Relations Ordinance for immu-
 nity of registered unions or union officers from civil liability. Enforcement of these
 provisions is uneven. In the case of iegal work actions, such as transportation
 blockades, police have arrested union members under either the Special Powers Act,
 the Antiterrorism Law (now no longer in effect), or regular criminal codes.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Free collective bargaining is
 legal only for private sector workers, on condition that the workers are represented
 by unions legally registered as collective bargaining agents by the Registrar of
 Trade Unions. Collective bargaining occurs on occasion in large private enterprises
 such as pharmaceuticals, jute and textiles, but with unemployment in the 30 per-
 cent range, workers' concerns with job security often outweigh wage and other is-
 sues. Collective bargaining generally does not occur in small private enterprises.
 Public sector workers' pay levels and other benefits are recommended by the Na-
 tional Pay and Wages Commission. The Commission's recommendations are binding
 and may not be disputed except on the issue of implementation.
 Under the Industrial Relations Ordinance, there is considerable leeway for dis-
 crimination against union members and organizers by employers. For example, the
 Ordinance allows arbitrary transfer of workers suspected of union activities. Com-
 plaints that employers routinely engage in antiunion discrimination are particularly
 common in the garment industry. In practice, private sector employers tend to dis-
 courage any union activity. The Registrar of Trade Unions rules on discrimination
 complaints. In a number of cases the Labor Court has ordered the reinstatement
 of workers fired for union activities. However, the Court's overall effectiveness is
 hampered by a serious case backlog, and there have also been allegations that some
 of its deliberations have been corrupted by employers.
 Current law prohibits professional and industry-based unions in Bangladesh's two
 Export Processing Zones (EPZ's). In addition to the prohibition on unions, no collec-
 tive bargaining takes place in the EPZ's. Although no action has so far been taken
 the Government has stated that restrictions on unions in the EPZ's will be lifted
 by 1997.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. The Factories Act and the Shops and Establishment Act, both
 passed in 1965, set up inspection mechanisms to enforce laws against forced labor.
 These laws are not rigorously enforced, partly because resources for enforcement are
 few. While Bangladesh does not experience large-scale bonded labor, there is forced
 labor to the extent that workers are often required to work later than stipulated
 by law, with no special compensation. This is a notable problem in the garment in-
 dstry, for example, which operates in high-volume, short-deadline modes of produc-
 tion.
 d. Minimum Aqe for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits labor by chil-
 dren. The Factores Act of 1965 bars children under age 14 from working in fac-
 tories. This law also stipulates that young workers (that is, children and adoles-
 cents) are allowed to work only a maximum 5-hour day and only between the hours
 of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.
 In reality, enforcement of these rules is inadequate. According to a 1990 labor
 force survey by the Bureau of Statistics, the country has 5.7 million working chil-
 dren 10 to 14 years of age. United Nations estimates are that about one-third of
 Bangladesh's population under the age of 18-the child labor definition is 14-is en-
 gaged in some type of formal or informal employment. Children are commonly seen
 riving rickshaws, breaking bricks at construction sites, carrying fruits, vegetables,
 and dry goods for shoppers at markets, and working at tea stalls. They are found
 as peelers, packers, and beach combers in the shrimp industry, and work side-by-
 side with other family members in small-scale and subsistence agriculture. Children
 also routinely perform domestic work. Cases of children being physically abused and
 occasionally killed by the head of household where they work are reported in the
 press. Under the law, every child must attend school through the fifth grade. How-
 ever, the Government continues to maintain that it does not yet have the resources
 to implement this law effectively.
 In anticipation of possible foreign legislation prohibiting the import of products
 made by child labor, thousands o underage workers employed in the ready-made
 garment industry were fired in 1993. Many were probably rehired later by other fac-
 tories or in subcontracting operations.
 Concerned about a possible boycott of Bangladeshi garments by foreign child labor
 advocacy groups, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Associa-
 tion (BGMA) pledged to make its member factories child labor-free. Protracted ne-
 gotiations were held to ensure that the dismissed children were placed into schools
 rather than onto the streets. These talks led to the July agement on a Memoran-
 dum of Understanding (MOU) between the BGMEA, the U.N.'s Chidren Fund, and
 
 
 1304
 
 the ILO to eliminate child labor in the garment sector in a way that provides a safe-
 ty net for dismissed children. The MOU establishes a cooperative program to iden-
 tify underage workers (through surveys of the garment factories) and then to re-
 move them from their factories and place them in new schools. The children will
 receive a monthly stipend to help replace their lost income. According to the MOU
 qualified family members will be hired to replace child workers when possible, and
 children will not be replaced until surveys are complete and educational prograrn
 are in place. Completed in late October, the surveys identified some 12,000 children
 working in the garment sector. Preparations for opening the first schools under the
 MOU were well advanced by year's end.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Instead
 the Wage Commission, which convenes every several years, sets wages and benefits
 industry by industry. In most cases, private sector employers ignore this wage struc-
 ture, arguing that low labor productivity vitiates any argument for a set wage. In
 1993 the Confederation of Labor Unions (SKOP) won a minimum wage agreement
 for public sector factory workers that was slightly above the level recommended by
 the 1992 Wage Commission. According the he agreement, government factory work-
 ers receive about $24 (950 taka) a month plus benefits. Private sector wages tend
 to fall below the total government wage and benefits package. Organized jute and
 textile workers in particular have called strikes in an attempt to win wage parity
 for their industrys private sector workers. The average monthly wage is sufficient
 to support life, but is not by any means a comfortable wage for a family.
 The law sets a standard -hour workweek with 1 day off. A 60-hour workweek,
 inclusive of a maximum 12 hours of overtime, is allowed. The law is poorly enforced
 in industries such as hosiery and ready-made garments.
 The Factories Act of 1965 nominally sets occupational health and safety stand-
 ards. The law is comprehensive but appears to be largely ignored by many employ-
 ers. Workers may resort to legal action for enforcement of the law's provisions, but
 few cases are actually prosecuted. Enforcement by the Labor Ministry's industrial
 inspectors is weak. Due to high unemployment and inadequate enforcement of the
 laws, workers demanding correction of dangerous working conditions or refusing to
 participate in perceived dangerous activities risk losing their jobs.
