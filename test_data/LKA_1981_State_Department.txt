 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka has had a praiseworthy record on human
 rights over most of the 33 years of its independent
 existence -- the result of a vigorous and free democratic
 system which has seen six orderly and constitutional
 changes of government in eight national elections. In
 1978, a new constitution gave greater power to an executive
 independent of the Parliament.
 The past year has seen the basic human rights of Sri
 Lanka's 14.8 million citizens somewhat abridged, however,
 by two declarations of states of emergency -- the conse-
 quence of serious tension and violence between members of
 the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamil communities,
 of a temporary breakdown in the government's civil law and
 order capabilities in the Tamil area of Jaffna and of an
 upsurge in terrorist-type activities by extremists in both
 communities in several areas of the island republic. These
 events have resulted in a temporary suspension of the right
 of habeas corpus, in a rise in preventive and arbitrary
 arrests, in deployment of troops in a police role and in
 some evidence of third-degree tactics by poliue officials.
 The present government of President Jayewardene is
 attempting to restore calm, through negotiations with
 representatives of the Tamil community and through prose-
 cution of those found to be malefactors in both communi-
 ties, in order to get on with its programs of balanced
 economic development and liberalized trade and investment
 policies, which are aimed at bringing about an improvement
 in the overall standard of living of all Sri Lankans --
 Sinhalese and Tamil alike.
 Also of concern to civil libertarians has been the
 continued imposition of civic disabilities upon former
 prime minister Bandaranaike and two other officials of the
 previous government, following a special commission's
 investigation of abuse of power charges against them.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution of Sri Lanka (1978) states that "No
 person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment." There have been no
 documented accusations of torture by forces of law and
 order in the year under review.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Police are known to be rough in interrogating persons
 arrested as suspects in terrorism cases. Since most
 terrorist acts have been perpetrated (largely against
 policemen) by extremist Tamil organizations advocating
 creation of a separate Tamil state by violent means, many
 detainees subjected to rough treatment at the hands of the
 largely Sinhalese police force have been Tamil. During the
 
 (1094)
 
 
 1095
 police riots and subsequent martial law in Jaffna May
 31-June 4, seven persons were killed under circumstances
 which may be described as summary execution or even
 murder.
 By law, any accusations of harsh treatment must be
 filed within a month of the incident if disciplinary
 action is to be taken.
 As in many developing countries, prison conditions
 are both crowded and primitive -- largely due to budgetary
 constraints. Sri Lankan prisons are overcrowded, because
 of both the increase in the number of convicted prisoners
 accompanying population growth, and the large numbers of
 remand prisoners who either cannot meet bail or whose
 trials are delayed in the congested court systems..
 Accommodations, sanitary facilities and health services
 are severely strained. The government recognizes this
 problem and appointed a prison reform committee, which
 recommended in 1980 construction of new prisons, improved
 rehabilitation programs and alternatives to continued
 custody for those awaiting trial on minor offenses. The
 government is currently considering measures to alleviate
 congestion and to reduce the number of remand prisoners.
 c. Disappearances
 There were no allegations of disappearances in 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 On March 25, 1981, a robbery took place at the
 People's Bank in Neerveli (Jaffna District, in the northern
 Tamil area), during which two policemen were killed and
 nearly $400,000 was stolen. Believing the robbery to have
 been the work of a Tamil extremist group known as the
 "Tamil Tigers", the police took into custody some 80
 persons, without initially informing either the detainees
 or their relatives of the charge. Only after numerous
 inquiries did relatives ascertain the nature of the charges
 and the locations of the incarcerated persons. The govern-
 ment justifies continued detention of 22 suspects on the
 grounds that they are connected to a terrorist movement
 that has already killed 20 policemen since 1977, and that
 provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1979
 apply in their case. The act permits detention for an
 initial period of 3 days before court appearance and pre-
 ventive detention of up to 18 months, if ordered by the
 minister of internal security. Relatives of thirteen
 detainees filed writs of habeas corpus; four applications
 were considered by the court of appeal, and the commander
 of the army was ordered by the presiding justice to produce
 the detainees in court on July 28. The applications were
 subsequently denied on September 10. The presiding justice
 did direct that lawyers and the judicial medical officer
 should have ready access to the detainees at the army camp.
 The justice noted that arrests were made under provisions
 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and that the detainees
 were safer in military custody than if they were in ordi-
 nary prisons, in the company of largely Sinhalese prisoners.
 Four persons (including two policemen) are believed to be
 under detention in connection with a terrorist attack on
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 70
 
 
 1096
 
 Annacottai police station, in the north, on July 28;
 eight others have also been held in other cases.
 Under normal circumstances, citizens are protected
 against arbitrary arrest and imprisonment by an article
 of the constitution which reads: "No person shall be
 arrested except according to procedure established by law.
 Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for
 his arrest." An arrested person must be produced within
 24 hours before a magistrate, who can authorize further
 detention for certain serious crimes; an accused can be
 detained up to three months without bail, and longer if
 a court so rules. A person detained under the Prevention
 of Terrorism Act cannot appeal preventive detention to
 the courts; a presidentially appointed advisory board
 reviews individual cases.
 A state of emergency was declared on two occasions
 in 1981: once on June 2 in Jaffna (Tamil area in the
 north), after the killing of two policemen and subsequent
 widespread looting and arson by police -- it was extended
 to the whole country on June 4 until June 9; and once
 nation-wide on August 17, in the wake of violence against
 Tamil tea estate workers in the central highlands. This
 nationwide emergency lapsed January 17, 1982. Special
 emergency regulations provided for preventive detention,
 and for unlimited detention for offenses under the regula-
 tions, after commitment by a magistrate.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 Both the constitution and the law provide, under
 normal circumstances, that persons are entitled to a fair
 trial in a competent court, to be represented by counsel,
 to be informed of the charges brought against them and to
 have access to the evidence against them. Trial by jury
 is the custom in Sri Lanka, although anti-terrorism legis-
 lation requires trials by justices only, on the grounds
 that juries in such cases can be intimidated.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Search or arrest warrants are required to enter
 premises in ordinary circumstances. This is eroded, how-
 ever, by the Prevention of Terrorism Act, under which
 police officers above a certain rank are not required to
 have warrants to enter and search any premises.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, publication, religion and assembly
 are guaranteed by the constitution. Chapter II of the
 constitution gives Buddhism the "foremost place," and
 states that it shall be the "duty of the state to protect
 and foster the (religion of the Buddha)." While giving
 Buddhism a preferred position, other articles in the
 constitution guarantee the freedom of the individual to
 "have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice" and
 to "manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance,
 practice and teaching...."
 
 
 1097
 The government controls two of five major newspaper
 groups and owns the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation.
 Such control constrains, but does not preclude, criticism
 against the government.  There is a wide range of smaller
 publications -- daily, weekly, and monthly -- many of which
 are organs of political parties. Independent publications
 complain of government pressures to control criticism.
 There is, nevertheless, an active expression of differing
 views in the press. Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act,
 direct censorship can be invoked and, in the wake of the
 island-wide declaration of emergency on August 17 (following
 attacks on tea estate Tamils), the government imposed
 censorship on August 21. This applied only to communal
 news and remained in effect through December 16, 1981.
 There was one instance of interdiction of.a telex of
 articles intended for major Western newspapers outside Sri
 Lanka.
 Freedom of assembly generally is not restricted.
 Political and other rallies may be held in public places,
 subject to permits, but no political party is allowed to
 hold political processions or street demonstrations under
 present emergency regulations.
 There is no evidence of interference in scholarly
 research at Sri Lankan colleges, universities, and research
 institutes; nor have there been any instances of harassment
 or persecution of professional groups during the past year.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country and the right
 to choose one's place of residence are guaranteed by the
 constitution and permitted in practice. The present govern-
 ment of Sri Lanka, which came to power in 1977, lifted the
 exit visa requirement for certain categories of people, and
 now permits virtually unimpeded emigration by any Sri Lankan
 citizen. The right to free emigration has been particularly
 appreciated by the minority Tamil population in the north,
 for free emigration has opened up possibilities of better-
 paying jobs in the Middle East, where many Sri Lankans,
 Tamil and Sinhalese, now work. Women are not subjected to
 different rules regarding travel.
 The right of voluntary repatriation is specifically
 guaranteed by an article which states that "every citizen
 is entitled to the freedom to return to Sri Lanka." The
 government recently demonstrated its adherence to this
 principle, when over 100 (out of some 2,500) Tamil youths
 from the Jaffna area in the north voluntarily returned to
 Sri Lanka from West Berlin in July 1981, after having
 previously demanded political asylum. After initial ques-
 tioning at Colombo International Airport, all but a handful
 (who were further questioned for passport irregularities)
 returned to their homes in Sri Lanka.
 As recently as June 1981, the government reiterated
 its reluctance to permit refugees (in the June case, 17
 Vietnamese boat people).an even temporary stay on Sri Lankan
 soil while a permanent recipient country was sought. Some
 Sri Lankan citizens (almost entirely Tamil) have presented
 themselves as refugees in a few Western European countries
 and requested political asylum.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Sri Lanka is a multiparty democracy with an executive
 president and a popularly elected parliament. Six of eight
 general elections since independence have resulted in a
 change of government, demonstrating the viability and
 dynamism of Sri Lanka's political system. Sri Lanka in
 1981 celebrated the' fiftieth anniversary of the granting
 of universal adult suffrage. Opposition parties function
 freely and have access to news media, although they are not
 satisfied with the type of coverage accorded them in
 several papers controlled by the government. No political
 parties are banned, but all must meet certain qualifi-
 cations to appear on the ballot as acknowledged parties.
 Candidates of parties which fail to qualify may run as
 independents in elections. Voter participation is usually
 over 85 percent.
 Parties are free to establish their own criteria and
 standards governing conduct of individual party members
 and of those holding elected office. In September 1981,
 the ruling United National Party (UNP) expelled from the
 party a member of parliament who had made particularly
 inflammatory statements in parliament against Tamil
 minority leaders, and had not adhered to party discipline.
 The member could ultimately lose his seat in parliament,
 depending on adjudication by the courts.
 Status of 825,000 so-called Indian Tamils, whose
 forebears were brought from southern India by the British
 in the 19th and 20th centuries to work the Ceylon tea
 estates, remains unresolved, following expiration in 1981
 of the 1964 bilateral agreement between India and Sri
 Lanka. This agreement and its later amendments and exten-
 sions, provided for granting of Indian citizenship and
 repatriation to India of 600,000 Indian Tamils and their
 offspring, out of the 975,000 Indian Tamils in Ceylon in
 1964, and also provided for the granting of Sri Lankan
 citizenship to the remainder. So far, only 375,000 have
 been repatriated (an additional 121,000 have been granted
 Indian citizenship) and 209,000 have become Sri Lankan
 citizens (figures include children born after 1964 of the
 original 975,000 covered by the agreement). Attacks on
 dwellings of tea estate workers in August 1981 accelerated
 the repatriation process, as at least several hundred
 Indian Tamils first fled to Colombo and then were granted
 permits for entry into India.
 Sri Lankan women have equal suffrage, equality under
 general law, and equal property and inheritance rights.
 However, under the personal laws of various ethnic groups,
 there are some limitations on women's equality. Women are
 believed to exercise their vote extensively, but play a
 much more limited role in the political process and
 decision-making.
 There are more than 1500 registered trade unions in
 Sri Lanka. Under the law, unions have the right to organ-
 ize, to bargain collectively, to lobby and, in the private
 sector, to strike. The Essential Public Services Act,
 passed in 1979, gives the government the authority to ban
 strikes in essential sectors of the economy and provides
 stiff penalties for violations. The law has not yet been
 
 
 1099
 invoked. Of some 60,000 or more government employees.
 considered to have vacated their positions in August 1980,
 during an attempted general strike, a good number have
 not found employment. The cabinet recently decided to
 explore ways of giving some consideration to strikers who
 have not found alternative employment (estimates run as
 high as 30,000).
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been previous investigations by such
 organizations as Amnesty International and the Inter-
 national Commission of Jurists (ICJ) dealing with detention
 cases following the 1971 insurgency and with the trial of
 a noted Sri Lankan lawyer for breach of parliamentary
 privilege. In December, the ICJ issued a report on
 communal violence in Sri Lanka, based on a four week visit
 to the country to look into communal problems. The ICJ
 observer was present for the habeas corpus hearings for
 four of the 27 individuals held incommunicado following
 communal problems last June. After the wave of looting
 and arson, and the murder of some seven "curfew violators"
 in Jaffna by police and military (May 31-June 4, 1981) the
 Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) demanded an inquiry
 into police actions by a respected international organi-
 zation as one of the five conditions for ending the TUIL
 boycott of parliament. The government of Sri Lanka
 refused to permit such an investigation, although groups
 such as the ICJ were allowed to observe judicial actions
 related to the violence.
 A number of local civic and human rights organizations
 monitor and criticize human rights violations in Sri Lanka
 through the publication of newsletters, press releases,
 and communications to the government. Among the most active
 are the Civil Rights Movement of Sri Lanka and the Movement
 for Inter-Racial Justice and Equality. A representative
 for Asia of Amnesty International resides in Sri Lanka, but
 her concerns are more regional than local.
 In the wake of the Neerveli bank robbery in March and
 the police violence in Jaffna in May/June, the government
 of Sri Lanka has received at least three communications
 from Amnesty International. Among Amnesty International
 concerns were detentions under the Prevention of Terrorism
 Act and the practice of holding detainees incommunicado.
 A representative from the International Human Rights Law
 Group of Washington, D.C., visited Sri Lanka at the end of
 July to observe habeas corpus proceedings for four detainees
 arrested in connection with the Neerveli bank robbery and
 the killing of two policemen. The representative was
 accorded full cooperation by government authorities and was
 able to observe all proceedings.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Sri Lanka is an island nation of 14.85 million people
 (1981 census), about the size of the state of West Virginia
 and lying 18 miles off the southeast coast of India. Since
 independence in 1948, successive governments have tried to
 break the cycle of unemployment, food scarcity and disease,
 
 
 1100
 in the context of an enlightened democracy. While progress
 has been fitful throughout the years, largely due to
 continuous changes of government, the overall status and
 living condition of the Sri Lankan citizen started higher
 than the South Asian average, and has improved. The
 present government, elected in 1977, states its determi-
 nation to lift Sri Lanka from its condition of under-
 development and to transform it into a modern market
 economy society.
 Despite widespread poverty and generally poor quality
 health care, a Sri Lankan citizen has a life expectancy at
 birth of 66 years. The infant mortality rate is 49 per
 1000 births. The population growth rate is 1.7 percent
 (1970-80), considerably below the 1960-70 rate of 2.4
 percent; the total fertility rate is 3.8 percent. The
 growth rate has risen somewhat during the past two years,
 however, because of increased employment; the government
 maintains that employed people tend to marry and have
 children earlier, since they are financially able to do so
 sooner than would normally be expected. As a result of the
 recent increase, the government is once again stressing
 family planning, and has started a promotional campaign.
 The emphasis in Sri Lanka over the past three decades
 has been on preventive rather than curative medicine. Long
 life expectancy and low infant mortality are indications of
 some success. With regard to curative medicine, while
 health care is widely distributed and, in principle, freely
 available to the people, thereare still not enough facil-
 ities or staff to accommodate the people requiring a hospital
 bed or a physician. In 1978, it was estimated that there
 were 340 persons per hospital bed and 6,429 persons per
 physician. A major hospital of over 1000 beds (a gift from
 Japan) has been planned for the new capital city of Sri
 Jayewardenapura (8 miles southeast of Colombo), and a
 private medical college was recently opened in Colombo. Sri
 Lankan health care has suffered greatly from the brain drain
 of qualified physicians to Europe and the United States over
 the past decades. Part of the void has been filled by the
 recruitment of foreign doctors as UN volunteers. Some
 overseas Sri Lankan physicians have felt a responsibility
 for their homeland, however; several cardiologists
 returned to Sri Lanka in December 1981 to conduct open-
 heart surgery in Colombo in order to clear the backlog of
 cardiac cases.
 The price of food has increased rapidly since most
 government subsidies for rice and other essentials were
 removed by the present government, but Sri Lanka has
 attained near self-sufficiency in rice production because
 of the removal of the subsidies. The government attempted,
 with some success, to provide help to the poor through a
 targeted food stamp program which replaced the indiscrimi-
 nate subsidy program. Food is therefore available
 (reflected in a 96 percent ratio of.calorie supply avail-
 able for consumption relative to nutritional requirements),
 and the government is engaged in a massive irrigation scheme
 in northeast Sri Lanka (Mahaveli River area) to boost food
 production even more.

 countries" (LDC's), Sri Lanka has a low GNP per capita
 of $230 (1979 figure). Entrepreneurs and farmers have
 benefited from incentives and price ceilings introduced by
 the present government; many others, particularly low-level
 government employees on fixed incomes, have suffered from
 the effects of an inflation rate as high as 35-40 percent.
 The government contends that the high inflation rate is
 somewhat offset by an increase in employment generated by
 the government's liberalized economic policies and
 creation of new industries in the Colombo free trade zone.
 According to the UNP government, the number of unemployed
 inherited from the previous government in 1977 has been
 cut from 1,250,000 to some 600-700,000. Massive develop-
 ment projects in hydroelectric power generation and irri-
 gation have led to a boom in the construction industry and
 have created a heavy demand for materials and certain cate-
 gories of skilled labor. Real GNP growth rate since 1977
 has been from 5 to 8 percent per year. The government has
 also undertaken a massive program of housing construction,
 
 
 1102
 largely at the behest and under the supervision of Prime
 Minister Premadasa, with a target of 100,000 housing
 units. The Average number of persons housed per room is
 2.5 (1970).
 Sri Lanka remains largely rural, and disparities
 between urban and rural communities are pronounced.
 Overall, the percentage of population with access to safe
 water is 20, but in urban areas it is 45 percent and in
 rural areas, 13 percent. Occasional outbreaks of cholera,
 particularly in the northeast part of the island, attest
 to the inadequacy of protected water supplies.
 Emigration to the Middle East of more than 100,000
 Sri Lankans in search of better-paying jobs has caused
 shortages of trained personnel, but it has also resulted
 in large remittances to families living in Sri Lanka.
 Sri Lankan labor is one of the country's most important
 exports and earners of foreign exchange, along with
 tourism and tea. These remittances amounted to more than
 US$ 100 million in 1980.
 Through encouragement of domestic and foreign
 investment, both in and out of the free trade zone, and
 the opening up of large tracts of irrigated land to
 hundreds of thousands of previously marginal farmers, the
 government hopes to create more employment and generate
 significantly increased incomes for large segments of the
 population. Some 15,000 citizens (mostly young women)
 have so far gained employment in the Colombo area free
 trade zone.
