 SPAIN
 Spain's Government   is a parliamentary   democracy  within  a
 constitutional monarchy. Parliament is the policy-making body
 established by the Constitution. Three general elections have
 been held since the 1975 death of Spanish dictator Francisco
 Franco.  The Union of the Democratic Center, a coalition of
 center-right parties, governed from the first elections in 1977
 through 1982.   In the most recent elections held in October
 1982, the Spanish Socialist Worker Party won an absolute
 majority of parliamentary seats. These elections demonstrated
 Spain's continuing commitment to democratic government. Voter
 participation was an unprecedented 79.5 percent, with more than
 50 national and regional parties participating, spanning the
 political spectrum from ultra right to far left.
 Most elements of current Spanish society--including the King,
 the Catholic Church, and all major political parties--are
 committed both in principle and in practice to the realization
 of a democratic Spain, where human rights are protected. Basic
 freedoms of speech, press, religion, assembly, movement, and
 participation in the political process are respected in Spain.
 The Spanish Constitution of 1978 protects all basic human
 rights.   Controversial statutes exist, however, within the
 constitutional framework. One of the most controversial is the
 anti-terrorist law enacted by Parliament.   This law provides
 for a 10-day incommunicado detention period of an arrestee
 suspected of terrorism or affiliation with terrorists.    Many
 human rights activists see this detention period, during which
 the detainee is deprived of legal counsel, as a serious human
 rights violation.   Government.- officials, on the other hand,
 believe  that   the  law  is   necessary  to  cope   with  the
 indiscriminate killings carried out as a matter of policy by
 the Basque Fatherland and Freedom movement.
 Human rights trends in Spain, both long-term and short-term, are
 postive.  As the ruling party until the past elections, the
 Union of the Democratic Center advocated the protection of
 human rights both at home and abroad.       The new Socialist
 Government also has emphasized the protection of human rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Killing
 Of the human rights violations that occur in Spain, political
 killings have received the most attention.    These have been
 almost exclusively terrorist acts, usually committed by the
 Basque  terrorist organization.   The attacks are primarily
 motivated by Basque separatist goals.
 Occasionally, the Government's security forces also have been
 involved  in  politically-motivated  killings.   One  case  of
 particular note is the Almeria case.     In 1981, three Civil
 Guards allegedly killed three youths suspected of belonging to
 the Basque terrorist group. The guards were arrested, tried,
 convicted, and sentenced to 24, 15, and 12 years respectively.
 The Civil Guards remained confined at the end of 1982, pending
 their appeal. The case is significant, because such punishment
 for a human rights abuse never     occurred during the Franco
 regime.

 b. Disappearance
 Terrorist abductions occur in Spain, but there are no known
 cases of abductions, secret arrests, or clandestine detentions
 by official forces or by factions whose activities are condoned
 by the Government.
 c. Torture
 The Spanish Constitution categorically    forbids the use of
 torture and guarantees the "right to life and to physical and
 moral  integrity."   Periodic  reports of torture of Basque
 terrorists by the Spanish police continue to be heard, but
 there have been no documented cases during 1982.      A 10-day
 incommunicado   detention    period   permitted    under   the
 anti-terrorism law is seen by some as an opportunity for
 torture.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel or inhuman punishment is prohibited by the Constitution,
 but allegations of ill treatment (almost exclusively from
 Basque sources) continue.   Overcrowding of prisons is also a
 problem. This has been reported frequently in the press, but
 it is generally recognized that a solution will take time.
 Aside from overcrowding, prison conditions are adequate.   All
 prisoners are treated equally.
 The length of pre-trial detention in Spain is of concern to
 many legal observers. There is presently no uniform fixed term
 applicable to prisoners in this category, and they may be held
 indefinitely, with the proviso that detentions may not exceed
 the maximum possible sentence.    The Minister of Justice has
 proposed that "an across the board" limit of one year or the
 maximum possible sentence, whichever is shorter, be set as the
 maximum pre-trial detention period.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There have been no documented cases of arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment,  although  accusations  have   been  made.   The
 Constitution  prohibits  arbitrary  arrest  and   imprisonment.
 Though the Constitution provides for habeas corpus, a law
 regulating  the habeas corpus procedure has     not yet been
 drafted. The newly elected Socialist Government has indicated
 it will introduce habeas corpus legislation.
 Preventive detention for investigation does exist in Spain, but
 legally may not (and in practice does not) exceed 72 hours.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees the right to a fair public trial,
 and this right is respected in practice. The defendant has the
 right  to  effective  legal  counsel  except  in  those  cases
 involving the 10 day incommunicado detention period. In these
 latter cases, however, the detainee is allowed access to legal
 counsel upon termination of the incommunicado period.
 According to Spanish law, an arrestee must be released or
 presented to a judicial authority within the first 72 hours of
 police arrest. The court then has an additional 72 hours to
 determine whether the suspect will be released or indicted,
 The  Spanish   legal  system  operates  independently  of  the
 executive and military, as specified in the Constitution.
 
 
 994
 Since Franco's death, political and security courts have been
 abolished, and only normal civilian and military courts exist.
 Currently, civilians may only be tried in military courts for
 offenses they have committed on military installations. In such
 cases, the Spanish code of military justice is followed.
 Defendants may always appeal verdicts to the next highest court
 until they reach the Supreme Court, the court of last resort.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution provides that the home is inviolable and that
 entry is forbidden unless permitted by the owner or by court
 order, except in cases of flagrant crimes.    It allows, however,
 for the suspension of these provisions in individual cases,
 specifically those involving terrorism, but only during declared
 states of emergency or siege.
 Under normal circumstances, a search warrant is required before
 officials may enter a private residence.    These are issued by
 the criminal court. If officials wish to search the residence of
 military personnel, the warrant must be issued by a military
 court.
 Forced entry has not been credibly alleged during 1982. Other
 privacy violations of the home, such as bugging, do occur but
 only with court authority.   Cases in which such practices have
 been authorized involved terrorism and, more recently, alleged
 coup-plotting.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press is protected by the Constitution
 and is observed in practice. Opposition viewpoints are freely
 ventilated both in common speech and in the media, and they are
 tolerated by the Government.    The Director of the state-owned
 Spanish  Radio  and  Television  Network   is appointed  by   the
 Government, and the network operates under the supervision of a
 Parliamentary oversight committee.   Although the Spanish press
 is also subsidized by the Government, the Spanish media are
 essentially independent and free to criticize the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to assemble freely is a constitutional right and one
 which is exercised by all political groups.     Labor unions in
 Spain are active and are free to organize, strike, and negotiate
 as stipulated in the Constitution. They are allowed to maintain
 relations with recognized international bodies in their fields.
 Spanish   trade  unions   are  not   government-controlled,   nor
 influenced or subjected to official harassment.    Approximately
 18-20 percent of the Spanish work force is unionized. One major
 issue between the Government and the unions is the patrimony
 question.  Union property was seized by the Franco regime and
 became state property under the Franco system of "vertical"
 unions.    Union   and   employer   associations   have    sought
 reinstatement of their property but the issue is complex, and a
 mutually acceptable settlement has not yet been reached.
 
 
 995
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Spain, and open practice of all
 religions  is  permitted.    Catholicism  is  the  predominant
 religion in Spain, but other religions are represented and
 function with full freedom.    There have been no registered
 incidents   of    religious    harassment,   persecution,   or
 discrimination.  Adherence to a particular faith does not by
 itself confer either advantage or disadvantage to one's secular
 status.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement and foreign travel by Spanish citizens are
 not impeded by the Spanish Government. People are allowed to
 travel  freely and as often as they wish.        There are no
 restrictions placed on residence in certain areas of the
 country or in the cities. Emigration and repatriation are not
 restricted by the Spanish Government, nor does the Government
 force refugees to return to the homelands from which they have
 fled.  Spain has accepted, prior to 1982, large numbers of
 Latin American refugees and smaller numbers of Indonesian
 refugees. Spanish citizenship cannot be revoked if acquired by
 birth.   It can, however, in accordance with Spanish law, be
 revoked if acquired by other means.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Spain is a parliamentary democracy with multiple parties and
 candidates.  Elective positions are contested in Spain as in
 other democratic countries. Opposition groups exist openly and
 actively participate in the political process.
 Spanish citizens .at least.18 years old are eligible to vote and
 elections are   free.   The  Constitution  guarantees complete
 equality for women, but cultural and societal factors still
 inhibit women from enjoying equal participation in all aspects
 of Spanish society.
 Some minorities in Spain, particularly the gypsies, are not
 fully integrated into Spanish society.
 A potentially important political role is that of the Public
 Defender, whose duty will be to investigate complaints of
 violations of basic constitutional rights and seek corrective
 action in the courts. He may independently launch full-scale
 investigations into any area of public administration in which
 complaints lead him to believe there is probable cause for
 suspicion of maladministration. His services are free, and no
 lawyer is necessary to make a direct appeal to him.        The
 position was authorized by the Constitution, but only recently
 instituted by the new Socialist Government.
 :3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 -,,governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human
 Rights
 .Spain participates...in .thesrhuman rights body of the Council of
 Europe and is an act4ve member in (and is host for) the ongoing
 Conference  for: Security -and  Cooperation  in Europe, which
 monitors the observance of the human rights issues endorsed in
 the Helsinki Accords. ,The Spanish Government has allowed
 investigative groups to enter its borders, openly tour the
 country, and report on the status of human rights. In Spain,
 
 
 996
 it is generally individuals rather than organizations who work
 to protect individual liberties. Most of these individuals are
 concerned citizens or lawyers, who hear of human rights cases
 from affected families or other sources and then investigate
 them independently. An Amnesty International group visited the
 Basque Provinces in April 1982 to investigate allegations of
 torture. The human rights organization has since called on the
 Spanish authorities to investigate immediately allegations of
 ill-treatment and torture following the arrest of four men in
 March.   Amnesty  International  found  that  the   allegations
 provided a substantial prima facie case for a full government
 investigation.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Spain  has  a   market  economy  with  significant  government
 intervention.   It is a mid-level industrial country which
 produces a wide variety of products at various levels of
 technology and sophistication, ranging from the rudimentary to
 modern.   Its 1981 gross domestic    product  (GDP) was $186
 billion.   The national unemployment rate is currently 15.9
 percent.
 The Spanish Constitution guarantees the basic rights of work,
 private  property,   food  and   shelter,  health   care,  and
 education.   The   following  statistics  provide   a  general
 indication of Spain's standard of living.   Spain's population
 in 1981 was 37,732,000 and growing at an annual rate of 0.8
 percent. GNP per capita is $5,354. Life expectancy at birth
 is 73.4 years, and the infant mortality rate is 13.2 per 1000
 live births. The adult literacy rate is 90.2 per cent (1970)
 and the primary school enrollment ratio is 109 (1977).     The
 percentage of the population with access to safe water is 77.6
 (1970)  and  the   ratio  of  calorie   supply  available  for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements is 128 percent
 (1977).
