 BARBADOS
 Barbados, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, is a constitutional democ-
 racy with a multiparty, parliamentary form of government. The Queen is Head of
 State and is represented by an appointed Governor General. Prime Minister Owen
 Arthur is the Head of Government and governs with an appointed Cabinet. Two

 major and one minor political parties and several independent candidates contested
 free and fair national elections in September.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force is charged with maintaining public order. The
 small volunteer Barbados Defense Force (BDF), responsible for national security,
 can be employed to maintain public order in times of crisis, emergency, or other spe-
 cific need. The BDF continues to assist the police by patrolling certain tourist areas
 in response to an increase of crime. On the whole, the police respected constitutional
 and legal guarantees of human rights, but there continued to be infrequent reports
 of incidents of use of excessive force by police.
 The economy is based on tourism, services, light manufacturing, and agriculture,
 which makes it vulnerable to external economic developments. Per capita gross do-
 mestic product (GDP) exceeds $5,000 per year. In order to stimulate demand and
 reverse a 3-year decline in GDP and employment, the Government decided in May
 1993 to abandon attempts to meet economic targets set in consultation with the
 International Monetary Fund. Nevertheless, Barbados experienced a cyclical eco-
 nomic recovery in 1994.
 Barbadians enjoy a wide range of rights and freedoms, and the Government re-
 spects constitutional provisions regarding human rights. Principal human rights
 problems continued to be societal violence against women and children and in-
 stances of excessive use of force by police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 In the case of Ryan Jordan, a 17-year-old who died in police custody in April 1992,
 Amnesty International called on Barbadian officials to initiate an impartial inves-
 tigation and prosecute those responsible. In 1994 the coroner returned an open ver-
 dict which exonerated the police from responsibility for Jordan's death; the report
 said excessive drugs in his system caused his death.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. However, the Caribbean Human Rights Network and the
 local press reported numerous allegations of coerced confessions. There continued to
 be credible reports that law enforcement officials sometimes used force during de-
 tention to extract confessions from detainees.
 Recently implemented police procedures provide that the police may question sus-
 pects and other persons they hold only at a police station, except when expressly
 permitted by a senior divisional officer. An officer must visit a detainee at least once
 every 3 hours to inquire about the detainee's condition. After 24 hours, the detain-
 ing authority must submit a written report to the deputy commissioner. The au-
 thorities must approve and record all movements of the detainee between stations.
 The Caribbean Human Rights Network is satisfied that the authorities adhere to
 these basic principles.
 Barbados is in the forefront of an initiative to standardize police procedures
 throughout the English-speaking Caribbean region. The authorities issued firearms
 to special units and some foot patrols in high-crime areas in response to the 1993
 shooting death of a policeman and a rise in gun- and drug-related crime. Aside from
 this, the Barbados police force is mainly unarmed, in keeping with its British tradi-
 tions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and imprisonment and requires detainees to be brought before a court of law
 within 72 hours of arrest. The Government generally respects these provisions in
 practice. Criminal defendants have the right to counsel, and attorneys have ready
 access to their clients. The authorities do not use exile as a punishment or means
 of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides that persons charged
 with criminal offenses be given a fair public hearing within a reasonable time by
 an independent and impartial court. he judicial system provides for rights of due
 process at each level. The law presumes defendants innocent until proven guilty.
 The Government provides free legal aid to the indigent. The judiciary acts independ-
 ently and is free of intervention from other branches of government. Criticizing the
 Government is not a political offense, and there are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires war-
 rants to be issued before privately owned property may be entered and searched.

 The Government does not routinely interfere in the private lives of its citizens.
 Nonetheless, there continued to be credible reports that, in response to increased
 drug-related crime, the police resorted to searches of homes in certain neighbor-
 hoods, sometimes without warrants. The Government neither censors mail nor re-
 stricts the receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and the authorities respect these rights in practice. There are five radio
 stations, two of which are owned by the Government. The Caribbean Broadcasting
 Corporation (CBC) television service (the only television source, excluding direct sat-
 ellite reception) is government owned. Though CBC is a state enterprise, it regularly
 reported views opposing government policies. There are two independent daily news-
 papers, both of which present opposition political views. The Government regularly
 comes under attack in the newspapers and on daily call-in radio programs. Although
 critics allege that the Government sometimes uses its influence to discourage media
 from reporting on sensitive issues, the press remained vigorously critical of the Gov-
 ernment on a broad span of issues.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associaton.-The Government observes the
 constitutional provisions for peaceful assembly and private association. It routinely
 grants the permits require for public demonstrations. Political parties, trade
 unions, and private organizations function and hold meetings and rallies without
 hindrance.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is full freedom of religion. Numerous active reli-
 gious denominations and organizations practice their faiths and proselytize freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and legal residents move freely within Barbados and leave and
 enter the country without restriction.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right in law and exercise it in practice. Political parties freely
 compete in fair elections by secret ballot at least every 5 years. The most recent oc-
 curred in September, in which the Barbados Labour Party won a decisive victory,
 gaining a 19-t-8 majority over the Democratic Labour Party which had held an 18-
 t-10 advantage in the 1991 elections. The New Democratic Party won one seat, its
 first ever in Parliament. There are no impediments to participation in the political
 process, and all Barbadians over age 18 may vote. The Prime Minister exercises ex-
 ecutive power along with the Cabinet of Ministers he appoints, balanced by the bi-
 cameral Parliament and the judiciary system
 Women are well represented at all levels of government and politics, including the
 Head of State, Governor GeneralDame Nita Barrw. After the September elections,
 Prime Minister Arthur appointed women to several cabinet-level portfolios. For the
 first time, the Deputy Prie Minister is a woman (she also serves concurrently as
 Foreign Minister).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local groups involved with human rights matters operate freely and without gov-
 ernment hindrance. The Caribbean Human Rights Network, a Caribbean-wide
 human rights organization which has its headquarters and a small staff in Bar-
 bados, investigates and reports on allegations of human rights violations throughout
 the region.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law, regardless of race,
 religion, or sex.
 Women.-Women actively participate in all aspects of national life and are well-
 represented at all levels of both the public and private sectors. They form a large
 percentage of heads of household and are not discriminated against in public hous-
 ing or other social welfare programs. However, violence against women and children
 continued to be a significant social problem. Women's rights groups reported that
 the incidence of sexual assaults, domestic violence, incest, and rape among family
 members increased, despite the fact that there is still some reluctance on the part
 of victims to report such incidents. There are ublic and private counseling services
 for domestic violence, rape, suicide, and child ause.
 
 
 The 1992 Domestic Violence Law specifies the appropriate police response to do-
 mestic violence, intended to protect all members of the family, including men and
 children. It applies equally to marriages and to commn law relationships. Criminal
 penalties for violent crimes are the same, regardless of the sex of the offender or
 the victim. The courts heard a number of cases of domestic violence against women
 involving assault or wounding. Victims may request restraining orders, which the
 courts often issue. The courts can sentence an offender to jail for breaching such
 an order. Human rights monitors continued to criticize the inconsistency in sentenc-
 ing for rape, incest, and statutory rape, which is often left to the discretion of the
 judge. They noted that the lack of sentencing guidelines resulted in longer sentences
 being handed down for persons accused of petty theft than for incest; and lesser sen-
 tences for incest than for rape or sexual assault of nonfamily members.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's human rights and welfare,
 although violence against children remains a serious problem. The Child Care Board
 is the key agency responsible for monitoring and responding to the critical welfare
 needs, interests, and rights of children.
 People With Disabilities.-Neither local legislation nor regulations within the
 Labor Code prohibit discrimination against the physically disabled in employment,
 education, or the provision of other state services. The Labour Department, which
 is responsible for finding jobs for the disabled, unsuccessfully advocated the intro-
 duction of such legislation in the 1980's. Similarly, there is no legislation mandating
 provision of handicapped access to public thoroughfares or public or private buil-
 ings. Interest groups have lobbied for this type of legislation from time to time, but
 without success.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers freely exercise their right to form and be-
 long to trade unions and to strike. There are two major unions and several smaller
 ones, representing various sectors of labor. The civil service union, the National
 Union of Public Workers, is completely independent of any political party or the
 Government. The largest union, the Barbados Workers' Union, was historically
 closely associated with the opposition Democratic Labour Party.
 The law accords full protection to trade unionists' personal and property rights.
 Another longstanding law prohibits strikes against public utilities. All other private
 and public sector employees are permitted to strike; however, there were no strikes
 or long-term work stoppages in 1994.
 Trade unions are free to form federations and are in fact affiliated with a variety
 of regional and international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to organize and bargain collectively, and the authorities respected it in practice. Re-
 cent losses of jobs in the economy resulted in a reduction in union membership to
 about 20 percent of the working population. Normally, wages and working condi-
 tions are negotiated through the collective bargaining process, but a tripartite wage
 policy accord signed in the summer of 1993 established a 2-year wage freeze, thus
 impinging on the ability of unions to bargain for wage and benefit increases.
 Employers have no legal obligation to recognize unions under the Trade Union Act
 of 1964, but most do so when a majority of their employees signify a desire to be
 represented by a registered union. Mule there is no specific law prohibiting
 antiunion discrimination, the courts provide a method of redress for employees al-
 leging unfair dismissal. The courts commonly award monetary compensation but
 rarely order reemployment.
 There are no manufacturing or special areas where collective bargaining rights
 are legally or administratively impaired. Barbados has no specially designated ex-
 port processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there were no reported instances in 1994.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum working age
 of 16 is generally observed. ompulsory primary and secondary education policies,
 which require school attendance until age 16, reinforce minimum age requirements.
 Occasionally, especially among migrant worker families, children assist in agricul-
 tural production during peak season. The Labour Department has a small cadre of
 labor inspectors who conduct spot investigations of enterprises and check records to
 verify compliance with the law. These inspectors may take legal action against an
 employer who is found to have underage workers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets and the authorities establish min-
 imum wages for specified categories of workers. Only two categories of workers have
 a formally regulated minimum wage-household domestics and shop assistants
 (entry level commercial workers). Household domestics receive a minimum wage of
 
 
 about $32.50 (bds $65.00) per week, although in actual labor market conditions, the
 prevailing wage is almost double that amount. There are two age-related minimum
 wage categories for shop assistants. The adult minimum wage for shop assistants
 is $1.87 (bds $3.75) per hour, the juvenile minimum wage for shop assistants is
 $1.62 (bds $3.25) per hour. Agricultural workers (i.e., sugar plantation workers) re-
 ceive a minimum wage as a matter of practice, but such compensation is not found
 in legislation.
 The minimum wage for shop assistants is marginally sufficient to meet minimum
 living standards; most employees earn more. In 1992 an International Labor Orga-
 nization (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) cited Barbados for not adhering to the
 ILO Convention on Equal Remuneration in its wage differentials in the sugar indus-
 try. The COE admonished the Government to ensure the application of the principle
 of equal remuneration for work of equal value to male and female workers in the
 sugar industry or to provide further information on job descriptions which might
 justify such wage distinction. This case was not resolved at year's end.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and the law requires overtime
 payment for hours worked in excess of that. Barbados accepts ILO conventions,
 standards, and other sectoral conventions regarding maximum hours of work. How-
 ever, there is no general legislation that covers all occupations. Employers must pro-
 vide workers a minimum of 3 weeks' annual leave. Unemployment benefits legisla-
 tion and national insurance (social security) cover all workers. A comprehensive gov-
 ernment-sponsored health program offers subsidized treatment and medication.
 Under the Factories Act of 1983, which sets out the officially recognized occupa-
 tional safety and health standards, the Labour Department enforces health and
 safety standards and follows up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by man-
 agement. Workers have a limited right to remove themselves from dangerous or
 hazardous job situations without jeopardizing their continued employment. The Fac-
 tories Act requires that in certain sectors firms employingimore than 50 workers
 set up a safety committee. This committee can challeng the decisions of manage-
 ment concerning the occupational safety and health environment. Recently, how-
 ever, trade unions called on the Government to increase the number of factory in-
 specters in order to enforce existing and proposed safety and health legislation more
 effectively, and to follow up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by manage-
 ment. Government-operated corporations in particular were accused of doing a "poor
 job" in health and safety. The Government promised to undertake inspections of
 government-operated corporations and manufacturing plants as a priority.
