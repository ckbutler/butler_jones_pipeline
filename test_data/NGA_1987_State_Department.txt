 NIGERIA
 President Ibrahim Babangida came to power in a military coup
 in August 1985, overthrowing a previous military government
 which had seized power from civilians in December 1983. A
 30-member Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) is the country's
 main decisionmaking organ, while a mixed military/civilian
 cabinet presides over the FederalGovernment's executive
 departments. Military governors head each of the 21 states.
 The 1979 Constitution remains partially in effect, but
 significant prqvisions, namely, those guaranteeing free
 elections, political parties, and the right to due process and
 habeas corpus, are suspended. Due process and habeas corpus,
 however, continue to be respected in most cases. Federal and
 state legislation are promulgated by decrees, which are exempt
 from challenge in the courts. The Government elaborated plans
 in 1987 to xeturn the country to civilian rule featuring a
 two-partysystem, although in July it postponed the final date
 from 1990 to 1992. As first steps, the Government in 1987
 created a National Electoral Commission and a Constitutional
 Review Committee, both composed of civilians, and conducted
 nationwide elections in December for local governing councils.
 The Government enforces its authority through the Federal
 security apparatus--the military, the State Security Service
 "(SSS), and the national police--and through the courts. No
 separate law enforcement agencies exist at the state and local
 levels. The Government generally exercises effective control
 over the security apparatus, but deficiencies in organization
 and management sometimes lead to human rights violations.
 Nigeria, with an estimated 108 million people, is Africa's
 most populous country. It has a mixed economy in which the
 Government plays a-major but declining role. In June 1986,
 President Babangida announced an economic structural adjustment
 program calling for increased reliance on market forces and
 the private sector.
 The Babangida Government continued to articulate a policy of
 general respect for fundamental human rights. Important
 exceptions related to the Government's efforts to restrain
 political debate and participation prior to a return to
 civilian rule and significant deficiencies in the judicial and
 state security systems. Freedom of the press was undercut by
 several potable cases in which government authorities moved
 against publishers and journalists for printing articles
 either at odds with government decisions or considered
 inimical to national security. In the wake of serious
 religious rioting between Christians and Muslims in March,
 which left 19 dead, the Government instituted various bans on
 religious advertising and campus-based religious organizing as
 well as limitations on proselytizing. The Government
 continued its practice of reviewing the cases of Nigerians
 detained or convicted under decrees of the previous military
 administration. The impact of these efforts was reduced by
 the slow pace of judicial procedures, especially in the case
 of the coriuption and civil disturbances tribunals.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There was no evidence of politically motivated killing at
 government or private instigation in 1987. The October 1986
 letter-bomb killing of the editor-in-chief of an influential
 weekly newsmagazine, Dele Giwa, remains unsolved, despite an
 ongoing government investigation. The incident continues to
 generate keen public interest and unsubstantiated allegations
 of government involvement.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 A portion of the 1979 Constitution that is still in effect
 outlaws torture and mistreatment of prisoners. Nigerian law
 provides that such excesses be dealt with in criminal or civil
 proceedings. There were no reports or allegations of torture
 in 1987. Public allegations of police brutality surfaced
 periodically, primarily in connection with periods of
 heightened religious or community tensions. Prominent
 northerners alleged, following March rioting in northern
 Kaduna state, that the police and military committed excesses
 in their efforts to stem the violence and apprehend
 perpetrators. Similar charges were made about the treatment
 of detainees, some of them children. There has been no public
 investigation of these allegations. Suspected criminals
 allegedly killed by police in separate instances in different
 states led to antipolice mob violence. In one of the
 incidents, the state governor ordered a judicial probe, and in
 both cases police suspected of the actions were arrested.
 Prison conditions remain poor because of the lack of basic
 necessities. In May, inmates at one prison rioted over food
 supplies, resulting in the deaths of 24 prisoners. A special
 tribunal appointed by the Government to look into the incident
 began hearings in September.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Babangida Government has retained the authority to detain
 without charge persons suspected of acts prejudicial to state
 security or harmful to the economic well-being of the country
 under Decree 2 of 1984, the State Security (Detention of
 Persons) Decree. This Decree suspends sections of the 1979
 Constitution guaranteeing citizens the right to fair trial,
 due process, and judicial determination of the legality of
 detention (habeas corpus). While it imposes no time limit and
 disallows challenges of the detention in a court of law, the
 Decree does provide for administrative review of detention
 cases every 3 months. Several persons, including former
 politicians returning from self-exile, were detained under
 this Decree during 1987. One American citizen was detained
 for 103 days without charge before his release on his own
 recognizance on November 23.
 
 
 NIGERIA
 Some Nigerians have been detained in 1987 without being held
 under the provisions of Decree 2 of 1984. Cumbersome
 administrative procedures and bureaucratic inefficiency
 sometimes result in persons suspebted of criminal offenses
 being held for extended periods without charge or trial even
 though provisions of the 1979 Constitution still in force
 guarantee persons charged with crimes a fair public trial in
 civilian courts within 3 months from the date of arrest. The
 Director of Prisons said in September that about two-thirds of
 Nigeria's 54,000 inmates are awaiting trials. During routine
 inspections of prisons in 1987, High Court chief judges
 exercised their right to release detainees found to have spent
 more time in prison than they would have if they had been
 convicted for their alleged crimes.
 An unknown number of persons are still in detention without
 charge or trial following the arrests of about 700 persons in
 connection with the March religious disturbances in northern
 Nigeria. The Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunal) Decree of
 1987, promulgated after the disturbances, provided for
 investigation of the rioting and for the arrest and trial by
 special tribunal of those suspected of committing specified
 offenses. This decree makes northern Nigeria's criminal
 procedure code the applicable law for the trials (including
 provisions for bail, representation by lawyers, and appeal--
 except in cases of armed robbery). However, administrative
 confusion has resulted in continued detention without charge
 or bail for many. The refusal of some of the accused to
 accept government-appointed lawyers has delayed tribunal
 proceedings. At the end of 1987, about three-fourths of the
 89 cases initially slated for trial by the civil disturbances
 special tribunal had been tried. In July a Kaduna state High
 Court judge ordered the release of two of those arrested on
 grounds that the government counsel was unable to produce
 evidence to justify their arrest under the Civil Disturbances
 (Special Tribunal) Decree of 1987. In August, 44 of those
 slated for trial engaged in a 4-day hunger strike to protest
 the pace of the trials, prison conditions, and being forced to
 share cells with convicted criminals. The Federal Government
 responded by transferring the convicts to other jails.
 In 1987 the Government continued a process, begun in 1986, of
 reviewing the cases of persons detained or convicted under
 various decrees during the previous military administration
 (1984-85), many of whom had already been released. In June a
 detainees's review panel ordered the release of 22 persons
 following a review of all outstanding detentions. Some were
 granted bail, others were either recommended for trial or had
 cases pending in court. The panel is headed by the Attorney
 General, who said the panel will continue to meet periodically.
 In 1987 two state governments released over 650 suspected
 members of the Maitatsine religious sect. They had been
 detained without charge since uprisings in 1984 and 1985 in
 Gongola and Bauchi states. The state governments had been
 unable to prosecute them due to the unwillingness of witnesses
 to testify against them in court. According to the Gongola
 state Attorney General, the 50 most dangerous prisoners will
 remain in detention indefinitely. About 100 of the detainees
 reportedly died of hunger, disease, and malnutrition while in
 prison custody.
 Still in detention without charge since August 1985 are former
 military Head of State (1984-85) Muhammadu Buhari and his
 Chief of Staff Tunde Idiagbon. No Nigerian has been exiled.
 
 
 224
 NIGERIA
 Self-exiled politicians are free to return home with the
 caveat that those suspected of crimes are subject to
 prosecution. Former Senate President Joe Wayas has been
 detained without charge since returning to Nigeria in June
 1987. A former Speaker of the House of Representatives who
 returned in December 1986 is also in detention. A former
 Minister of Commerce and Internal Affairs, detained without
 charge since his return to Nigeria in 1986, was released in
 May 1987.
 The Government does not use forced labor as a means of
 political coercion or as a sanction against free expression.
 Nigeria's 1979 Constitution provides that "no person shall be
 required to perform forced or compulsory labor." The latter
 excludes community service programs such as the National Youth
 Service Corps and environmental clean-up campaigns.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1984 decree modifying the 1979 Constitution left the
 judiciary relatively unscathed, but it shifted judicial
 activity for certain specified offenses to special military
 tribunals that were established outside the regular judicial
 system, notably for corruption cases( see below). The regular
 judiciary is composed of both Federal and state courts and
 includes procedures for appeals from courts of first instance
 to parallel appeal courts at state levels, then to the Federal
 Court of Appeal and finally to the Federal Supreme Court.
 Courts of first instance under the 1979 Constitution include
 magistrate or district courts, customary or area courts,
 religious or Shari'a courts, and for some specified cases, the
 state high courts. In some instances the nature of the case
 determines which court enjoys jurisdiction. In others, when
 jurisdiction is overlapping as in the case of customary and
 Shari'a courts, the plaintiff can designate the court.
 Shari'a, or Islamic courts, are limited by the Constitution to
 the 11 northern states of Nigeria.
 Trials in the regular court system are public and adhere to
 certain constitutionally guaranteed individual rights. These
 include a presumption of innocence, the right to be present at
 a public trial, to confront witnesses and present evidence,
 and to be represented by legal counsel if so desired. In
 capital cases, the Government provides counsel for indigent
 defendants. In other cases, indigents must rely for counsel
 on the Nigerian Legal Aid Society, which has limited resources.
 Assistance is extended under the Legal Aid Act of 1976 to
 persons with incomes of up to $400 per year. There is a
 functioning bail system. In his Independence Day speech,
 President Babangida announced that the Government would ensure
 strict compliance with laws denying bail to those charged with
 murder and armed robbery.
 Through decrees promulgated by the previous military
 government, but still in effect, the AFRC transferred
 jurisdiction over cases involving corruption, currency
 violations, armed robbery, and a variety of miscellaneous
 offenses, such as drug trafficking and illegal oil bunkering,
 from the civilian judicial system to special military
 tribunals. In these cases, those charged have access to legal
 assistance, bail (except in the case of armed robbery), and
 the right to appeal (except in the case of armed robbery and
 conviction under the Civil Disturbances Decree). Civilian
 judges head all special tribunals even though military members
 may be included. Currently six special tribunals including a
 
 
 225
 NIGERIA
 Special Appeal Tribunal are in operation. Convictions for
 armed robbery by the Special Robbery and Firearms Tribunals
 carry the death sentence and no right of appeal, although the
 sentence must be confirmed in some states by state military
 governors or the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory
 before it is carried out. The Special Appeal Tribunal began
 its first hearing in September, but no appeals were concluded
 before the end of the year. Recommendations of the Appeal
 Tribunal are subject to AFRC confirmation.
 Amnesty International's 1987 Report (covering 1986) gave
 prominent attention to the activities of the Special Robbery
 and Firearms Tribunals, noting the large number of persons
 sentenced to death and executed in 1986 and the need for an
 appeal'mechanism to a higher court. The judicial review
 panels of 1986 recommended corruption trials for nearly 800
 former public officials. However, the two corruption
 tribunals created in September 1986 to try these suspects have
 so far heard fewer than a dozen of the pending cases.
 In September, five defense attorneys withdrew under protest
 from the civil disturbances tribunal proceedings on the March
 religious riots. The lawyers, who were jointly defending 67
 people, claimed they were being denied regular access to their
 clients and accused the judges of partiality. The Trial
 Lawyers Association of Nigeria has offered free legal service
 to the accused persons who have rejected government-appointed
 counsel. The accused have no right of appeal, and the AFRC
 must confirm all sentences.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Nigerian society is generally free of arbitrary interference
 by the State in the private lives of its citizens. Provisions
 of the 1979 Constitution still in force guarantee rights of
 privacy in the home, correspondence, and oral electronic
 communications. General surveillance of the population by the
 State is not practiced. In April police reportedly searched
 the homes of some members of the government-appointed Political
 Bureau, during investigations into the unauthorized leak to the
 press of the Bureau's report. No Bureau members were arrested
 or detained. Forced entry into homes without a warrant rarely
 occurs.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The modified 1979 Constitution provides for freedom of
 expression and the press. Political, social, and economic
 issues are openly discussed. However, officials frequently
 caution journalists both publicly and privately on their
 responsibility and the extent of press freedom. In addition,
 in 1987 the Government took actions against a number of
 publishers and journalists to limit news reporting that is
 critical of government policies. Academic freedom is
 generally respected.
 The 1979 Constitution reserves to the Federal and state
 governments the exclusive right to own and operate radio and
 television stations. There are no restrictions on ownership
 of print media, and Nigeria has a lively press. Among the
 vast array of Nigerian daily newspapers are seven privately
 owned national dailies with large circulations, one daily
 
 
 226
 NIGERIA
 owned by the Federal Government, and another in which the
 Federal Government owns a majority share. Some states operate
 their own daily newspapers. In some states privately owned
 dailies compete with state papers. Four weekly newsmagazines
 vie for national readership.
 On several occasions in 1987 Federal and state authorities
 interrogated, jailed, or fired editors and reporters of
 government-owned papers on grounds that they had published
 articles inconsistent with official policy or otherwise
 embarrassing to the Government. Triggering these actions were
 items such as a two-page paid advertisement charging government
 security forces with bias in handling the March religious
 riots, an erroneously reported trip abroad by the President's
 wife, and an editorial critical of the Federal Government's
 removal of two leading directors of government-controlled
 banks who objected to central bank policies.
 In April President Babangida pledged not to revive Decree 4, a
 curb on the press imposed by the previous military Government.
 However, later in the year the President prohibited any
 attempts by the media to give publicity to those banned from
 elective office and to those advocating creation of new states
 in Nigeria.
 The 1979 Constitution includes a provision aimed at preventing
 disclosure of confidential information harmful to national
 security. Citing national security among its reasons, the
 Government closed for 5 months a leading weekly newsmagazine,
 Newswatch, and briefly detained three of its editors for
 publishing excerpts of the then-classified Political Bureau
 report on Nigeria's political future. The editors publicly
 apologized and stated they had not intended to embarrass the
 Government. They were not prosecuted.
 During 1987 the Government made several other moves aimed at
 curbing what it considers media irresponsibility with national
 security implications. It impounded an issue of a privately
 owned newsweekly for criticizing the firing of the bank
 officials, continued to require official authorization prior
 to press interviews of civil servants, limited the quantity of
 religious broadcasting on television and radio (all government
 owned) following religious rioting, and prohibited publication
 of advertisements paid for by religious organizations. A
 military tribunal hearing a corruption case against a former
 politician acquitted the publisher, editor, and reporter of a
 leftwing magazine of contempt for publishing an article
 tribunal authorities had considered prejudicial to the
 tribunal. In October Federal security authorities temporarily
 prevented publication of a book about the life of a prominent
 newsmagazine editor killed by a letter-bomb in 1986.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although Nigeria's 1979 Constitution assures all citizens the
 right to assemble freely and to associate with other persons
 in political parties, trade unions, or other special interest
 associations, in practice, there are important exceptions.
 The provision regarding the right to form and join political
 parties was suspended by Decree 9 of 1984. This Decree also
 authorizes the Government to dissolve or ban any other group
 considered to have objectives similar to those of a political
 party. Police monitor gatherings suspected of violating the
 ban. Government officials frequently reminded Nigerians
 during 1987 of the continuing ban on political activity but
 
 
 227
 NIGERIA
 did not dissolve any other organizations despite widespread
 allegations that an organization formed by a group of northern
 elders had objectives similar to those of a political party.
 The Government announced in June that political activity and
 the formation of political parties, limited to two, will
 resume in 1989.
 Nigerians form and participate in a myriad of special interest
 organizations, including a wide range of religious groups,
 trade groups, women's organizations, and professional
 associations. Organizations are not required to register with
 the Government. However, following the March religious
 disturbances, the Government introduced a requirement that
 religious groups be sanctioned by either the Christian
 Association of Nigeria, in the case of Christian groups, or
 the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, in the case of Muslim
 groups. Permits are not normally required for public meetings
 unless the venue is outdoors in a government facility and
 police security would be appropriate. In most states open-air
 religious services, outside a church or a mosque, are
 prohibited.
 The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has been
 banned since nationwide student demonstrations in May 1986.
 However, in December 1986 the Government authorized individual
 campuses to reinstitute student organizations. In May 1987,
 police were deployed to forestall a news conference scheduled
 by NANS to commemorate the previous year's demonstrations.
 Earlier the Inspector-General of Police had broadcast a
 reminder to students that the ban on NANS demonstrations and
 meetings wasstill in force. The police also published new
 guidelines for handling campus disturbances to avoid
 fatalities such as occurred in 1986.
 All Nigerian workers 16 years or older may join trade unions,
 with the exception of members of the armed forces and
 designated employees of essential government services at the
 Federal, state, and local levels. Employers are obliged to
 recognize trade unions and must pay a dues checkoff for
 employees who are members of a registered trade union. The
 establishment of closed shops is prohibited. About 10 percent
 of the 3 million nonfarm work force claims union membership,
 and the unions constitute a strong bargaining force for worker
 rights. With the ban on political parties still in force,
 unions have been cautious not to assume the role of a
 political party, but labor leaders have spoken out both in
 support and criticism of government labor policies. However,
 in response to a labor-led campaign against the Government's
 stated intention to eliminate or reduce petroleum subsidies,
 about 30 officials of the Nigeria Labour Congress, including
 its President, were detained without charges for 8 days in
 mid-December. Although the Government threatened to charge
 them with subversion, all were released unconditionally.
 Despite provisions in the 1979 Constitution and Nigeria's
 ratification of 28 International Labor Organization (ILO)
 conventions, government decrees and policy continue to
 restrict certain labor freedoms. A 1978 decree created a
 single central labor body, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC),
 forcibly merged a number of unions into 42 industrial unions,
 and deregistered all other unions. The Government has not
 responded to a 1982 ILO committee of experts finding that this
 decree violates ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of Association
 and Protection of the Right to Organize. The 1978 decree also
 created senior staff associations to represent white-collar
 
 
 228
 NIGERIA
 workers, which a 1986 decree explicitly excluded from NLC
 membership, forcing two such associations to withdraw. Since
 1975 government policy has permitted international labor
 affiliation only with the ILO and the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity and its affiliated pan-African labor
 federations. *Government policy does permit, however, informal
 "fraternal relations" with foreign unions and secretariats.
 The labor laws of Nigeria permit collective bargaining between
 management and trade unions. However, a series of restrictive
 measures imposed by the Government have significantly reduced
 the range of issues left for bargaining. In February 1987,
 the National Economic Emergency Decree of 1985, which granted
 the Federal Government broad authority over labor matters, was
 extended for 2 more years. The Government transferred to
 state governments the power to deduct special levies
 involuntarily from the salaries of workers for financing state
 development projects. The nationwide wage freeze, an
 anti-inflation measure, was imposed in 1984 and lifted in
 1987. Also, in 1987 the Government reestablished the
 requirement, in the Minimum Wage Act, that the minimum wage
 must be paid to employees in companies with 50 or more
 employees. (It had amended the Act in 1986 to require the
 minimum wage scale only in companies with more than 500
 employees.)
 Work stoppages and strikes are allowed by law (except in
 essential services), but few occurred during 1987. In June
 seven public service unions representing civil service
 employees of Bendel state went on strike because the state
 government was not meeting its financial obligations to its
 employees and retirees. The NLC supported the striking civil
 servants, and the Federal Government moved quickly to achieve
 a settlement. In October some 40 petroleum workers seized
 control of an offshore oil rig and locked their expatriate
 supervisors in their quarters for 2 days because their
 employer, a Nigerian company, had refused to turn over union
 dues to union representatives. The dispute was defused
 without government intervention when management agreed to
 accept the demands of the workers. The 1976 Trade Disputes
 Decree provides for mediation of such disputes by an
 industrial arbitration panel and a national industrial court,
 and forbids strikes and lockouts while disputes are under
 mediation.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nigeria's 1979 Constitution prohibits the Federal and state
 governments from adopting any religion as a state religion.
 This is adhered to in practice. Constitutional provisions
 guaranteeing freedom of religious belief, religious practice,
 and religious education are generally respected. Allegations
 persist of harassment of Christians by officials in
 predominantly Muslim areas of northern Nigeria in the form of
 bureaucratic obstacles to church construction that delay
 projects, sometimes indefinitely. There are no restrictions
 on numbers of clergy trained nor on contacts with
 coreligionists in other countries. Religious travel,
 including the hajj, is permitted and in some cases officially
 supported. Missionaries and foreign clergy, though limited by
 quotas, are permitted to work in Nigeria. Some states require
 licenses for religious services outside churches and mosques.
 Tensions between the Muslim and Christian communities of
 Nigeria escalated in March 1987 to several days of violent
 
 
 NIGERIA
 rioting in the northern state of Kaduna. The Government
 announced a death toll of 19, along with the destruction of
 162 churches, 5 mosques, and 152 private homes. The Government
 created a special civil disturbances tribunal to try persons
 arrested by a joint police-military investigative panel. The
 Government also announced a ban, still in effect, on all
 religious organizations on postprimary campuses, while
 reaffirming the right of individual students to practice their
 religion in recognized places of worship. Several state
 governments temporarily banned religious preaching and playing
 of religious cassettes outside places of worship without the
 written permission of police. Publication of advertisements
 paid for by religious organizations remains banned, and
 religiops programming on radio and television remains limited
 in some areas. The Minister of Internal Affairs announced
 that no new religious organizations could be formed without
 approval from one of two designated religious bodies, one
 Muslim and one Christian. In July the Government launched an
 advisory council on religious affairs, comprised of equal
 numbers of Christian and Muslim leaders.
 The 1982 ban on the Maitatsine religious sect remains in
 effect. The group still exists but is closely monitored by
 the police.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Nigeria's Constitution entitles citizens to move freely
 throughout Nigeria and to reside where they wish. The same
 provision prohibits expulsion from Nigeria or the denial of
 entry to or exit from Nigeria to any citizen. In general,
 these provisions have. been observed. Nigerians travel abroad
 in large numbers, and many thousands are studying abroad.
 Exit visas are not required. Citizens who leave Nigeria have
 the right to return. Citizenship cannot be revoked for any
 reason, including political reasons, from persons who are
 citizens by birth or registration. Fifty-seven naturalized
 Nigerians, however, had their citizenship revoked in 1987 for
 alleged irregularities in the naturalization process. No
 known penalties have been levied on Nigerians who have
 emigrated, settled abroad, or acquired another nationality.
 However, Nigeria does not recognize dual nationality, and
 naturalization in another country does not release Nigerians
 from Nigerian laws.
 Nigerians are free to change their place of work within
 Nigeria, but local laws sometimes disadvantage citizens not
 indigenous to the area. For example, access to limited places
 in elementary and secondary schools is more difficult for
 children of such citizens who must also pay higher school fees
 than the children of citizens of the area. There has been no
 forced resettlement of Nigerian citizens.
 Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge and asylum
 in Nigeria for political refugees from other countries.
 Nigeria supports and cooperates with the Lagos office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 Repatriation of refugees is normally conducted in accordance
 with UNHCR standards. In 1987 several hundred Chadian
 refugees were repatriated at their request as were an
 undetermined number of persons allegedly refugees from Libya.
 No refugees were expelled in 1987.

 NIGERIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The 30-member Armed Forces Ruling Council headed by President
 Babangida is the highest political authority in Nigeria.
 There is no elected legislative body, and political parties
 are prohibited. In 1987 citizens did not have the right to
 change their national or state governments through the
 electoral process. However, democratic elections for local
 government officials were held in December.
 In July President Babangida announced 1992 as the date for
 returning Nigeria to civilian rule. The Government based its
 program for transition to civilian rule on the recommendations
 of the civilian Political Bureau which conducted a nationwide,
 year-long public debate on Nigeria's political future during
 1986 and presented its findings to the AFRC in April 1987.
 While many of the Bureau's recommendations were accepted, the
 Government rejected or amended many other significant
 provisions, especially on socioeconomic policy. An appointed
 civilian Constitutional Review Commission is expected to
 propose to the 1988 constituent assembly a draft constitution
 closely resembling Nigeria's 1979 Constitution. The Government
 has recommended incorporation of one major change which calls
 for a two-party rather than a multiparty system. Six political
 parties participated in the last elections in 1983.
 As a first step in the transition process, free elections for
 local government councils were held on a nonpartisan basis in
 December, although malpractices and administrative problems
 resulted in cancellation of elections in about 5 percent of
 the nation's constituencies. Byelections are planned for
 early 1988. All citizens 18 years and older were eligible to
 vote. Dates have been set for additional elections in the
 run-up to 1992, but many former politicians are banned from
 contesting. A civilian National Electoral Commission was
 appointed in August to administer the elections. Also, a
 civilian Constitutional Review Committee (CRC) was appointed
 to review the 1979 Constitution. The CRC solicited input from
 the general public, as had the civilian Political Bureau, as
 the basis for its recommendations to a constitutional
 constituent assembly scheduled for 1988.
 Thousands of former Nigerian Government officials, both
 civilian and military, are prohibited from participating in
 the transition process, although they remain eligible to
 vote. In September 1987, the Government significantly
 extended a ban announced in 1986 on partisan political
 activity for a large number of former politicians from the
 last civilian regime (1979-83) to include many political
 figures from the first civilian republic (1960-66) and past
 and present high-ranking military leaders. These persons,
 including President Babangida himself, will be barred from
 contesting any election until after the transition is
 completed in 1992. Also, former politicians will be forbidden
 to join any political party until that time. Furthermore, any
 person convicted or removed from office for various misdeeds
 at any time since 1960 will be banned for life from contesting
 elections or holding any political party office.
 Along with the announcement in July of the political
 transition program, the Government promulgated Decree 19 of
 1987, the Transition to Civil Rule (Political Programme)
 Decree. This Decree makes persons who might in any way
 forestall or prejudice the transition program liable to a
 
 
 231
 NIGERIA
 prison term of up to 5 years. This applies to persons who:
 seek to undermine the realization of the transition program;
 take part in forming a political body prior to the lifting of
 Decree 9 (1984); or encourage others to join them in
 misrepresenting or distorting the provisions of the transition
 program.- The special tribunal authorized to try offenses
 under the Decree was formed in October. Its decisions may be
 appealed to the Special Appeal Tribunal.
 The composition of the AFRC and Cabinet reflects greater
 ethnic and religious diversity than any government in the
 recent past. There are currently no women on the AFRC or in
 the Federal Cabinet, although some women serve as permanent
 secretaries in cabinet departments and as commissioners in
 state governments.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 -Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no investigations of alleged human rights
 violations in Nigeria during 1987 by any international or
 nongovernmental agency. In 1987 the Babangida Government
 repeatedly renewed its pledge to uphold basic human rights and
 tolerated criticism from local human rights advocates. It did
 not interfere with local human rights organizations. The
 Human Rights Committee of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA)
 monitors the domestic human rights situation and
 characteristically speaks out against human rights abuses.
 The NBA president, following announcement of the ban on former
 politicians, publiclyquestioned the legality of the move. At
 least two other groups also monitor human rights practices in
 Nigeria: The Council of Human Rights, an independent
 organizatioa formed in late 1985, and Citizens for Human
 Rights., The former president of the NBA and chairman of its
 Human Rights-Committee continues to hold the post of Attorney
 General and Minister of Justice.. Amnesty International
 maintains an office in Lagos and has active chapters
 throughout the country, both on university campuses and among
 civil servants. Its annual human rights report is publicized
 in the Nigerian press.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no official policy of systematic discrimination among
 Nigeria's 250 ethnic groups, and laws do not overtly favor one
 .group over another. The Government generally makes a conscious
 effort to strike a balance among different groups in its
 decisionmaking and in appointments to key governmental
 positions. However, Nigeria has a long history of tension
 among the diverse ethnic groups, and tradition continues to
 impose considerable pressure on individual government
 officials to favor their own ethnic or religious group.
 Allegations of religious and ethnic favoritism or harassment
 persist.
 State-of-origin hiring quotas are observed in most public
 sector employment. Also, persons whose family is not
 indigenous to their state of residence frequently experience
 difficulty in job-seeking, school enrollment, and other areas.
 Women have always had economic power and have exerted
 influence in Nigerian society through women's councils or
 through their family connections. As primary school

 NIGERIA
 enrollments increase, women are gaining greater access to
 education. There has been a dramatic increase in the number
 of women who have university degrees and who have become
 professionals, including teachers, lawyers, doctors, judges,
 senior government officials, media figures, and business
 executives. Despite a degree of economic independence, women
 suffer discrimination in employment and other areas,
 experience social prejudice, and have virtually no
 representatives in the political arena. The pattern of
 discrimination against women varies according to the ethnic
 and religious diversity of Vigeria's vast population. In some
 states, husbands can prevent their wives from obtaining
 employment or passports. In many states, a widow cannot
 inherit her husband's property, which in the absence of
 children usually reverts to the husband's family. Women do
 not receive equal pay for equal work, and male professionals
 receive fringe benefits not extended to their female
 counterparts. Female circumcision, which has never become a
 major public issue, is still practiced in many areas, as is
 the selling of young girls for marriage by poor rural families.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Nigeria's 1974 Labor Decree prescribes a 40-hour workweek, 2
 to 4 weeks of annual leave, and other conditions of
 employment. The National Minimum Wage Act of 1981 set the
 national minimum wage at 125 Naira, or about $150, per month
 in 1981. With the minimum wage remaining constant, the
 progressive devaluation of the local currency over the past
 several years has resulted in a significant reduction in
 workers' purchasing power. The 125 Naira are now equal to
 about $27 per month, which is not sufficient to provide a
 decent standard of living and requires persons to supplement
 income through second jobs, extended-family assistance, etc.
 Under the Government wage freeze guidelines which were revised
 on December 31, 1987, annual increases are allowed at the 1984
 rate, the traditional 13th month holiday gratuity payment to
 employees is allowed, and improvements in fringe benefits in
 the private sector must be approved by the Government.
 The labor law prohibits employment of children under 15 in
 commerce and industry, restricts other child labor to
 home-based agricultural or domestic work, and allows the
 apprenticeship of youths aged 13-15 only under specified
 conditions. It contains general health and safety provisions,
 some aimed specifically at young and female workers,
 enforceable by the Ministry of Employment, Labour, and
 Productivity. Employers must compensate injured workers and
 dependent survivors of those fatally injured in industrial
 accidents. The ineffectiveness of the Ministry in enforcing
 these laws in the workplace is regularly criticized by labor
 unions.

 RWANDA
 Major General Juvenal Habyarimana has headed the Government
 since his accession to power in a nonviolent coup in 1973. He
 iias confirmed as President in a national referendum in 1978.
 He is also the founder of the single party, the National
 Revolutionary Movement for Development (MRND). Government
 policy is set by the President in consultation with the party's
 Central Committee and the Council of Ministers. Laws are
 ratified by the National Development Council (the legislature),
 which was established in 1982 but does not have any real
 independence from the MRND. In December 1983, President
 Habyarimana, the sole candidate, was reelected along with a
 new slate of deputies. Although the legislative candidates
 had to be approved by the party, the race was open to almost
 all whb chose to run.
 The major organizations responsible for administration of
 justice include the Ministry of Justice, which controls the
 courts, the judicial police, and the prison system; and the
 gendarmerie, a paramilitary force which receives specialized
 police training. In addition, the Central Intelligence
 Service in the Office of the President can make certain
 decisions which may not be appealed, such as denial of
 passports to Rwandan citizens or the extension of visas and
 residence permits to foreigners.
 Most Rwandans are poor rural farmers. There is little
 industry, and imports are expensive because of high
 transportation costs. Food production has managed to keep
 pace with the high population growth rate. Rwanda's major
 exports are coffee and tea, and the Government has a liberal
 approach to trade and investment.
 Although the Constitution provides for a number of fundamental
 human rights, there are restrictions in practice on the right
 to fair public trial, the right of citizens to change their
 government, and freedom of speech, association, and religion.
 The most significant human rights development in 1987 was the
 July prisoner amnesty decreed by the President during the
 country's observance of its 25th anniversary of independence.
 The amnesty included the release of all women and minors
 serving sentences of 20 years or less, and of all other
 prisoners sentenced to 10 years or less; the commutation of
 death sentences to life imprisonment; and the reduction of
 life sentences to 20 years. However, none of the amnesty
 measures applied to seven political prisoners convicted by the
 Court of State Security of crimes agAinst domestic security.
 The amnesty also released the 295 members of certain religious
 sects, convicted in 1986 of charges relating to observance of
 their religion. The Government indicated that in the future
 it intends to resolve such problems with religious groups
 through discussion with those concerned.
