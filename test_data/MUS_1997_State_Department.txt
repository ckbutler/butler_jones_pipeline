 MAURITIUS
 The Republic of Mauritius, a parliamentary democracy since 1968, is governed by
 a Prime Minister, a Council of Ministers, and a National Assembly. The President,
 who is nominated by the Prime Minister and confirmed by the National Assembly,
 serves as Head of State, with largely ceremonial powers. Fair and orderly national
 and local elections, supervised by an independent commission, take place at regular
 intervals. There are numerous political parties and partisan politics is open and ro-
 bust. The judiciary is independent.
 A paramilitary Special Mobile Force under civilian control is responsible for inter-
 nal security. This force, under the command of the Commissioner of Police, is
 backed by a general duty police force. Both forces are largely apolitical and gen-
 erally well trained. While human rights violations are infrequent, members of the
 security forces committed some abuses.
 The economy is based on labor-intensive, export-oriented manufacturing (mainly
 textiles), as well as sugar and tourism. The standard of living is high, with average
 per capita gross domestic product of approximately $3,400 per year. The Govern-
 ment is successfully diversifying the economy by promoting investment in new sec-
 tors such as information technology and financial services.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, but problem
 areas remain. There continued to be occasional reports that police abused suspects
 
 
 224
 and detainees as well as delayed their access to defense counsel. Discrimination and
 violence against women is a problem. In a significant step, in May the Government
 passed legislation outlawing domestic violence. Child labor remains a problem. In
 a positive step, the Government decided to introduce human rights education in sec-
 ondary schools and is now preparing a curriculum for introduction in 1998. In No-
 vember police inspectors participated in the first human rights training seminar for
 law enforcement officials in the country.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 However, no progress was made in resolving the cases of two persons who died
 in police custody, one in December 1996, the other in 1994. Human rights lawyers
 asserted that the police were attempting to conceal the facts surrounding the deaths
 and were not conducting thorough, unbiased investigations.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and inhuman punishment, and authorities generally ob-
 served it. However, there were approximately one dozen published reports of alleged
 police brutality involving mistreatment of individuals, including suspects in custody.
 Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards.
 The Government has permitted prison visits by foreign diplomats, the national
 ombudsman, a team from the U.N. Commission for Human Rights, and the press.
 The Government is investigating conditions and treatment in police holding cells.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and the Government generally observes these prohibitions. In
 most cases, but not in all cases, suspects are provided prompt access to family and
 defense counsel.
 The Constitutionprohibits exile, and the Government does not use it.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. The judicial
 system consists of the Supreme Court, which has appellate powers, and a series of
 lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the Judicial Committee in the United
 Kingdom (the Privy Council). There are no political or military courts.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judici-
 ary vigorously enforces this right. Defendants have the right to private or court-ap-
 pointed counsel. The 1995 Dangerous Drugs Act, which would permit law enforce-
 ment authorities to hold suspected drug traffickers for up to 36 hours without access
 to bail or legal counsel, is undergoing judicial review and has not been implemented.
 The constitutionality of the law maybe questioned.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these provisions, and violations are subject to legal sanction. Both human rights
 lawyers and police authorities said that illegal entry by the intelligence apparatus
 has ceased. The acting Commissioner of Police stated that police do not use illegal
 wire taps on telephones.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Debate in the National Assembly is lively and open. More than one dozen privately
 owned newspap rs presented varying political viewpoints and expressed partisan
 views freely. The Government has the ability to counter press criticism by using
 strict libel laws; however, the Ramgoolam Government has not invoked these meas-
 ures to inhibit the press. Libel suits between private parties are common.
 The government monopoly in broadcasting local news and programming contin-
 ued, but it was undermined by a decision of the Supreme Court in July that is ex-
 pected to result in the opening of broadcasting to private parties, except for local
 news programming, which will remain under government control pending passage
 of legislation for complete liberalization. The Government did not challenge the
 Court's decision, and appears prepared to comply with it. Television and radio news
 reporting maintained a progovernment slant, although the Mauritius Broadcasting
 Corporation allowed opposition figures slightly more air time than it had previously.
 Sky News from the United Kingdom and Canal Plus from France are available to
 the public on a subscription basis.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 
 
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice. Police permis-
 sion is required for demonstrations and mass meetings such permssion is rarely
 refused, and groups have the right to challenge denials. In June 1996, the Commis-
 sioner of Police decided not to authorize a trade union march 12 hours before it was
 to have begun. Police later informed union leaders that they would be prosecuted
 because they had addressed the crowd that had gathered despite the ban. In August
 the police demanded that the union leaders surrender their passports. They subse-
 quently withdrew this demand. An inquiry began to determine who had initiallyin-
 structed police to prosecute the trade unionists, but its results were not available
 at year's end.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign- Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 There are no refugees. The Government considers asylum requests on a case-by-
 case basis.
 The issue of the provision of first asylum has never arisen. There were no reports
 of forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice. Free and fair national elec-
 tions based on universal suffrage were held in December 1995. The remote and iso-
 lated islands of Agalega and St. Brandon are an exception to universal suffrage.
 Their nearly 500 citizens have no representation in the National'Assembly.
 In the National Assembly, up to eight members are appointed through a "best
 loser' system to ensure that all ethnic groups are represented.
 Of the 66 National Assembly seats, 6 areheld by women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups are organized and active, and operate without
 government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights
 - cases. Government officials cooperate with and respond to the views of human rights
 groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, caste,
 place of origin, political opinion, color, creed, or sex. The Government generally re-
 spects these provisions. In a positive step, the Government decided to introduce
 human rights education in secondary schools and is preparing a curriculum for in-
 troduction in 1998.
 Women.-Violence against women, particularly spousal abuse, is widespread, ac-
 cording to the Ministry of Women's Rights and Family Welfare, attorneys, and non-
 governmental organizations. In August the Government took a significant step to
 address these problems by enacting legislation that outlawed domestic violence and
 provided mechanisms to protect women and children in particular. Officials report
 that the number of spousal abuse cases has been rising in the last 3 years due pri-
 marily to better reporting. Between August and November, 66 protection orders
 were issued and an additional 35 were under investigation.
 Women have traditionally played subordinate rles in society, and societal dis-
 crimination continues. Women do, however, have access to education, employment,
 and government services.
 Children.-The Government placed strong emphasis on the health and welfare of
 children, and displayed a commitment to expand educational opportunities for chil-
 dren. Education is mandatory up to the age of 12, and the Government plans to in-
 crease this to the age of 15.
 Incidents of child abuse are occasionally reported; private voluntary organizations
 claim that the problem is more widespread than is publicly acknowledged. Most gov-
 ernment programs are administered by the state-funded National Children's Coun-
 cil, which provides counseling, investigates reports of child abuse, and takes reme-
 dial action to protect affected children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other government services. The law
 requires organizations that employ more than 10 persons to set aside at least 3 per-
 
 
 cent of their positions for the disabled. The law does not require that work sites be
 accessible to tle disabled, making it difficult for people with disabilities to fill many
 jobs. There is no law mandating access to public buildings or facilities.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Tensions between the Hindu majority and
 Creole and Muslim minorities persist but rarely lead to violence or open confronta-
 tion. Creole and Muslim minorities attempted to keep public attention focused on
 alleged societal injustices and Hindu discrimination against them. Some Creole po-
 litical groups allege that they received unequal treatment from police, including
 being subjected to a greater degree of force.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution explicitly protects the right of
 workers to associate in trade unions, and there is an active trade union movement.
 More than 300 unions represent over 100,000 workers, or about 20 percent of the
 work force. Many of the unions are small, having less than 1,000 members. Eight
 major labor federations serve as umbrella organizations for these smaller unions.
 With the exception of members of the "disciplined force," namely, the police and the
 Special Mobile Force, and persons in state services who are not public officers such
 as contractors, workers are free to form and join unions and to organize in all sec-
 tors including in the export processing zone (EPZ). Although only 10 percent of EPZ
 workers are unionized, these workers are covered by national labor laws. The
 Mauritian Labor Congress asserts that union membership is low in the EPZ in part
 because employers in the EPZ intimidate employees and restrict-access to union or-
 ganizers. Labor unions are independent from the Government and press wage de-
 mands, establish ties to domestic political parties, and address political issues.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act (IRA), unions have the legal right to strike.
 In practice, however, the IRA requires a 21-day cooling-off period, followed by bind-
 ing arbitration, which has the effect of making most strikes illegal. The IRA states
 that worker participation in an unlawful strike is sufficient grounds for dismissal,
 but workers may seek remedy in court if they believe that their dismissal is unjusti-
 fied. There were no major strikes during the year.
 Under the law, unions may and -do establish ties with international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law protects the right of
 employees to bargain collectively with their employers. Wages are established by the
 National Remuneration Board (NRB), whose chairman is appointed by the Minister
 of Labor, but most unions are able to negotiate wages higher than those set by the
 NRB. About 12 percent of the labor force works for national or local government.
 The IRA prohibits antiunion discrimination. There is an arbitration tribunal that
 handles any such complaints.
 About 90,000 people work in the EPZ. While there are some EPZ-specific labor
 laws, such as provisions allowing EPZ employers to request up to 10 hours per week
 .of paid overtime from their employees, workers in these firms enjoy the same basic
 protections as workers in other firms.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and not practiced in fact. Forced or bonded labor involving children
 and domestic workers is prohibited by law and does not exist.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 Sminimum age for employment of children is 15 years. However, children unable to
 attend secondary school often seek apprenticeships in the trades. The Government
 plans to increase mandatory education to 9 years of schooling, which would keep
 children in school until the age of 15, rather than the current requirement, age 12.
 There are also plans to establish vocational schools to train those who leave school
 early.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcement and conducts frequent in-
 spections. Child labor in homes, on farms, and in shops is common in Rodrigues,
 which is the principal problem area because of the difficulty in monitoring. Forced
 or bonded labor involving children and domestic workers is- prohibited by law and
 does not exist (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively establishes
 minimum wages, which vary according to the sector of employment, and it man-
 dates minimum wage increases each year based on inflation. The minimum wage
 for an unskilled worker in the EPZ is about $10.50 (231 rupees) per week, while
 the lowest weekly wage for a non-EPZ worker is about $12.50 (274 rupees). This
 is below the level needed to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and
 family, but the actual market wage for most workers is much higher due to the
 present labor shortage and collective bargaining. The standard legal workweek in
 the industrial sector is 45 hours. In the EPZ, an employee may work an additional
 10 hours per week, although at a higher hourly wage.
 
 
 The Government sets health and safety standards, and Ministry of Labor officials
 inspect working conditions and ensure compliance with the 1988 Occupational Safe-
 ty, Health, and Welfare Act. The small number of inspectors limits the Govern-
 ment's enforcement ability, but through voluntary compliance the number of occupa-
 tional accidents has been cut nearly in half since the act's passage. Workers have
 the right to remove themselves from dangerous situations without jeopardy to con-
 tinuedemployment.
