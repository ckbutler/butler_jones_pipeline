 ALGERIA
 Since shortly after independence in 1962, political power has been controlled by
 Algeria's military leadership, supprted by the bureaucracy and remnants of the Na-
 tional Liberation Front (FLN), the former ruling party. The Constitution, adopted
 in 1989, provided for a transition from this military-based, one-party Socialist state
 to a multiparty parliamentary system. However, democratization was suspended in
 1992 when the Army intervened, forced the president to resign, canceled the second
 round of parliamentary elections which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised
 to win, and installed a five-man High State Committee. Subsequently, this ruling
 Committee imposed a state of emergency, banned the FIS as a political organiza-
 tion, and jailed most of its leaders. Since 1992, fighting has continued between the
 security forces and armed Islamist groups seeking the overthrow of the Government
 and the imposition of a fundamentalist Islamic stapte.
 In 1994 the Army leadership replaced the High Committee with Liamine Zeroual,
 a former general, who became president of a  transitional" government. Zeroual
 tried to find a political solution with the major legal parties and the FIS, and under-
 took some limited confidence-building measures. He conditioned release of FIS lead-
 ers from prison, and their inclusion in multiparty discussions, on their calling for
 an end to political violence. Late in 1994, Zerual announced that a national dialog
 for a political resolution to the crisis had failed, and that presidential elections
 would be held in 1995. He rejected "totally an-I in detail" the "national compact,"
 a proposal for negotiating a political solution, adopted by opposition parties at a
 meeting in Italy sponsored by the Sant'Egidio Society in January. These parties in-
 cluded representatives of the FIS and FLN, the Socialist Forces Front (FFS), which
 is supported mainly by Berbers, as well as several smaller parties.
 The Government tried without success to convince the Sant'Egidio parties to par-
 ticipate in the presidential election. Four candidates officially received the 75,000
 signatures needed to appear on the ballot of the country's first pluralist presidential
 election. After an intense and widely-publicized campaign lasting 3 weeks, nearly
 75 percent of the electorate voted on November 16. President Zeroual obtained over
 60 percent of the votes, according to government figures. While there appears to
 have been little coercion of the 12 million voters, losing candidates claimed that
 there were instances of localized election fraud, but insufficient to alter the outcome.
 In his inaugural address, President Zeroual called for legislative elections and prom-
 ised to move toward full democracy in the future.
 The Government's security apparatus is composed of the newly formed Communal
 Guards (a local police), the police, the gendarmerie, and the army, air force, and
 navy, all of which are involved in efforts to repress the Islamist insurgency and com-
 bat terrorism. The security forces were implicated in torture, arbitrary arrest, and
 extrajudicial killing.
 Spurred by government reforms, the economy is evolving slowly from a centrally
 planned system to a more market-oriented system. However, government-owned in-
 dustry stll dominates the economy. In 1995 the state-owned hydrocarbon industry
 alone constituted about one-fourth of gross domestic product and earned 97 percent
 of the country's export revenues. The Government's contractionary fiscal and mone-
 tary policies in 1995 hit the state sector hard, as the Government reduced its finan-
 cial support to debt-ridden firms. Some of these companies laid off excess workers
 and limited salary increases during the year. Algeria is a middle-income country,
 with an annual per capita income of about $1,700. Unemployment rose in 1995, es-
 pecially among younger workers. About 70 permnt of persons under 30 could not
 adequate employment. Some of them made a living from petty smuggling or
 peddling goods on the street.

 A broadly accepted estimate is that an average of 10,000 people have been killed
 every year since the beginning of the unrest. One estimate indicates that nearly
 50,000 Algerians had been killed by the fall of 1995.
 There is convincing evidence that the security forces carried out dozens of
 extrajudicial killings and often tortured and otherwise abused detainees. While the
 Government continues to use its emergency law powers to detain hundreds of sus-
 pected Islamists, it closed the last remaining detention camp in November and re-
 eased the 641 prisoners held there. The Government continues to restrict freedoms
 of assembly, religion, press, and movement, and the Family Code discriminates
 against women. The Government has promised legislative and local elections, but
 has not yet set a date. In contrast to previous years, there was only one report of
 anti-Islamist vigilante groups killing Islamists and their sympathizers. Domestic vi-
 olence against women remains a serious problem.
 Terrorists carried out widespread attacks on civilians. They assassinated political
 figures, journalists, academics, and thousands of other civilians as well as 20 for-
 eigners. According to press reports, they kidnaped and raped young women, forcing
 them to become mistresses of group leaders. Insurgents used car bombs and other
 devices to attack electric pylons, telephone exchanges, schools, bridges, police and
 military headquarters, local government offices, and railroad trains and tracks. Car
 bombs caused hundreds of civilian deaths. in addition, some armed groups are com-
 posed of ordinary criminals who have exploited the general breakdown in law and
 order.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the. Integrity of the Person, Inclu.ding Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There is credible evidence that secu-
 rity forces con'inued to commit eArajudicialkillings of persons involved in, or sus-
 pected of, terrorism. in February the MVinister of Justice announced that 96 pris-
 oners were killed and 10 wounded during a disturbance at the Serkadji Jail, a facil-
 ity which houses prisoners condemned to death for terrorism. The prisoners Milled
 four guards during the disturbance. The Government has not made public a list of
 those killed, nor has it released the report of a special committee which investigated
 events at Serkadji. However, the National Observatory for Human Rights (ONDH)
 a government body which reports on human rights issues to the President, released
 a report in May which supported the Minister's version that the security forces
 quelled a prison riot.
 Nevertheless, lawyers for the victims and their families issued a report in July
 claiming that the Government had spurned a peaceful settlement during the dis-
 turbance, and that the security forces deliberately killed over 100 prisoners even
 after the disturbance was quelled. The lawyers also claimed that prison authorities
 systematically removed or destroyed evidence. The Government has not responded
 to the lawyers' charges or to calls by Amnesty Iaternational (Al) and Human-Rights
 Watch for an independent investigation. An AI medical delegation visiting Algeria
 in March requested permission to visit Serkadji Prison and interview surviving de-
 tainees, but was denied access to Algerian jails.
 The Government maintains that the security forces resort to lethal force only in
 the context of armed clashes with terrorists. Nonetheless, ONDH claims that during
 the year it provided President Zeroual with information on "some tens" of cases of
 possible extrajudicial killings. In other cases, ONDH was unable to determine the
 identity of the perpetrators.
 In July ONDH stated that a detainee in the Ain M'guel detention camp had been
 killed and an investigation was underway.
 In September Saghir Bouhadida, a former journalist, died under suspicious cir-
 cumstances while in police custody. Bouhadida was arrested on June 11 on sus-
 picion of membership in a terrorist group. While in detention he reportedly gave the
 police information about a terrorist cell, and in September led the police to a terror-
 ist hideout. The Government claims that Bouhadida was killed there in an exchange
 of fire.
 In 1994 ONDH provided the Ministry of Justice with information on 12 suspected
 extrajudicial killings. The Ministry responded to only one case in 1995. In that case,
 a military tribunal found three security officials guilty of the extrajudicial killing
 of several people and gave them long jail sentences. ONDH did not receive informa-
 tion on the other cases, despite President Zeroual's publicly stated assurances that
 human rights violators would be punished.
 The anti-Islamist, independent daily Liberte reported in October that the self-de-
 fense committee in a village in eastern Algeria had apprehended three men who al-
 
 
 1121
 legedly participated in a terrorist attack on the village. The committee executed the
 three without a trial.
 Armed groups, most notably the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), killed hundreds-
 perhaps thousands-of persons, including members of the security forces and ordi-
 nary citizens. Terrorists attacked civilians whom they regarded as instruments of
 the state or whose life styles they considered in conflict with Islamic values.
 Victims included politicians, teachers, tax collectors, entertainers, government-ap-
 pointed Islamic preachers, veterans of the war of independence, journalists, intellec-
 tuals, the families of security service personnel, and foreigners. The throats of many
 victims were cut or their bodies were mutilated after death. Sometimes the victims'
 severed heads would be discovered in one location and the bodies in another. There
 were numerous reports of armed bands taking over villages, destroying government
 buildings, raping women, and killing inhabitants, including children.
 During the year, armed groups killed a minor presidential candidate; the presi-
 dent of the National Football Association; two members of the Finance Committee
 of the National Transition Council (Algeria's appointed parliament); a professor of
 Islamic law; the president of a women s association; a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 official; a professor (a female) at the National Institute of Agronomy; the Director
 of Training at the National School of Administration; a well-known sports figure;
 active members of political parties; the imam of the Sidi-Abderrahman Mosqe; and
 a trade union leader who was also a member of the Algerian League for the Defense
 of Human Rights (LADDH).
 In November terrorists killed a member of the Executive Committee of the Social-
 ist Forces Front, as well as workers in the election campaigns of President Zeroual
 and Said Sadi, the candidate of the RCD party. The president of the Algiers Associa-
 tion of Private Practitioners was assassinated in his office on November 26.
 Armed groups intensified their attacks on journalists, killing at least 25 in 1995.
 Five of the victims worked for the state television company and three for the state
 radio company. In March a gunman shot and critically wounded a television journal-
 ist and her sister while the two were waiting for a company car to take them to
 work. The journalist died of her wounds 10 days later. A week after her death, the
 chief editor of the Government's French language daily El Moudjahid was killed on
 his way to work. Three journalists were killed within 48 hours on September 3-4,
 and a television reporter and his wife were killed on September 8. After these
 killings, independent newspapers suspended publication for 3 days to protest the
 killings of journalists and demand better police protection. Throughout the year,
 some journalists lived a transient life, to avoid staying 2 nights in the same place.
 Since 1993, 54 Algerian journalists reportedly have been killed.
 Terrorist groups killed 20 foreigners in 1995, compared to 74 in 1994. Victims in-
 cluded Roman Catholic priests and nuns, businessmen, a university professor, and
 construction workers. Terrorists attacked two French nuns, both longtime residents
 of a violence-prone suburb of Algiers, on November 10, killing one and critically in-
 juring the other. Terrorists also killed two Latvian sailors on November 30 and
 wounded a third.
 In addition to targeted killings, terrorist groups resorted to indiscriminate vio-
 lence, making greater use of bombs and car bombs in 1995 than in previous years.
 In January a suicide car bomb exploded in a busy street in central Algiers, killing
 42 and wounding 286. In March a car bomb wounded 83 persons and destroyed 60
 apartments in a building housing police families. The GIA claimed responsibility for
 that attack. A car bomb in May at Bachdjara, also directed at a housing area for
 police, wounded 37 people. In August a car bomb aimed at the Gendarmerie head-
 quarters in central Algiers killed nine and wounded 104. In September a bomb ex-
 ploded under a locomotive near Algiers, killing 5 and injuring 11. In October gun-
 men opened fire on a crowded country bus, killing1 passengers, including three
 children, and wounding 15. Also in October, car bombs exploded in the towns of
 Barki and Relizane, and another exploded near a gendarmerie barracks in Rouiba,
 killing 6 and injuring 83. In November a car bomb exploded near a police station
 in Souk El-Tenine, in the Kabylie region, killing 3 and wounding 7. Fourteen people
 were killed in December by a car bomb in Ain Nadja. A communique issued by the
 FIS condemnend that bombing.
 b. Disappearance.-The ONDH claimed that it received significantly more com-
 plaints about disappearances in 1995 than in 1994 when it documented 116 cases
 of disappearances allegedly caused by security force personnel. It submitted infor-
 mation on all of these cases to the Ministries of Justice and Interior, in some cases
 the Government responded to the ONDH queries, but in others it did not. In many
 cases it was impossible to determine whether the security forces or armed groups
 were responsible.
 
 
 1122
 In July ONDH said that the security forces denied holding Djamal Fahassi, a
 radio journalist, who disappeared on May 6. Fahassi was reportedly a militant sup-
 porter of the FIS who had been fired from his job at a state radio station. OND
 assumed that Fahassi was kidnaped by armed groups; but many journalists believe
 he was arrested by the security forces. Hadj Abdelkader Benaamane an Algerian
 press service reporter who disappeared in February, reappeared in July at his trial
 before a military tribunal (see Section i.e.).
 Terrorist groups kidnaped hundreds of civilians. Sometimes their bodies were
 found later, but often the victims disappeared and their families have no informa-
 tion about their whereabouts.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Knowledgeable sources, including Amnesty International (A) and all three major
 Algerian human rights organizatons--ONDH, LADDH, and the Algerian League for
 Human Rights (LADH)-reported that the security forces frequentfy used torture on
 detainees, especially suspected Islamists, to extract confessions or to obtain informa-
 tion about the activities of terrorist groups. The ONDH claimed that it provided the
 Ministry of Justice with information on "ens" of cases of torture. Evidence suggets
 that many alleged torture victims decline to press charges against security officials
 for fear of reprisal against themselves or their families.
 In July the political arties that participated in the Sant'Egidio conference
 charged that torture had ecome an integral part of police investigations. The Gov-
 ernment denies that torture is a matter of policy or an accepted practice, but ac-
 knowledges that individual security officials may commit "excesses." In January
 President Zeroual ordered the prosecution of any official charged with using torture.
 However, the Government has failed to condemn the use of torture publicly, nor has
 it demonstrated that it investigates torture allegations seriously. ONDH claimed
 that it submitted 17 torture cases to the Ministry of Justice in 1994, of which 5 had
 been transferred to judicial proceedings. The Government has not revealed whether
 torturers have been punished.
 A commonly reported torture method is the use of the "chiffon," a cloth stuffed
 into the victims mouth and saturated with dirty water. Other torture techniques re-
 prtedy include electric shocks, beatings, the pulling out of igernails, burning
 with cigarettes or a blowtorch, and the insertion of objects into the anus.
 Hamas party officials complained to the media that security forces arrested a
 party worker during the presdential election campaign and tortured him to death.
 An autopsy reprtely revealed evidence of torture. The Government did not deny
 the  amas charges.
 Terrorist groups have also abused persons under their control. For example, the
 media eported that armd Islamist groups often raped women when they took over
 controLof towns and rural villages.
 Prisons are overcrowded, but there is no reliable information to assess other con-
 ditions. The Government does not permit independent monitoing of prisons or de-
 kntion centers by such humanitarian organizations as the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. It stipulates that incommunicado detention in criminal cases
 phrior to arraignment may not exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect must be
 carged or released. However, under the state of emergency, the security fores
 have arrested and detained thousands of persons. According to the Antiterrorist De-
 cree of 1992, the police may hold deta ies n preaualignment detention for 12 days
 and must inform them of the charges against them. In practice, the security forces
 routinely exceed the lawful detention limit.
 In January ONDH announced that it had received 327 complaints in 1994 that
 detainees were held in prearragnment detention longer than 12 days.
 When making arrests the security forces do not obtain watrants and allegedly
 ofen refuse to identify themselves or to provide detainees' relatives and lawyers
 with information about their whereabouts or well-being. These practices are appar-
 ently permitted under the state of emergency.
 Under the state of emergency, the Minister of Interior is authorized to detain sus-
 pects in special camps administered by the Army. The Government announced on
 November 29 that it had closed Aln M'gel, the last of these camps, and releaed
 the 641 men who we held there (see Section l.a.).
 Exile is not a legal form of punishment and is not known to be practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trio.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and in December, President Zeroual promisednew efforts to ensure that inde-
 pendence. The judiciary is composed of the civil courts, which try misdemeanors and
 felonies, and military courts, which have been known to try civilians for terrorism
 offenses. There is also a Constitutional Council which reviews the constitutionality
 
 
 1123
 
 of treaties, laws, and regulations, and elections. Although the Council is not part
 of the judiciary, this independent body has the power to nullify laws, etc., if they
 are found unconstitutional.
 Islamic law, or Shari'a, provides much of the basis for civil court rulings in mat-
 ters involving personal status, such as divorce or inheritance.
 Under the state of emergency, military courts are authorized to try civilians ac-
 cused of terrorism. The only known example of such a trial this year occurred in
 July whea a military court in Tamanrasset sentenced Hadi Abdelkader Benamane,
 a journalist, and at least two other defendants, to 2 to 4 years in prison for publish-
 ing the place of detention of the Vice President of the FIS, Ali Benhadj.
 InFebruary the Governmnent abolished three special courts established to try ter-
 rorism and subverioa cases. Their jurisdiction was transferred to the ordinary
 criminal courts. The President appoints civilian judges on recommendations from
 the Higher Magistrate's Council, composed of the Prsident, the Minister of Justice,
 and various members of the judiciary.
 According to the Constitution of 1989, defendants are presumed innocent until
 proven guilty. They have the right to legal counsel, are entitled to be advised of the
 charges against them, have the right to confront their accusers, may appeal the ver-
 dict, and trials are public. In November the Minister of Justice admitted that 18,000
 of the country's 34,000 prisoners have not yet been tried. About half of the prison
 population is being held for alleged terrorist offenses. The courts continued to hand
 dlown death sentences to those found guilty of terrorism; however, executions were
 suspended in 1993.
 Police subpoenas are not always delivered to those subpoenaed, and the Govern-
 meat is unable to ensure their delivery. The law requires that the Government pro-
 vide lawyers for indigent defendants. Lawyers representing Islaniists have received
 death threats.
 The former detainees of the Ala M'guel detention might be considered political
 prisoners as most were arrested in 1992 for alleged "subversive activities" and held
 without trial (see Section 1.d.).
 fc Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondenae.-Al -
 though the Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, the state of emer-
 gency authorizes regional governors to issue exceptional search warrants at any
 time. Security forces often enter residences illegally. The Government fails to ensure
 that the police adhere to lawful procedures for entering houses or monitoring cor-
 respondence.
 Armed insurgents often enter private homes either to kill or kidnap residents or
 to steal weapons, valuables, or food.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speeh and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. The state of emergency and the Antiteromrist Decree of December
 1992 gave the Government broad authority to restrict these freedoms and to take
 legal action against what it considered to be threats to the State or public order.
 Fear of arrest deters many journalists from reporting on internal security develop-
 ments, the Islanist movement, or the military and security services, unless the in-
 formation is provided by the authorities. In Febrary journalists reported that the
 Government had assigned newspaper censors to prevent the publication of offending
 articles.
 Nonetheless, the press continued to report opinions contrary to the government
 line. Commentary on the military is usually self-censored, but some newspapers
 have published interviews with former military officers who have criticized the cur-
 rent commanders.
 The Government continued to suspend newspapers without providing reasons for
 the closures, beyond vague accusations of undermining public order or the interests
 of the State. The Government continues to restrict news about the FIS, unless pro-
 vided by government sources.
 In November 1994, the Ministry of Interior suspended the publication of the FLN
 newspaper, El Hiwar, and that newspaper did not resume publication in 1995. In
 September, the FLN's Secretary General claimed that the Ministry still had not pro-
 vided him with a written suspension order. Without it, the FLN was not able to pe-
 tition for the removal of the suspension order.
 The Arabic weekly El Wadj ElAkhar, suspended for a month in December 1994,
 was suspended agai n t1995. It has not resumed publication.
 In March the Government suspended the independent weekly, La Tribune, be-
 cause it did not publish an Arabic-language version as required by law. After com-
 plaints that the law was applied selectively, the Government lifted the ban.
 
 
 1124
 Also in March, the Government began an investigation of the editors of El Watan,
 Algeria's biggest newspaper, and El Khabar on unspecified charges. The editors
 were p laced under "judicial control," which requires them to report periodically to
 their local police station. The Government did nBt explain the purpose of the inves-
 tigation, but the editors speculated that they ran afoul of the authorities because
 El Watan published an article about a scandal in the Public Health Service, and
 El Khabar criticized the Ministry of Justice's handling of the disturbance at
 Serkadji prison (see Section 1. a.).
 In May the Government suspended the publication of the newspaper Horizon, re-
 portedly for publishing material that overstepped the Government's news guidance.
 In June the Government suspended the French-language El Ouinn for 15 days,
 and the weekly La Nation and the monthly El Houria, each for a month, allegedly
 for printing an announcement signed, inter als, by the FIS, of a public meeting of
 the SantEgidio parties. El Ouma reported in June that in its 8 months of existence,
 the Government had suspended its publication for 81 days.
 Also in June, the Government suspended the publication of the newspaper El
 Hadith, for 6 months repordly because it had published a letter by FI Vice Presi-
 dent A Benhadi, after the Government had denied the existence of the letter.
 In July the police arrested Sheikh Hocine Slimani, purportedly because El Watan
 had published a description of his alleged role in facilitating behind the scenes talks
 between the Government and the FI in June. Slimani was released after 24 hours
 but reportedly was placed under judicial control.
 In August the Government placed the mansig editor of La Nation under judi-
 cial control, after it published an interview with a senior FIB official. The Interior
 Ministry prevented La Nation's October 18 issue from appearing on news stands
 without explanation. Shortly thereafter, the Ministry suspended two other issues of
 La Nation, aain without explanation. Observers speculated that the suspensions
 were ordred bcause La Nation supported the Sant'Egidio parties' call for a boycott
 of the November presidential election.
 In December the authorities arrested the editor and a reporter at the French-lan-
 guage newspaper, Liherte, apparently for discussing a possible government appoint-
 ment for one of the countes top generals in a gossip olumn. They received sus-
 pended sentences of 4 months and 2 months, respectively, and the newspaper was
 suspended for 15 days, even after it apologized for reporting erroneous information
 about the general.
 The Government further controls the press by its monopoly on newsprint, printing
 presses, advertising, and newspaper distribution services. Several newspapers
 ceased publication jor financial reasons, which they attributed to the government
 monopolies. Their problems were exacerbated by shortages of newsprint and cuts in
 electricity.
 The Government continued to curtail the public expression of views supportive of
 te Fs. Two FIB publications banned in 1992 remain suspended. However, commu-
 niques and bulletins from various Islamist organizations, including the FIS and its
 armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIB), circulated clandestinely. Islamist
 communiques sometimes appear on the walls of mosques.
 The press may report news related to the FIB only after the Government has is-
 sued a news release about the FIS, as in the case of a series of letters from FIB
 leaders to the Government. The press may also publish without harassment when
 the news reports police successes against the armed groups, or, in selected cases,
 when the news has already appeared in print abroad.
 Radio and television remained under government control, with coverage biased in
 favor of the Government's policies. However, the state radio and television allowed
 opositionpresidential candidates to present their views prior to the November
 prsidentia election. Because of the widespread accessibility of satellite dish anten-
 nas, millions of citizens have access to European broadcasts.
 The terrorist campaign against journalists and academics continued to constrain
 freedom of speech and press. In January the GIA reiterated its threats against all
 journalists. Assailants murdered 25 journalists in 1995. Many journalists received
 death thrats and took security precautions.
 In April an unidentified group of armed Islamists seized a state television relay
 station in western Algeria and broadcast their own hour-long tape of Koranic verses
 before destroying the station's transmitting equipment.
 The exodus abroad of intellectuals and university educators to escape threats con-
 tinued throughout the year. As a result, there were few academic seminars and col-
 loquia.
 According to the Government's latest figures, in 1994 terrorists destroyed 915 pri-
 mary and secondary school classrooms, 7 institutes of research and development, 9
 
 
 1125
 
 centers for professional training and 3 university administration buildings. Terror-
 ists continued to target schools in 1995.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the 1989 Constitu-
 tion provides for the rights of assembly and association, the Government has sharp-
 ly curtailed these freedoms under the Emergency Law.
 In July the Government forbade two officials of the FIS to make any public state-
 ments. A month earlier, the Government had ordered them not to engage in further
 political activities after they had appeared on a public platform with other figures
 of the SantEgidio parties.
 Citizens and organizations must obtain a permit from the local governor's office
 before holding public demonstrations. After review by the Ministry of Interior, such
 permits are generally granted for demonstrations against terrorism or in support of
 the Government. Legal parties are not required to obtain permits to hold private
 meetings, but in July and September the Government refused several parties per-
 mission to hold a series of public meetings on human rights.
 The Government allows Berber organzations to hold demonstrations only in the
 Kabylie region, which has a large Berber population. In January and February, it
 denied permission for two demonstrations sponsored by the Berber Cultural Move-
 ment in the Algiers area.
 The Ministry of Interior licenses all nonovernmental associations, and regards all
 associations as illegal unless they have licenses. It may deny a license to, or dis-
 solve, any group regarded as a threat to the existing political order.
 After the Government suspended the parliamentary election in 1992, it dissolved
 the FIS as a political party, and the social and charitable groups associated with
 it. Membership in the F IS is illegal. However, the Government itself has ontinued
 to meet periodically with FIS leaders who are in detention.
 Acrding to a 1989 law, all citizens have the right to join political organizations,
 except oudges, army and security servie personnel, and members of the Constitu-
 tional Council. Most political groups, except the banned FIS, conduct activities free-
 ly. Over 55 parties, including some centrist Islamist parties such as Hamas, were
 active in 1995. Other associations include specialized groups such as human rights
 and women's rights groups, social welfare groups, and regionally based cultural or-
 ganizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution declares Islam to be the state religion
 but prohibits discrimination based on religious belief. The Government respects this
 right in practice. It permits the small Cbristian and Jewish populations (numbering
 approximately 1,000 and 200 respectively) to practice their faiths without inter-
 ference.
 In 1994 the GIA declared its intention to eliminate "Jews, Christians, and Poly-
 theists" from Algeria. The Christian community, composed mostly of foreigners, cur-
 tailed its activities and evacuated some church workers because of death threats.
 During the year, extremists killed two Roman Catholic priests and three nuns, and
 wounded another nun.
 Conversions from Islam to Christianity a  re. The Family Code prohibits Mus-
 lim women from marrying non-Mnslims, although Muslim men may marry non-
 Muslim women. Because of legal problems and social stigma, Muslim converts to
 Christianity practice their new faith clandestinely. The Ministry of Religious Affairs
 appoints Islamic preachers in both state and private mosques. It also proposes
 themes for and monitors sermons.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of domestic and foreign travel and free-
 dom to emigrate. The Government generally respects these provisions, although it
 imposes some restrictions on men of military age. Under the Family Code, women
 under 19 years of age need their husband's or father's permission to obtain a pass-
 port or travel abroad
 Under the state of emergency; the Minister of Interior and the provincial gov-
 ernors may deny residency in certain districts to persons regarded as threats to pub-
 lic order. A curfew irst imposed in 1992 prohibits people from traveling in Algiers
 and the surrounding provinces between midnight and 4 a.m.
 In April the Government restricted travel by non-residents to four southern prov-
 inces where much of the oil industry and many foreign workers are located. Police
 checkpoints in the cities and countryside routinely step vehicles to inspect identifica-
 tion papers and search for evidence of terrorist activity. Armed groups establish
 comparable false checkpoints to rob travellers of cash and vehicles, or to kill them.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum, and the Government
 has granted asylum in a few cases. The Government cooperates with the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refu-
 gee Sahrawis, the former residents of Western Sahara who left a therritory after
 
 
 1126
 it was occupied by Morocco in the 1970s, and Tuaregs, a nomadic people of southern
 Algeria and neibring countries. Some came from Mali to escape fighting in the
 northern part of that country. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those
 having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Army's cancellation of the electoral process in 1992 effectively denied citizens
 the right to change their government by legislative election. Power remains in the
 hands of the military leadership, supported by the bureaucracy, and some officials
 of the FLN, the former ruling party. The military appointed all the members of the
 National Transition Council, which functions as a quasi-parliament.
 In November President Liamine Zeroual was elected to a 5-year term in office,
 after obtaining over 60 percent of the vote in a multiparty presidential election.
 Nearly 75 percent of the electorate cast their ballots in an election that was gen-
 erally considered to be free and fair. In his inaugural address, President Zeroual
 pledged that Algeria would continue to move toward full democracy, and announced
 his intention to hold legislative and local elections.
 Prior to the election, the Government clamped down on opposition parties which
 called for their supporters to boycott it. When the FLN was denied permission to
 hold a large party meeting, it complained that the Government had impinged on its
 constitutional liberties. The Government also clamped down on the media which
 suapported the Sant'Egidio parties (see Section 2.a.).
 Few women hold high government positions. There are no women in the Cabinet,
 but the highest government official responsible for family matters is a woman.
 vFewer than 1 percent of the candidates for pariament  elections in the 1991 par-
 liamentary election were women. However, the  e      e Labor Party is a woman
 and the major political parties have women's divisions. The Government changed
 the electoral law to ensure that women cast their own ballots, rather than to permit
 their husbands or fathers to do so for them, as frequently happened in previous elec-
 tions.
 The Berbers, an important indigenous minority group, participate freely and ac-
 tively in the political process. Berbers hold influential positions m the Government
 and the army. The Tuaregs, a people of Berber origin, do not play as important a
 role in politics, due in large part to their small numbers, estimated in the tens of
 thousnds  and their nomadic existence. Systemic or goverment-sanctioned bar-
 riers to political participation dd not exist against any minority group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are two independent human rights groups: the Algerian League for the De-
 fense of Human Rights (LADDH), whose president was spokesman of the parties at
 the SantEgidio Conference, and the Algerian League of Human Rights (LADH),
 which is largely moribund. Neither gup issues annual reports of its findings. A
 overnmental body, the National Observatory of Human Rights (ONDH), estab-
 tished in 1992, is charged with reporting human rights developments directly to the
 President. The OND    submitted its first annual report to the President in 1994,
 but the Government has not made it public.
 Although the Government does not permit independent monitoring of prisons or
 detention centers (see Section 1.c.), it allowed representatives from Al to visit Alge-
 ria twice.
 The Government claimed that AI has preconceived ideas about th~e conflict in Al-
 veria, and lacks evidence to support its allegations of human rights abuses. The
 Government did not respond to calls by Al and other international human ihts
 groups for an independent investigation into the disturbance at the SerkaDji Prison
 (see Section l.a.).
 The Government's public interest in human rights increased in January after the
 SantEgidio Conference. At that meeting, several political parties and the FIB issued
 a "national compact" to end civil unrest, and called or respect for human rights.
 Shortly afterwards, President Zeroual ordered state entities to cooperate with inves-
 tigations conducted by ONDH, and indicated that the Government would irosecute
 any official accused of violating unspecified "human rights." In June the OTDH held
 a 2-day seminar to educate the public about human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on birth, race, sex, belief, or any
 other personal or social condition. However, women continue to face legal and social
 discrimination.

 Women.-Women's rights advocates assert that spousal violence is common, al-
 though there are no reliable studies on the problem. Battered women may file crimi-
 nal charges or sue for divorce, but women's rights advocates maintain that legal ac-
 tions are rare because the courts are generally lenient with abusive husbands.
 Some aspects of the law and many traditional practices discriminate against
 women. Women's rights advocates argue that the 1984 Family Code violates the
 Constitution. Based on Islamic law, or Shari'a, it regards women as minors under
 the legal guardianship of a husband or father. Women do not have full legal respon-
 sibility for their children because the father must sign all official documents. A
 woman's testimony in a court of law does not equal a man's.
 The Family Code also confirms the Islamic practice of allowing a man to marry
 four wives-a rare occurrence. However, a wife may sue for divorce if her husband
 does not inform her of his intent to marry another wife. Only males are able to con-
 fer citizenship on their children. In cases of divorce, the Code awards guardianship
 of the children to the father, even though the mother is usually expected to care
 for them until a son is 13 and a daughter is married.
 Women may own businesses and enter into contracts. Women constitute about 8
 percent of the work force and pursue opportunities in government, medicine, law,
 education, the media, and even in the armed forces. Nonetheless, social pressure
 against women pursuing a career is strong. According to government figures, women
 constitute 53 percent of illiterates.
 During the year, Islamists continued to pressure women to adopt Islamic fun-
 damentalist social norms. According to the Government, unidentified assailants
 killed over 160 women in 1995. The GIA announced in March that it would attack
 families of members of the security forces. They have carried out that threat (see
 Section L.a.). Extremists have also killed those who own and operate hair salons and
 their clients. Islamist groups reportedly raped women and forced some to serve as
 mistresses of group leaders.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to protecting children's
 human -ights. It provides free education for children ages 6 to 15 and free medical
 care for all citizens. The Ministry of Youth and Sports has many programs for chil-
 dren, but those proga     face serious funding problems. Legal experts maintain
 that the Penal and Family Codes do not offer children sufficient protection. Hos-
 pitals treat dozens of cases of child abuse every year, but many cases are unre-
 ported. Laws against child abuse have not led to notable prosecutions against of-
 fenders.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. Public enterprises gen-
 erally ignore a law which requires that they reserve 1 percent of their jobs for peo-
 ple with disabilities. The independent newspaper La Tribune reported in May that
 the Government has ignored international standards for treatment of people with
 disabilities. The ONDH is charged with developing programs to provide unspecified
 "help" for people with disabilities, but the project has not been given a high priority.
 The Government also provides limited financial support to several nongovernmental
 organizations that assist people with disabilities.
 National IRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Berbers were the original inhabitants of
 Algeria, and many citizens claim to be of mixed Berber and Arab ancestry. Berbers
 have sought to maintain their own cultural identity and language in the face of the
 Government's emphasis on the development of an Arab identity. In May the Govern-
 ment created the High Commission for Berber Affairs. The move followed a year-
 long school boycott in Berber areas, because there was no instruction in Berber lan-
 guage and culture. The Commission has begun implementing its mandate to pro-
 mote Berber culture, and to introduce the Berber language into the education and
 media. There have been professorships in Berber language and culture at the Uni-
 versity of Tizi Ouzou for years.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to establish trade unions of
 their choice. About two-thirds of the labor force belongs to unions. Workers are re-
 quired to obtain government approval to establish a union. After a labor union re-
 ceives its license, it must wait 6 months before it can start its organizing activities.
 The Government limits some union activities. As part of its crackdown on the FIS,
 the Government abolished an Islamist union affiliated with the FIS, because it had
 never been licensed.
 The law prohibits unions from associating with political parties. The law also pro-
 hibits unions from receiving funds from foreign sources. The courts are empowered
 to dissolve unions that engage in illegal activities.
 
 
 1128
 Under the state of emergency, the Government is empowered to r quire workers
 in both the public and private sectors to stay at their jobs in the event of an unau-
 thorized or illegal strike. According to the 1990 Law on Industrial Relations, work-
 ers may strike only after 14 days of mandatory conciliation, mediation, or arbitra-
 tion. This law states that arbitration decisions are binding on both parties. If no
 agreement is reached in arbitration, the workers may legally strike after they vote
 by secret ballot to do so. A minimum level of public services must be maintained
 during public sector service strikes.
 There were numerous local strikes and work stoppages by public-sector workers,
 such as a strike in June and July by oil-sector workers. Most ended quickly follow-
 ing mediation efforts involving government officials and labor unions. The Govern-
 ment did not invoke the state of emergency to block strikes; it only rarely retaliated
 against workers involved in the stoppages.
 Unions may form and join federations or confederations, affiliate with inter-
 national labor bodies, and develop relations with foreign labor groups. The UGTA,
 for example, has contacts with French unions and te American Federation of
 Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize ana Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining for all unions. The Government permits this right to be practiced.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers and provides mechanisms for resolving trade union complaints of antiunion
 practices by employers. It further permits unions to recruit members at the work-
 place.
 c. Prohibition Gf Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is in-
 compatible with the Constitution's provisions on individual rights. The Penal Code
 prohibits compulsory labor, and the Government effectively enforces the ban.
 d. Minimum Age for Employmrent of Children.-T he minimum age for employment
 is 16 years. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor enforce the mimmum employment
 age by periodic or unannounced inspection visits to public sector enterprises, but do
 not effectively enforce it in the agricultural or private sectors. Many children are
 driven by economic necessity into informal employment, such as street vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law defines the overall framework for ac-
 ceptable conditions of work, but leaves specific agreements on wages, hours, and
 conditions of employment to the discretion of employers in consultation with employ-
 ees. The Government fixes by decree a guaranteed monthly minimum wage for all
 sectors. The minimum wage is $80 per month (4,000 dinars). Ministry of Labor in-
 spectors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the minimum wage regula-
 tions, although they enforce these provisions inconsistently.
 Algeria has a 44-hour workweek and well developed occupation and health regula-
 tions codified in a decree issued in 1991. However, government inspectors do not en-
 force these regulations effectively.
