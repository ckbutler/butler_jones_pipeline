 KUWAIT
 Amirs, or princes, from the AI-Sabah family have ruled Kuwait in consultation
 with prominent community figures for over 200 years. The Constitution, adopted in
 1962 shortly after Kuwait's independence, provides for an elected National Assembly
 and enumerates the powers of the Government and the rights of citizens. It also
 permits the Amir to suspend its articles during periods of martial law. The Amir
 twice suspended constitutional provisions and dissolved the National Assembly from
 1976 to 1981 and from 1986 to 1992 and ruled extraconstitutionally during these
 riods. Kuwait was occupied by Iraq from August 1990 to February 1991, when
 Vai forces were expelled by a coalition led by the United States. The Assembly re-
 sumed functioning after the 1992 elections.
 
 
 1205
 The Ministry of Interior supervises the security apparatus, including the Criminal
 Investigation Department (CID) and Kuwait State Security (KSS), two agencies
 that, in addition to the regular police, investigate internal security-related offenses.
 Some members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 Endowed with oil, the country has largely completed the process of recovery from
 the destrmction caused by the Iraqi occupation, and has an estimated per capita in-
 come of approximately $23,000. Because of the costly reconstruction the Govern-
 ment has recurred a cumulative fiscal deficit of approximately $70 billion, which it
 covers by liquidating government-owned foreign assets and increasing the public
 debt. The Government is gradually reducing the deficit and plans to eliminate it by
 2000. Despite its emphasis on an open market, the Government continues _to domi-
 nate the locl economy through direct expenditures and government-owned compa-
 nies and equities.
 There continued to be incremental improvement on the human rights scene. Dur-
 ing the year, the National Assembly ratified two important human rights conven-
 tions and extended the franchise to a large group of adult males who previou ly did
 not have voting rights. The Assembly's Human Rights Committee was active in in-
 vestigating important human rights issues. Moreover, the Government abolished the
 special State Security Court in favor ofthe regular judiciary, and there was contin-
 ued improvement in prison conditions. Kuwait enjoys an active press which is free
 to criticize the Government.
 Nonetheless, significant problems remain. Women do not have the right to vote;
 however, a bill granting women's suffrage was introduced in the Assembly. The Gov-
 ernment continues to be hostile to the human rights problems of the more than
 100,000 stateless people residing in Kuwait known as the "bidoon." It also prevents
 the return of stateless persons, Iraqis, and Palestinians who have strong ties to the
 county. Domestic servants are not protected by the labor law, and unskilled foreign
 workers suffer from a lack of a minimum wage in the private sector, and from fail-
 ures to enforce the labor law. Moreover, the Goveent bans formal political par-
 ties, and places some restrictions on the freedom of assembly and association.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integri osy of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There were no developments in the investigations into the extrajudicial killings
 that occurred during the chaotic period after Kuwait's liboration in 1991.
 b. Disappearane.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There were no developments in the approximately 100 cases of disappearance that
 occurred following Kuwait's liberation in 1991.
 According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Iraqi authori-
 ties have not yet accounted for 603 Kuwaitis and residents of Kuwait, including 9
 women, who were taken prisoner during Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. The Govern-
 ment of Iraq has refused to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 687,
 which stipulates the release of the detainees. Iraq denies that it holds Kuwaiti de-
 tainees.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and there is no pattern of systematic abuse. Nev-
 ertheless there continues to be credible reports that the police physically abused de-
 tainees during interrogation. The  aie were more likely to inflict such abuse on
 non-Kuwaitis than on citizens. Reported abuse includes blindfoldings, verbal
 threats, and slaps and blows.
 The Government says that it investigates all allegations of abuse and that it has
 punished at least some of the offenders. However, the Government does not make
 public the findings in its torture investigtions or what, if any, punishments are im-
 posed. This omission creates a climate of impunity which diminishes the deterrence
 against torture and abuse. t  c
 Defendants have the right to present evidence in court that they have been mis-
 treated during interrogation. However, the courts frequently dismiss torture com-
 plaints because defendants are often unable to substantiate their claims with phys-
 ical evidence. Members of the security forces deliberately hide or misrepresent their
 identity, a practice that further compates  noirmation of abuse.
 The Government has taken some steps to bring its prison system up to inter-
 nationally recognized minimum standards. Prison conditions are general y accept-
 able in terms of food, access to basic health care, access to the media, scheduled
 family visits, cleanliness, and opportunities for exercise and work. The Government
 
 
 1206
 has permitted family visits for Jordanian prisoners and g.anted entry visas to the
 family members who would normally not be allowed to visit Kuwait.
 The National Assembly's Human Rights Committee continued to monitor prison
 conditions. Committee members visited prisons in early 1995 as they did in the pre-
 vious yea. _The ommittee members noted that problems include overcrowding and
 the availability of specialized medical care. The Government allows the ICRC access
 to all detention facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for freedom
 from arbitrary arrest and detention. There were no reports of arbitrary arrest this
 year.
 Police officers must obtain an arrest warrant from state prosecutors before mak-
 ing an arrest, although in misdemeanor cases the arresting officer may issue them.
 Security forces ccasionally detain persons at checkpoints in Kuwait City (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.).
 Under the Penal Code, a suspect may not be held more than 4 days without
 charge. Security officers sometimes prevent families from visiting detainees during
 this confinement. After 4 days, prosecutors must either release the suspect or file
 charges. If charges are filed, prosecutors may remand a suspect to an additional 21
 days i detention. Prosecutors may also obtain court orders for further detention
 pending trial.
 Over 1,900 persons are serving sentences at the central prison of Kuwait, while
 another 500 are under detention pending deportation. The issuance of deportation
 orders is arbitrary, and an alen may be deported without trial. The Government
 may expel noncitizens, even those who have been long-term residents, if it considers
 them securty risks. The Government may also ex    oreigners if they are unable
 to obtain or renew work or residency permits. About 10 percent of the 500 detainees,
 especially Iraqis or Bidoon (stateless residents of Kuwait), have been in detention
 for more than 1 year. However, the Government will not deport them to their coun-
 tryof oriin aainst their will. Ira ended its arrangements for U.N. supervised bor-
 der crosings m Febrary, preventing the repatriation of those Iraqis who desire to
 return tsee Section 2.d.).
 The law protects citizens from exile, and there were no reports of this practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution states that 0judges shall not be
 subject to anly authority." Nonetheless, the Ministry of Justice controls the judi-
 ciarys administrative and financial matters. The Amir appoints all judges on rec-
 ommendations from the Minister of Justice. Judges who are citizens have lifetime
 appo sitments, but the Government also employs many noncitizen as judges. These
 non-Kuwaiti judges work under renewable contracts, which undermines their inde-
 pendence. The Ministry of Justice may remove judges for cause, but rarely does so.
 Foreig residents involved in legal disputes with citizens frequently complain that
 tme courtios sho a b in favor of Kuwaiti citizens.
 In 1995 the National Assembly abolished the Special State SecuritydCourt and
 now has one court system which tries both civil and criminal cases. The Court of
 Cassation is the highest level of judicial appeal. Sunni and Shi'a Muslims have r-
 course to courts of their respective denominations for family law case.
 FoDefendants have the rig     l to confront their accusers and appeal verdicts. The
 Amir has the constitutional power to paron or commute all sentences. Defendants
 in felony cases are required by law to be represented in court by legal counsel which
 the courts will provide in criminal cases, in misdemeanor cases, defendants have
 the right to waive the presence of legal counsel, and the court is not  red to
 provide counsel to indigent defendants.
 Both defendants and prosecutors may appeal court verdicts to the High Court of
 Appeal, which may rule on whether the law was properly applied, as well as on guilt
 or innocnce of the defendant. Decisions of the High Court of Appeal may be pre-
 sented to the Court of Cassation, which will conduct a limited, formal review of
 cases to determine only whether the law was properly applied.
 In the regular ourt system there are no groups, including women, who are barred
 from testifeding or whose testimony is given lesser weight. However, the Islamic
 courts, which have jurisdiction over family law, apply Islamic law, which states that
 the testimony of two women equals that of one man.
 There are no reported political prisoners, but the Government continues to incar-
 cerate person on victed of ollaboration with Iraq during the occupation. By law
 such collaboration is a felony. Most of the people convicted in martial law courts
 (including the majority of collaborators) did not receive fair trials.
 _of. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for individual privacy and sanctity of the home. The police
 must obtain a warrant to search both public and private prorty, unless they are
 cr hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime, or if alcohol or narcotics
 
 
 1207
 
 are suspected on the premises. The warrant can be obtained from the state prosecu-
 tor or, in the case of private property, from a judge. The security forces occasionally
 monitor the activities of individuals and their communications.
 By law males must obtain government approval to marry foreign-born women.
 However, the Government does not vigorously enforce this restriction, and Kuwaitis
 routinely obtain exemptions from the Ministry of Justice. The Government also ad-
 vises women against marrying foreign nationals.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press-With a few exceptions, citizens are free to criti-
 cize the Government at public meetings and in the media. Several laws empower
 the Government to impose restrictions on the freedom of speech and the press, but
 they are rarely invoked.
 Kuwaiti newspapers are privately owned and free to publish on many social, eco-
 nomic, and political issues and frequently criticize government policies and officials,
 including the Crown Prince, who is also the Prime Minister.
 The Government ended prepublication censorship in 1992, but journalists still
 censor themselves. The Press Law prohibits the publication of any direct criticism
 of the Amir, official government communications with other states, and materal
 that serves to "attack religions" or "incite people to commit crimes, created hatred,
 or spread dissension among the populace." In 1995 the Government banned publica-
 tion of one newspaper for 5 days for contravening the law. The media and the Na-
 tional Assembly criticized the ban.
 In order to begin publication of a newspaper, the publisher must obtain an operat-
 ing license from the Ministry of Information. Publishers may lose their license if
 their publications do not appear for 6 months. This 6-month rule prevents publish-
 ers from publishing sporadically-it is not used to suspend or shut down existing
 newspapers. Individuals must also obtain permission from the Ministry of Informa-
 tion beore publishing any printed material, including brochures and wall posters.
 The Government does not censor foreign journalists and permits them open access
 to the country.
 The Government owns and controls the radio and television companies. The Mid-
 dle East Broadcasting Company and Egyptian television transmit to Kuwait without
 censorship. The Government does not inhibit the purchase of satellite dishes. Citi-
 zens with such devices are free to watch a variety of programs, including those
 broadcast from Israel.
 The Ministry of Information censrs all books, films, videotapes, periodicals, and
 other imported publications to remove morally offensive material. However, the
 M   try  as censored political topics as well. The General Organization of Printing
 and Publishing controls the printing, publishing, and distribution of informational
 materials in Kuwait.
 There is no government censorship of university teaching, research, or publica-
 tion. However, academics are subject to the same restraints as the media with re-
 gard to criticism of the Amir or Islam.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution af-
 firms the right to assembly, the Goveent restricts this right, as well as that of
 association, and bans political parties. Several informal political blocs, acting much
 like parties, coalesced during the 1992 elections and have been present in succeed-
 ing National Assembly sessions. The Government has made no effort to constrain
 these groupings, which are organized on the basis of common ideological goals.
 Many may be categorized as "opposition" groups. Public gatherings, however, must
 receive prior governnent approval, as must private gatherings of more than 5 per-
 sons that result in the issuance of a public statement.
 Political activity finds its outlet in informal, family-based, almost exclusively
 male, social gatherings known as diwaniyas. Practically every male adult, including
 the Amir, hosts and attends diwaniyas at which every possle topic is discussed.
 The diwaniya contributes to the development of political consensus and official deci-
 sionmaking.
 All nongovernmental oranizations (NGOs) must obtain a license from the Mn-
 istry of Social Affairs and Labor. The Government uses its power to license as a
 means of political control. The Ministry has registered over 55 NGO's, including pro-
 fessional groups, a bar association, and scientific bodies. These Sroups receive gov-
 ernment subsidies for their operating expenses. They must obtain permission from
 the Ministry before attending international conferences. However, since 1985 the
 Ministry has issued only two licenses. The Ministry has disapproved other license
 requests on the grounds that previously established NGO's already provide services
 similar to those proposed by the petitioners.
 
 
 1208
 By banning unregistered NGO's the Government mainly sought to dissolve groups
 whose efforts were not coordinated with an official government committee working
 for the release of the missing persons presumed herd in Iraq. The ban discourages
 these groups from fundraising and recruitment, and prevents them from holding
 public meetings and making their views known in the press. Nevertheless, the Gov-
 ernment overlooks the activities of many unregistered NGO's, despite a decree is-
 sued in 1993 ordering them to cease activities. No organization has challenged that
 decree in court.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. The Constitution states that
 Islamic law Shari'a, is "a main source of legislation." The ruling family and many
 prominent kuwaiti families belong to the denomination of Sunni Islam. However,
 40 percent of the population belong to the Shi'a denomination. They are free to con-
 duct their traditional forms of worship without government interference.
 There are several legally recognized expatriate congregations and churches, in-
 cluding a Catholic diocese and several Protestant churches. Expatriates who are
 members of religions not sanctioned in the Koran (e.g. Hindus, Sikhs, and Bud-
 dhists) may not build places of worship but may worship privately in their homes.
 The Government prohibits missionaries to proselytize among Muslims; however,
 they may serve expatriate congregations. The law prohibits religious education for
 religions other than Islam, although this law does not appear to be rigidly enforced.
 The Government does not permit the establishment of non-Islamic publishing com-
 panies or training institutions for clergy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have the right to travel freely within the country and to
 change their workplace as desired. Unmarried women age 21 and over are free to
 obtain a passport and travel abroad. However, married women who apply for pass-
 ports must obtain their husband's written permission. Once she has a passport, a
 married woman does not need her husband's permission to travel, but he may pre-
 vent her departure from the ountry by placing a 24t-hour travel ban on her. He can
 do this by contacting the immigration authorities. After this 24-hour period, a court
 order is required if the husband still wishes to prevent his wife from leaving the
 country. Minors must have their father's permission to travel outside of the country.
 Citizens are free to emigrate and to return.
 A serious problem exists in the case of the Bidoon, who are stateless persons usu-
 ally of Iraqi or Iranian descent who resided in Kuwait prior to the Iraqi invasion.
 The Government argues that many Bidoon (the term means "without") are conceal-
 ing their true citizenship in order to remain in Kuwait, become citizens, and enjoy
 the generous benefits provided to citizens. Some Bidoon have had residency ties to
 Kuwait for generations. Others immigrated during the oil boom years. There are ap-
 proximately 117,000 stateless persons in Kuwait, down from a prewar level of about
 220,000. The Government does not wish the return of the Bidoon who departed Ku-
 wait during the Gulf War and frequently delays or denies issuing them entry visas.
 This policy imposes serious hardships and family separations.
 The Government continued its postwar policy of reducing the number of foreign
 residents from those countries that supported Iraq during its invasion of Kuwait.
 The number of such residents is now only about 10 percent of its pre-war total. The
 Government permits the ICRC to verify if a deportee objects to returning to his
 country of origin. The Government detains those deportees who have objections at
 the main deportation center.
 Security forces in Kuwait City occasionally set up checkpoints where they may de-
 tain individuals. The checkpoints are mainly for immigration purposes and are used
 to apprehend undocumented aliens.
 There is no legislation governing refugees, and no clear or standard procedure for
 processing a person's claim to be a refugee. The Constitution prohibits the extra-
 dition of political refugees. The Ministry of Interior may issue residency permits to
 persons granted political asylum, although this is not a frequent occurrence. The
 Government states that it does not deport anyone who claims a fear of persecution
 at home, but it will often keep such persons in detention rather than grant them
 permission to live and work in Kuwait. The United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees maintains an office in Kuwait and has access to refugees in detention.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens cannot change their head of state. Women and many others are
 disenfranchised, only 30 percent of adult citizens are eligible to vote. Under the
 Constitution, the Amir holds executive power and shares legislative power with the
 National Assembly. The Prime Minister presides over a 16-member cabinet. In ac-
 cordance with the practice of the ruling family, the Prime Minister is always the
 
 
 1209
 
 Crown Prince. The Constitution empowers the Amir to suspend its provisions and
 to rule by decree. In 1986 the Amir effectively dissolved the National Assembly by
 suspending the constitutional provisions on the Assembly's election. The Assembly
 remained dissolved until 1992. The Amir had previously dissolved the Assembly
 from 1976 to 1981.
 An election was held for the National Assembly in 1992 in which 303 candidates
 ran for the Assembly's 50 seats. Members serve 4-year terms. The Constitution em-
 powers the Assembly to overturn any Amiri decrees made during the dissolution.
 After the election, the Assembly used its power to revoke some decrees issued from
 1986 to 1992. Since the Government prohibits political parties, assembly candidates
 must nominate themselves. Nonetheless, informal political groupings are active in
 the Assembly (see Section 2.b.).
 Approximately 82,000 citizens, almost the entire franchised male population at
 the time, registered to vote in the 1992 elections. In 1994 the Assembly passed legis-
 lation extending the right to vote to the sons of naturalized citizens. It amended
 that law in 1995 to extend the franchise to citizens naturalized 20 to 30 years ago.
 These measures should increase the male electorate to an estimated 100-110,000.
 Women are disenfranchised and have little opportunity to influence government.
 In the past, a majority of the members of the National Assembly have expressed
 opinions favoring women's rights to vote, and a draft law granting- this right
 emerged after 3 years of consideration by a parliamentary comttee. However, no
 strong parliamentary support currently exists for this law, and the Government has
 made no effort to persuade the National Assembly to pass the legislation. Women's
 groups in Kuwait are divided on this issue.
 Members of Kuwait's Shi'a minority are generally underrepresented in high gov-
 ernment positions, although in recent years two Shi'a Muslims were appointed to
 the Cabinet and one was named to a high-ranking military post.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government has prevented the establishment of local human rights groups
 by not approving their requests for licenses (see Section 2.b.). The Government per-
 mits international human rights organizations to visit and to establish o ifices. Sev-
 eral organizations conduct field work and report excellent communication with and
 reasonable cooperation from the Government.
 The National Assembly has established a human rights committee which takes
 testimony from individuals about abuses, investigates prison conditions, and has
 made nonbinding recommendations for redress (see Section 1.c.). During the year,
 the Assembly ratified two international human rights conventions: the Convention
 on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and the Convention
 on the Non-applicability of Statutory  Limitations to  War Crimes and Crimes
 Against Humanty.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, national origin, lan-
 guage, or religion. However, laws and regulations discriminate against women, and
 non-Kuwbitis face widespread social, economic, and judicial discrimination.
 Women.-According to some local experts, domestic abuse of women occurs in an
 estimated 15 percent of all marriages. Each of the country's 50 police stations r-
 ceives approximately one to two complaints of spousal abuse each week. Women in
 such cases usually take refuge in the homes of relatives. The police and the courts
 generally seek to resolve family disputes informally and may ask the offending
 spouse to sign a statement affirming that he will end the abuse. The police refer
 serious cases to the psychiatric department at the Ministry of Health. The courts
 have found husbands guilty of spousal abuse.
 A significant number of employers physically abuse expatriate women working as
 domestic servants, and sexual abuse is also a concern. The local press gives the
 problem considerable attention. Foreign-born servants have the right to sue their
 employers for abuse, but few do so owing to both fear of deportation and fear that
 the judicial system is biased against them. The Government has designated a police
 station to investigate complaints and provide some shelter for runaway maids. eoth
 the police and the courts have taken action against employers when presented with
 evidence of serious abuse.
 Runaway servants seek shelter at their country's embassy where they seek repa-
 triation or a change in employers. On several occasions, the Philippine embassy has
 sheltered nearly 300 women at once. Although most of these women sought shelter
 
 
 1210
 due to contractual or financial problems with their employers, many also alleged
 physical and sexual abuse.
 Women experience legal and social discrimination. They are denied the right to
 vote (see Section 3), their testimony is not given equal weight to that of males in
 the Islamic courts (see Section i.e.), and married women require their husband's
 permission to obtain a passport (see Section 2.d). By law only males are able to con-
 fer citizenship, which means that children born to Kuwaiti mothers and stateless
 fathers are themselves stateless. Inheritance is governed by Islamic law, which dif-
 fers according to sects. For example, Sunni female heirs receive half the male heirs'
 inheritance, while a sole Shia female heir may receive the whole of her parents' or
 brother's estate.
 Women are traditionally restrained from choosing certain roles in society, and the
 law restricts women from working in "dangerous industries" and trades "harmful"
 to health. Educated Kuwaiti women maintain that an Islamic fundamentalist trend
 limits career opportunities. Women wearing western attire and foreign women expe-
 rience sexual harassment more frequently than women wearing traditional Islamic
 garb. Nonetheless, an estimated 28 percent of Kuwaiti women of working age are
 employed. The law promises 'remuneration equal to that of a man provided she does
 the same work." This promise is respected in practice. Women work as doctors, engi-
 neers, lawyers, and professors. A few have reached senior government positions in
 the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Education, and the state-owned Kuwaiti Petro-
 leum Corporation. However, there are no female judges or prosecutors, only a few
 women in the diplomatic service, and none in the National Assembly.
 In case of divorce, the Government makes family subsidy payments only to the
 divorced husband, who is expected by law and custom to provide for his children
 even though custody of minor children is usually given to the mother. The law dis-
 criminates against women married to foreign men. These women are not entitled
 to government housing subsidies which are available to male citizens. The law also
 requires Kuwaiti women to pay residence fees for their husbands and does not rec-
 ognize marriage as the basis for granting residency to foreign-born husbands. In-
 stead, the law grants residency only if the husband is employed. By contrast, Ku-
 waiti men married to foreign-born women do not have to pay residency fees for their
 spouses, and their spouses right to residency derives from marriage.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the welfare of children. It provides
 free education and health care to all children and a variety of other services. There
 is no pattern of societal abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no institutionalized discrimination against dis-
 abled persons in housing, employment, education, and in the provision of state serv-
 ices. The Government has not legislated or mandated accessibility for the disabled
 but does provide extensive benefits for the disabled that cover transportation, job
 training, and social welfare.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Government's failure to improve the
 plight of the 117,000 Bidoon remains a significant human rights abuse. The Bidoon
 have been the objects of hostile government policy since the late 1980's. Since then
 the Government has eliminated the Bidoons from the census rolls, discontinued
 their access to government jobs and social services, and sought to deport many
 Bidoons. In 1993, the Government decreed that Bidoon males would no longer be
 allowed to enlist in the military service. Those presently in the armed forces are
 being gradually replaced.
 The Bidon exist in a legal limbo. Because their citizenship and residency status
 is undetermined, they do not have a legal right to work or enroll their children in
 public or private schools. If the Bidoon travel abroad, they risk being barred from
 returning to the country unless they receive advance permission from the immigra-
 tion authorities. Marriages pose special hardships because the offspring of male
 Bidoon inherit the father's undetermined legal status.
 The Government has established a review process which would    larize the sta-
 tus of some of the Bidoon and their families, especially for any Bidon who has
 served in the Kuwaiti military and security forces and for the children born to mar-
 riages between Bidoon males and Kuwaiti women. However, the process is slow and
 ineffective. Government officials and National Assembly members recognize the
 hardships suffered by the Bidoon, but so far have not acted on the legislation pro-
 posed by some members.
 Since the end of the Gulf War, the Government has been hostile to workers from
 those nations that suported Iraq, especially Palestinians, Jordanians, and Yemenis.
 The Government has delayed or denied the issuance of work and residency permits
 to persons in these groups, and in many cases has hindered those workers that are
 permitted to reside in the country from sponsoring their families to join them. The
 
 
 1211
 Government imposes further hardships by prohibiting schools from enrolling the
 children of such persons without valid residency permits.
 Religious Minorites.-Although Christians are free to practice openly, the Gov-
 ernment prohibits Christians from proselytizing Muslims, and Muslims from con-
 verting from Islam. The law prohibits non-Muslims from becoming citizens. A non-
 Muslim male must convert to Islam when he marries a Muslim woman, if the wed-
 ding is to be legal in Kuwait. A non-Muslim female does not have to convert to
 Islam to marry a Muslim male, but it is to her advantage to do so (i.e. failure to
 do so may ultimately place custody of children in the hands of the Musim father,
 should the couple later divorce). Government welfare programs generally do not dis-
 criminate against Shi'a Muslim citizens.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right, but are not required, to join
 unions. Nonetheless, the Government restricts the right of association By prohibiting
 all workers from freely establishing trade unions. The law stipulates that workers
 may establish only one union in any occupational trade, and that the unions may
 establish only one federation. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has long
 criticized such restrictions. In 1995 about 50,000 people were organized in 14
 unions, 12 of which are affiliated with the Kuwat Trad~nion Federation (KTUF),
 the sole, legal trade union federation. The Bank Worker's Union and the Kuwait
 Airways Workers Union are independent. The Government has shown no sign that
 it would accept the establishment of more than one legal trade union federation.
 The law stipulates that any new union must include at least 100 workers, of whom
 at least 15 are citizens. Both the ILO and the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions have criticized this requirement because it discourages unions in sec-
 tors employing few citizens such as the construction industry and domestic sectors.
 The Government's pervasive oversight powers further erode union independence.
 The Government subsidizes as much as 90 percent of most union budgets, may in-
 spect the financial records of any union and prohibits any union from engaging in
 vaguely defined political or religious activities. The law empowers the courts to dis-
 solve any union for violating labor laws or for threatening "public order and morals."
 Such a court decision may be appealed. The Amir may also dissolve a union by de-
 cree. By law the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is authorized to seize the as-
 sets of any dissolved union. The ILO has criticized this aspect of the law. Although
 no union has been dissolved the law subordinates the legal existence of the unions
 to the power of the State.
 Foreigners constitute most of the work force and about a third of its unionized
 work force. Yet the law discriminates against foreign workers by permitting them
 to join unions only after 5 years of residence and only as nonvoting members. Un-
 like union members who are citizens, foreign workers do not have the right to elect
 their leadership. The law requires that union officials must be citizens. The ILO has
 criticized the 6-year residency requirement and the denial of voting rights for for-
 eign workers.
 KTUF administers an Expatriate Labor Office which is authorized to investigate
 complaints of foreign laborers and provides them with free legal advice. Any foreign
 worker may submit a grievance to t   abor office regardless of union status.
 The law limits the right to strike. It requires that all labor disputes must be re-
 ferred to compulsory arbitration if labor and management cannot reach a solution
 (see Section 6.b.). The law does not have any provision guaranteeing strikers that
 they will be free from any legal or administrative action taken against them by the
 State.
 Two strikes occurred in 1995. The first was called by approximately 1,000 workers
 at the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC), a government-owned com any, to pressure man-
 agement to upgrade their classifications. The KOC persuaded the workers, all of
 whom were citizens, to return to their jobs, but did little to address the workers
 complaints. The second strike was a 1-day sit-down action by nonunion workers at
 the labor camp of a private company who complained of inadequate food. The work-
 ers, all of whom were expatriates, ultimately received more and better food, but the
 four Bangladeshi leaders of the action were jailed for 21 days and then deported.
 The KTUF belongs to the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and
 the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Wokers have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively, subject to the restrictions cited above. These rights
 have been incorporated in the Labor Law and have, according to all reports, been
 respected in practice.
 The Labor Law provides for direct negotiations between employers and "laborers
 or their representatives" in the private sector. Most agreements are resolved in such
 
 
 1212
 tiations; if not, either party may petition the Ministry of Social Affairs and
 r for mediation. If mediation fails, the dispute is referred to a labor arbitration
 board composed of officials from the High Court of Appeals, the Attorney General's
 office, and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
 The Civil Service Law makes no provision for collective bargaining between gov-
 ernment workers and their employer. Technically, wages and conditions of em ploy-
 ment for civil service workers are established by the Government, but in practice,
 the Government sets the benefit scales after conducting informal meetings with offi-
 cials from the civil service unions. Union officials resolve most issues at the working
 level and have regular access to senior officials.
 The Labor Law prohibits antiunion discrimination. Any worker who alleges
 antiunion discrimination has the right to appeal to the judiciary. There were no re-
 ports of discrimination against employees, based on their affiliation with a union.
 Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination must reinstate workers fired for
 union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor "except in cases specified by law for national emergency and with just remu-
 neration.'
 Foreign workers may not change their employment without permission from their
 original sponsors unless they have been in the country for over 2 years. Domestic
 servants are particularly vnerbe to abuses from this practice because they are
 not protected by the labor law. In many cases employers exercise some control over
 their servants by holding their passports, although the Government prohibi~s this
 practice and has acted to retrieve passports of maids involved in disputes.
 Domestic servants who run away from their employers may be treated as crimi-
 nals under the law. However, the authorities usually do not enforce this provision
 of the law. In some reported cases, employers illeglly withheld wages from domes-
 tic servants to cover the costs involved in bringing them to Kuwait. The Govenent
 has done little, if anything, to protect domestics in such cases.
 d. Minimum Age for Emploment of Children.-The legal minimum age is 18
 years for a forms of work, oth full- and part-time. Employers must obtain permits
 from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor to employ juveniles between the ages
 of 14 and 18 in certain trades. Education is compulsory for children between the
 ages of 6 and 15. These laws are not fully observed in the nonindustrial sector, al-
 though no instances involving Kuwaiti children have been alleged. Some small busi-
 nessmen employ their children on a part-time basis, and there have been
 unconfirmed reports that some south Asian domestic servants are under 18, but fal-
 sified their age in order to enter Kuwait.
 Juveniles may work a maximum of 6 hours a day on the condition that they work
 no more than 4 consecutive hours followed by a one-hour rest period.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is re-
 sponsible for enforcing all labor laws. There is no legal minimum wage in the pri-
 vate sector. In 1995 the minimum wage in the public ser, administratively set
 by the Government, was approximately $774 a month (226 dinars) for citizens and
 approximately $315 a month (90 dinars) for noncitizens.
 The Labor Law establishes general conditions of work for both the public and the
 privat sectors, with the oil industry treated separately. The Civil Service Law also
 prescribes additinal conditions for the public sector. Labor law limits the standard
 workweek to 48 hours with 1 full day of rest per week, provides for a minimum of
 14 workdays of leave each year, and establishes a compensation schedule for indus-
 trial accidents. Domestic servants, who are specifically excluded from the Private
 Sector Labor Law, frequently work long hours, greatly in excess of 48 hours.
 The ILO has urged the Government to guarantee the weekly 24-consecutive-hour
 rest period to temporary workers employed for a period of less than 6 months and
 workers in enterprises employing fewer than five persons. The law pertaining to the
 oil industry provides for a 40-hour work week, 30 days of annual eave, and a sick
 leave. Laws establishing work ciondto s are not always applied uniformly to foreign
 workers. Labor law also provides for emplyer-previded medical care and compensa-
 tion to workers disabled by injury or disease dtie to job-related causes. The law also
 requires that employers provide periodic medical examinations to workers exposed
 to environmental hazards on the job (i.e., chemicals, asbestos, etc.). The Government
 has issued occupational health and safety standards; however, compliance and en-
 forcement appear poor, especially with respect to unskilled foreign laborers. Employ-
 ers often exploit workers  willingness to accept substandard conditions. Foreign
 workers, especially unskilled or semiskilled South Asian workers, frequently face
 contractual disputes, poor working conditions, and some physical abuse.

 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to their continued employment, and legal protections exist for
 workers who file complaints about such conditions. Latest available figures for occu-
 pational injuries show 1,472 such occurrences in 1994, primarily in the sectors of
 construction and building, manufacturing, hotels and restaurants, and transpor-
 tation. To cut accident rates, the Government periodically inspects installations to
 raise awareness among workers and employers and ensure that they abide by the
 safety rules, control the pollution resulting from certain dangerous industries, train
 workers who use new machines in specialized institutes, and report violations.
