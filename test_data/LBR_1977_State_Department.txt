 LIBERIA
 Liberia has had close ties to the United States dating
 back to the country's founding in 1822 by the American
 Colonization Society. Many of Liberia's institutions
 and concepts of government, including the separation
 of powers between the legislative, executive and judi-
 cial branches, are patterned after the American model.
 President Tolbert's True Whig Party has dominated
 Liberian political life for many years, but opposition
 groups exist and are legally entitled to contest elec-
 tions. Liberia has one of the best human rights records
 in Africa.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Torture
 Torture is neither sanctioned nor practiced in Liberia.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In January 1977 public flogging of convicted thieves as
 a deterrent measure was reinstituted. This punishment
 has been infrequently applied, however, after some
 negative public reaction to the initial floggings. The
 government does not countenance arbitrary deprivation
 of life or involuntary servitude.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest or imprisonment has not taken place in
 recent years. There are no known political prisoners
 in Liberia.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Access to the protection of the legal system is avail-
 able to all. Trials are fair and public.

 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legAl safeguards against arbitrary
 invasion of the home.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Liberian Government is strongly committed to extend-
 ing direct assistance to the country's poor. President
 Tolbert has repeatedly stated his firm dedication to a
 government responsive to the needs of his people. He
 has enthusiastically adopted the New Directions concept
 in U.S. aid with its emphasis on assistance to the
 rural poor. In the past several years Liberia's budget
 has been increasingly structured toward this end.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are constitutionally guaranteed, and re-
 spected in practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within the coun-
 try, and regulations governing travel abroad are
 minimal. Liberia's emigration policies are free and
 liberal.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The democratic process is open to all who meet the age
 and citizenship requirements. Liberia has been led by
 representatives of the True Whig Party since the late
 nineteenth century, and there are at present no other
 
 
 registered national parties, though opposition groups
 exist and function freely. Opposition parties are
 neither proscribed nor suppressed, and many have
 existed over the years.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-Governmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Liberia's positive human rights record is due in no
 small part to the personal convictions of President
 Tolbert and the top leadership. Liberia has given its
 support to U.S. human rights initiatives in a number
 of statements made by the president and Foreign
 Minister Dennis. Leaders of other groups in Liberia
 have also responded favorably to this issue.
 The Liberian government probably would welcome an in-
 vestigation into human rights conditions in Liberia if
 conducted by a reputable international organization.
 None of the major international human rights organi-
 zations have raised human rights issues or called for
 investigations of human rights conditions in Liberia
 in recent years.'
