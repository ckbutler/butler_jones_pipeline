 ZIMBABWE
 President Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
 Front (ZANU-PF) have dominated the legislative and executive branches of
 Zimbabwe's Government since independence in 1980. The Constitution allows for
 multiple parties; in addition to ZANU-PF, there are a large number of smaller par-
 ties. However, they are poorly organized and led, poorly financed, and subject to
 periodic intimidation by the ruling party and government security forces. The judici-
 ary is independent, but the Government occasionally refuses to abide by court deci-
 sions.
 The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) are responsible for maintaining law and
 order. The Zimbabwe National Army and Air Force are responsible for external se-
 curity. The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) under the Ministry of State Se-
 curity is responsible for internal and external security but no longer has powers of
 arrest.
 Zimbabwe's economy is agriculturally based, with strong mining and tourism sec-
 tors and a diversified manufacturing base. It is increasingly market based under the
 1991-95 structural adjustment program. Primary exports are tobacco, cotton, oil
 seeds, livestock, gold, and nickel. Over 60 percent of the population engages in sub-
 sistence agriculture. The formal sector unemployment rate remains a ove 45 per-
 cent. Indigenization (black economic empowerment) is a government priority to re-
 dress economic disparities between the majority black population and a small white
 elite. The estimated 1996 annual per capita gross domestic product of $588 is ex-
 pected to rise as the economy continues its recovery from drought.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were significant problems in some areas, including incidents of police brutal-
 ity, harsh prison conditions, the Government's refusal to abide by several court rul-
 ings, CIO intimidation of opposition party candidates and their supporters, restric-
 tions on academic freedom, infringements on citizens' privacy, and the banning of
 the Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe's stand at the Harare International Book Fai
 (which was overturned by the courts).
 Members of the security forces committed human rights abuses. Despite cases of
 police brutality, human rights organizations report a marked improvement in over-
 all police treatment of suspects and members of the public.
 Although the legislative and campaign climate remained tilted in favor of the rul-
 ing party and the March presidential elections were marred by opposition can-
 
 
 324
 
 didates' last minute attempts to withdraw, impartial election monitors found the
 elections generally free and fair. As a result of the Government's improper handling
 of nominations, the High Court nullified the results of the October 1995 Harare and
 Bulawayo mayoral elections. Cases challenging the validity of the Chitungwiza,
 Gweru, and rerun Harare mayoral elections were still pending at year's end. Al-
 though the small independent press was increasingly open and critical of the Gov-
 ernment, the electronic media-the major source of information       for most
 Zimbabweans-remained government-controlled, and strict antidefamation laws led
 to self-censorship. The Zimbabwe Broadcast Corporation issued an order banning
 coverage of several businessmen and opposition politicians. Domestic violence
 against women remained widespread, and traditional, often illegal, discrimination
 against women and the disabled continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government security forces. However, police killed three people in shoot-
 ing incidents during the year. All occurred in the line of duty, and there were no
 suspicious circumstances.
 Harsh prison conditions contributed to the average of 25 deaths per month of pris-
 oners in custody (see Section 1.c.).
 The Legal Resource Foundation and the Catholic Commission for Justice and
 Peace (CeJP) interviewed thousands of victims or relatives of victims of atrocities
 committed during the 1982-87 Matabeleland crisis and are scheduled to present
 their findings to the President in early 1998. No action has been taken on the 1993
 Simplicius Chihambakwe Commission investigation of the Matabeleland crisis. De-
 spite calls by the CCJP for an investigation, the Government took no further action
 on the bodies discovered at Antelope Mine in Kezi in 1992; the bodies have not been
 identified or properly buried. The trial of the police officer charged with murder
 after allegedly shooting another officer, who had ordered him not to urinate in pub-
 lic, began in September. There were no developments in the cases concerning the
 1992 death in custody of 15-yearold Happy Dhlakama, the 1991 death of Lieuten-
 ant Shepard Chisango, or the 1988 death of Captain Edwin Nyela.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There were no developments in the 1990 disappeai ance of Rashiwe Guzha.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and cruel and inhuman treatment. There were
 no credible reports of torture. The ZRP service charter and improved training have
 resulted in markedly better treatment of suspects and the public. However, there
 are still reports of occasional police brutality. For example in November police fired
 tear gas at a group of striking nurses trying to peaceably enter a magistrate's court
 to attend the hearing of fellow strikers. Also in November, police beat students flee-
 ing demonstrations at the University of Zimbabwe. Police occasionally beat suspects
 as they are arrested.
 The Government has not actively pursued past allegations of torture, nor pros-
 ecuted CIO or ZRP officers for such abuses. The CIO continued to refuse to pay
 court-ordered damages to a 1990 torture victim.
 Prison conditions remained harsh and have improved little since the CCJP issued
 its 1993 report describing extreme overcrowding, shortages of clothing, and poor
 sanitary conditions. In August, 4,000 prisoners were released under a presidential
 amnesty, helping to ease serious overcrowding. Overcrowding and poor sanitation
 aggravated outbreaks of cholera, diarrhea, and AIDS-related illnesses. An average
 of 25 prisoners a month died in custody, 18 from AIDS-related illnesses. Zimbabwe
 has established a successful community service sentencing program to try to allevi-
 ate prison overcrowding. The Legal Resource Foundation, in cooperation with the
 prison service, established a human rights training program for prison officials. Offi-
 cials who mistreat prisoners are routinely punished.
 The Government permits international human rights monitors to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes these prohibitions. The law
 reuires that police inform an arrested person of the c      a in  i b   he
 is taken into custody. Warrants of arrest issued by the courts are required except
 in cases of serious crimes or whe r teris  e risk of evidence disappearing. The
 Ministry of Home Affairs pays an average of $150,000 (Z$1.5 million) each year in
 damages in wrongful arrest cases. In September the Minister issued a strongly
 worded statement warning police to observe proper procedures.
 
 
 325
 Although a preliminary hearing before a magistrate is required .within 48 hours
 (or 96 hours over a weekend), the law is often disregarded if a person does not have
 legal representation. A 1992 amendment to the Criminal Procedures and Evidence
 Act substantially reduced the power of magistrates to grant bail without the consent
 of the Attorney General or his agents. In practice, however, a circular issued by the
 Attorney General gving a general authority to grant bail has lessened the negative
 impact of the rule. High Court judges grant bail ndependently.
 The Government still enjoys a wide range of legal powers under the Official Se-
 crets Act and the Law and Order Maintenance Act (LOMA). Originally promulgated
 30 years ag and widely used in the past to prosecute political opponents of the Gov-
 ernment, the LOMA gives extensive powers to the police, the Minister of Home Af-
 fairs, and the President to address political and security crimes that are not clearly
 defined. The Government invoked the LOMA during the civil service strike in Sep-
 tember when it briefly arrested two leaders of the Public Service Association. In Nb-
 vember two leaders of the junior doctors strike and the head of the Zimbabwe
 Teachers' Union were arrested under the LOMA. The Supreme Court has agreed to
 hear a constitutional challenge to the LOMA as part of their defense. A supporter
 of the independent Member of Parliament (M.P.) was fined under the LOMA for re-
 moving his vehicle, which had been driven by an unlicensed driver, from police im-
 poundment during the Harare South by-election campaign. William Namakonya and
 Simba Mhlanga received 12- and 15-year sentences respectively under the LOMA
 for conspiring to assassinate President Mugabe. Opposition leader and M.P.
 Ndabadingi Sithole is still on bail pending trial on the same charge. In November
 the Supreme Court agreed to hear a constitutional challenge to the LOMA's provi-
 sions that the accused must prove their innocence as part of Sithole's defense.
 Pretrial detainees, who make up 21 per cent of the overall prison population,
 spent an average of 6 months in prison before their trials because of a critical short-
 age of magistrates and court interpreters. In an extreme case, Daniel Machabe was
 released in 1994 after spending more than 7 years in remand without trial.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the judiciary has a well-deserved reputation for independence. However,
 on occasion the Government refuses to abide by its decisions. Judges are appointed
 for life and can be removed from the bench only for gross misconduct. They are not
 discharged or transferred for political reasons. Magistrates, who are art of the civil
 service rather than the judiciary, hear the vast majority of cases and are sometimes
 subject to political pressure. Military courts deal with disciplinary or court martial
 proceedings. Police courts, which can sentence a police officer to confinement to
 camp or demotion, handle disciplinary and misconduct cases. Trials in beth these
 latter courts meet internationally accepted standards for fair trials; defendants in
 these courts have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. All levels of the judici-
 ary often make rulings unpopular with the Government.
 The Customary Law and Local Courts Act of 1990 created a unitary court system,
 consisting of headmens' courts, chiefs' courts, magistrates' courts, the High Court,
 and the Supreme Court. With this restructuring, civil and customary law cases may
 be heard at all levels of the judiciary, including the Supreme Court. In July the po-
 lice criticized the customary courts for ruling on rape cases, over which they have
 no jurisdiction.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial, and the judiciary rigorously
 enforces this right. Every defendant has the right to a lawyer of his choosing. How-
 ever, well over 90 percent of defendants in magistrates' courts go unrepresented. In
 criminal cases, an indigent defendant may apply to have the  vernment provide
 an attorney, but this is rarely done and rare y granted. However, in capital cases
 the Government provides an attorney for all defendants unable to affordone. Liti-
 gants in civil cases can request legal assistance from the Legal Resources Founda-
 tion or the Citizens Advice Bureau. All litigants are represented in the High Court.
 The Supreme Court has instrUcted magistrates to ensure that unrepresented de-
 fendants fully understand their rights and to weigh any mitigating circumstances
 in criminal cases, whether or not the accused presents them as part of his defense.
 The right to appeal exists in all cases and is automatic in cases in which the
 death penalty is imposed. Trials are open to the public except in certain security
 cases. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and the right to present wit-
 nesses and question witnesses against them. Defendants and their attorneys gen-
 erally have access to government-held evidence relevant to their cases. The legal
 system does not discriminate against women or minorities.
 The Government generally abided by court decisions even when it was strongly
 opposed to the rulings. However, in January the Immigration Department deported
 a Nigerian national despite a High Court stay of the deportation order. In addition
 
 
 326
 the Government routinely delayed payment of court costs or judgments awarded
 against it. For example, the CIO continued its refusal to pay damages awarded by
 the High Court to a former opposition party official whom CIO agents had tortured
 in 1990. The Attorney General's office was unable to ensure CIO compliance with
 the judgment.
 Legal and human rights activists continued to criticize the Government's efforts
 to adopt constitutional amendments in order to overturn Supreme Court rulings.
 For example, Amendment 11 (1992) changed the Constitution to allow corporal pun-
 ishment of minors after the Supreme Court ruled that caning of minors constituted
 cruel and inhuman punishment. Amendment 14 (1996), which denies both men and
 women the right to confer automatic residency on their foreign spouses, was passed
 in response to a 1994 Supreme Court ruling declaring that women should have the
 same rights as men to confer residency and citizenship on their spouses (see Section
 2.d.).
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or cor-
 respondence. Human rights groups are concerned that Amendment 14 erodes these
 constitutional rights by repealing Section 11 of the Constitution which specifies pro-
 tection for the right to the privacy of one's home and from the compulsory acquisi-
 tion of property without compensation. Although government authorities generally
 respect citizens' right to privacy and violations are subject to legal sanction, it is
 widely known that the Government sometimes monitors private correspondence and
 telephones, particularly international communications.
 The need for land reform in Zimbabwe is almost universally accepted; however,
 problems have arisen with implementation of the 1992 Land Acquisition Act. Farm-
 ers whose lands have been designated for acquisition may only appeal the amount
 of compensation in administrative courts, not the initial decision to acquire their
 farms. In the past this act was implemented largely along racial lines; the Govern-
 ment stated that black-owned commercial farms would not be subject to designation.
 In a few cases, land was designated for acquisition to achieve political goals. Opposi-
 tion party leader M.P. Ndabadingi Sithole continued to fight the Government over
 its 1993 acquisition of his farm.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion but allows for legislation to limit this freedom in the "interest of defense, public
 safety, public order, state economic interests, public morality, and public health." Al-
 though the independent press is increasingly open and critical of the Government,
 there is a high degree of self-censorship in both the government-controlled and inde-
 pendent press. Self-censorship is aggravated by antidefamation laws that make no
 distinction between public and private persons. For example in December the former
 head of the army was awarded substantial damages in a defamation suit because
 an independent monthly had pondered how his "goings on" would be reported. In
 addition an extremely broad Official Secrets Act makes it a crime to divulge "any
 information acquired in the course of official duties."
 The major print media (seven English language newspapers and one vernacular
 broadsheet) belong to the Mass Media Trust, a holding company heavily influenced
 by the Government and ruling party. The Ministry of Information controls the
 Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency wire service. The Government influences main-
 stream media through indirect ownership, editorial appointments, directives to edi-
 tors, and removal of wayward editors. The small independent press consists pri-
 marily of two economic weeklies and three monthly magazines. They carefully mon-
 itor government policies and open their pages to opposition critics. Other minor
 independent publications exist with fewer than 3,000 subscribers.
 Radio and television are entirely government owned and controlled. Journalists
 report that ZANU-PF Secretary for Information Nathan Shamuyarira is often in-
 o     in determining what news is broadcast. Despite a Supreme Court ruling that
 the Government's monopoly on telecommunications was unconstitutional because it
 interfered with the constitutional right to freedom of expression, the Government
 has repeatedly refused to license independent radio and television stations. The
 Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp   tion (ZBC), which still enjoys a monopoly under the
 Broadcast Act, issued an order banning coverage of several prominent businessmen
 and opposition politicians. In addition all of the government-controlled media re-
 fused to report the statements of the Public Service Association during the civil
 service strike in August. The ZBC gave all candidates 30 minutes of free broadcast
 time during the Presidential campaign.
 
 
 327
 Books and films are subject to review by the Zimbabwe Board of Censors. In Feb-
 ruary the police briefly seized the negative of a fim, still in production on the lib-
 eration struggle which the National War Veteran's Association claimed was offen-
 sive. However, the Southern African Film Festival was held in Harare in September
 without interference from the Board of Censors.
 In July the government spokesman announced that the Gays and Lesbians of
 Zimbabwe (GALZ) exhibit on AIDS counseling and prevention at the Harare Inter-
 national Book Fair had been banned. The Board of Censors subsequently issued an
 official banning order, but the High Court overturned the order on the grounds that
 the Board of Censors could not ban materials it had not screened.
 The University of Zimbabwe (UZ) Amendment Act and the National Council for
 Higher Education Act curtail academic freedom by restricting the independence of
 universities, making them subject to government influence, and extending the dis-
 ciplinary powers of the university authorities against staff and students. Th UZ sus-
 pended or expelled 20 students under the act after students wrecked the university
 cafeteria prtesting poor food. A large number of Harare Polytechnic and UZ stu-
 dents were suspended in July for participating in unruly demonstrations demanding
 increased allowances.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly and association for political and nonpolitical organizations, in-
 cluding a broad spectrum of economic, social, professiona, an  recreational activi-
 ties. Permits are no longer required for meetings or demonstrations. A draft public
 order act, the purported successor to the Law and Order Maintenance Act, has been
 circulated for comment to human rights groups. The law would make organizers of
 demonstrations civilly liable if the demonstrations turn violent.
 The formation of unions and political parties is not restricted. Organizations are
 generally free of governmental interference as long as their activities are viewed as
 nonpolitical. However, under the Private Voluntary Organizations Act of 1995, the
 Minister of Social Welfare, Labor, and Public Service is empowered to suspend the
 executive body or "any member of the executive committee of an organization and
 to appoint persons to manage the affairs of the organization for a specified time."
 A case challenging the Minister's November 1995 removal of the board of a women's
 nongovernmental organization (NGO) is pending in the Supreme Court. The Na-
 tional Association ofNGO's (NANGO) is negotiating with the Government for revi-
 sion of the act. As a result of the act, several newly established NGO's decided to
 establish their organizations as "associations" connected with established NGO's so
 that their executive bodies would not be subject to government interference.-
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rig ts, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice.
 The new Zimbabwean Citizenship and Immigration bill, presented to Parliament
 in mid-1994 but not yet law, tightens prohibitions against dual citizenship. Human
 rights groups are concerned that these provisions will most affect white
 Zimbabweans, many of whom hold dual citizenship, and will interfere with citizens'
 right of return.
 In response to a 1994 Supreme Court ruling that Zimbabwe's practice of allowing
 men, but not women, to confer residency rights on their foreign born spouses was
 discriminatory, the Government proposed a constitutional amendment establishing
 the practice in the Constitution. After an outcry from civic, particularly women's,
 organizations, the Government withdrew the amendment and proposed a revised
 bill that allows neither men nor women to confer citizenship on their foreign born
 spouses automatically. Parliament passed the amendment in October.
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 Zimbabwe provides first asylum. Forty persons were granted first asylum and 36
 denied it in 1996. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid
 claim to refugee status nor of forced return of persons to countries where they
 feared persecution. There were approximately 350 refugees from a variety of African
 nations.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the legal right to change their government democratically, however,
 the political process continued to be tilted through various means in favor of the
 ruling party. President Mugabe and his ZANU-PF Party remained the dominant po-
 litic  force within the country. In the 1995 general elections, ZANU-PF captured
 
 
 328
 117 of the 120 elected seats. The 10 chiefs who sit as M.P.s are elected by their
 peers. The President also appoints 8 provincial governors, who sit as M.P.s, and 12
 nonconstituency M.P.s. The net result of several constitutional amendments has
 been to consolidate the power of the executive branch and to limit M.P.s' independ-
 ence. There is no effective parliamentary opposition, and the legislature remained
 subordinate to the executive branch. However, in 1996 Parliament had greater in-
 fluence on the content of proposed legislation in ruling party caucus debate and dur-
 ing the committee phase than in previous years.
 There are many small opposition parties. However, their growth is inhibited by
 a variety of factors, including the Political Parties Finance Act (PPFA) and the gov-
 ernment monopoly on the electronic media. The PPFA provides government funding
 only to those parties that have more than 15 parliamentary seats, effectively giving
 all public funding to the ruling party. An opposition party's constitutional challenge
 of the Electoral Act is still pending before the Supreme Court. There were credible
 reports of continued CIO harassment of opposition and independent candidates and
 their supporters. In addition to these serious institutional problems, however, the
 opposition parties' poor leadership, infighting, and lack of coherent platforms played
 an important role in their poor electoral showing.
 The week before the March presidential elections both opposition candidates at-
 tempted to withdraw, claiming that until the PPFA, the Electoral Act, and the
 Broadcast Act were substantially revised, they would be unable to surmount the
 hurdles placed before them by the electoral system. However, the Registrar General
 ordered that the elections be held with their names on the ballots because they did
 not withdraw within the period required by the Electoral Act.
 Voting in the presidential elections was peaceful and generally free and fair. The
 turnout was very low (30.4 percent). The relatively high ratio of spoiled ballots (over
 4 percent) was thought to indicate a need for more thoroughth on ducto, therP
 ticularly in rural areas. Human rights organizations thorf hv coer ducton,
 during the elections. There were no reports of bias or intimidation by election offi-
 cials. The Electoral Supervisory Commission (ESC) deployed hundreds of NGO elec-
 tion monitors nationwide, but at year's end the ESC had not presented its report
 on the Presidential election to the Minister of Justice.
 In March the High Court nullified the results of the October 1995 Bulawayo and
 Harare mayoral elections because the returning officers (supervising election offi-
 cials) had conducted nominations improperly. An opposition party is appealing the
 High Court's ruling that the Gweru mayoralelections were handled properly, alleg-
 ing that the President abused the Presidential Powers Act in calling for mayoral
 elections before Parliament passed a new Urban Councils Act establishing the post
 of executive mayor.
 New Bulawayo and Harare elections were held in August and September. The
 campaign in Harare was marked by lopsided media coverage and CIO and ZANU-
 PF official harassment of opposition party supporters. There were isolated incidents
 of violence by supporters of both candidates. Before the election, the independent
 candidate successfully sued to have the Town Clerk, who was a candidate in the
 1995 ruling party parliamentary primaries, removed as returning officer. His suit
 to have the new election results nullified, on the grounds that the voters' roll was
 not in order and that vote counting was handled improperly, was still pending in
 the High Courat year's end. NGO election observers described the vote counting
 as "chaotic" and noted that the agents of the independent candidate were not
 present when counting began. Also in September the independent candidate for
 1ayor of  itungw a (a newly designated municipality) filed a High Court suit to
 have the election results nullified because gross irregularities in the voters' roll re-
 suited in persons not on the roll being allowed to vote fraudulently and persons on
 the roll being refused the right to vote. There were 20 affidavits attached to his suit
 detailing abuses ranging from violence and intimidation by supporters of the ruling
 party, to vote buying, to voters being told they were too old to vote."
 There are institutional problems with the management and supervision of elec-
 tions. Although the Ministry of Justice technically admnisters the Electoral Act, the
 Registrar General's Office falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs. With a meager
 budget and a tiny staff seconded from the Ministry of Justice, the Electoral Super-
 visry Commission lacks the institutional capacity to oversee all of the country's
 polling stations. Nor do commissioners have the executive authority to order that
 an irregularity be corrected. Despite an attempt to computerize the voters' roll, it
 contains a very large number of redundancies or errors, including misspellings, mul-
 tiple entries, and names of the deceased. In the March presidential elections, thou-
 sands of voters were turned away because their names were missing from or im-
 properly listed on the roll. An opposition party's challenge of the results of the July
 
 
 329
 1995 parliamentary by-election in Gweru on the grounds that registration irregular-
 ities affected the outcome was still before the High Court at years end.
 Women participate in    ltics without legal restriction. However, according to
 local women's groups, husbands-particularly in rural areas--commonly force their
 wives to vote for the husband's preferred candidates.
 There are 20 women in the 150-member Parliament, including the Deputy Speak-
 er. There are three female cabinet ministers and three deputy ministers. All major
 ethnic groups are represented in Parliament and in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although the Government permits local civic and human rights groups to operate,
 it monitors their activities closely, in particular those of the Catholic Commission
 for Justice and Peace and ZIMRIGHTS. Other groups that promote human rights
 include the Legal Resource Foundation, the Southern African Federation of the Dis-
 abled, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, the Child and Law Project, the
 Zimbabwe Women Lawyer's Association, and the Southern African Human Rights
 Research and Documentation Trust. The Foundation for Democracy in Zimbabwe
 (FODEZI) was established in July as a watchdog organization to support independ-
 ent candidates. Amnesty International, Transparency International, and the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross operate in Zimbabwe. The Government does
 not discourage representatives from international human rights groups from visiting
 Zimbabwe.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides that "every person in Zimbabwe" is entitled to fun-
 damental rights whatever his race, tribe, place of origin, political opinions, color,
 creed, or sex.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, especially wife beating, is common
 and crosses all racial and economic lines. Women's groups have noted that everyp-
 lice station in Zimbabwe has handled at least one case of a woman killed by her
 husband. According to Women in Law and Development in Africa (WILDAF), do-
 mestic violence accounts for more than 60 percent of murder cases in the Harare
 High Court. In 1992 (the last year for which official statistics are available), 4,437
 official complaints of wife beating were fied. Human rights groups have noted that
 increased training has improved police community relations officers' handling of
 these cases. There were 3,148 cases of rape reported in 1995 (the majority involving
 girls under the age of 14), resulting in 727 convictions. There were 1,400 cases of
 rape in the first half of 1996. Women's groups and the police believe the actual num-
 ber is much higher, but the majority of cases go unreported because of the social
 stigma of rape. When cases come to court, the courts generally impose stiff sen-
 tences for rape and wife beating. However, a "binding over" order (an order to ap-
 pear in court to respond to an accusation of violent behavior) is issued based only
 on actual physical abuse and not on threats of violence. In addition the courts do
 not have the power to oust an abusive spouse from a matrimonial home.
 Since independence the Government has enacted major laws aimed at enhancing
 women's rights and countering certain traditional practices that discriminate
 against women. However, women remain disadvantaged in Zimbabwean society. Il-
 literacy, economic dependency, and prevailing social norms prevent rural women in
 particular from combating societal discrimination. Despite legal prohibitions, women
 are still vulnerable to entrenched customary practices, including "kuzvarira," the
 practice of pledging a young women to marriage with a partner not of her choosing;,
 "nhaka," the custom of forcing a widow to marry her late husband's brother, and
 the customary practice of offering a young girl as compensatory payment in inter-
 faiydisputes.
 hough two women preside as chiefs in Mashonaland, a dispute has erupted
 over the ascension of a female chief, sanctioned by the President, in Matabeleland
 South. Provincial Governor Welshman Mabhena declared that "under Ndebele cus-
 tom a woman can never preside over a man. It is a mockery of our culture."
 The Legal Age of Majority Act and the Matrimonial Causes Act recognize women's
 right to own property independently of their husbands or fathers. However, while
 unmarried women may own property in their own names, women married under
 customary law are not allowed to own property jointly with their husbands. Inherit-
 ance laws remain unfavorable to widows. The Government took no legislative action
 on a draft inheritance law that would address the issue of unfair and unequal dis-
 tribution of inherited assets. Divorce and maintenance laws are favorable toward
 women, but women generally lack awareness of their rights under the law.
 
 
 330
 Although labor legislation prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of
 gender, women are concentrated in the lower echelons of the work force and com-
 monly face sexual harassment in the workplace.
 Several active women's rights groups in Zimbabwe, including WILDAF, the
 Musasa Project, the Zimbabwe Women Lawyers' Association, and the Women's Ac-
 tion Group, concentrate on improving women's knowledge of their legal rights, in-
 creasing women's economic power, and combating domestic violence. There is no
 government office specifically responsible for women's affairs.
 Children.-The Government continued to demonstrate its strong commitment to
 children's rights and welfare through a system of primary health care and education
 overseen by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. The Children's Protection
 and Adoption Act, the Guardianship of Minors Act, and the Deceased Person's Main-
 tenance Act all protect the legal rights of minor children. While there is no compul-
 sory education, Zimbabwe has made considerable progress in providing education for
 girls, and overall primary school attendance has increased by more than 400 percent
 since independence. About 93 percent of children reach grade 5. With the reintro-
 duction of school fees in urban schools and rural secondary schools, however, enroll-
 ment has declined. If a family is unable to pay tuition costs, it is most often female
 children who leave school. There are an estimated 12,000 homeless "street kids" in
 Zimbabwe, many of them the children of former Mozambican refugees or AIDS or-
 phans. Child abuse-including incest (long taboo in Zimbabwean society), infan-
 ticide, child abandonment, and rape is increasing but still is not widespread.
 The Ministry of Justice's Vulnerable Witnesses Committee established two pilot
 projects to improve the judicial system's handling of child victims of rape and sexual
 abuse. The criminal justice system has special provisions for dealing with juvenile
 offenders.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is rarely per-
 formed in Zimbabwe. However, according to press reports, the initiation rites prac-
 ticed by the small Remba ethnic group in Midlands Province include infibulation,
 the most extreme form of FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-President Mugabe appointed a disability activist to Par-
 liament in 1995 to represent the needs of the disabled. The Disabled Persons Act
 of 1992 specifically prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in em-
 ployment, admission to public places, or provision of services and is viewed by advo-
 cates of the disabled as model legislation. In practice, however, the lack of resources
 for training and education severely hampers the ability of disabled people to com-
 pete for scarce jobs. Although the act stipulates that government buildings should
 be accessible to disabled persons, for budgetary reasons this is rarely implemented.
 Disabled people face particularly harsh customary discrimination. According to tra-
 ditional belief, people with disabilities are considered bewitched, and reports of dis-
 abled children being hidden when visitors arrive are common.
 National/Racial [Ethnic Minorities.-The Shona ethnic group makes up 77 per-
 cent of the population, Ndebele 14 percent, Kalanga 5 percent, whites 1 percent, and
 other ethnic groups 3 percent. Government services are provided on a nondiscrim-
 inatory basis, and the Government has sought to expand and improve the previously
 "whites only" infrastructure in urban areas to provide health and social services to
 all citizens. Nevertheless, in social terms Zimbabwe remains a racially stratified
 country. While schools and churches are all integrated, social interaction among ra-
 cial groups is still limited. Although intertribal relations are generally very good,
 the disproportionate number of Shona speaking teachers and headmasters in
 Matabeleland schools remained a sensitive issue.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Relations Act (LRA) provides private sec-
 tor workers with freedom of association and the right to elect their own representa-
 tives, publish newsletters, and set programs and policies that reflect the political
 and economic interests of labor. Workers are free to form or join unions without
 prior authorization. The LRA allows for the existence of multiple unions per indus-
 try, provided that each is registered with the Ministry of Public Service, Labor, and
 Social Welfare (MPSLSW). While the Government may deregister individual unions,
 the High Court has ruled that the LRA does not give the Minister the power to sus-
 pend or deregister the national umbrella labor confederation, the Zimbabwe Con-
 gress of Trade Unions (ZCTU).
 Approximately 30 percent of the formal sector work force belongs to the 33 unions
 that form the ZCTU. ZCTU officers are elected by delegates of affiliated trade
 unions at congresses held every 5 years. While the Government encouraged the
 ZCTU's formation, anticipating that it would form the labor arm of ZANU-PF, it
 
 
 no longer directly influences ZCTU actions. The Government and the ZCTU often
 clash on economic policy, particularly the Economic Structural Adjustment Program
 (ESAP). The Government usually does not consult either the ZCTU or employers be-
 fore implementing policy decisions affecting the workplace. This lack of consultation
 often results in reactions that disrupt labor relations, thereby promoting uncertainty
 and even strikes. At its 1995 Congress, the ZCTU called for the formation of a
 standing committee consisting of labor, government, and industry representatives
 that would comment on all government policy decisions affecting labor. The LRA al-
 lows for the formation of multiple national federations. A second umbrella labor or-
 ganization, the Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Unions (ZFTU), was launched in Oc-
 tober with the stated purpose of providing an alternative of the ZCTU. The new or-
 ganization states that its goal is to work in collaboration with the Government and
 is openly critical of the ZCTU. The ZFTU's origin, leadership, and membership re-
 mained unclear at year's end. Although key personnel have not been publicly identi-
 fled, most observers believe that they are principally former senior ZCTU leaders,
 some of whom were involuntarily separatedfrom that organization. No ZFTU activ-
 ity has been observed other than the fact of its formation.
 Public servants and their associations, the Public Service Association (PSA), the
 Zimbabwe Teachers Association (ZIMTA), and the Zimbabwe Nurses Association
 (ZINA), are not covered by the provisions of the LRA. Instead, their conditions of
 employment are provided for under the Constitution. Although civil servants are
 constitutionally barred from forming unions, in 1995 ZIMTA stated its intention to
 join the ZCTU and the PSA joined in August. All public servants are deemed essen-
 tial and are prohibited from striking. Nonetheless, in late August at least 20,000
 civil servants went on nationwide strike with many more unable or unwilling to re-
 port to work. The Government declared the strike illegal, briefly arrested PSA lead-
 ers, and announced the dismissal of striking workers. After a 20-day strike, the
 Government rescinded the dismissal order and agreed to implement previously
 promised pay raises. The Government also agreed to enter negotiations on other
 worker demands such as unifying the public and private sectors under one LRA. In
 late October, over 2,000 government nurses and 300 government doctors from
 Zimbabwe's principal hospitals resumed their portion of the civil servant strike, cit-
 ing as justification lack of Government good faith in the negotiations. The Govern-
 ment declared the strike illegal, dismissed the striking workers, arrested several of
 their representatives, and banned demonstrations, use of protest placards, and pub-
 lic gatherings related to the strike. In November the ZCTU called a national 2-day
 work stoppage after riot police broke up a peaceful demonstration using truncheons
 and tear gas. The police briefly detained the ZCTU's Secretary General during the
 demonstration. The call for a work stoppage went unheeded. By early December,
 most nurses and doctors had returned to work, but the Government refused to rein-
 state two doctors and several nurses who were in the forefront of the strike.
 The Labor Relations Amendment Act (LRAA) of 1992 specifies that workers may
 establish independent worker committees, which exist side by side with unions, in
 each plant. Worker committees must also be registered with the MPSLSW, which
 is free to refuse registration. Trade union officials believe that the formation of
 worker committees was an attempt to dilute union authority. However, the ineffec-
 tiveness of worker committees demonstrated the need for the experienced worker
 representation of the established trade unions.
 The International Conference of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has criticized
 Zimbabwean labor legislation for giving "wide scope to the authorities to declare
 that a given enterprise or industry constitutes an essential service, and then impose
 a ban (on strikes) on it.L" The authority to reclassify a previously nonessential serv-
 ice as essential was not used in 1996. Workers in sectors deemed "nonessential"
 have the right to strike provided the union advises the Government 2 weeks in ad-
 vance of its intention to do so. If the MPSLSW finds that administrative require-
 ments were not met for a strike, it can issue a disposal order that gives the em-
 ployer the right to dismiss striking workers. There were no reports that this oc-
 curred in 1996. There were 30 cases of collective job actions during the first 5
 months of 1996.
 The ZCTU and its officials are free to associate with international labor organiza-
 tions and do so actively. The ZCTU is affiliated with the ICFTU and the Southern
 African Trade Union Coordinating Council. The African American Labor Center
 (AALC) maintains a regional officebased in Harare.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The LRA provides workers
 with the right to organize. As originally enacted, this act was si ent on the right
 to bargain collectively. However, the 1992 LRAA permits unions to bargain collec-
 tively over wages. Worker committees, which are by law not organizationally part
 of the unions or the ZCTU, are empowered to negotiate with the management of
 
 
 a particular plant on the conditions of labor and codes of conduct in the workplace,
 except for wages.
 Collective bargaining wage negotiations take place on an industrywide basis be-
 tween the relevant union and employer organizations sitting on joint employment
 boards or councils. These bodies submit their agreements to the Registrar in the
 MPSISW for approval. The Government retains the power to veto agreements that
 it believes would harm the economy. However, it did not directly involve itself in
 labor negotiations unless requested to do so by one of the two parties. When no
 trade union represents a specific sector, representatives of the organized workers,
 i.e., the professional associations, meet with the employer associations, under the
 mediation of labor officers from the MPSISW. Public sector wages are determined
 by the Salary Service Department of the MPSLSW, subject to the approval of an
 independent Public Service Commission (PSC). Each year PSC officials meet with
 PSA representatives to review wages and benefits. These reviews result in a rec-
 ommendation that is forwarded to the MPSLSW. The Minister is not required by
 law to accept the recommendation.
 Employees designated as being in managerial positions are excluded from union
 membership and thus from the collective bargaining process. The presence of the
 ZCTU or specific national unions in individual shop floor or worker committee nego-
 tiations is not mandated.
 The LRA prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members.
 Complaints of such discrimination are referred to labor relations officers and may
 subsequently be adjudicated by the Labor Relations Tribunal (LRT). Such com-
 plaints are handled under the mechanism for resolving cases involving "unfair labor
 practices." The determining authority may direct that workers fired due to
 antiunion discrimination should be reinstated, although this has yet to be utilized
 in practice.
 The  R      streamlined the procedure for adjudicating disputes by strengthening
 the LRT. Now, labor relations officers hear a dispute; their decision may be ap-
 pealed to regional labor relations officers, after which the LRT may hear the case.
 Ultimately, it may be appealed to the Supreme Court. In 1993 the Government
 filled long vacant positions on the LRT, but at yeaxs end the LRT boards were still
 not fully staffed. The LET has a backlog of over 2,000 cases, some of which have
 been awaiting a hearing for more than 7 years.
 The Export Processing Zones Act states the LA shall not apply to workers in
 export processing zones (EPZ's). Although President Mugbe publicly agreed in 1994
 hat the act should be revised to make the LEA applicable in the EPZ's, the Govern-
 ment has taken no action to amend the act. Applications for companies to be estab-
 lished in the newly created EPZ's are currently being processed.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Compulsory labor is prohibited by
 law, and there were no reports that it was practiced.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children.-The law affords little protection to
 working children. There is no specific legal prohibition of child labor; the LRA only
 states that contracts of employment shall not be enforceable against any person
 under the age of 16. Although schooling is not compulsory, over 90 percent of chil-
 dren attend school through grade 5 (see Section 5).
 The presence of child labor in industry is marginal since a ready supply of adult
 labor at relatively low wages gives firms little incentive to employ children. Children
 are most often employed as casual farm workers, domestics, or in the informal sec-
 tor; only a tiny percentage of children work full-time. Among the peasant farmers,
 financial necessity often dictates the use of child labor during the harvest season
 and for tending livestock. There were anecdotal reports of an increase in the number
 of children working full-time in the informal sector and small-scale alluvial gold
 panning. The Government formed a task force in late 1993 to define child labor, de-
 termine problem areas, and suggest legislation to alleviate these problems. The task
 force referred its recommendations to the Attorney General's office which to date
 has taken no action.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The maximum legal workweek is 54 hours, and
 the law prescribes a minimum of one 24-hour rest period per week. Working condi-
 tions are regulated by the Government on a specific industries basis. The Constitu-
 tion empowers the PSC to set conditions of employment in the public sector. Govern-
 ment regulations for each of the 22 industrial sectors continue to specify minimum
 wages, hours, holidays, and required safety measures. In recent years, in an effort
 to opt out of the wage bargaining system, the Government mandated wage paranm-
 eters and specified minimum wage increases only for domestics and gardeners. Due
 to an ineffective monitoring system, many such workers are remunerated below the
 minimum wage.
 
 
 333
 The minimum monthly wage for domestics and gardeners of approximately $31
 (Z$308.49 and Z$304.83 respectively) is the de facto minimum wage. In most in-
 stances the employer must provide housing and food to workers or allowances for
 such. On commercial farms, the employer may provide schooling for workers' chil-
 dren. The minimum wage is not sufficient to sustain a decent standard of living for
 a worker and family. Workers in sectors covered under collective bargaining agree-
 ments received wage increases averaging a few points below the 25 percent inflation
 rate. Minimum monthly wage rates ranged from $29 (Z$290) in the agricultural sec-
 tor to approximately $73 to $82 (Z$731 to Z$817) in the various manufacturing sec-
 tors. In theory labor relations officers from the MPSLSW are assigned to monitor
 developments in each plant to assure that government minimum wage policy and
 occupational health and safety regulations are observed. In practice these offices are
 understaffed, cannot afford to routinely inspect workplaces, and must rely on vol-
 untary compliance and reporting by employers.
 Safety in the workplace is a continuing problem. The most recent figures show
 that there were 252 deaths in 19,861 reported occupational injuries during 1995,
 numbers consistent with those for preceding years. Many of the basic legal protec-
 tions do not apply to the vast majority of farm, mine, anddomestic workers. Unions
 charge that there are no general standards for the work environment, such as
 threshold limits for manually lifted weights or conditions for pregnant workers.
 Health and safety standards are determined only on an industry-specific basis. The
 Government intervenes on a selected basis (and often seemingly in response to the
 most recent accident) and sets standards by regulation in some industries. In theory
 workers have a legal right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to continued employment; in practice they risk the loss of their
 livelihood.
