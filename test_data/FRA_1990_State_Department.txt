 FRANCE
 France is a democratic republic with constitutional provisions
 for human rights, freely functioning political parties,
 regular elections, and universal suffrage.
 France's military/security apparatus consists of the three
 traditional services, a 90,000-strong gendarmerie (national
 police/paramilitary force), and police forces in major
 cities. These forces come under civilian control and are
 highly professional, but there are instances, such as the
 3-day riot in the working-class town of Vaulx-en-Velin in
 October, in which the police were alleged to have used
 excessive force to restore and maintain order.
 France has a developed and diversified economy and a skilled
 labor force. It has substantial agricultural resources and a
 modern industrial system based on a mixture of public and
 private enterprises.
 French authorities respect human rights and civil liberties.
 France's cabinet-level Secretary of State for Human Rights,
 who reports directly to the Prime Minister, is tasked with
 encouraging respect for human rights both in France and
 abroad. The Government in 1990 consistently condemned acts of
 violence against ethnic and religious minorities. French
 public and political leaders, including President Mitterrand.
 responded to the desecration of tombs in the Jewish cemetery
 in Carpentras in southern France by participating in a public
 march condemning racism, particularly anti-Semitism.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There is no evidence that French authorities engaged in
 political or other extrajudicial killings in 1990. The level
 of terrorism in France remained low, and no major acts of
 international terrorism were committed on French soil. The
 incidents of violence perpetrated by domestic terrorist
 groups--primarily Basque, Breton, and Corsican separatists--
 were relatively minor and nonlethal, although at the end of
 1990 several murders occurred in Corsica that could have been
 the work of either organized crime or terrorist separatists.
 The judicial system continued its vigorous prosecution of
 terrorists. A Paris court in March convicted all but one of
 the defendants in the trial of Hizballah members accused of
 conspiracy in connection with a rash of bomb attacks in Paris
 in 1986. In July President Mitterrand pardoned Anis Naccache,
 a terrorist convicted of killing two people in an
 assassination attempt on former Iranian Prime Minister
 Bakhtiar in 1980.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence that the authorities have engaged in
 abduction or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 France does not condone or practice torture or cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment. However, there have
 
 
 1151
 
 FRANCE
 been a few documented cases of police brutality. The case of
 one American who alleged mistreatment during his 1986 arrest,
 and the case of another American who claimed the police used
 unnecessary force during a December 1989 search of his home,
 remain under investigation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 French law provides for freedom from arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus
 in the French legal system, but there is a limit of 2 days
 --4 for drug and terrorist cases--before a suspect must be
 referred to a magistrate for investigation.
 The judiciary plays a determining role in the detention
 process. Government authority to hold a person beyond the
 prescribed periods is severely restricted, and such detention
 must be ordered by the competent court.
 There is no evidence that the- authorities detained any person
 for political reasons. There is no, provision for exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is provided by law and respected
 in practice. Suspects are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty and have the right to legal counsel as soon as their
 cases are transferred from the police to the magistrate. For
 misdemeanors, pretrial confinement.is limited normally to 4
 months, with extensions- in special circumstances of
 approximately 8 t 12 months.- Although- all druq-related
 crimes are technically classified as misdemeanors. those
 convicted of serious narcotics offenses are subject to
 penalties otherwise. reserved for felonies. Those found-guilty
 of some drug offenses may be sentenced to up to 2G years'
 imprisonment. Pretrial confinement in drug cases and in
 felonies is not limited. This pretrial period can be lengthy,
 depending upon the seriousness and complexity of the case.
 Evidence is gathered and assessed by anL independent examining
 judge. Defendants are free to request and present evidence
 during this-investigatory period.
 Trials in France are normally open and public, but provisions
 exist for the defense to request a closed proceeding. All
 felonies are tried before juries, and a defendant does not
 have the right to- refuse a jury trial. The press has free
 access to records of court proceedings, although under French
 law the prosecutor may not disclose information about cases
 being tried or investigated. French- law provides, for the
 right of appeal for those convicted of misdemeanors. Those
 convicted of felonies may appeal to the Cour- de Cassation only
 on procedural grounds.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 French law provides for freedom from invasion of privacy, and
 this freedom is respected in practice. The search of a
 private residence requires a search warrant and must take
 place between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. except in special
 circumstances, such as drug cases, when the search may be
 undertaken at any time. Telephone conversations may be
 monitored in conjunction with criminal proceedings with a
 court order. However, no court order is required in national
 security cases.

 FRANCE
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Newspapers and magazines are free from
 government control and present views ranging across the
 political spectrum. There are three state-owned and three
 private television networks, in addition to private cable
 channels. Hundreds of private radio stations offer a wide
 array of independent, uncensored programming. Academic
 freedom of expression is respected in both public and private
 academic institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is widely
 respected in France, although--except for a specific reference
 to trade unions--it is not mentioned in the Constitution.
 Groups wishing to organize public meetings, protest marches,
 or demonstrations must obtain a permit from the local
 authorities. Permits are usually granted for both political
 and nonpolitical gatherings. Local authorities have on
 occasion, however, denied permits to extremist groups. After
 Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and subsequent seizure of French
 hostages, the French Government announced that it would not
 permit public demonstrations in favor of the Iraqi regime.
 Private associations, whethet political or apolitical, must
 register with the prefecture in the department in which they
 are established, but they do not require the prefecture's
 authorization to exist. Such registration is considered
 routine in France. Informal associations, such as those
 without officers, bylaws, or dbes, need not register.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although Roman Catholics comprise by far the largest religious
 group in France, all religions are tolerated. Separation of
 church and state is guaranteed by law. Private and parochial
 schools receive substantial subsidies from the Ministry of
 National Education.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel; Emigration, and Repatriation
 French law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. All lawful resident
 aliens, including refugees, can undertake foreign travel and,
 in most instances, return to France. France has a long
 history as a haven for refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people have the right and ability to change their
 Government by peaceful means, not only through the election of
 the President, the National Assembly, and local officials, but
 also through amendment of the Constitution by means of
 national referendum. The Constitution guarantees the equality
 of all citizens before the law, without regard to origin,
 race, or religion. All French citizens who have reached the
 age of 18 may vote, except for most convicted criminals,
 bankrupt persons, and persons certified to be mentally
 incompetent. These provisions are fully respected in
 
 
 1153
 
 FRANCE
 practice. Presidential elections are held every 7 years, and
 elections for the National Assembly are held every 5 years,
 unless the Government is dissolved, in which case elections
 may be called sooner. Voting is-by secret ballot.
 A wide variety of political parties compete freely in
 regularly scheduled Rational and local elections. Many'
 special interest groups--business, labor, veterans, consumer
 advocates, ecologists, and others--organize freely and
 regularly support candidates for elective office.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 NongoveLnmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 France'has traditionally been a leader in the human rights
 field. Both local and international human rights
 organizations operate freely in France.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Statutes ban discrimination based on race, religion, sex,
 ethnic background, or political opinion. Incidents of racism
 have been directed at the large Arab/Muslif and black African
 immigrant communities, as well as toward the Jewish
 population. The Government and a wide spectrum of public
 opinion consistently condemned these incidents.
 The French media and French political leaders in 199a became
 very sensitive to a perceived increase in anti-Semitic
 sentiment and activity. This growth in anxiety coincided with
 the continued rise of political groups on the extreme right
 associated with anti-Semitism. The desecration of the Jewish
 cemetery in Carpentras in southern Fiance in May was followed
 a few days later by a massive march in opposition to the
 anti-Semitism exemplified by the desecration. The May 15
 march marked the first time since the liberation of France in
 1944 that an incumbent French President participated in such a
 demonstration. The National Assembly on June 30 passed a law
 that called for restricting participation in the- political"
 process, for up to 5 years, by anyone convicted of committing
 racist, anti-Semitic, or xenophobic acts. Prior laws
 proscribed "racism"; the new law is more broadly targeted,
 aimed at helping "victims of discrimination based on national,
 ethnic, racial, or religious origin." The new law
 specifically provides that sanctions can be imposed against
 anyone who publicly contends that_"crimes against humanity,
 collaboration with-the enemy, or war crimes" did not occur.
 These provisions appear aimed at extreme rightwing groups that
 have discounted the holocaust; these groups often are accused
 of promoting anti-Semitism. The judicial interpretations of
 the antidiscrimination law most likely will address further
 questions of what acts do, or do not, constitute racist,
 anti-Semitic, or xenophobic acts.
 The national debate in late 1989 over the rights of religious
 minorities sparked by the "head scarf" incident--whether
 Muslim girls should be permitted to wear head scarves in
 public schools-significantly subsided. The debate revolved
 around the traditional and legally mandated secular nature of
 French public schools. The debate also touched on questions
 of freedom of expression, the role of parents vis-a-vis the
 State, allegations of racial and cultural discrimination
 against the Arab/Muslim minority, and concerns about the
 
 
 1154
 
 FRANCE
 effect of religious traditions on sexual equality.
 The French are assertive about the primacy of the French
 language in the French educational system but are tolerant of
 the numerous residents of France who have non-French origins
 and whose mother tongue is not French.
 The Government does not tolerate violence and abuse against
 women, and such violence, including wife beating, is
 prohibited under Article 309 of the penal code. The State
 Secretary for Women's Rights estimated that as many as 10
 percent of French homes experience family violence of a
 physical, psychological, or sexual nature. The State
 Secretary launched an educational campaign to underscore the
 need to address the problem and called for tougher penalties
 for violators of Article 309.
 While French law requires that women receive equal pay for
 equal work, this requirement is not met in many cases.
 Women's rights groups actively lobby for full implementation
 of equal rights statutes and seek solutions to the
 increasingly publicized phenomenon of violence against women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution affirms the principle of freedom of labor
 union association. Although only 10 percent of the work force
 is unionized, trade unions exercise significant economic and
 political influence. They participate actively in numerous
 tripartite (government, employer, and worker) bodies dealing
 with social matters, including labor courts and the Economic
 and Social Council, a constitutionally mandated consultative
 body. All unions are technically independent of the political
 parties, but many of the leaders of France's largest union,
 the General Confederation of Labor, belong to the Communist
 Party. Leaders of most other unions are members of one or
 another faction of the Socialist Party, although members of
 other parties are also active in the labor movement. There
 are no restrictions on the unions' international activities,
 and all three world trade union confederations have French
 affiliates. French workers, including civil servants, are
 free to strike, with a few exceptions in cases where strikes
 are determined to be a threat to public safety. According to
 the latest available statistics, 904,000 man-days of work were
 lost because of strikes in 1989, as opposed to 1,242,00G
 man-days in 1988.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have the right to organize and bargain collectively.
 French law strictly prohibits antiuniofi discrimination. The
 law further sets forth procedures for dealing with labor
 disputes and defines two forms of collective contracts:
 extendable and ordinary. Amendments added in 1982 require at
 least annual bargaining on wages, hours, and working
 conditions at both plant and industry levels. The 1982 law
 does not require that negotiations result in a signed
 contract. However, outside mediators, drawn from the upper
 ranks of the civil service, may impose solutions that are
 binding unless formally rejected by either side within 8
 days. About 19 percent of France's private sector work force
 is covered by annually updated, bilaterally conducted
 collective bargaining agreements. There are also trilateral
 consultations on such subjects as the minimum wage, temporary
 
 
 1155
 FRANCE
 work, and social security. France has no export processing
 zones.
 French law requires that enterprises with more than 50
 employees have a works council where workers are consulted on
 working conditions. 'Work councils are open to both union and
 nonunion'members, and elections are held every 2 years.
 Trade union rights, as guaranteed by the Constitution, extend
 to France's overseas departments and territories. However,
 some social benefits, such as the minimum wage or supplemental
 retirement payments, may be reduced in the overseas
 departments and territories, taking into account the local
 economies.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and this
 prohibition is effectively enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children-
 With a few exceptions for those enrolled in recognized
 apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may not
 be employed. Certain categories of work considered arduous
 and night work (10 p.m. to 5 a.m.) may not be performed by
 persons unaer the age of 18 or by women in manufacturing,
 mining, the public sector, unions, and nonprofit organizations.
 However, women with managerial responsibilities may perform
 night work. Laws prohibiting child employment are effectively
 enforced through periodic inspections by officials of the
 Ministry of Labor, Eiployment, and'Vocational Training.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 France hai a minimum wage of $5'94 an hour, whi6h is
 sufficient to provide a decent standard of living. The
 national legal maximum workweek is 39 hours. As part of a-
 trilaterally negotiated package to.reduce working time in the
 -hope that enterprises would find it necessary to employ more
 people, overtime is restricted'to 9 hours per week. In
 general terms, French labor legislation and practice,
 ,including that pertaining to occupational safety and health,
 are fully comparable to those in other industrialized market
 economy countries.
 The Ministry of Labor has overall responsibility for policing
 occupational safety and health laws. To assist the Ministry,
 French law requires that any enterprise with 300 or more
 employees establish a committee for occupational safety,
 health, and conditions of work. About 65 percent of all
 enterprises, employing about 80 percent of the private
 sector's labor force, had such committees in 1989.
