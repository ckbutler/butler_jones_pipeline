 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania is a parliamentary democracy, having regained its independence in
 1990 after more than 50 years of forced annexation by the Soviet Union. The Con-
 stitution, adopted by referendum in 1992, established a 141-member unicameral leg-
 islature, the Seimas; a directly elected president, who functions as Head of State;
 and a government formed by a prime minister and other ministers, appointed by
 the President and approved by the Seimas. The Government exercises authority
 with the approval of the Seimas and the President. The Conservatives prevailed in
 the 1996 parliamentary elections, followed by the Christian Democrats. The two
 aVies formed a coalition government (the first in Lithuania's history). In February
 aldas Adamkus was elected President by a narrow margin. The judiciary is inde-
 pendent.
 A unified national police force under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry is
 responsible for law enforcement. The State Security Department is responsible for
 internal security and reports to Parliament and the President. The police committed
 a number of human rights abuses.
 Since independence Lithuania has maade steady progress in developing a market
 economy. Over 40 percent of state property, in addition to most housing and small
 businesses, has been privatized. Trade is diversifying, and expanding both to the
 West and the East. The largest number of residents are employed in agriculture (22
 percent), followed by industrial enterprises (19.9 percent, including electricity, gas,
 and water supply) and wholesale and retail trade (14.8 percent). About 31.6 percent
 of those employed work for state enterprises, while 68.4 percent are employed by
 private companies. The agricultural sector's high proportion of the work force re-
 flects a lack of efficient consolidation of small private farms and represents a vocal
 protectionist current in economic policy debate. The banking system remains weak,
 but laws on banking control and supervision are in place and a number of large pri-
 vate banks are undergoing outside audits. The inflation rate for the first half of the
 
 
 1365
 year was 2.6 percent, compared with an annual rate of 8.4 percent for 1997. Per
 capita gross domestic product for the first half of the year was estimated at $1,240
 (4,960 litas) and unemployment at mid-year was 6.2 percent. The balance of trade
 remains negative due to imports of gas and other energy products from Russia.
 Major exports include textile and knitwear products, timber and furniture, elec-
 tronic goods, food, and chemical and petroleum products.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, but problems
 remain in some areas. Police on occasion beat detainees and abuse detention laws.
 The Government is making some progress in bringing police corruption under con-
 trol. Prison conditions remain poor, and prolonged detention in a small number of
 cases is still a problem. The police investigated the desecration of two Jewish sites
 but identified no suspects. State media continues to be subject to political interests.
 Violence and discrimination against women and child abuse are serious problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUM IAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 In May President Adamkus announced an initiative to form an international com-
 mission for research into crimes against humanity perpetrated in Lithuania from
 1939-91. By year's end, the commission had not yet received funding for its pro-
 posed budget, action plan, or staff.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There is a problem, however, of women who have been forced or willingly sold into
 prostitution by organized crime figures (see Section 5). Their families, unaware of
 the situation, claim that they have disappeared or have been kidnaped.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically forbids torture, and there were no reports of its use.
 However, police sometimes beat or otherwise physically mistreated detainees. The
 local press reported that incidents of police brutality are becoming more common.
 In many instances, the victims reportedly are reluctant to bring charges against po-
 lice officers for fear of reprisals. A total of 79 officers were dismissed for illegal or
 fraudulent activities in the first 6 months of the year for a variety of offenses, com-
 pared with 182 for all .of 1997. The Interior Ministry states that district police in-
 spectors are the most negligent in the force. To strengthen the integrity of the po-
 lice, the Inspectorate General of the Interior Ministry was given administrative au-
 tonomy in May 1997.
 Human rights violations committed by noncommissioned military personnel con-
 tinue, despite efforts to quash hazing-a practice inherited from the former Soviet
 armed forces. As living conditions improve for military personnel, there has been a
 significant reduction in human rights violations committed by noncommissioned offi-
 cers. During the first S months of the year, 34 cases were brought against conscripts
 and officers, of whom 5 were charged with "hooliganism" and 1 was charged with
 causing intentional bodily injury. According to the Ministry of National Defense,
 most trauma inflicted on conscripts is psychological rather than physical. The Min-
 istry believes that a lack of professionalism among noncommissioned officers-rath-
 er than ethnic, regional, or social factors-is a primary factor in cases of hazing, and
 it is working actively to improve the skills and judgment of such officers.
 Prison conditions are poor. Due to limited resources, most prisons are over-
 crowded and poorly maintained. Prisoners on death row or serving life sentences are
 required to wear special striped uniforms. Human rights monitors are permitted to
 visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Except in cases that come under provi-
 sions of the Preventive Detention Law (described below), police may detain a person
 for up to 72 hours based upon reliable evidence of criminal activity. Under a law
 passed in June, a judge also must approve the detention. At the end of that period,
 police must decide whether to make a formal arrest, and a magistrate must approve
 an arrest warrant. The authorities have 10 days to present supporting evidence.
 Once a suspect is formally charged, prosecutors may keep the suspect under inves-
 tigative arrest for up to 2 months before taking the suspect to court. In exceptional
 cases, investigative arrest may be extended by a further 6 to 9 months with the
 written approval of the Prosecutor General. The Constitution provides for the right
 to an attorney from the moment of detention.
 In an effort to cope with the rise in violent organized crime in 1993, Parliament
 passed the Preventive Detention Law pertaining to persons suspected of being vio-
 lent criminals. The law was passed as a temporary measure and was repealed in
 June 1997. The 1993 law allowed police, but not the internal security and armed
 
 
 1366
 forces, to detain suspected violent criminals for up to 2 months rather than only for
 the standard 72-hour period. The effect of the law was to give prosecutors and inves-
 tigators additional time to conduct an investigation and file formal criminal charges
 against the detainee. The Government is addressing concems that periods of deten-
 tion were excessive.
 In the most widely known case, businessman Arvydas Stasaitis, who was accused
 of embezzlement and misappropriation of funds, was kept in detention in a hard
 labor camp from November 1994 until October 1998 when he was sentenced to 7
 years imprisonment. He was originally under house arrest, but fled the country. He
 was arrested abroad, repatriated, and incarcerated.
 There is no provision for exile, nor is it practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the judiciary is independent in practice.
 Efforts continued during the year to reform legal codes imposed during the Soviet
 era. Parliament passed new civil and criminal procedure codes as well as a Court
 Reform Law in 1995. The judicial system presently consists of a two-tier structure
 of district courts and a Supreme Court, which is an appellate court. There is also
 a Constitutional Court. Court decisions are arrived at independently. The Prosecu-
 tor General exercises an oversight responsibility through a network of district pros-
 ecutors who work with police investigators-employed by the Ministry of the Inte-
 rior-in preparing the prosecution's evidence for the courts. The institution of lay
 assessors was abolished at-the end of 1994.
 Under the provisions of the Court Reform Law, two new kinds of courts were cre-
 ated. Local district courts were set up below the present district courts to handle
 cases at the municipal level, while a new appellate court level hears appeals arising
 from district court decisions, thereby reducing the case load of the overburdened Su-
 preme Court.
 An arbitration system for commercial cases was established in 1997 by the Lith-
 uanian Chamber of Commerce, Lithuanian Industrialists' Association, the Associa-
 tion of Lithuanian Banks, and the Association of International Chambers of Com-
 merce. With the abolition of the Economic Court in September, commercial cases
 will be resolved through arbitration or heard in county or district court. In addition
 as a result of accession to the Council of Europe in 1993, the Ministry of Justice
 initiated in 1995 an ongoing process to review Lithuania's laws to bring them into
 accord -with the provisions of the European Convention on Basic Human Rights and
 Freedoms.
 The Constitution provides defendants with the right to counsel. In practice the
 right to legal counsel is abridged by the shortage of trained advocates who find it
 difficult to cope with the burgeoning numbers of criminal cases brought before the
 courts. Outside observers have recommended the establishment of a public defender
 system to regularize procedures for provision of legal assistance to indigent persons
 charged in criminal cases. By law defense advocates have access to government evi-
 dence and may present evidence and witnesses. The courts and law enforcement
 agencies generally honor routine, written requests for evidence.
 Government rehabilitation of over 50,000 persons charged with anti-Soviet crimes
 during the Stalin era led to reports in 1991 that some people alleged to have been
 involved with crimes against humanity during the Nazi occupation had benefited
 from this rehabilitation. A special judicial procedure was established to examine
 each case in which an individual or organization raised an objection that a rehabili-
 tated person may have committed a crime against humanity. In the first such cases
 since 1994, the Supreme Court during the year overturned the rehabilitation of 22
 persons.
 Formal charges have been brought against alleged war criminals Aleksandras
 Lileikis and Kazys Gimzauskas. After being stripped of his U.S. citizenship in May
 1996 for concealing his World War II activities, that allegedly included acts of geno-
 cide when he headed the security police of the Vilnius district under Nazi control,
 Lileikis returned to Lithuania. Gimzauskas, who had served as Lileikis's deputy,
 had returned to Lithuania in 1993. After his appointment in February 1997, Pros-
 ecutor General Kazys Pednycia actively investigated the case, and prepared to pros-
 ecute Lileikis by the end of June 1997. However, the law stipulates that the accused
 has -a right to a fair, public trial and that the trial cannot proceed if the accused's
 health precludes his or her appearance in court. The Seimas passed legislation at
 the end of 1997 to allow indictment of persons accused of war crimes in absentia,
 which authorities did. Due to Lileikis's continued assertions that his health is poor,
 formal court proceedings begun in September were suspended by the judge pending
 a medical examination of Lileikis's physical and mental fitness. Medical commission
 members stated on October 12 that Lileikis was fit to stand trial. Lileikis appeared
 at his trial in November, but he was removed from the courtroom ostensibly due
 
 
 1367
 to poor health when he appeared to suffer from exhaustion. A medical commission
 appointed by the Court is expected to rule in January 1999 on whether Lileikis and
 Gimzauskas are fit to stand trial.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy. The authorities do not engage in in-
 discriminate or widespread monitoring of the correspondence or communications of
 citizens. With the written authorization of a prosecutor or judge, however, police
 and the security service may engage in surveillance and monitoring activities on
 grounds of national security. Except in cases of hot pursuit or the danger of dis-
 appearance of evidence, police must obtain a search warrant signed by a prosecutor
 before they may enter private premises.
 However, it is assumed widely that law enforcement agencies have increased the
 use of a range of surveillance methods to cope with the expansion of organized
 crime. There is some question as to the legal basis for this police surveillance, but
 there are no known legal challenges to such surveillance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press. The Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Prior restraint over either print or broadcast media and restrictions on disclosure
 are prohibited, unless the Government determines that national security is involved.
 The Parliament adop ted its long-awaited media law in 1996, after a draft public in-
 formation law failed to pass in 1995 because most independent news publications
 and many prominent journalists protested that it was too restrictive. The new
 media law introduced an element of self-regulation but postponed a difficult decision
 on television advertising. Under the new law, the media are to create a special eth-
 ics commission and an ombudsman to check libel cases and other complaints. The
 final version of the law allows reporting on the private lives of officials as long as
 the information affects the welfare of the people.
 The independent print media has flourished since independence, including a wide
 range of economic newspapers and specialty magazines. Officially there are over
 2,000 newspapers and magazines registered, but only a fraction are still published.
 Journalists covering organized crime continue to receive threats to their safety
 and welfare.
 State radio and five private radio stations broadcast throughout the country. In
 addition to state television, which is in the process of being transformed into public
 television, three private television stations also broadcast regular programming na-
 tionwide. Additional radio and television stations, including a Polish-language radio
 station in the Vilnius region, are found throughout the country in population cen-
 ters.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 The Communist Party of Lithuania and other organizations associated with the
 Soviet regime continue to be banned.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and the
 Government generally respects this provision in practice. The Law on Religious
 Communities and Associations was passed in 1995. It grants religious communities,
 associations, and centers property rights to prayer houses, homes, and other build-
 ings and permits construction necessary for their activities. Article 5 of this law
 mentions nine religious communities that have been declared "traditional" by the
 law and therefore are eligible for governmental assistance: Latin Rite Catholics;
 Greek Rite Catholics; Evangelical Lutherans; Evangelical Reformers; Orthodox; Old
 Believers; Jews; Sunni Muslims; and Karaites. There are no restrictions on the ac-
 tivities of other religious communities.
 Relations between the Government and the officially registered Jewish community
 are good. However, the Hasidic Chabad Lubavich community has not yet been able
 to register as a traditional Jewish religion. The Ministry of Justice has argued that
 the Chabad Lubavich is not a part of Lithuania's historical, spiritual, or social herit-
 age and therefore cannot be registered as traditional (Article 5 of the Law on Reli-
 gious Communities and Associations). The Ministry has stated that the Chabad
 Lubavich does not have a continuity of traditions and is a separate branch of Juda-
 ism than that followed by the traditional Lithuanian Jewish religious community.
 Furthermore, it has stated that the Hasidic- movement only began in Lithuania in
 the 18th century and has been suspended twice. The Chabad Lubavich community
 countered that the suspension of its activity during the war years and subsequently
 was imposed by Nazi and Soviet occupiers. It also has protested the disassociation
 
 
 1368
 of the Hasidic movement from Judaism. The Chabad Lubavich continue to press for
 recognition as a traditional religion. The Ministry of Justice is reviewing the status
 of Chabad Lubavich. The inability to register has not had a direct impact on Chabad
 Lubavich activities; the Chabad Lubavich operates a school (kindergarten through
 12th grade), a social center, and a kosher kitchen.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Under the law, citizens and permanent residents are permitted free
 movement within the country and the right to return to the country. There are no
 restrictions on foreign travel.
 In 1997 the Law on Refugee Status came into effect, allowing for the first formal
 grant of refugee status to qualified applicants, in accordance with the provisions of
 the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees and Its 1967 Protocol.
 There is a registration center for migrants and asylum seekers in the town of
 Pabrade, where 198 illegal immigrants were registered by year's end. Conditions at
 Pabrade are unpleasant but support basic needs. A modern, well-equipped refugee
 reception center, opened in 1997 in the town of Rukla. It has approximately 200
 residents and is intended to help integrate those persons granted refugee status into
 society. As of the end of the year, over 1,600 illegal immigrants either departed
 Lithuania of their own accord or were repatriated with international financial as-
 sistance.
 Lithuania continued its efforts to stem the tide of illegal migrants through nego-
 tiating readmission agreements with Russia and Belarus, the two countries used by
 most migrants to reach Lithuania. The Government cooperates with the office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organiza-
 tions in assisting refugees. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise
 during the year. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country
 where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Of 141 seats in the Seimas, 71 are
 elected directly and 70 are elected through proportional representation. Only those
 parties that receive more than 5 percent of the total ballots (or 7 percent for coali-
 tions) are allowed representation in the Parliament. National minority slates had
 been exempt from this law in the past, but despite the 5 percent threshold, ethnic
 Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, and Jews were elected to the Seimas in the 1996 par-
 liamentary elections.
 The Citizenship Law, adopted in 1991 and amended in 1995, is inclusive with re-
 gard to the country's ethnic minorities. The law provides citizenship to persons who
 were born within the borders of the Republic; who were citizens of Lithuania prior
 to 1940 and their descendants; or who became citizens under previous legal author-
 ity. More than 90 percent of Lithuania's ethnic Russian, Polish, Belarusian, and
 Ukrainian inhabitants received citizenship.
 Qualification for naturalization of persons not covered by the above-mentioned
 categories requires a 10-year residency, a permanent job or source of income, knowl-
 edge of the Constitution, renunciation of any other citizenship, and proficiency in
 Lithuanian.
 While there are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics or gov-
 ernment, they are underrepresented in political leadership positions. There are 24
 female deputies; there is 1 female minister in the 14-member Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Most government authorities cooperate with local nongovernmental organizations
 and actively encourage visits by international and nongovernmental human rights
 groups. A key exception is the Ministry of Interior, which has continually refused
 to release information on police brutality and statistics on corruption-related inci-
 dents. The Association for the Defense of Human Rights in Lithuania is an umbrella
 organization for several small human rights groups, all of which operate without
 government restriction. In 1994 the Government established the Department of
 International and Human Rights within the Ministry of Justice, which monitors law
 and legal practice to determine whether these are in accord with Lithuania's inter-
 national obligations.
 
 
 1369
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 or ethnic background. However, discrimination against women persists.
 Women.-Abuse of women at home is reportedly common, especially in connection
 with alcohol abuse by husbands, but institutional mechanisms for coping with this
 problem only now are being formed. A women's shelter funded in part with Nor-
 wegian assistance is now in operation. According to one sociological survey pub-
 lished in 1997, 20 percent of women reported experiencing an attempted rape, while
 another 33 percent reported having been beaten at least once in their lives. The
 number of rapes reported in the first half of the year (83) is proportionally the same
 as the 166 rapes reported for all of 1997. Official statistics on the incidence of abuse
 of women in the home are not filed separately from other categories of assault. Per-
 sons convicted of rape generally receive sentences of from 3 to 5 years in prison.
 A number of women, some underage, have been enticed or forced into prostitution
 and sold abroad by organized crime figures. Some go consciously, hoping to become
 wealthy; others are lured by deceptive offers of seemingly innocent jobs as house-
 hold helpers, bar dancers, or waitresses. Women are also tricked into prostitution
 through false marriage advertisements. Their families often are unaware of their
 predicament and believe that they have disappeared or been kidnaped. An official
 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that about 99 percent of women who
 have been reported missing actually are working as prostitutes abroad.
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for men and women, and official policy
 specifies equal pay for equal work. Generally, men and women receive the same pay
 for comparable work, but women are underrepresented significantly in some profes-
 sions and in the managerial sector as a whole. Significant inequalities in society
 based on gender continue, and there are still very conservative views about the role
 of women. The fact that women's enrollment now exceeds that of men in some uni-
 versity departments has prompted university administrators to introduce pref-
 erential entrance criteria for men to redress what is perceived as an abnormal state
 of affairs. Parliamentary deputies speaking about female deputies in public some-
 times make unflattering comments based on gender stereotypes without eliciting
 any public reaction.
 Children.-The Ministries of Social Security and of the Interior share official re-
 sponsibility for the protection of children's rights and welfare. Starting in 1994, the
 Children's Rights Service of the Ministry of Social Security has taken on many of
 the functions formerly handled by the Interior Ministry and its subordinate police
 officers throughout the country, thereby focusing more attention on the social wel-
 fare needs of children. There are 56 branches of the Children's Rights Protection
 Council throughout the country. This Council registers and cares for children in
 abusive and dysfunctional families, and had registered 34,379 children during the
 year.
 Child abuse is a problem. The press has been thorough in reporting increases in
 cruelty to children, including sexual abuse, intentional starvation, beatings, and
 murder. Authorities reported that 2 children were killed by their parents in 1998,
 down from 3 deaths in 1997. However, no department or organization collects infor-
 mation on child abuse. Moreover, there are no specific criminal codes for child por-
 nography, sexual abuse, or sex tourism. There is only one rehabilitation center in
 the country for children who have been abused sexually.
 Social welfare workers believe that child abuse in connection with alcohol abuse
 by parents is a serious problem. Moreover, the prevalence of authoritarian values
 in family upbringing has discouraged more active measures against child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-The 1991 Law on Integrating Disabled People provides
 for a broad category of rights and public benefits to which disabled people are le-
 gally entitled. Legal provisions for access to buildings for people with disabilities are
 in place but are not widely enforced; the vast majority of public buildings remain
 inaccessible to such persons.
 More than 350,000 people with disabilities live in Lithuania-10,000 of them chil-
 dren. During the year the Parliament allotted approximately $35 million (140 mil-
 lion litas) for persons with disabilities, including $20 million (80 million litas) for
 institutions caring for such persons, $6.8 million (27.3 million litas) for various spe-
 cific programs, and $5.8 million (23.4 million litas) for orthopedic assistance pro-
 grams. A project in Kaunas to build an apartment building for persons with disabil-
 ities has not been completed due to a lack of funds and the pending privatization
 of the state institution that was to have supervised the project. A center for deaf
 children has been created, as has a program for children with special orthopedic
 problems.
 
 
 1370
 Religious Minorities.-Jewish community leaders expressed their concern regard-
 ing desecration at the cemetery in Kaunas and at a monument marking a former
 cemetery site in Vilnius. Although authorities res ponded promptly in both cases, no
 witnesses were found and no charges were brought. A certain level of anti-Semitic
 sentiment persists in the country. However, on January 23, Lithuanian Fascist
 Youth activist Vidmantas Gulbinas was sentenced in the port city of Klaipeda to 3
 years of incarceration at a hard labor facility for "malignant hooliganism" in connec-
 tion with a series of attacks on non-ethnic Lithuanians between 1995 and 1997 and
 desecration of a Jewish cemetery in 1995. This was the first such conviction since
 Lithuanian independence was restored in 1990.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Minority ethnic groups-including Russians,
 Poles, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Tatars, and Karaites-make up roughly 20 percent
 of the country's citizens.
 Many nonethnic Lithuanian public sector employees were required to attain a
 functional knowledge of Lithuanian within several years, although the authorities
 have been granting liberal extensions of the time frame in which this competence
 is to be achieved. During the first 6 months of the year, 248 persons appied for
 citizenship, of whom 220 were granted citizenship upon passing a language test. Of
 1,650 persons who asked that their citizenship rights be restored in the first half
 of the year, citizenship was confirmed for 881 persons. There is no documented evi-
 dence of job dismissals based on the language law. The authorities have indicated
 that the intent of the law is to apply moral incentives to learn Lithuanian as the
 official language of the State; they have asserted that no one would be dismissed
 solely because of an inability to meet the language requirements.
 Vidmantas Gubinas's January conviction and sentence for "malicious hooliganism"
 resulted from several crimes, including assaulting a Japanese citizen in Vilnius's ca-
 thedral square in 1995; assaulting two ethnic Russians at a night club in Klaipeda
 in 1996; and pushing a Korean fisherman into the Dane river in Klaipeda in 1997.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the 1991 Law on Trade Unions
 recognize the right of workers and employees to form and join trade unions. The
 Law on Trade Unions formally extends this right to employees of the police and the
 armed forces, although the Collective Agreements Law of 1991 does not allow collec-
 tive bargaining by government employees involved in law enforcement and security
 related work. In 1990 the Lithuanian branch of the Soviet Union's All-Union Cen-
 tral Council of Trade Unions, including 23 of 25 trade unions, renamed itself the
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (CFTU) and began asserting increased inde-
 pendence from its Soviet parent. In 1993 the CFTU joined eight other unions that
 also had been part of the All-Union Central Council to form the Lithuanian Trade
 Union Center (LTUC).
 The Lithuanian Workers' Union (LWU) was formed in 1990 as an alternative to
 the CFTU. Unlike the CFTU/LTUC, the LWU was an early supporter of Lithuanian
 independence from the Soviet Union and actively sought Western free trade union
 contacts. The LWU claims a dues-paying membership of 78,000 organized in 35 re-
 gional groupings.
 The Law on Trade Unions and the Constitution provide for the right to strike,
 although public officials providing essential services may not do so. There were no
 major strikes during the year.
 There are no restrictions on unions affiliating with international trade unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Collective Agreements
 Law provides for collective bargaining and the right of unions to organize employ-
 ees, although several provisions reportedly hinder the establishment of new union
 organizations. According to the law, unions, in order to be registered, must have at
 least 30 founding members in large enterprises or have a membership of one-fifth
 of all employees in small enterprises. Difficulties commonly arise in state enter-
 prises in which employees are represented by more than one union. LWU officials
 charge that managers in some state enterprises discriminate against LWU organiz-
 ers and have on occasion dismissed employees in retribution for their trade union
 activities. The LWU also charges that the judicial system is slow to respond to LWU
 grievances regarding dismissals from work. LWU representatives claim that state
 managers sometimes prefer the CFTU/LTUC over LWU unions as collective bar-
 gaining partners.
 In general trade union spokesmen say that managers often determine wages with-
 out regard to trade union wishes, except in larger factories with well-organized
 trade unions. The Government issues periodic decrees that serve as guidelines for
 state enterprise management in setting wage scales. The LWU and the LTUC en-
 gage in direct collective bargaining over wages at the workplace level. Wage deci-
 
 
 1371
 sions increasingly are being made at the enterprise level, although government min-
 istries still retain some control over this sphere in state-owned enterprises. The
 LWU reports that it supplements its bargaining efforts with active lobbying in gov-
 ernment ministries that own enterprises. Since the second quarter ,of 1996, there
 has been a slowdown in the growth rate of consumer prices, while wage increases
 have picked up speed. Average wages grew by 12 percent while the inflation rate
 was 2.4 percent in 1998.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor by all, including children, and this prohibition is observed in
 practice. There are no reports that it occurred.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age for employment of children without parental consent is 16 years; with
 the written consent of parents, it is 14 years. Free trade union representatives as-
 sert that the mechanisms for monitoring minimum age legislation are rudimentary.
 Complaints about infringement of child labor regulations generally are referred to
 local prosecutors who investigate the charges and take legal action to stop viola-
 tions. Available evidence suggests that child labor is rare.
 The Constitution specifically prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and
 this prohibition is observed in practice (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage is $107.50 (430 litas)
 per month. The minimum wage does not provide a decent standard of living for a
 worker and family. The average wage in the public sector is $258 (1,032 litas) per
 month, compared with $215 (861 litas) in 1997. The Council of Ministers and the
 Ministry of Social Security periodically adjust the minimum wage. Every 3 months
 these government bodies must submit their minimum wage proposals to the Seimas,
 which has the right to approve or revise the minimum wage level. Enforcement of
 the minimum wage is almost nonexistent, in part because the Government does not
 want to exacerbate unemployment. The 40-hour workweek is standard, with a provi-
 sion for at least one 24-hour rest period. For a majority of the population, living
 standards remain low. The pdorest households spend 70 percent of their income on
 food, compared with 36 percent in wealthier households.
 The Constitution provides that workers have the right to safe and healthy work-
 ing conditions. In 1993 a Labor Safety Law went into effect, setting the rights of
 workers confronted with hazardous conditions and providing legal protection for
 workers who file complaints about such conditions. The State Labor Inspection Serv-
 ice, which the law established, is charged with implementing the Labor Safety Law.
 There are 10 regional labor inspection offices and 3 specialized inspection offices.
 The largest offices employ between 20 and 30 persons. They closed 262 enterprises
 or individual departments of enterprises found to be in violation of safety regula-
 tions during the year, compared with 91 closures for 1997. Unsafe conditions caused
 by worn, outdated industrial technologies are reportedly widespread, and 101 work-
 related deaths were recorded during the year, compared with 80 work-related
 deaths for 1997.
