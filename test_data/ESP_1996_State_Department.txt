 SPAIN
 Spain is a democracy with a constitutional monarch. The Parliament consists of
 two chambers, the Congress of Deputies and the Senate. As a result of elections in
 March, Jose Maria Aznar of the Popular Party became Prime Minister. The Govern-
 ment respects the constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary in practice.
 Spain has three levels of security forces. The National Police are responsible for
 nationwide investigations, security in urban areas, traffic control, and hostage res-
 cue. The Civil Guard polices rural areas and controls borders and highways. Autono-
 mous police forces have taken over many of the duties of the Civil Guard in Galicia,
 Catalonia, and the Basque Country. The security forces are under the effective con-
 trol of the Government. The security forces also maintain anticorruption units. An
 adviser for human rights in the Ministry of Justice is charged with promoting hu-
 manitarian law and training senior law enforcement groups in human rights prac-
 
 
 1127
 tices. An Ombudsman, called the "People's Defender" in the Constitution, serves as
 an independent advocate for citizen's rights. Some members of the security forces
 committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is market based, with primary reliance on private initiative, al-
 though a number of public-sector enterprises remain in key areas. The economy
 grew by 2.3 percent in 1996. The nominal unemployment rate dropped from the
 1994 high of 25 percent to 21.3 percent in July.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However
 there were problems in some areas, including police brutality, an inefficient judicial
 system, and investigations of past government wiretapping. Societal violence against
 women, discrimination against Roma, and incidents of racism and rightwig youth
 violence are also problems. The Government investigates allegations of human
 rights abuses by the security forces and punishes those found guilty of such abuses.
 Continued allegations surfaced of involvement by the previous Gonzalez Adminis-
 tration in the "Antiterrorist liberation Groups" (GAL), which were responsible for
 bombings, kidnapings, and extrajudicial killings during the mid 1980s. The Su-
 preme Court was sti investigating the GAL at year's end. There were accusations
 that the current Government, while clearly not involved in these incidents, was en-
 gaging in a deliberate cverup by declining to release classified documents that
 some lege contain evidence of the previous government's involvement in the GAL.
 The principal source of human rights abuses continued to be the protracted cam-
 paign of terrorism waged by the Basque Fatherland and Freedom (ETA) separatist
 group, which committed killings, kidnaping, and other abuses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government forces.
 Courts continue to investigate the "dirty war" against terrorism, during which the
 GAL allegedly assassinated approximately 28 people in the mid-1980's. Hearings
 began in 1995, and high-ranking officials continue to testify. Several cases are ex-
 pected to go to trial in early 1997.
 In January the Supreme Court indicted former Interior Minister Jose Barrionuevo
 and former Secretary of State for Security Rafael Vera on charges of kidnaping, mis-
 use of public funds, and association with an armed group in relation to the kidnap-
 of Segund Marey in 1983 and the "dirty war" against ETA. They were indicted
 on additional charges in March. In November the Supreme Court decided not to
 summon to testify in this case former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, former Vice
 President and Defense Minister Narcis Serra, or Basque socialist leader Jose Maria
 Benegas.
 In April a witness testified that in 1983 highly decorated Civil Guard General
 Enrique Galindo and former Guipuzcoa civil Governor Julen Elgorriaga entered the
 Palace de la Cumbre where they presumably interrogated two kidnaped men, Jose
 Ignacio Lasa and Jose Antonio Zabala. The bodies of Lasa and Zabala, which
 showed signs of torture, were identified in 1995. Two Civil Guardsmen involved in
 the killings were imprisoned in May, the first persons to be sentenced in the GAL
 investigations. Galindo was held in preventive custody for 72 days for his role in
 this case. Elgrriaga remains in preventive detention.
 In February the ex-head of operations of the National Intelligence Agency
 (CESID) provided new information about the 1983 assassination in the south of
 France of Roman Onsderra (also known as Kattu") by Civil Guardsman. In May
 Galindo and two generals were declared suspects in this case. Barrionuevo and Vera
 are expected to testify
 The case of the death of Mikel Zabaltza, a tram conductor who died while in police
 custody in 1985 after being taken from his home for alleged collaboration with ter-
 rorists, was reopened in November.
 Also pending in the GAL investigations is the case of Frenchman     Robert
 Caplanne, who was mistaken for an ETA member and murdered in 1985
 In September the Madrid daily El Mundo reported that CESID abducted a tramp
 and two drug addicts in July 1988 to test on them an anesthetic that CESIa in-
 tended to use for the kidnaping of ETA leader Juan Antonio Urreticoechea (also
 known as "Josu Ternera). El1Mundo claimed that the injection of the anesthetic led
 to the death of one of the beggars and that CESID agents had to dispose of the
 body. The Defense Minister at the time and the current Defense Minister both de-
 niedthe accusations; the investigation continued at year's end.
 There continued to be frequent terrorist incidents. As of October, 49 attacks at-
 tributed to ETA had resulted in 5 deaths and 43 serious injuries. The Attorney Gon-
 
 
 1128
 eral's report states that groups supporting ETA carried out 830 acts of sabotage, nu-
 merous disturbances, and attacks on persons, property, political parties, and secu-
 rity forces in 1995, a 300 percent increase from 1994. Actions by ETA and its affili-
 ate groups caused millions of dollars worth of damage throughout Spain. In Feb-
 ruary then-Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said that terrorist violence reached lev-
 els in 1995 unheard of since 1985-87.
 On February 6, Base Socialist parliamentary candidate Fernando Mugica
 Herzog was shot and killed by four ETA youths in San Sebastian. On February 14,
 the former Vice Chairman of the Constitutional Court was assassinated by three
 shots to the back of the head in his office at Madrid University where he served
 as a professor. On March 4, a car bomb killed the former head of the Basque police
 intelligence service, 1 day before his scheduled testimony in the trial of 15 alleged
 ETA members. On May 12, a bomb killed an army sergeant and narrowly missed
 a busload of soldiers in Cordoba. On July 26, Basque businessman Isidro Usaiaga
 was shot five times as he was retuning home from a party. Local officials say that
 he had refused to pay ETA's " revolutionary tsx.'
 On June 23, ETA announced a 1-week unilateral cease-fire. The Government said
 that the short cease-fire could not be taken seriously when ETA continued to hold
 kidnaped prison official Jose Antonio Lara (see Section 1.b.). ETA ended the cease-
 fire on July 1, and followed its announcement with an attack on a Civil Guard out-
 post in Navarra and the resumption of its annual summer campaign against se-
 lected tourist areas in the south of Spain. The campaign moved to Catalonia with
 a July 20 explosion at the Reus airport that injured 35 people.
 The Government took several steps to deal with the ETA problem. It increased
 its counterterrorism efforts, joined in the creation of a European police intelligence
 department, signing a Europe-wide extradition treaty, and sought tougher extra-
 dition rules from countries outside Europe where ETA terrorists reside. The Govern-
 meat offered the possibility of talks with ETA, provided that ETA renounced terror-
 ism and made fundamental political commitments. It also sought tougher legislation
 to control street violence by separatists supporters.
 French-Spanish cooperation led to the November arrest in Bordeaux of ETA's
 arms and explosives operative, Juan Maria Insausti Mugica (also known as
 "Karpov"); the November arrest in Bayona of ETA's chief of illegal commands, Juan
 Luis Agierre Lete (also known as "Patas" and "Isuntza); and the July arrest in Pau
 of ETA s number three leader, Julian Achurra Egurola (also known as "Pototo'). In
 November France also carried out the extradition pending since 1994 of ETA leader
 Rosario Pikahea Ugalde (also known as "Errota"), charged in Spain with two mur-
 ders. Two ETA members were also arrested in Brussels in January, and three more
 were detained in Venezuela in Ma
 In November the National High Court sentenced ETA member Henry Parot to
 1,170 years' imprisonment for the bomb attack on the Civil Guard Directorate Gen-
 eral.
 b. Disappearanc.-Since 1970 ETA has kidnaped 76 people; between then and
 year's en  it is estimated that ETA has obtained more than $33 million (4 billion
 pesets) from the kidna ings.
 ETA released Jose Par'a Aldaya Etieburua, a 54-ear-old Basque industrialist,
 on April 14, after holding him hostage for 341 days.  is was the longest kidnaping
 ever by ETA, during which time thousands of people participated in hundreds of
 demonstrations, urging Aldaya's release. The Ministry of the Interior estimates that
 ETA was able to acquire more than 100 million pesetas ($800,000) from various
 sources for the liberation of Aldaya.
 Jose Ortega Lara, a        at the prison of Logrono, was kidnaped on January
 17. Unlike other EA kidnapings, Ortega Lara's is widely viewed as an attempt by
 ETA to pressure the Government into ending the dispersion of more than 500 ETA
 prisoners in jails around Spain and concentrating them in prisons in the Basque
 count.eof December Orteg       a Lar a was still a captive.
 On Nover 28, ETA claimed responsibility for the November 12 kidnaping of
 Cosme Delclaux Zubriria, a 34-year-ovd Vizcaya lawyer whose family is heavily in-
 volved in Basque business and finance. Family members claim that they received
 a letter 2 years ago "advising' that they pay ETA'S "revolutionary tax,' which they
 said they did not do. Police also now believe a misspelling of the name "Delclaux'
 appearedon a list of ETA targets recovered in 1987 with the arrest of ETA member
 Santiago Arrspide Sarasola (also known as "Sani Potrs"). At year's end, Deiclaux
 was still a captive.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such acts. Spsin is a signatory to the U.N. Convention Against
 Torture and in 1995 approved 1rotocol 1 oft he Strasbourg European Convention for
 the Prevention of Torture and Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Penalties.
 
 
 1129
 Nonetheless, many detainees charged with terrorism assert that they have been
 abused during detention, and similar charges are sometimes made by other detain-
 ees. In March four policemen were charged with the rape and illegal detention of
 a Brazlian tourist.
 While the situation of ETA prisoners appears to be improving, individuals, non-
 governmental organizations(NGO's), and the media continue to accuse the Civil
 Guard of unprovoked brutality, particularly in the Basque region. According to the
 Spanish Association AgainstTorture (AAT), there were 267 accusations of torture
 in 1994 (latest figures available) involving 448 members of the security forces, of
 whom 128 were found guilty and sentenced, and 120 were found innocent. The re-
 maining cases are still being processed.
 The Madrid public prosecutor charged 14 Civil Guards of the Colmenar Viejo bar-
 racks near Madrid with torturing, injurng, anmying, and threatening 3 youths
 while they were detained in the barracks in October 1994. The three young men
 were arrested the day after a violent confrontation in a bar. The public prosecutor's
 report describes the injuries inflicted on the 3 detainees by the 14 Civil Guardsmen.
 The Civil Guard opened its own investigation into the case. The AAT filed a judicial
 complaint against 18 Civil Guardsmen in the case. The additional four are identified
 in the prosecutor's report as witnesses. The public prosecutor asked for penalties of
 between 4 months and 1 year in jail for the 14 it accused. The AAT asked for pen-
 alties of between 6 months and 6 years in jail for the 18 it accuses in the case.
 In December 1995 the National High Court in Madrid sentenced 11 people ac-
 cused of collaboration with ETA to 135 years' imprisonment. Some 50 persons had
 been arrested between January and May 1992, but the court ruled inadmissible a
 large number of the polie declarations because nearly all of the detainees made de-
 tailed allegations (often supported by medical evidene) of torture. The allegations
 of torture were under judiia examination at year's end.
 In March a judge suspended the trial of 10 Civil Guardsmen accused of the tor-
 ture in 1980 of 6 detained ETA members in the jal of La Salve in Bilbao.
 Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards, and the Gov-
 ernment permits visits by human rights mnitrs. In March the Government agreed
 to pubi   a medical report of a 1994 ad hoc visit by the European Committee for
 the Prevention of Torture, which recognized injuries compatible with eight 1994 de-
 tainees' allegations of mistreatment. The National High Court had originally re-
 jected complaints of mistreatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Ezile.he Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest detention, and exile, and the authorities respect this provision. A suspect nor-
 meally may not be held more than 72 hours without a hearing. The Penal Code per-
 mits holding a suspected terrorist an additional 2 days without a hearing or the pos-
 sibility of incommunicado detention for such persons, provided that a rec�uest is
 granted by a judge. Many requests for extensions and incommunicado detention con-
 tain only minimal necessary details, which alarms Amnesty International. The U.N.
 Committee Against Torture, in its 1993 examination, raised the issue of the oper-
 ation of "antiterroristf' legislation and expressed concern over incommunicado deten-
 tion and the suspension of procedural rights, such as the initial denial of selection
 of free legal counsel.
 The law on aliens permits detention of a person for up to 40 days prior to deporta-
 tion but specifies that it must not take place in a prison-like setting.
 In October two policemen were incarcerated for illegal detention of immigrants,
 extortion, drug trafficking, and robbery. Other policemen were also charged with il-
 legal detention (see Section 1.c.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the judiciary is independent in practice.
 The judicial structure consists of territorial, provincial, regional, and municipal
 courts with the Supreme Court at its apex. The Constitutional Court protects con-
 stitutional rights, but there is no clear distinction between its jurisdiction and that
 of the Supreme Court on some issues, nor is it clear which has ultimate authority.
 A National High Court handles cases involving crimes such as terrorism and drug
 trafficking. The European Court of Human Rights is the final arbiter in cases con-
 cerning human rights.
 Over the past 2 years, Spain has almost completely overhauled its judicial system,
 in an effort to rectify the shortage of judges and the severe backlog of cases.A nine-
 person jury system was established in November 1995, and the first cases were
 tried in 1996. The entire Penal Code was revised and enacted in May. Changes in-
 cluded the restructuring of the criminal justice system, introduction of modern of-
 fenses and white-collar crimes, an increase in the penalties for fraud offenses, a rise
 in the legal age at which an individual may be tried for a criminal offense from 16
 to 18 years of age, the establishment of other new offenses (including domestic vio-
 
 
 1130
 lence and sexual harrasment), and authorizing judges to fine individuals with ref-
 erence to their wealth. The new Code also allows judges more flexibility in sentenc-
 ing. It eliminates the longstanding tradition of granting credits toward early release
 for time served for good behavior. The maximum penalty for any one offense under
 the new code is 25 years, and the maximum time a person can continuously serve
 is 30 years, regardless of the cumulative total of sentences. Judges can now deport
 foreigners sentenced to 6 years or less. The 1882 Criminal Procedural Law was not
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair public trial, and the authorities
 respect this right in practice. Defendants have the right to be represented by an at-
 torney (at state expense for the indigent). They are released on bail unless the court
 has some reason to believe they may flee or be a threat to public safety. The law
 calls for an expditious judicial hearing following arrest. However, the Association
 of Victims of Terrorism and others have prtested delays in the judicial process. By
 law, suspects may not be confined for more than 2 years before beingbrught to
 trial, unless a further delay is authorized by a judge, who may extend pretrial cus-
 tody to 4 years.
 In practice pretrial custody is usually less than 1 ear, however, increasing criti-
 cism is heard in legal circles that some judges use Bpreventive custody as a form
 of anticipatory sentencing. In cases of petty crime, suspects released on bail some-
 times wait up to 5 years for trial. As of December, 25.8 percent of the prison popu-
 lation was in jail awaiting trial.
 Following conviction, defendants may appeal to the next higher court. Human
 rights groups such as the Association Against Torture and members of the press
 complain that many persons convicted of offenses constituting violations of human
 rights have avoided judicial sentencing by prolonging the appeals prcess and that
 sentences for persons convicted of such offenses are unduly light. According to Am-
 nesty International, custodial sentences of less than 1 year and 1 day are customar-
 ily not served by those convicted of such offenses.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interferene With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the privacy of the home and correspondence. Under the
 Criminal Code, government authorities must obtain court approval before searching
 private property, wiretapping, or interfering with private correspondence. The
 present antiterroriat law gives discretionary authority to the Minister of Interior to
 act prior to obtaining court approval in "cases of emergency."
 Investigation continues into allegations of wiretapping by the National Intel-
 ligence Agency (CESID) of private telephone conversations made by the King, var-
 ious ministers, and other prominent figures between 1980 and 1991. The Minister
 of Defense, the Vice President, and CESID's chief resigned in 1995, after related
 government dcuments were leaked to the press. The judge closed the case on Feb-
 ruary  however, on May 14 the provincial court revoked that action and ordered
 it    ed to et investigating.
 Terehas also been linked to the investigations of GAL crimes (see Section .a.).
 In February the judge in one GAL investi ation "found" lists of CESID documents
 relating to GAL in the prison cell of the ex-hirector of CES operations, which were
 subsequently leaked to the press. Based on the lists, the judge requested 18 official
 secret documents from the CESID in May, which allegedly contain information
 about GAL crimes. The Government declined to declassify these documents. The in-
 vestigating judges criticized the Government for impeding the judicial process by not
 declassifying the documents and stated that they would work with parliamentary
 representatives, public officials, and other judges to obtain the information.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Spech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. Opposition
 viewpoints, beth from political parties and nonpartisan organizations, are freely
 aired and widely reflected in the media.
 In July the dismissal of six top journalists from the stat-run television network
 ignited controversy over whether the firings were politically motivated or driven by
 cost concerns (as the station management claimed). Several foreign newspapers took
 up the cause of the discharged journalists (all of whom had been appointed under
 the previous government), charging that their firings represented a t at to  re-
 dom of the press. Other foreign newspapers and the majority of the Spanish press
 declared that the personnel changes were "normal" in any media organization un-
 dergoing a change of top management.
 Academic freedm is respected.
 
 
 1131
 
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.,
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Roman Catholicism is the predominant
 religion, and its institutions receive official funding. Protestant and Jewish leaders
 refused the Government's offer of financial support.
 The Government announced in June that it would make "religion" (or a similar
 class on "ethics') an obligatory class in public secondary educational institutions, re-
 verting to a longstanding practice. The Spanish confederation of parents of students
 and some opposition political parties opposed the idea. Consequently, the Govern-
 ment agreed to search for a baance between the desire of the Catholic Church that
 religion be taught and arents' constitutional right to choose the kind of education
 they want for their children. A final decision had not been reached by year's end.
 d.Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patrratio--Citizens are free to travel within and outside the country, to emigrate,
 and to repatriate. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. A recent asy-
 lum law (passed in 1994 and modified in February 1995) brought refugee and asy-
 lum cases together and gave full power to the Office of Asylum and Refugees (OAR)
 (a branch of the Ministry of the Interior) to adjudicate them but also mandates that
 cases can be referred to the UNHCR for appeal. Asylum requests can be made only
 at the point of entry, and applicants are detained until the case is resolved. Nega-
 tive rulings must be made within 72 hours, but the asylum seeker has an additional
 24 hours in which to make an appeal. No provisions are made for detainees to have
 access to translators or lawyers. Since 1994 the revised law has caused a major drop
 in the numbers of both requests for, and grants of, asylum. From January to June,
 only 110 of 1,638 applications for asylum were approved. An additional 98 humani-
 tarian asylum applications were approved.
 Spain is facing an unprecedented wave of illegal immigrants coming across the
 Strait of Gibraltar. More than 8,000 illegal igrants had been caught as of Octo-
 ber, the majority in Andalucia; authorities sat under "normal circumstances
 they intercept no more than 30 percent of those who enter Spain through that zone.
 In response, the Government is resorting to a mix of tighter border controls, liberal-
 ized treatment for those who have already established themselves in Spanish soci-
 ety, and increased international coordination. In July the Government sedated and
 forcibly repatriated 103 sub-Saharan Africans, one of whom later died during a vio-
 lent demonstration in Guinea-Bissau. The repatriation stirred protests from civil lib-
 ertarians and opposition political parties, as well as hunger strikes and demonstra-
 tions by the affected persons in Africa and Spain. The man who was killed in Guin-
 ea-Bissau was one of several who had applied for asylum, but whose applications
 never reached the proper authorities because of faults in police procedure; such de-
 portations violated Spanish law.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which all citizens 18 years
 of age and over have the rht to vote by secret ballot for Parliament and for provin-
 cial and local bodies. At alevels of government, elections are held at least every
 4 years. As a result of elections held in March, the People's Party (PP) received 38
 percent of the votes. Jose Maria Aznar became Prime Minister, and 14 years of So-
 cialist government came to a close. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) fol-
 lowed closely with 37.5 percent of the votes. The next highest number of votes re-
 ceived were the United Left (IU) with 10.6 percent, the Catalan Union and Conver-
 gence Party (CIU) with 4.6 percent, and the Basque National Party with 1.3 per-
 cent.
 Governmental power is shared between the central government and 17 regional
 "Autonomous Communities." Local nationalist parties give political expression to re-
 gional linguistic and cultural identities.
 Women are increasing their participation in the olitical process. The number of
 female candidates increased in the 1996 national elections, ut under the electoral
 system the percentage of votes won determines the number of candidates elected
 from the party list. Many women were placed in the lower half of the list, and as
 a consequence of the electoral system, the number of women elected has never
 reached 25 percent.
 Women hold 19 percent of parliamentary seats. The 350-member Chamber of Dep-
 uties has 72 female representatives (22 percent of the total), and the 256-member
 Senate has 27 (10.4 percent of the total). There are 1,529 mayors (6.5 percent of
 
 
 1132
 the total), and 224 women in regional parliaments (19 percent of the total). Of all
 judges, 30 percent are women (a profession that was closed to women before 1977),
 but no women hold Supreme Court positions. The Ministers of Justice, Agriculture,
 Education and Culture, and Environment are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of nongovernmental human rights groups, including the Human Rights
 Association of Spsin in Madrid and the Human Rights Institute of Catalonia in Bar-
 celona, operate freely without government interference. The Government cooperates
 readily with international organizations investigatin allegations of human rights
 abuses (such as the European Commission of Human Rights) and international non-
 governmental human rights groups, as well as with independent national groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens and provides for an Om-
 budsman, called the "People's Defender", who actively investigates complaints of
 human rights abuses by the authorities. The Ombudsman operates independently
 from any party or government ministry, must be elected every 5 years by a three-
 fifths majority of Congress, and is immune from prosecution. He has complete access
 to government institutions and documents not classified secret for national security
 reasons. The office of the people's defender received 13,214 complaints in 1995 and
 an estimated 22,000 complaints in 1996. While the majority of the complaints per-
 tained to education and social services, there were increases in complaints of racism
 and mistreatment by law enforcement agencies.
 Women.-Sexual abuse, violence, and the harassment of women in the workplace
 continued to be areas of concern. The Women's Institute in the Ministry of Labor
 and Social Affairs reports that 47 women were killed by their male partners and
 that 1,863 rapes were reported in 1995. Police received 16,000 calls concerning
 abuse in 1995, 3,400 from Madrid. However, experts believe that only 10 percent
 of violent acts against women each year are reported to authorities. Some women s
 NGO's estimate that about 600,000 to 800,000 cases of abuse occur each year.
 A 1989 law prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace, but very few cases have
 been brought to trial under this law.
 Several levels of government provide assistance to battered women. A toll-free hot
 line advises women where to go for government shelter or other aid if mistreated.
 There are 54 official centers for mistreated women. The Government also runs edu-
 cational programs seeking to change public attitudes that contribute to violence
 against women. The Women's Institute has charged that some judges are reluctant
 to get involved in cases of violence against women by members of their family. Simi-
 larly, in smaller towns some police officers have been reluctant to accept complaints
 from battered women. Recognizing the latter problem, the Ministry of the Interior
 initiated a program in 1986 that created special sections within the police depart-
 ment to deal with violence against women, staffed by trained female officers. In
 March the community of Madrid cut spending for women's organizations by 9 per-
 cent, paralyzing more than 1,000 women's programs until 1997.
 In recent years, women have moved towards equality under the law, and there
 are larger numbers of women in the educational system and work force. According
 to the organization Active Population, women received 58 percent of university de-
 grees in 1995. The Minister of Social Affairs in January claimed that women now
 inteleal, jour-
 constitute 43 percent of the work force. Women outnumber men in the leg, or
 nalistic, and health care professions, but still play minor roles in many fields.
 The law mandates equal pay for equal work. However, according to a report by
 the Economic and SocialCouncil in April, women's salaries still remain 27 percent
 lower than those of their male counterparts. The Council claims that women are
 more apt to have temporary ontracts and part-time empoment than men. The Na-
 tional Association of Rural Women and Families (ANFAR) claimed in 1995 that 80
 percent of rural women are not formally employed but instead aid their husbands
 in farmin or fishing. ANFAR said that these women lack titles to family enter-
 prises and do not receive the same social security benefits as the male head of
 household.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its commitment to children's welfare
 through well-funded and easily accessed programs of education and health care. The
 Constitution obligates both the State and parents to protect children, whether or not
 born in wedlock. The Ministries of Health and Social Affairs are responsible for the
 welfare of children and have created numerous programs to aid needy children. Nu-
 merous NGO's exist to further children's rights. For example, the school help pro-
 
 
 1133
 
 gram for the protection of children has a team of experts who work with educators
 to help them identify abused or abandoned children in the classroom.
 The 1995 Law of the Child gives legal rights of testimony to minors in child abuse
 cases; it also obliges all citizens to act on cases of suspected child abuse and, for
 the first time sets up rules regardin_ foreign adoptions. A 1987 signatory to the
 1961 Hague (onvention, Spain voted in 1995 to withdraw the reservations it held
 previously in regard to the protection of minors; the treaty's provisions now apply
 to all children in Spinl not just those who areS anish citizens.
 Under the new Penal Code children under te age of 18 are not considered re-
 sponsible for their actions and cannot be sent to prison. The seriousness of the vio-
 lent acts in the Basque country by separatist youths, however, has led to accelerated
 negotiations between the central Government and the Basque government for the
 punishment of youthful offenders under ag 18. Public debate centers on whether
 the age of responsibty should be set as low as 12 years. The Attorney General's
 reportinSepteer        igted a 300 percent increase in youth vandalism in the
 B asque county since 1994.
 A new penitentiary law passed this year lowered the age that a child can remain
 with an incarcerated mother from 6 to 3 years of age. It also provides a special unit
 for mothers with children, a kindergarten, psychological supprt, and ways for chil-
 dren to get out of prison regularly. Currently 169 children live in jails with their
 mothers under this law.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution obliges the State to provide for the
 adequate treatment and care of people with disabilities, ensuring that they are not
 deprived of basic rights that apply to all citizens. Since 1982, a law on the integra-
 tion of disabled citizens has been in effect, which aims to ensure fair access to public
 employment, prevent disability, and facilitate physical accessibility to public facili-
 ties and transportation. The national law serves as a guide for rgonal laws; how-
 ever, levels of assistance and acceasibility differ from region to region and have not
 iproved in mayres
 Te1996 PenalCode ontinues to allow parents or legal representatives of a men-
 tally disabled person to petition a judge to obtain permission for the sterilization
 at person. In 1994 the Constitutional Court held that sterlization of the men-
 taly infirm does not constitute a violation of the Constitution. In practice many
 courts have authorized such surgery. Religious groups continue to protest this rul-
 &Tational/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Roma, who make up 3 percent of the popu-
 lation, continue to suffer discrimination in housing, schools, and jobs. Since 1991 the
 Madrid city government, in cooperation with the autonomous regional government,
 has been carrying out a program to relocate squatters (the great majority of whom
 are Roma) to housing projects in the region. A University of Navarra estimate indi-
 cates that 12,000 squatters live in camps at the margins of Madrid, although the
 Madrid public works councilor states that there has never been a reliable census
 of squatters. The daily El Pais reported in March that 16 prefabricated houses exist
 around Madrid for the "Chabolistas," with 140 more houses planned. The city gov-
 ernment plans to relocate 449 of the 769 families of squatters in and around Madrid
 by 1998. Spain's largest Romani organization, Gypsy Presence, complains that the
 city has put up police checkpoints and fences that make Romani communities re-
 senmble prison  amps. Thegroup's omplaint that such relocation areas lack basic
 services is supported by NGO's and the press. The city government denies any anti-
 Romani bias in its actions. In May, 31 illegal families destroyed their "houses" so
 that they would not be ounted in the 1996 census and forced to relocate.
 Six of the 17 autonomous communities use a language or dialect other than
 Castillian Spanish. The Constitution stipulates that citizens have "the duty to
 know" Castilian which is the "official language of the state", but it adds that other
 languages can also be official under regional statutes and that the "different Ian-
 guage variations of Spain are a cultural heritage which shall * * * be protected."
 Catalonia has passed a law whereby Catalan is taught in regional schools and used
 at official regional functions. Suits regarding specific applications of this law are
 fending in various courts. Both Galicia and Valencia have laws stating the duty to
 promote" their regional languages in schools and at official functions.
 In 1995 Congress modified the Penal Code to make it a crime to "incite publicize,
 or otherwise promote the abuse or discrimination of people or groups because of
 race, ethnicity, nationality ideology, or religious beliefs." No cases have been tried
 under the modified Penal 6ode.
 Human rights groups and the media continued to give increasing attention to dis-
 crimination against the growing numbers of illegal immigrants from northern and
 sub-Saharan Africa (see Section 1.d.). According to the Youth Institute in the Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Affairs, 91 percent of persons under the age of 29 would

 like to see immigration further restricted. Although only 1.3 percent of the popu-
 lation is foreign born and the Government reduced the number of work permits is-
 sued to foreigners by 10 percent in 1995, 60 percent of the respondents under 29
 years old in a July Youth Institute survey said that the believed immigrants
 caused emploent problems for them. The association of Moroccan immigrant la-
 borers has offices in Madrid, Barcelona, and Seville to combat anti-Morocan racism,
 and Madrid has a special administrative office to deal with immigrant complaints.
 There may be a connection between opinions on immigration and the increasing
 number of rae-related incidents being reported. Quasi-organized rightwing youth
 goups (called "skinheads" by the press) ontinued to commit violent acts throughout
 the year, terrorizing minorities, and in some instances committing murder. Na-
 tional police estimate the total number of skinheads to be several thousand; how-
 ever, they say that the skinheads are not organized to plan specific actions. SOS
 Racismo, an NGO, said that race-related violence increased in 1995, due in part to
 the reduction in plice arrests and incarcerations of skinheads.
 In May skinheald Oscar Hernandz Bernal was tried in Barcelona for racist com-
 ments and defense of the expulsion of African immigrants in a newspaper interview
 in 1993. Other incidents includd an attack on a black immigrant by skinheads in
 Madrid which was stopped by the shouts of a 60-year-old woman, and the beating
 in Madrid of a Moroccan man by six akinheads who did not like the color of his skin.
 Skinheads and ultra-right groups also attacked young radical-left supporters
 Arabs, punks, homosexuals, and homeless persons. In April two skinheads received
 a 3-year sentence for publicly stating their opinion on television that killing trans-
 vestites did not constitute wrongdoing. In March five neo-Nazis were sentenced to
 a total of 12 years in jail for severely beating a youth for his leftist opinions. In
 September seven skinheads were detained for kidnaping, robbing, and beating a 22-
 year-old man in Barcelona. Perhaps the most widely publicized case was the murder
 of David Gonzalez in January, who was stabbed in the heart by Madrid skinheads.
 As a consequence, the President of the Madrid autonomous region, together with
 nine women and one man whose children had been brutally attacked (and in three
 cases, killed) by ultraright bands, launched an initiative in April to end the violence.
 In May three of nine accused persons were sentenced to 7 total years in jail for
 the murder of a Polish citizen outside Madrid in 1990. The other six were declared
 innocent.
 US. citizens regularly complain of discrimination and abuse by authorities and,
 more frequently, by ordinary citizens. Women and US. citizens of African and Latin
 American origin are those most frequently victimized.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except those in the military services,
 judges, ma   trates, and prosecutors, are entitled to form or join unions of their own
 choosing. Athat is required to organize a trade union is that more than two work-
 ers register with the Minister of Labor and Social Security. Spain has over 200 reg-
 istered trade unions and 1 not legally registered (because the Constitutional Court
 ruled that it was ineligible, since it represents military personnel).
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to choose their representatives, de-
 termine their policies, represent their members' interests, and strike. They are not
 restricted or harassed by the Government and are independent of political parties.
 A strike in nonessential services is legal if its sponsors give 5 days' notice. Any
 striking union must respect minimum service requirements negotiated with the re-
 spective employer. The right to strike has been interpreted by the Constitutional
 Court to include general strikes called to protest government policy. Strikes occur
 frequently, but most are brief. From January to April, there were 166,700 absent
 workers due to strikes a 70 percent drop from the same period in 1995. In the first
 3 months of 1996, the Labor Ministry reported that there were 277 strikes, in which
 86,900 workers participated, compared with strikes by 190,900 workers for the same
 period last year.
 The Government is reforming the labor and social security regime, particularly
 the pension system. On September 20, a preagreement on pension reform was
 signed between the Government and labor. Although trade unions have signed this
 agreement, they have not ruled out supporting the public employee confederations
 in protestin the government plan to save approximately $1.6 billion (200 billion
 pesetas) by freezing public employees' salaries through 1997. The trade unions have
 planned a number of actions i response to the salary freeze plan, including filing
 complaints with the International Labor Organization, lobbying Congress to protect
 employees' right to collective action, and holding demonstrations and strikes.
 Unions are free to form or join federations and affiliate with international bodies
 and do so without hindrance.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collctiely.-A 1980 statute undergirds the
 right to organize and bargain colectively. Trade union and collective bargaining
 right were extended in 1986 to all workers in the public sector, except military per-
 sonnel Public sector collective bargaining in 1990 was broadened to include salaries
 and employment levels, but the Government retained the right to set these if nego-
 tiations failed. Collective bargaining agreements are widespread in both the pub c
 and private sectors; in the latter they cover 60 percent of workers, notwithstanding
 that only about 15 percent of workers are actually union members.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against trade union members and
 organizers. Discrimination cases have priority in the labor courts. Legislation in
 1990 gave unions a role in controlling temporary work contracts to prevent abuse
 of these and of termination actions. Nonetheless, unions contend that employers dis-
 criminate in many cases by refusing to renew temporary contracts of workers engag-
 ing in union organizing. More than one-third of all employees are under temporary
 contracts, and the number is growing.
 Labor regulations and practices in free trade zones and export processing zones
 are the same as in the rest of the country. Union membership in these zones is re-
 portedly higher than the average throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is out-
 lawed and is not practiced. The legislation is effectively enforced:
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 the employment of children is 16 years. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security
 is primarily responsible for enforcement. The minimum age is effectively enforced
 in major industries and in the service sector. It is more difficult to control on small
 farms and in family-owned businesses. Legislation prohibiting child labor is effec-
 tively enforced in the special economic zones. The law also prohibits the employment
 of persons under the age of 18 at night, for overtime work, or in sectors considered
 hazardous.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for workers over 18
 years of age is considered sufficient for a decent standard of living. The daily na-
 tional minimum wage rate in 1996 was $18.03 (2,164 pesetas); for those 16 and 17
 years of age it was $13.95 (1674 pesetas). These rates are revised every year in line
 with the consumer price index and are effectively enforced by the Ministry of Labor
 and Social Security. The law sets a 40-hour workweek with an unbroken rest period
 of 36 hours after each 40 hours worked. Workers enjoy 12 paid holidays a year and
 a month's paid vacation.
 Government mechanisms exist for enforcing working conditions and occupational
 health and safety rules, but bureaucratic procedures are cumbersome and ineffi-
 cient. Safety and health legislation is being revised to conform to European Union
 (EU) directives. The Law to Prevent Labor Risks was passed in 1995 by-Parliament
 as the foundation for the completion of the rest of the EU directives. The National
 Institute of Safety and Health in the Ministry of Labor has technical responsibility
 for developing labor standards, but the Inspectorate of Labor has responsibility for
 enforcing the egislation through judicial action when infractions are found. Workers
 have legal protection for filing complaints about hazardous conditions.
