 LIBYA*
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya describes its
 form of government as 'popular democracy," but the country is
 essentially under the control of a military dictator, Col.
 Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi. The governing principles of the society
 are expressed in Qadhafi's 'Third Universal Theory"--the "Green
 Book"--rather than in the Constitution. The Libyans have
 created a government which they regard as being heavily based
 on Islamic teachings and which ostensibly emphasizes full
 participation of the people in the decisions which affect their
 daily lives through a system of people's committees. These
 committees not only operate local government and social
 institutions such as education, but also control virtually
 every local enterprise, including farming and manufacturing.
 They are influential in terms of local operations, but
 Qadhafi--though holding no formal government position--remains
 the single arbiter of all important issues in Libya.
 Like other petroleum-producing countries, Libya has benefitted
 from the high prices of recent years, with oil income reaching
 a high of $23 billion in 1980. This enhanced revenue was used
 to finance an active internal development program (new schools,
 hospitals, roads) and to acquire large quantities of weapons.
 In addition, Qadhafi has attempted to overthrow the governments
 of a number of other states and has supported a wide range of
 terrorist groups in virtually every area of the globe. Because
 of unrealistic oil pricing policies, Libyan revenues declined
 considerably in 1981 (to about $15 billion) and somewhat
 further (to $13 billion) in 1982. Significant parts of the
 1981-85 development plan were postponed in 1982 because of
 these financial problems, but weapons purchases and efforts to
 destabilize moderate neighbors did not decline appreciably.
 Qadhafi has admitted that financial problems have made it
 difficult for him to finance "liberation movements," and it
 appears that funds for a few extremist groups were stopped or
 reduced.
 Since 1969 the regime has prided itself on its *white' (or
 bloodless) revolution. However, the considerable change for
 the worse in Libya's human rights picture since 1980, including
 reports of marked increases in torture and abuse, appears to
 have continued in 1982. In speeches in October 1982, Qadhafi
 indicated he may be planning to resume the 1980-81 campaign of
 assassinations of Libyan exiles.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Reports persist of summary executions, as well as deaths by
 torture, of some of those arrested during 1982. For example,
 Middle East press sources report that 21 Libyan naval officers
 *After the attack on the US Embassy in Tripoli on December 2,
 1979, Embassy operations were suspended. On May 2, 1980 the
 Embassy was closed. Because of the absence of a United States
 Mission in Libya, this report draws heavily on unofficial
 sources.
 
 
 1205
 were executed in the first half of the year for alleged
 participation in a plot to assassinate Qadhafi. Other sources
 allege that, in another 1982 case, more than 30 military men
 were summarily executed after *discovery' of a false coup plot
 concocted by Qadhafi's security forces. Forty-three Chadian
 workers in Libya were reportedly executed for refusing to join
 a Libyan-organized expeditionary force to fight against the
 Government of Chad.
 The 1980-81 assassination campaign against Libyan exiles, a
 form of domestic persecution practiced abroad, followed an
 April 1980 address in which Qadhafi issued an ultimatum to his
 enemies abroad to return to Libya or be killed. Although the
 campaign was not resumed in 1982, Qadhafi made two speeches in
 early October 1982 in which he threatened to renew the
 killings. Some exiled dissidents received threatening
 communications from Libyan officials including, in some cases,
 letters from the General Revolutionary Committee in Tripoli
 revoking their citizenship and vowing to "liquidate them
 physically.- There are reports that a pro-Qadhafi group met in
 Europe in July 1982 to select assassination targets. These
 threats were taken very seriously among Libyan exiles in the
 US, Europe, and elsewhere and were, in themselves, a form of
 international terrorism.
 b. Disappearance
 There continue to be reports that Libyan businessmen, former
 government officials, religious oppositionists, and political
 activists have been taken into custody by the Government with
 no further information available as to their condition, their
 whereabouts, or the charges lodged against them. Referring to
 the problem of disappearances in Libya, Amnesty International
 has stated that detainees apparently have been held
 incommunicado for unlimited periods in centers belonging to the
 intelligence services.
 c. Torture
 During 1982, there were numerous reports of torture and
 mistreatment of prisoners. An exile group, the Libyan
 Committee for the Defense of Democracy and the Rights of Man
 reported that Benghazi law student Ahmed Isma'il Makhlouf died
 in July 1982 after being tortured for writing anti-regime
 slogans on the walls of university buildings. According to
 Amnesty International, Makhlouf and fellow student Najir
 Abuhawiya reportedly died under torture by the security
 services. The two students are said to have been arrested on
 April 7 after demonstrations at Benghazi university. Amnesty
 International wrote to Qadhafi on October 6, 1982 calling for
 an investigation into the two students' deaths. There has been
 no response from Qadhafi. At least two other persons--a
 university professor and a military man--reportedly also were
 tortured to death. The methods of torture most commonly
 reported to Amnesty International include electric shocks to
 the head and genitals and beatings on the soles of the feet.
 Much of the torture is alleged to have been inflicted by
 selected members of the revolutionary committees.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Detainees in criminal and security cases reportedly are
 frequently beaten during interrogation. In some prisons,
 conditions reportedly are tolerable but, according to
 information received by Amnesty International, conditions
 
 
 1206
 of detention for political prisoners have worsened, including
 transfer to overcrowded cells and confiscation of reading and
 writing materials. Various reports suggest that beatings and
 other forms of degrading treatment of prisoners of conscience
 are commonplace and that several are afflicted by deep
 depression. Amnesty International has expressed concern about
 the large number of offenses, including political offenses,
 which are punishable by death under Libyan law. For example,
 membership in an illegal operation was made a capital offense
 in 1975.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 According to Libyan law, detainees may be held incommunicado
 for unlimited periods. Many allegedly are held without charge
 or trial, apparently as an example to would-be opponents of the
 Qadhafi regime. Some are said to have been released quickly,
 but others reportedly were beaten.
 Libya declared several years ago that there were then *no
 political detainees on any charge in its prisons." Reports
 from a variety of sources, however, claim that Libyan prisons
 contain increased numbers of persons convicted of or held for
 political offenses. Qadhafi justified in a 1981 speech
 imprisonment on political, as opposed to criminal, charges:
 I ...those who are put into prisons are there because they are
 the enemies of the people and they fight for restoring the
 government above the people. There is no shame and there is
 nothing wrong in putting these persons in prisons or in
 treading on them with your feet."
 Amnesty International in 1979 estimated-the number of political
 prisoners to be 80. The 1980-81 arrest campaign certainly
 pushed that number far higher. More than 3,000 persons were
 reportedly arrested during that campaign, many of whom were
 later killed or released. There is information from various
 sources that, during much of 1982, some 300-500 suspected
 dissidents, mostly students, were in detention at any given
 time. These persons reportedly were taken into custody during
 several waves of arrests at universities throughout the year.
 Amnesty International has information, for example, that some
 200 professors and students, including Makhlouf and Abuhawiya,
 were arrested in April 1982 on orders of the Benghazi
 University Revolutionary Committee. Exile sources claim that
 about 30 women students at Benghazi University were detained
 and their heads shaved during the late spring for distributing
 pamphlets and writing anti-Qadhafi slogans on walls. According
 to these sources, the women were to have been put on trial,
 with the authorities seeking penalties from death to life
 imprisonment. Further, the Saudi press reported in June that
 117 army officers had been arrested in April for alleged
 anti-regime plotting in Benghazi.
 A number of persons arrested prior to 1982 continue to be held.
 For example, several alleged members of the pro-Iraq wing of
 the Baath Party, including attorneys, writers, instructors, and
 students reportedly still are held in Tripoli Central Prison
 despite acquittal. The men, arrested in February and March
 1980, were tried on the charge of membership in an illegal
 organization (since 1975, a capital offense), but reportedly
 were acquitted after the court received evidence that they
 confessed under torture.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The normal court structure in Libya has been by-passed to a
 signigicant extent by the 'people's courts.' This parallel
 
 
 1207
 legal system has far fewer safeguards, and the trials are
 frequently held in camera or in absentia. Over the years, the
 Libyan authorities have put considerable pressure on the Libyan
 legal profession. According to a new book by exile attorney
 'Imran Muhammad Buruways, Qadhafi personally threatened in 1977
 to execute the director and board of the Libyan Lawyers' Union
 if it did not issue a certain statement. The pressure
 culminated in a 1981 law prohibiting the private practice of
 law and making all attorneys employees of the Secretariat of
 Justice. The Union of Arab Lawyers, located in Cannes, France,
 has expressed concern for the ability and freedom of attorneys
 simultaneously to provide aggressive legal defense for
 political prisoners and to serve as government employees. The
 Libyan authorities have claimed that they "guarantee prisoners
 all necessary means of defense and safeguards of justice
 adequate to the principles contained in the declaration of
 human rights.* They claim the accused may contact their
 lawyers and families "as soon as possible with respect to the
 exigencies of interrogation.'
 In routine civil or criminal cases, these government claims
 appear to reflect accurately the prevailing situation.
 However, in security cases, there are many reports of
 prisoners' being held incommunicado and without trial for long
 periods. While undergoing interrogation--sometimes for periods
 of several months--they are given no access to legal
 representation. Alleged political offenses seem increasingly
 to be tried before ad hoc Orevolutionary courts' rather than
 through the normal judiciary procedure, with the defense
 severely restricted.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The legal stipulation that judicial warrants must first be
 obtained before entering a private home is reportedly often
 disregarded.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Col. Qadhafi's Government continues to restrict severely basic
 civil and political freedoms. Internal security became even
 more strict during the latter half of 1982 as a result of
 Qadhafi's increasing insecurity. The media are owned and
 controlled by the Government, with the official news agency
 JANA the conduit for politically acceptable opinions. Domestic
 and international telephone calls are routinely tapped. Token
 criticism of the Government is permitted during people's
 committee meetings and at the annual General People's
 Congress. However, most Libyans are circumspect about uttering
 dissident views toward the regime's policies. One resident
 told a Western reporter that Tripoli'is a 'frightened city.
 People are not only frightened to come to foreigners' homes,
 they are frightened of each other.'  (Alan Cowell, "New York
 Times,O September 14, 1982).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of association is granted only to those institutions
 affiliated with the apparatus of the regime. Attempts at
 public assembly, as noted above, are repressed if they are not
 government-controlled and supportive of regime positions.
 Organizations such as trade unions and professional
 associations are viewed by Qadhafi as threats, and he vowed not
 to "accept intermediaries between the revolution and its
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 77
 
 
 1208
 working forces.' The previous trade union system has been
 changed considerably. New unions, organized under government
 control, are also run through the popular committee system.
 Collective bargaining no longer occurs. The intimidation of
 the Libyan Lawyers' Union is illustrative of the regime's view
 of independent professional associations. There have been no
 reports of strikes for some time; presumably they are not
 permitted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim.  Services are permitted in
 some Christian churches. There is a Catholic bishop resident
 in Libya, and the small number of priests and nuns there are
 reportedly permitted to wear their habits. The once-powerful
 Sanusiyya Islamic religious organization was virtually banned
 by Qadhafi after the revolution as part of his efforts to
 eliminate rival power bases. Restrictions were placed on the
 operation of the organization's Zawaayaa (lodges), a government
 supervisor was appointed for Sanusi properties, and the
 Sanusi-sponsored Islamic University was merged with the
 University of Libya. Nearly %11 of Libya's formerly large
 Jewish community has emigrated. No information is available on
 the status of any Jews who may remain in Libya; however,
 virulently anti-Jewish broadcasts on Libyan radio were the
 apparent cause of anti-Jewish violence in 1982 in portions of
 Tunisia within broadcasting range.
 It is not known what became of 15 persons reportedly arrested
 in a Tripoli mosque in late 1980. Amnesty International
 received information that five of these, including a mosque
 official, may have been executed in 1981. The mosque remained
 closed as of the beginning of 1982. Amnesty International's
 requests to the Libyan Justice Secretary for information on
 this case have gone unanswered. Some 200 members of the Moslem
 Brotherhood and another extremist religious group are said to
 have been detained during the first half of 1981, but no
 further information has been developed on this case.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 With the exception of security areas, freedom of movement
 within the country is unrestricted for Libyan citizens. An
 exit permit is required for travel abroad. Military
 conscription regulations have led to some restrictions on the
 issuance of exit permits to potential inductees. It is
 reportedly increasingly difficult for Libyan nationals
 suspected of inadequate revolutionary zeal to travel abroad.
 For example, during 1982 the authorities reportedly withdrew
 the passports of some persons suspected of intending to have
 contacts with Libyan exiles. Information concerning current
 Libyan policy with regard to emigration or voluntary
 repatriation is unavailable. Wives may not leave the country
 without their husband's permission; children may not travel
 without their father's consent.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Major decisions in Libya are made by Qadhafi himself, as are
 all appointments of military officers and official
 functionaries down to a low level. Power flows down from
 Qadhafi, who surrounds himself with an increasingly small
 circle of associates whose own authority is a reflection of
 their proximity to him.
 
 
 1209
 Officially, Libya describes itself as the world's only
 Jamahiriya, or "Republic of the Masses.' Major changes in the
 organization of the Libyan state occurred in 1977. These
 changes were intended by Qadhafi to replace subnational
 leaders, chosen on traditional and cultural bases, with leaders
 selected by and presumably loyal to Qadhafi. The changes
 centered on the establishment of the General People's Congress
 and the appointment of the General People's Committee and a
 series of subordinate popular committees. Although political
 parties have been outlawed, many people have some involvement
 in the system through the local committees. Efforts have been
 made to recruit women and members of the Berber minority in
 this local political structure.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 An Amnesty International mission went to Libya in early 1980.
 Following the mission, Amnesty International issued a
 memorandum "setting forth its concerns to the authorities in
 which it called upon the Libyan authorities to put an end to
 'physical liquidation' and to implement fully the provisions of
 the international instruments guaranteeing human rights which
 they had ratified.' The Libyan authorities have failed to
 respond to written requests from Amnesty International for
 information on specific cases. Freedom House, in its 1982
 report, classifies Libya as "Not Free."
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 A tightened world oil market and Libyan price cuts caused sales
 and revenues to rebound somewhat in the second half of 1982.
 The current account remained in deficit, however, which led to
 food shortages, since most food is imported. Thus, the 1982
 development plan was officially scaled back and there were
 persistent reports that outlays and projects under the 1981-85
 plan had been frozen. Libya's substantial oil wealth has
 allowed the Government over the years to make real improvements
 in the people's material standards, despite the curtailment of
 freedoms. Per capita GNP rose from $5,560 (1971) to $8,639
 (1980). Investment in health facilities and a marked growth in
 female literacy over the past decade contributed to the
 increase in life expectancy at birth to 56.5 years (1980) from
 the earlier 51.9 (1971). The infant mortality rate was 53 per
 1,000 live births in 1981. Population, estimated at 3,200,000,
 has been growing at 4.1 percent per year. Between 1971 and
 1979 the percentage of the population with access to safe water
 increased from 58 to 100, and the percentage of calorie supply
 available for consumption relative to nutritional requirements
 increased from 105 to 126.
 The considerable investment in education has increased the
 number of elementary students from 270,000 (1969) to
 600,000(1982), according to official Libyan figures. The
 addition of all other students brings that total number to
 nearly one million, say these same sources. Certainly the
 literacy rate has increased beyond the 50.1 percent recorded in
 1973. Mitigating against such progress at the university level
 were the limits on freedom of speech and militarization of the
 campuses, with its reduction of classroom time.
