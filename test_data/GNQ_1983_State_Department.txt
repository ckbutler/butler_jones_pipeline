 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Although the 1982 Constitution proclaims that Equatorial Guinea
 is a democratic, unitary, and republican state, it is in fact
 ruled by its President, Teodoro Obiang Nguema basogo, who is
 constrained only by the necessity to operate within a consensus
 of top government and tribal leaders. The Council of Ministers,
 appointed by the President, has law-making authority. A 1982
 referendum ratified the Constitution and the President's term of
 offices over 90 percent of the population voted in favor of the
 ratification. Eowever, the electorate was provided only an
 opportunity to vote yes or no on the Constitution, which Obiang
 then interpreted as a mandate to rule for seven more years. The
 state security apparatus is charged with reducing corruption
 and monitoring of possible internal dissidents, as well as of
 the opposition in exile.
 Multicandidate elections, controlled by the Government at the
 candidate-selection stage, resulted in the inauguration of a
 National Assembly in November 1983. Electors, who were chosen
 by individual villages, after government approval, selected candi-
 dates for the election. Under the Constitution, the Assembly's
 powers, though real, subordinate it to the much greater powers
 of the. presidency.
 Equatorial Guinea's economic and managerial base was destroyed
 during the 11-year rule of the brutal Macias regime, overthrown
 in 1979. Its institutions are new, beset with economic and social
 problems, and lacking the support of an established democratic
 tradition. Despite four years of foreign economic assistance
 and the gradual revival of a functioning bureaucracy, the economy
 has not recovered from the devastation of the Macias era and re-
 mains at the subsistence level. For the most part, the right of
 private property is respected, and individuals are free to pursue
 private initiatives, although only a few have the financial re-
 sources to do so.
 Two events in 1983 had major relevance for human rights practices
 in Equatorial Guineas  the formation of a National Assembly,
 mentioned above, and the trial of 33 Guineans accused of attempt-
 ing to overthrow the Government. Sentences given to the convicted
 were severe; two of the three ringleaders were executed. The
 trial did not incorporate all concepts of due process, but the
 Government made some attempt to observe international norms of
 fairness at the trial. Equatorial Guinea also suffers from the
 absence of an independent press and from isolated arbitrary acts
 committed by some government officials. In general, dealings
 between citizens and their government have been characterized in
 the last several years by a somewhat Improved climate for human
 rights.
 .RBSPBCT FOR HUNAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Three persons were sentenced to death for conspiring to overthrow
 the Government and assassinate the President. Two were executed,
 and one is still in custody. Defense counsel argued that, while
 the charge of conspiracy to overthrow the Government may have
 been proven, the intent to assassinate the President had not.
 Therefore, they claimed that under the law the three principal
 conspirators should not have received death sentences. There were
 no reports of other killings by government authorities during
 1983.

 b. Disappearance
 No information has been received that secret arrests and
 detentions occur in Equatorial Guinea. Arrests without warrants
 take place, but those arrested are formally charged or released
 at the police station.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been unconfirmed reports that torture or cruel
 treatment was used to extract some of the confessions given at
 the conspiracy trial. Interrogation of suspected criminals is
 reported to be intensive and lengthy, and may well include rough
 treatment. In particular, persons who have offended officials
 by their personal actions have at  time received beatings or
 rough treatment. This practice is officially condemned, and
 some officials have been seriously reprimanded.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Incidents of arbitrary arrest continue to decline. When they
 occur, it is usually on the order of low-level or mid-level
 officials, whose orders are countermanded in a day or two when
 their actions are discovered by their superiors. There have
 been no instances of people being jailed for the expression of
 dissident views. Habeas corpus is recognized by the Cohstitution
 and may be invoked by those Guineans well educated enough and in
 a position to hire a lawyer or have one as a friend. The
 ordinary Guinean, when arrested, relies upon representations to
 police officials made on his behalf by his family, which are
 often effective, even though taking place outside a formal legal
 framework.
 The Government in the main cities of Bats and Malabo continues
 to round up "vagrants' and put them to work for varying periods,
 with the sanction of law, but without the benefits of due process
 to each person arrested. Gainfully employed people who are not
 carrying their identity documents may also be forced to join
 work gangs for several days before they obtain their release.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There have been no reports of trials denied to accused persons,
 except in the case of vagrants. Trials are speedy. The current
 court system is a combination of traditional, civil, and military
 justice which often operates in an ad hoc manner for lack of
 established procedures and experienced judicial personnel. Major
 trials which have been attended by foreign observers have been
 conducted impartially, although often lacking on subtle but im-
 portant legal points. The Ministry of Justice continues to work
 on structuring the judiciary and establishing a legal system.
 The independence of the judiciary has not been violated, with
 respect to those cases interesting enough or important enough to
 have had public scrutiny. However, the independence of the judi-
 ciary has not been put to the test, as its normal function has
 not yet brought it into conflict with the Government. As a
 result of the conspiracy trial, there may be as many as 50 or
 60 political prisoners in Equatorial Guinea, all of whom were
 convicted in Guinean courts of conspiring to overthrow the
 Government. It is not clear whether the 24 sentenced for
 plotting in 1981 are still in custody, or whether some may
 have benefitted from various amnesties over the past year.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no reports of arbitrary interference with
 privacy, family, home, or correspondence. It is doubtful
 that search warrants are used, as provided for in the
 Constitution. Accused are arraigned after arrest.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government owns and operates the radio and television
 stations as well as the press in Equatorial Guinea. No one
 has proposed to open an independent station or newspaper;
 few Guineans have the capital or interest to do so and it is
 doubtful if independent media could be economically viable
 given the present state of the economy and limited audiences.
 The officially controlled media do not criticize the Govern-
 ment. Direct criticism of the Government is not heard in
 speeches made in public fora but is frequently heard in pri-
 vate conversation, as more and more Guineans are recovering
 from the traumatic experience of repression under the Macias
 regime and venturing to speak freely. For example, the
 vital issue of whether to enter a Central African economic
 union was discussed freely in private by a significant portion
 of the population.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government does not prohibit private associations, and one
 official is currently forming a club to discuss legal and social
 issues. Other non-political groups such as professional associa-
 tions and sports groups exist. Sensing undeclared government
 opposition, however, no Guinean has yet attempted to establish a
 political association in Equatorial Guinea, nor has anyone at-
 tempted to form a labor union. Given the country's minuscule
 industrial and disorganized agricultural sector, little scope
 for labor union activity exists except perhaps in the civil
 service.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is freedom of religion in Equatorial Guinea. No
 religion is favored, but the Catholic religion is dominant by
 virtue of the number of Catholics in the country. Religious
 publishing is permitted. Missionaries of several faiths are
 active and have government permission for their activities.
 Proselytization is permitted, and there does not appear to be
 any discrimination against persons on the basis of their
 faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 . Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no known restrictions on Equatorial Guineans with
 respect to travel within the country. Travel abroad is
 limited by the shortage of foreign exchange. There also are
 often delays in the issuance of exit visas but those delays
 do not appear to be politically motivated. Few Guineans
 currently seek refuge outside the country, but a large number
 of exiles who have been in Spain since the days of Macias
 continue to reside there. Many of them criticize the Govern-
 ment as undemocratic and tribally based, but others remain in
 Spain for economic reasons. The Government has repeatedly
 
 
 114
 proclaimed the freedom of all Guineans to return and promises
 they need not fear persecution, but it has made clear that it
 would expect those returning not to engage in political acti-
 vities outside the currently legally sanctioned system. There
 are no foreign refugees known to have sought asylum in
 Equatorial Guinea.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea was confirmed
 in office in October 1982, following a plebiscite which ratified
 the new Constitution in August 1982. This plebiscite did not
 expressly permit a vote for President, but rather only approval
 or disapproval of the Constitution itself, which established a
 seven-year term of office for the President, who is to be
 elected by a majority of votes cast and can run for re-election.
 President Obiang interpreted the constitutional referendum as a
 mandate to rule for seven years, and consequently will not face
 elections until 1989. The law does not indicate what the ground
 rules of that election will be. The President is the central
 political figure, is pre-eminent in the political decision
 making process in Equatorial Guinea, and is constrained only by
 the need to obtain the views of other leading government and
 tribal leaders on important issues.
 Village and town councils were recently chosen through
 multicandidate elections after the candidates themselves were
 approved by government officials. Recently a National Assembly
 was chosen in three stages, through a process which began with
 government-sanctioned electors being chosen in multicandidate
 elections at the first stage. In the second stage, the members
 of the electoral college, in a secret ballot, chose assembly dele-
 gates from among their own members. In addition to these 45
 elected members, the National Assembly also has 15 members appoint-
 ed by the President, some of whom represent minority groups who
 were too small to have their own representatives chosen by the
 electoral college. The National Assembly was officially sworn
 in on October 11, 1983, and will have limited powers to approve
 the budget and laws proposed by the Council of Ministers. None-
 theless, the new Constitution provides that primary law-writing
 power remains in the Council of Ministers, and the Assembly
 clearly has a secondary role. While the Constitution provides
 for members of the Assembly to freely voice dissenting views,
 the Assembly's role in formulating policies which differ from
 those approved by the Council of Ministers remains to be seen.
 There are some indications that the Assembly is to decide whether
 to permit political parties to form and under what rules, but it
 has not yet taken up this sensitive issue.
 No open opposition groups exist within the country. The police
 and military are often used to help organize pro-government.
 demonstrations. While the 1982 plebiscite was, for the most
 part, conducted by secret ballot, and did return an overwhelming
 majority for the new Constitution, it permitted no opposing.
 views nor, as noted above, did it explicitly elect President
 Obiang. Nonetheless, the favorable vote on the referendum
 did indicate that after the repressive years under Macias,
 the population does support a more open political system.
 Another issue has been the problem of relative sharing of
 power between the principal ethnic groups. The Pang tribe,
 which comprises more than 70 percent of the population, domi-
 nates the Government, but some Fang subtribal groups maintain
 that they are underrepresented in the population. Similarly,
 
 
 115
 the Subi tribe, which comprises a small percentage of the
 total population, but has historically been the majority on
 the island of Bioko where Malabo is located, also claims to
 be discriminated against. In this case, the Prime Minister
 is a Bubi, other Bubis occupy important posts, and the
 National Assembly elections returned a proportionate number
 of Bubi delegates; nonetheless, the Bubis do not have any
 effective political power within the inner councils of the
 Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 From 1979 to the present the Government has cooperated with
 the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) with
 respect to the restoration of civil and political liberties.
 Two constitutional experts recruited by the U.N. Secretary-General
 reviewed and provided the Government with advice with respect
 to the new Constitution.
 Foreign observers from many Western and other embassies
 attended the trial of the coup conspirators in early July
 1983. A Spanish consular officer was given access to visit
 in prison one of the principal coup plotters who had been
 surrendered to the authorities after having sought asylum in
 the Spanish Embassy. Their families have also been able
 to visit those arrested.
 Freedom House rates Equatorial Guinea "not free", stating
 that the rule of law is tenuous, and that there are political
 prisoners, but perhaps none of conscience. Amnesty Inter-
 national did not report on Equatorial Guinea in 1983.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The economy of Equatorial Guinea still has not recovered
 from the devastation and anarchy of 11 years under the
 Macias regime. Government institutions have been rebuilt,
 the bureacracy recreated, schools reopened, and scores of
 development projects initiated. However, cacao production,
 which is the mainstay of the economy, has only partially
 recovered, and the country remains not far above the
 subsistence level, without foreign exchange resources for
 the import of many needed items.
 Health services have improved, most of the population has
 been immunized, and minimal food requirements are met with
 the help of foreign aid. The following World Bank data give
 some idea of the state of economic and social development.
 The 1983 population is given as 268,000 (preliminary census
 data indicate 360,000 as probably a more accurate figure),
 with a population growth rate of 2.5 percent in 1983.  Life
 expectancy at birth is 47.06 years (1980), and the infant
 mortality rate is 136.20 per 1,000 live births (1983). Primary
 school enrollment (1975) was 89 percent of males, 72 percent
 of females or 81 percent of all children. The latest 1983
 estimate is 60 percent of all children. Per capita gross
 national product is about $175. The adult literacy rate is
 about 60 percent. No statistics are available for daily
 calorie supply or percent of the population below the abso-
 lute poverty level. Most Guineans live at the subsistence
 level, although the bureaucracy and the educated people
 living in the towns have a standard of living similar to
 
 
 116
 some other Third World countries. Other than traditional
 root and fruit crops, the food supply is severely limited.
 Nutrition has improved over the past year as a result of an
 increase of fish supplies on the market. Nevertheless, a
 very substantial portion of the population still suffers
 from malnutrition.
 Most salaried employment is with the Government, and minority
 groups complain that they are discriminated against in govern-
 ment employment. It is hard for outside observers to evaluate
 these claims but probably fair to assume that the type of
 discrimination prevalent in the top levels of government in the
 allocation of politically sensitive positions carries over into
 the lower bureaucracy. While substantial numbers of people from
 all tribes and sub-tribes are employed at all levels of the
 government, certain Fang sub-groups, Bubi, and Rio Muni coastal
 tribes may be underrepresented.
 Both sexes, just as all ethnic groups, are equal under the
 law. However, social tradition works to keep most women
 engaged in agricultural pursuits and domestic work. While
 only a slightly larger number of males than females begin
 primary education, five times as many males as females enter
 secondary school, and eight times as many graduate at the pre-
 university level. Those females who persist in seeking a
 career are able to do so, and women hold important jobs in
 the health sector and other socially oriented ministries.
