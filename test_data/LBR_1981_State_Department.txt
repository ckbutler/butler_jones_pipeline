 LIBERIA
 Founded in 1822 by blacks who were seeking the fundamental
 liberties then denied them in the United States, Liberia,
 the oldest republic in Africa, retains strong cultural and
 political ties to the United States. On April 12, 1980,
 a small group of military enlisted men killed President
 William R. Tolbert, Jr. and took control of the government
 as the People's Redemption Council (PRC). Supreme executive
 and legislative authority is vested in the PRC. The council
 is headed by its chairman, Head of State Samuel K. Doe.
 At the time of the coup, wealth, arable land, and political
 power were concentrated in the hands of a narrow though
 expanding elite. In sharp contrast to that elite, the
 majority of the population was living at the subsistence
 level. Even in the modern sector of the economy, wages
 could not support the spiralling demands of urban living.
 Real GNP had scarcely grown under the Tolbert regime
 (though for reasons largely outside the government's
 control). There had been no significant new investment
 in Liberia since 19731 in fact there had been some dis-
 investment. Development was uncoordinated, with much of
 the upcountry area isolated from modern social services.
 In the aggregate, developments in Liberia during 1981
 reflected an improvement over conditions, policies, and
 practices encountered at the time of the 1980 coup and its
 immediate aftermath. Among the more promising developments
 were the release of several hundred political detainees;
 increased emphasis on governmental programs in agriculture,
 health, and education to improve the living standards of
 all Liberians; appointment of a national constitutional
 commission which has begun working on a revision of the
 Liberian constitution as a prelude to a return to demo-
 cratic rule by 1985; and replacement of some of the persons
 responsible for the excesses during the days immediately
 following the revolution. The Liberians who left the
 country after the coup have started to return, and those
 who have returned have been free from persecution.
 However, 1981 also saw several alleged coup attempts, two
 of which ended in closed trials and the execution of 18
 accused coup plotters.
 The country is under a martial law regime with a 1:00 a.m.
 to 6:00 a.m. curfew. All civil and political rights
 remain suspended. Civilian cabinet ministers were given
 military commissions and rank in July 1981, but new cabinet
 ministers appointed since that time have not been obliged
 to join the military. There is still some harassment of
 the business community, and occasional efforts, so far
 unsuccessful, are made to intimidate the press. Economic
 opportunities have in the past benefitted only a small
 segment of the population, but the PRC government has
 pledged to open. opportunities for a wider spectrum of the
 population.

 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture.
 There is currently no legal prohibition against torture.
 However, there have been no reports of torture within
 the past year.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 During the final months of the Tolbert regime, political
 detainees were severely maltreated. Flogging, physical
 abuse, and humiliation were condoned treatments for prisoners.
 In the first weeks after the April 12 revolution, many
 political detainees were beaten, paraded half-naked, and
 humiliated. Thirteen high government officials under the
 Tolbert regime were executed. While there were occasional
 reports until mid-1981 that detainees were being beaten,
 active efforts have since been made to eliminate these
 practices. A senior member of the ruling PRC was detained
 for having a civilian flogged, and the minister of justice
 was dismissed and briefly jailed for having the director of
 the national security agency beaten. Because of the efforts
 of former Tolbert detainees now in high government positions,
 prison conditions in Monrovia are reported to have improved
 somewhat over conditions during the Tolbert regime. Over-
 crowding, deplorable sanitary conditions, and restrictions
 on visitation rights are still common. The one prison
 visited by American officials during 1981 is the People's
 Correctional Institute at Zwedru. The facility is less than
 one-sixth occupied, spotlessly clean, with more than adequate
 sanitary facilities.
 There have been several instances of government or military
 interference with businesses and their managers, but these
 have decreased in recent months. The government has actively
 discouraged, through numerous public statements by the head
 of state and other high officials, harassment of the civilian
 population. In recent months the PRC has held meetings with
 foreign businessmen and diplomats to discuss means of ending
 interference with their work. Head of State Doe announced
 further measures to end harassment in a December 1981. speech
 to the nation, warning that military personnel who threatened
 civilians would be dismissed and/or imprisoned.
 The death penalty may be imposed on persons convicted of
 murder or treason. Persons convicted in connection with two
 countercoup plots were executed during 1981.
 c. Disappearances
 While it is often difficult to obtain information on exactly
 who is being detained and the location of such detention,
 there is no government policy which results in Liberians
 being secretly abducted. Head of State Doe announced in
 December 1981 that A. B. Tolbert, son of the late president,
 and Varney Dempster, former director of police, were missing
 after being removed from their detention cells and were
 presumed dead. Both were detained after the April 1980 coup.
 
 
 141
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Following the coup, the new government arrested about
 three hundred people, mostly former government and military
 officials, and some critics of the government were later
 arrested. All were released by the end of 1981. The inci-
 dence of improper arrests is believed to have declined
 markedly in 1981. The government does not publish a list of
 detained persons. Habeas corpus has been suspended.
 Persons detained for political purposes can be detained
 indefinitely. Two persons formerly detained by the PRC
 government have since been appointed cabinet ministers.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Due process is normally followed in the special tribunals
 established by the PRC's Decree No. 3 of April 24, 1980,
 and in normal civil and criminal matters. Appeals may be
 made to the people's supreme tribunal, and the head of state
 has the power to grant clemency or to commute sentences.
 Three trials involving persons accused of plotting coups
 during the last eighteen months were held before special
 military tribunals (most of the accused were soldiers) and
 were closed to the public. Persons convicted in the first
 trial were released in September 1981 after serving part of
 their ten year sentences. Eighteen of the twenty persons
 convicted in the other coup plot trials were executed; the
 other two received prison sentences, but were released in
 December 1981.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms have been more or less observed in Liberia
 during the past decade. At present, with the suspension of
 the constitution, civil and political rights are governed
 through executive and PRC decrees. Liberians enjoy most
 of the rights they had before the coup but without legal
 safeguards. News media feel fairly free to criticize the
 government. From time to time media representatives have
 been asked to explain their stories, and staff members of
 an independent newspaper were detained on two occasions
 for periods ranging up to ten days. In September 1981,
 the minister of information directed that all government
 press releases and announcements be cleared in advance
 through the ministry of information. In doing so, the
 minister emphasized that the government had no intention
 of interfering with normal activities of the media and
 asserted that press freedom in Liberia would be upheld
 at all times.
 PRC Decree Number 12 denied workers the right to strike.
 The government has, however, lifted the longstanding ban
 on the organization of agricultural workers by industrial
 unions, a legal prohibition that had drawn International
 Labor Organization condemnation for a number of years.
 There have been several strikes. No action was taken
 against participants in a mid-September teacher's strike,
 although they were threatened with dismissal. On the
 
 
 142
 other hand, 209 employees of the Liberian American Swedish
 Minerals Company (LAMCO) were dismissed after a two-day
 wildcat strike in late September.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 With the advent of military rule, frequent roadblocks and
 a curfew were established. While the roadblocks have been
 terminated, the curfew still exists in a reduced form
 (1:00 a.m. - 6:00 a.m.). At various times there have
 been restrictions on foreign travel. Everyone is required
 to have an exit visa as well as a passport. Exit visas
 are subject to elaborate red tape, and often have been
 difficult to obtain. In recent months this situation
 has eased and recently it was announced that all former
 political detainees could travel, provided they could show
 that they had paid all of their bills.
 A significant number of Liberians have left the country
 since the April 12 coup. Many women and children were
 sent abroad to safehavens. Some have returned in the past
 year and one was made a deputy minister in the government.
 The head of state and other senior officials have made
 numerous statements encouraging exiles to return.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 On coming to power, the PRC prohibited political activities.
 The government has repeated on several occasions its
 intention to return the nation to civilian rule, and on
 December 24, 1980, Head of State Doe announced the govern-
 ment would appoint a national commission to draft a new
 constitution. This commission was constituted on April 12,
 1981 under the chairmanship of Dr. Amos Sawyer, a University
 of Liberia dean and former professor of political science.
 Terms of reference have been determined and immunities
 granted in connection with the work of the commission.
 Papers on constitutional issues are being prepared.
 Liberians have been urged to forward their views to the
 commission. Hearings on aspects of the constitution began
 in late 1981, prior to the preparation of a new constitution.
 On December 23, 1981, Head of State Doe announced that the
 PRC would return the country to civilian rule on April 12,
 1985, the fifth anniversary of the coup.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 An official of the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) visited Monrovia in 1980. He was received by the
 government of Liberia, but there was no request for Committee
 assistance.
 According to the Amnesty International 1981 report, the
 government of Liberia has been in contact with Amnesty
 International regarding human rights practices, but has
 not yet responded to its recommendations or agreed to an
 Amnesty International mission to Liberia.
 
 
 143
 As a general rule the government did not respond to specific
 requests for information on particular political prisoners,
 beyond giving the usual assurances that they were all
 right. Following the release of all political prisoners in
 December 1981, the government acknowledged that detainees
 A. B. Tolbert and Varney Dempster were missing and presumed
 dead, and that two other detainees had died of natural causes.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Liberia has a mixed economy with government participation
 in such public service corporations as the Liberian Electri-
 city Corporation and other public utilities. Most other
 businesses are in private hands, with foreign investors
 owning the iron ore and rubber firms that account for nearly
 all of Liberia's export earnings.
 Liberia is classified by the World Bank as a middle income
 country. Per capita gross national product was estimated in
 1979 at $500, a significant increase from the $260 estimated
 in 1970. The per capita share of the gross domestic product
 in manufacturing is 8 per cent, excluding ore and rubber
 processing facilities. Income distribution is greatly skewed,
 with 50 percent of total household income claimed by the top
 5 percent of families and the remaining 95 percent of house-
 holds sharing the other 50 percent. About 70 percent of the
 population is employed in subsistence agriculture.
 The new government is committed to fulfilling basic human
 needs such as food, shelter, health care, employment, and
 education, and has made a concerted effort to insure a
 sufficient supply of rice (the main staple) in the country.
 Of highest priority is a housing project for soldiers, many
 of whom now live in makeshift shanties. Health care facil-
 ities, i.ncluding staff living quarters and child day care
 centers, are being improved. Life expectancy at birth
 increased from 41.0 to 48.3 in the decade from 1968-1978.
 The infant mortality rate in 1970 (the last year for which
 statistics are available)-was 148 per 1,000 live births.
 Liberia faces serious financial problems which will limit
 the government's ability to provide more services to the
 people. These problems stem from the worldwide depression
 in markets for Liberia's main exports, iron ore and rubber,
 and from capital flight and loss of business confidence
 which occurred after the coup, in part attributable to
 harassment of businesses by military personnel. Corruption
 continues to exist in Liberia, but there is an anti-
 corruption campaign, under which arrests and convictions
 are being made against those who have misappropriated funds.
 Inflation has averaged about 15 percent while the real
 rate of growth has averaged only 1.5 percent annually for
 the last decade. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
 approved a two-year standby agreement with the government
 in September 1980; by meeting the IMF's targets during this
 period, the government became eligible to borrow Special
 Drawing Rights (SDR) 65 million, of which SDR 32 million was
 drawn in the first year. In June 1981 this was converted to
 a one year program and increased to SDR 55 million over the
 one year. Even with this assistance the government's budget
 
 
 144
 will be very limited in the foreseeable future, but it has
 allocated about one-third of the 1980-81 budget to social
 services. This provides about $80 million for recurrent
 costs and about $40 million for the development of new
 social programs. Access to vital needs has been limited
 in Liberia by the relative isolation of the bulk of the
 population, as 1.3 million of the total population of 1.8
 million live in rural areas. It is estimated that 20 percent
 of the population has access to safe water, (64 percent of
 the urban population and only 6 percent of rural dwellers).
 According to the most recent estimates, average Liberian
 consumption of calories stands at 104 percent of nutritional
 requirements.
 More than half the urban population is in the Monrovia area.
 The rural population is scattered in isolated communities.
 Many of these do not have access roads, which limits their
 ability to participate adequately in development or receive
 social services. The population growth rate is 3.3 percent
 annually. Free and universal education remains one of the
 highest development priorities of the PRC government; this
 would cost a minimum of $25 million per year. At present
 an estimated 35 percent of the population has access to
 education and health services. The literacy rate is approx-
 imately 30 per cent.
 The right to own property is restricted to Liberian citizens.
 Citizenship is limited to persons who are of black ancestry.
 There are no additional formal restrictions on the right to
 own or transfer real property. Since the revolution,
 however, 34 individuals or families have had their real and
 personal property (except for homestead rights) confiscated
 due to alleged involvement in corruption or for failure to
 return to Liberia. At least one of these families has had
 its property returned after family members returned to
 Liberia in 1981.
 The majority of the population probably continues to live at
 the survival level. Some 23 percent of all urban residents
 are below the absolute poverty level. This compares to the
 39.7 percent average for Africa south of the Sahara. Economic
 opportunities have in the past been concentrated in a few
 hands but the government has pledged to open opportunities
 for a wider spectrum of the population.
