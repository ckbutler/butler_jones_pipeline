 AFGHANISTAN*
 Afghanistan in 1996 continued to experience civil war and political instability, al-
 though more of the country was free of fighting and violence than in past years.
 There was no central government. At year's end, the Pashtun-dominated ultra-con-
 servative Islamic movement known as the Taliban had captured the capital of Kabul
 and expanded its control to over two-thirds of the ountry. General Abdul Rashid
 Dostam, an ethnic Uzbek, controlled several north-central provinces. After the loss
 of Kabul, former President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his military commander,
 Ahmed Shah Masood, controlled only three northeastern provinces. Rabbani and
 Dostam formed an alliance to check the growing power of the Taliban.
 Taliban forces took Kabul on September 26-27 after Masood's forces retreated
 northward. The Taliban gained some gund north of Kabul, but were pushed back
 by the combined forces of Masood and Dostam. The year ended in a military stale-
 mate. Despite intensive efforts, United Nations Special Envoy Norbert Holl did not
 secure a cease-fire agreement but made some progress towards getting the factions
 to begin political talks. The fighting forced thousands of Afghans to flee their homes
 in Kabul, areas north of Kabul, and in the northwestern and eastern parts of the
 country.
 There is no constitution, rule of law, or independent judiciary. Former President
 Rabbani, relocated to Takhar in the north, claimed that he remained the head of
 the Government of Afghanistan. His delegation retained Afghanistans U.N. seat
 after the U.N. General Assembly deferred a decision on Afghanistan's credentials.
 The Taliban, led by Mullah Mohammed Omar, formed a six-member ruling council
 in Kabul which ruled by edict. Ultimate authority for Taliban rule rested in the
 Taliban's inner Shura (Council), located in the southern city of Kandahar, and in
 Mullah Omar. In Taliban areas, order was established by disarming the local com-
 manders and the populace and by instituting stiff punishments for crimes. Several
 provincial administrations maintained limited functions. Civil institutions were
 mostly nonexistent. General Dostam has established some administration in the 5-
 6 north-central provinces under his control, including customs collection at border
 points, but law and order in these areas is enforced by local commanders. The eth-
 nic Tajik-majority areas of the northeast were controlled by Masood's commanders
 and his political organization.
 Agriculture, including high levels of opium poppy cultivation, remained the main-
 stay of the economy. Afghanistan has become the second largest opium producer in
 the world. Lack of resources and the war have impeded reconstruction of irrigation
 systems, repair of market roads, and replanting of orchards in some areas. The pres-
 ence of an estimated 10 million land mines has restricted areas for cultivation and
 slowed the return of refugees who are needed to rebuild the economy. The laying
 of new mine fields, primarily by pro-Rabbani forces but also by General Dostam's
 forces, exacerbated an already d cult situation. Trade was mainly in fruits, min-
 erals, and gems, as well as goods smuggled to Pakistan. Formal economic activity
 remained minimal and was inhibited by recurrent fighting and roads blocked by
 local commanders. These blockages were removed in territory taken by the Taliban.
 Reconstruction was continuing in Herat, Kandahar, and Jalalabad, although efforts
 in the latter city were slowed by renewed hostilities in the fall. Reconstruction in
 some northern areas, including Balkh province, reportedly continues.
 Serious human rights violations continued to occur and citizens were precluded
 from changing their government peacefully. Political killings, torture, rape, arbi-
 trary detention, looting, abductions and kidnapings for ransom were committed by
 armed units, local commanders, and rogue individuals. Prison conditions were poor.
 *The American Embassy in Kabul has been closed for security reasons since January, 1989.
 Information on the human rights situation is therefore limited.

 Various factions infringed on citizens' privacy rights. Summary justice was common.
 The Taliban instituted Islamic courts and enforced their interpretation of appro-
 priate Islamic punishments, such as public executions and amputations of one hand
 and one foot for theft. For minor infractions, Taliban militiamen often decided right
 or wrong and meted out punishments such as beatings on the spot. Both Taliban
 and anti-Taliban forces were responsible for the indiscriminate bombardment of ci-
 vilian areas, particularly Kabul. Taliban forces rocketed and shelled Kabul when it
 was held by Rabbani, killing hundreds of civilians. After Kabul fell, Dostam and
 Masood's forces also bombed the city, but caused many fewer casualties. Civil war
 conditions and the unfettered actions of competing factions effectively limited the
 freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement. There was
 widespread discrimination against women and girls, and the condition of women
 and girls in Kabul and Herat after the Taliban captured these cities was signifi-
 cantly worse than in 1995. The Taliban prohibited women from working outside the
 home except in the health care field. Girls were prohibited from attending school.
 However, the imposition of Taliban control in rural areas resulted in reduced inci-
 dents of rape, kidnaping, and forced marriage. Worker rights were not defined.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KIlling.-A number of personal and politi-
 cally-motivated killings reportedly took place during the chaos when the Taliban
 took Jalalabad in mid-September. For example, a group of commanders and mem-
 bers of the Nangarhar Council were ambushed and killed near the border town of
 Torkham. The attack was presumed to be retaliation for a Council-sanctioned killing
 of the assailant's brother several years earlier. When the Taliban captured Kabul
 in late September, one of their first acts was to invade the U.N. compound, seize
 former President Najibullah and his brother, and summarily execute them.
 Najibullah was head of the secret police during the Soviet occupation and President
 of Afghanistan from 1986-92. The corpses were hung in the street for 2 days follow-
 ing the executions. According to Amnesty International, at least 30 men were taken
 from Herat prison in July and executed by Taliban authorities. In October there
 were unconfirmed reports that 20 civilians were executed by Taliban forces north
 of Kabul as the Taliban forces withdrew under pressure from Masood's forces. There
 were also reports of atrocities against civilians by Dstam's forces.
 Commander Rasul Palawan, a prominent northern leader, was killed in June,
 reportedly by one of his bodyguards who then was killed by the other bodynards.
 Dostam, who many thought ordered the killing, denied involvement and established
 a commission of inquiry into the slaying. The assassin's family reportedly had had
 land and political disputes with Palawan. Since Pahlawan's slaying, intrafactional
 fighting within Dostam's political organization reportedly has resulted in some
 deaths.
 In other areas, combatants sought to kill rival commanders and their sympathiz-
 ers. The perpetrators of these killings and their motives were difficult to identify,
 as political motives are often entwined with family and tribal feuds, battles over the
 drug trade, and personal vendettas. In March fighting broke out in Baghan near
 the town of Pul-i-Khum ei aftr Ismaili forces reportedly ambushed and killed a
 Hezb-i-Islami commander loyal to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and some of his men.
 The Taliban used swift summary trials and implemented strict punishments ac-
 cording to Islamic law; the Taliban ordered public executions and death by stoning
 (see Sections 1.c. and i.e.)
 b. Disappearance.-Abductions, kidnapings, or hostage-taking for ransom or politi-
 cal reasons occurred in non-Taliban areas, but specific information was lacking. An
 unconfirmed report claimed that in July, political associates of Ahmed Shah Masood
 kidnaped six individuals in Takhar who were accused of being political opponents
 of Masood and held them for ransom. The strict security enforced by the Taliban
 in areas under their control has resulted in a decrease in such cries.
 There were unconfrmed reports of girls and young women being kidnaped by
 local commanders in the southeast, Jalalabad, Kabul, and other areas before these
 areas came under Taliban control. Some of the women were then forced to marry
 their kidnapers. Others simply remained missing. To avoid this situation, some fam-
 ilies sent their daughters to Pakistan. There were also reports that women had been
 killed by their male relatives to prevent forced marriages (see Section 5).
 Groups in Russia listed nearly 300 former Soviet soldiers who had served in Af-
 ghanistan as missing in action or prisoners of war. Most were thought to be dead
 or to have voluntarily assimilated into Afghan society. Some allege l coninued to
 be held against their will by their Afghan captors. A number of persons from
 
 
 1409
 Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakstan remain missing from the period of the Soviet occu-
 pation and are presumed dead. Their remains have not been found.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Afghanistan is in a state of civil war and torture is used against opponents and pris-
 oners of war (POW's), though specific information is generally lacking. Torture does
 not appear to be a routine practice in most areas. Some of Masood s commanders
 in the north reportedly used torture routinely to extract information from and break
 the will of prisoners and political opponents; some of the victims were said to have
 been tortured to death. Local authorities maintain prisons in territories under their
 control and established torture cells in some of them. The Taliban freed many pris-
 oners as they took control of new areas, but also incarcerated new prisoners. The
 Taliban operate prisons in Kandahar, Herat, Kabul, and Jalalabad. There are also
 prisons in the north in Mazar-i-Sharif and Faizabad, Badakhshan province. Accord-
 ing to Amnesty International (AI), some Taliban prisoners have been forced to labor
 in life-threatening conditions such as digging trenches in mined areas, though these
 reports are unconfirmed.
 The Taliban ruled strictly in areas they controlled, establishing ad hoc and rudi-
 mentary judicial systems. Taliban courts imposed their interpretation of Islamic
 laws and punishments following swift summary trials. Murderers were subjected to
 public executions (see Section l.a.) and thieves had a limb or two (one hand, one
 foot) severed. Adulterers were stoned to death. In July a couple was convicted of
 adulteiy by a Taliban court. The couple was reportedly stoned to death in a public
 p lae in Kandahar. In August a man was hanged from a crane for murder and left
 dangling for 20 minutes. The body was reportedly taken to the hospital before bur-
 ial. However, the hospital staff discovered that the man was still alive. The Taliban
 reportedly pardoned the man who is now venerated.
 Prson conditions are poor. Prisoners are given no food. Normally, this is the re-
 sponsibility of prisoners' relatives who are allowed to visit to provide them with food
 once or twice a week. Those who have no relatives have to petition the local council
 or rely on other inmates. Prisoners live in collective cells. The U.N. Special
 Rapporteur for Human Rights in Afghanistan visited prisoners in Mazar-I-Sharif
 and Kandahar in July. Local authorities allowed the ICRC to visit detainees
 throughout the country.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-With the absence of formal legal and law
 enforcement institutions, justice was not administered according to formal legal
 codes. Judicial and police procedures varied from locality to locality. Little is known
 about the procedures for taking persons into custody and bringing them to justice.
 In both Taliban and non-Taliban areas, the practices varied depending on the local-
 ity, the local commanders, and other authorities. Some areas have more of a judicial
 structure than others. A seven-member Russian air crew, detained by the Taliban
 in Kandahar since August 1995, managed to escape in August. While performing
 maintenance on their downed aircraft at the airport, the crewmen overpowered their
 guards and took off in their plane to freedom.
 Between January and June, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 visited over 2,000 detainees in 38 places of detention. Following the Taliban's cap-
 ture of Kabul in September, the ICRC confirmed that all the detainees it had pre-
 viously visited in the capital had been released. There were unconfirmed reports
 that the Taliban had freed prisoners in the southeast and the east as they captured
 these areas in August and September. In early October, the ICRC began visits to
 detainees newly-arrested by the Taliban in Kabul and Jalalabad.
 In October Al claimed that the Taliban had detained up to 1,000 civilians during
 house to house searches in the initial days after the fall of Kabul. The families
 feared that the prisoners were sent to clear mine fields for the Taliban in the
 Panjshir valley. This report was not confirmed. AI reported other cases of individ-
 uals detained by the Taliban because of their ethnic origin, suspected sympathy
 with Taliban opponents, or opposition to Taliban religious decrees. Political detain-
 ees are probably held by all factions but no firm numbers are available. Perhaps
 as many as 1,000 soldiers are held by opposing groups as POW's. In November the
 ICRC reported that 600 former RabbanifMasood soldiers were held by the Taliban.
 Masood reportedly holds several hundred Taliban soldiers as POWs.
 The authorities are not known to use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-With no functioning nationwide judicial system,
 many municipal and provincial authorities relied on some form of Shari'a (Islamic)
 law and traditional tribal codes of justice.
 Little is known about the administration of justice in the areas controlled by
 Dostam and Rabbani/Masood in the northern provinces. The administration and im-
 plementation of justice could vary from area to area and depend on the whims of
 Iocal commanders or other authorities, who could summarily execute, torture, and
 
 
 1410
 
 mete out punishments without reference to any other authority. In Rabbani/Masood-
 controlled Badakhshan province, one commander used a scaffold outside his head-
 quarters to hang several individuals convicted of serious crimes by local Islamic
 courts. In March three alleged criminals were hanged in public in Kabul, then under
 Rabbani's control.
 The Taliban established Islamic courts in areas under their control to judge crmi-
 nal cases and resolve disputes. These courts meted out punishments to dozens of
 prisoners, including execution and amputation. These courts are said to have heard
 cases in sessions that lasted only a few minutes. Reportedly one such court in
 Kandahar usually consisted of four judges who gathered in a room or courtyard.
 Both the witnesses and the accused were brought before the judges to recount testi-
 mony and plead their cases. Prisoners were often brought forward in shackles. The
 court reportedly dealt with all complaints, relying on Islamic law and punishments
 as well as traditional tribal customs (see Section 1.c.). In cases involving murder,
 convicted prisoners were generally ordered executed by relatives of the victim (see
 Section l.a.), who could choose to accept other restitution. Decisions of the courts
 were reportedly final.
 In January, according to press reports, a man was executed in Logar province for
 murdering a neighbor during a dispute. Local Taliban authorities arrested and tried
 the man, who was executed by a firing squad led by the victim's brother after the
 victim's family refused to forgive the man or accept money as compensation. Also
 in January, a man in Herat, also controlled by the Taliban, was executed by hang-
 ing at a local sports arena, reportedly for murder.
 In February according to press reports, a Taliban court in Khost tried and con-
 victed two men of murder in separate crimes. After rejecting any offer of money as
 compensation, the victims' male relatives carried out the sentence with a Kalash-
 nikov rifle. The convicted men were blindfolded with hands and feet tied, placed one
 at a time in front of a large tree in a public area, and executed.
 In July the Taliban allegedly executed without trial 30 to50 pro-Rabbani troops
 or supporters captured by the Taliban in Herat and Ghor provinces. In the western
 province of Nimruz, three men were publicly hanged in August by the Taliban after
 having been found guilty of planting landmines. In November, according to press re-
 ports, two men were executed in Kandahar by order of an Islamic court for sexually
 assaulting and murdering a boy and a girl. In December, a man convicted of killing
 a woman and children by Rabbani's courts in Kabul and who escaped from prison
 in the confusion following the Taliban takeover, was recaptured by the Taliban. A
 Taliban Islamic court affirmed the earlier conviction and allowed the husband of the
 murdered woman to forgive the murderer or kill the murderer himself. He chose the
 latter and shot the murderer to death in Kabul stadium.
 Shi'a Islamic legal norms are reportedly imposed in the Hazarajat in central Af-
 ghanistan. According to the October report of the U.N. Special Rapporteur for
 Human Rights in Afghanistan (see Section 4), the Shi'a Unity Party (Hezb-i-
 Wahdat) in Bamian province has established a Judicial Committee. The Committee
 has a prosecutor's office composed of three branches for political, military, and social
 offenders. There were also courts of the first and the final instance.
 All factions probably hold political prisoners but no firm estimates of numbers are
 available.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-
 Intrafactional fighting often resulted in the homes and businesses of civilians being
 invaded and looted by the opposing forces-whether victor or loser. Armed gunmen
 acted with impunity given the absence of any legal protection from the law or a re-
 sponsive olice force. In Kabul and Jalalabad prior to the Taliban takeover, armed
 individuals reportedly forced their way into homes without fear of reprisal. It was
 unclear what authority controlled the actions of Taliban militiamen who patrolled
 the streets of cities and towns, and several incidents were reported of Taliban sol-
 diers entering private homes without prior notification or informed consent in
 Kabul, Herat, Kandahar, and elsewhere. In Kabul the soldiers allegedly searched
 homes for evidence of cooperation with the former authorities. Individuals were
 beaten on the streets by the Taliban for what were deemed infractions of Taliban
 rules. However, following a written order in December by Mullah Omar to Taliban
 followers warning against beating citizens, the practice diminished.
 According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), approximately
 300 single men were registered in October who claimed to be fleeing forced conscrip-
 tion by the Taiiban. There were unconfirmed reports that after the takeover of
 Kabul, the Taliban rounded up young men to be soldiers and Panshiri Tajiks were
 seized in Kabul and taken to undisclosed locations.
 The Taliban and Dostam's political organizations infringed on women's freedom
 of expression by requiring strict Islamic garb in public (see Section 5).
 
 
 1411
 
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The Taliban killed approximately 325 civilians in Kabul in 1996 by indis-
 criminately firing rockets into the city. Approximately 675 civilians in Kabul were
 injured during the year because of the civil war. The Taliban reportedly conducted
 aerial bombing raids in October around Kalakan, approximately 12 miles north of
 Kabul and caused the deaths of 16 to 20 civilians, including women and children.
 According to press reports, in October Taliban units destroyed 120 houses in the
 Tajik-dominated village of Sar Cheshma, five miles north of Kabul. From October
 to December, Dostam's and Masood's forces engaged in sporadic bombing and rocket
 attacks against Kabul. Several persons, including children, were killed and injured
 in separate attacks.
 At the beginning of the year, the UNHCR reported that there were approximately
 150,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps near Jalalabad and as many
 as 200,000 living independently in and around Jalalabad city. Between 25,000 and
 27,000 IP's were reported to be living in camps in the north in Pul-i-Khumri
 Mazar-i-Sharif, Shibergan, and Hairatan. In November thousands of persons fled
 fighting in the northwest province of Badghiz. Twelve hundred of these IDP's passed
 through UNHCR camps in the -erat area, and 700 remained in camps as of late
 December Some 6,000 to 7,000 had headed north into Turkmenistan, but many of
 those had returned. The UNH   said that 15,000 Afghans, mostly from Kabul, had
 crossed into Pakistan since October and that 600 to 700 were arriving daily. From
 October to December, UNHCR estimated that about 40,000 Afghans fled to Pakistan
 due to the intensified civil war.
 The Afghan countryside remains plagued by an estimated 10 million land mines
 sown dun and since the Soviet occupation. With funding from international do-
 nors, the United Nations has organized and trained mine detection and clearance
 teams, which operated throughout Afghanistan. Nevertheless, the mines are ex-
 pected to pose a threat for years to come. The laying of new mine fields by Masood
 forces around Kabul and Sarbi, a strategic city southeast of Kabul, posed new dan-
 gers. U.N. agencies and other nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) have insti-
 tuted a number of mine awareness campaigns and educational programs for women
 and children in various parts of the country, but many were curtailed as a result
 of Taliban restrictions on women and girls.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Ther are no laws effectively providing for free-
 dom of speech and the press, and the Kabul authorities under a bani for the first
 9 months of the year lacked the authority to protect these rights. Senior officials
 of various warring factions allegedly attempted to intimidate reporters and influence
 their reporting. The Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) is an unaffiliated reporting service.
 The few newspapers, ail of which were published only sporadically, were largely af-
 fiiated with different factions. There was a pro-Rabbani radio andtelevision service
 in Kabul until it came under Talihan contrl and was renamed the Voice of Shariat.
 The various regions had their own radio and television stations: Dostam had his
 ow   n the northern city of Mazar-I-Sharif and Hekmatyar had his own near Kabul
 until they were taken over by the Taliban. Herat's media came under Taiban con-
 trl when they captured the city in September 1995.
 International journalists in Kabul reported that they were routinely pressured by
 the Rabbani regime to slant their coverage. The Taliban by and large cooperated
 with the international press who arrived in Kabul in September and took few steps
 to curb their access. However, a female Western journalist was not allowed to at-
 tend the Taliban's frst press conference in Kabul. In another incident, one com-
 mander discouraged Taliban officials from responding to questions posed by Western
 female journalists. One female correspondent reported that she and her camera
 crew were jostled by Taliban soldiers while fiming in Kabul. There were several in-
 cidents in which photographers' film was seized after taking pictures of women. In
 October two Argentine journalists were reportedly detained or 4ours and beaten
 by Taliban militia after they attempted to interview two Afghan women in Kabul.
 At times Western journalists were prevented from traveling to the front lines, al-
 though many succeeded in doing so on other occasions. Despite some incidents most
 journalists, including women, were able to do their jobs. In November the Taliban
 imposed a rale requring journalists to stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul
 (allegedly for security and economic reasons). Journalists also reported at year's end
 that the Taliban were attempting to control who could act as drivers and inter-
 preters for urnalists.
 The   Taliban imposed its interpretation of Islam  on popular culture, banning
 music, movies, and television. Cinemas in Kabul had already been closed by authori-
 ties in June before the Taliban takeover.
 
 
 1412
 The Taliban severely restricts academic freedom, particularly education for girls
 (see Section 5).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Civil war, tenuous security,
 and likely opposition from local authorities seriously inhibited freedom of assembly
 and association. Nonetheless, Afghans demonstrated in several cities. There were
 credible reports of women demonstrating in Herat against Taliban strictures, of per-
 sons encouraged by the Taliban to demonstrate in Kabul and Kandahar against Ira-
 nian interference, and of demonstrations in Mazar-i-Sharif against the Taliban. In
 one demonstration in Herat, Taliban adherents reportedly beat the female dem-
 onstrators.
 There were reports of Taliban harassment of international aid agencies and
 NGOs. In the fall, the Taliban detained Afghan staffers of UNHCR, broke into the
 office and home of one international staffer, and confiscated vehicles. Other NGO
 staffers, mostly Afghan, were also detained. Some female Afghan staffers were
 threatened with punishment if they went to work.
 It is unknown whether laws exist governing the formation of associations. The
 Taliban reportedly issued an edict at year's end which outlawed all social organiza-
 tions, but this was unconfirmed. Many Afghan NGOs have been formed. Some are
 based in neighboring countries, mostly Pakistan, with branches inside Afghanistan.
 Others are based in Afghan cities. The focus of their activities is primarily humani-
 tarian assistance, rehabilitation, health, education, and agriculture.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Afghanistan's official name, the Islamic State of Afghani-
 stan, reflects the country's adherence to Islam as the state religion. Some 85 percent
 of the population is Sunni Muslim, with Si'a Muslims comprising most of the re-
 mainder. The Hazara ethnic gup is Shi'a; Shi'as are among the most economically
 disadvantaged people in Afghanistan. The Shi'a minority want a national govern-
 ment to give them equal rights as citizens. There were unconfirmed reports that
 under TaTiban rule, the Shia populations in Kabul and Herat were forced to pray
 in the open-handed Sunni style, rather than in their own closed-handed style. Min-
 ature stones, representing the sacred black stone at the Kaaba in Mecca, were re-
 moved from S-ia mosques. Shi'as were forced to pray at the same time as Sunnis,
 although traditionally their prayer schedules differ. However, at year's end it ap-
 peared the Taliban were not interfering in Shi'a prayer practices.
 The Taliban sought to impose their strict form of Islamic observance in areas that
 they control. Men were hauled out of their vehicles and forced to attend services
 at mosques. Taliban members attempted to force men to pray five times a day at
 set times and to grow long beards. Ismaili women were not allowed to leave home
 to attend Ismaili religious services and Ismaili girls were not allowed to attend
 school. The Taliban also ordered women to dress in strict Islamic garb (see Section
 5).
 The small number of non-Muslim residents in Afghanistan may practice their
 faith, but may not proselytize. The country's small Hindu and Silkh population,
 which once numbered about 50,000, continued to shrink as its members emigTated
 or took refuge abroad. Some Taliban leaders claimed tolerance of religious minori-
 ties. There were unconfirmed reports that a number of Sikhs, who have long felt
 unwelcome by the various mujaheddin commanders, had returned to Jalalabad,
 Ghazni, and Kabul under the Taliban to reclaim their property and resume resi-
 dence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although in principle citizens have the right to travel freely both inside
 and outside the country, their ability to travel within the ountry was hampered by
 warfare, brigandage, millions of land mines, a road network_ in a state of disrepair,
 and limited domestic air service, complicated by factional threats to air traffic. De-
 spite these obstacles many people continued to travel relatively freely with buses
 plying routes in most parts of the country. Security conditions have improved along
 roads in Talibancontrolled areas. However, due to intermittent fighting in various
 areas, international aid agencies often found that their ability to travel, work, and
 distribute assistance was hampered. International travel continued to be difficult as
 both Dostam and the Taliban threatened to shoot down any planes that overflew
 areas of the country that they controlled without their permission. In December, the
 Taliban forced down a U.N. plane carrying a Tajik opposition leader from Iran to
 Afghanistan. The Taliban said the U.N. had not informed them of the flight. After
 a diversion to Kandahar, the plane was allowed to proceed.
 Commercial trade was impeded in certain non-Taliban areas as local commanders
 continued to demonstrate their control over the roads by demanding road tolls and
 sometimes closing roads. In January one road stoppage at Sarobi on the Kabul-
 Jalalabad road by a Hekmatyar commander prevented trucks carrying food supplies
 from reaching Kabul for about a week. Roads leading to Bamian province reportedly
 
 
 1413
 contained dozens of checkpoints controlled by local commanders, where travelers
 were sometimes subject to extortion.
 According to the UNHCR, approximately 10,000 people reportedly fled Jalalabad
 following the Taliban takeover in mid-September, but most later returned. Villagers
 were forced to flee the fighting north and northeast of Kabul in several locations
 as factions contended for control village by village. A large number of Kabul inhab-
 itants were also displaced by the Taliban takeover in late September, but there were
 no reliable estimates as to their number. In November fighting in Badghis province
 in the northwest caused thousands to flee their homes. More than 9,000 displaced
 persons were concentrated in 3 areas of northern Afghanistan by mid-November.
 The UNHCR said that 15,000 Afghans, mostly from Kabul, had crossed the border
 to Pakistan since the beginning of October. While, according to UNHCR statistics,
 the overall number of families returning to Kabul was greater than the number de-
 parting in 1996, the number of departing families rose sharply in September and
 continued at a high level throughout the remainder of the year. The rate of arrival
 in Pakistan in October was 600 to 700 a day. By year's end, the UNHCR and NGO's
 were assisting more than 1,600 newly arrived families (11,200 persons) in Nasir
 Bagh camp in Pakistan. Since October the Taliban have reportedly removed dozens
 of checkpoints on the Kabul-Jalalabad road; at year's end there were only six. They
 routinely checked passengers for weapons and "stolen state property."
 Afghans continued to form one o the world's largest refugee populations. Accord-
 ing to the UNHCR, about 2.4 million Afghans remain outside the country in 1996
 as registered refugees. Of these, 1.3 million are in Iran, 864,000 are in Pakistan,
 and 28,000 are in Russia. Approximately 19,000 Afghans reside in parts of the
 former Soviet Union other than Russia. Pakistan claimed an additional 500,000 un-
 registered Afghan refugees in its territory. Over 3.8 million Afghan refugees have
 been repatriated since 1988, with over 1.5 million returning to Afghanistan in the
 peak year of 1992. According to the UNHCR, 127,500 Afghans repatriated in 1996,
 120,000 from Pakistan and 7,500 from Iran. The repatriation from Iran was much
 lower than in previous years. This reflected in part the Iranian Government's deci-
 sion not to encourage repatriation while the Tliban remained in control of western
 Afghanistan and to postpone use of a new repatriation route through Turkmenistan.
 It also reflected the judgment of many refugees that their prospects for earning a
 livelihood were better in Iran than in Afghanistan.
 According to the UNHCR, approximately 18,800 refugees from Tajikistan remain
 in Afghanistan. About 1,000 Taik refugees were repatriated to Tajikistan during
 1996. Tajiks living in the UNHCR-run Saki camp near Mazar-i-Sharif have been
 able to repatriate relatively freely. Those in camps in the Kunduz area, which is
 controlled by Masood, Hekmatyar, and independeat commanders and where the
 Tajik opposition actively opposes repatriation, have not had free access to informa-
 tion on repatriation. The  NCR does not have access to these camps. The refugees
 have also faced considerable difficulty in repatriating when they have wished to do
 so. However, accordingto the UNHCR, theopposition's hold on the camps has de-
 creased in recent mont  an some repatriation has occurred.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The continuing struggle for political power among the three major armed groups
 precluded citizens from changing their government or form of government peacefully
 and democratically. Most political changes came about through shifting military for-
 tunes. No faction held elections or respected the right to change government demo-
 cratically.
 The faction controlling Kabul for the first 9 months of the year, headed by nomi-
 nal President Rabbani, held power with the military backing of de facto Defense
 Minister Masood, until the Taliban takeover in late September. General Dostam
 was aligned with Hezb-I-Islami (Islamic Party) leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and
 with an opposition Shi'aparty in an alliance called the Supreme Coordination Coun-
 cil of Afghanistan. The aliban controlled all of southern and western Afghanistan
 to the Turkmenistan and Iranian borders. In June former Rabbani rival Gulbuddin
 Hekmatyar switched sides and joined the Rabbani government as Prime Minister.
 The move was intended to broaden the base of the Kabul regime to include
 Pashtuns. However, the step weakened the allegiance of Hekmatyar's commanders
 in the southeast and east and led to the crumbling of the formerly neutral
 Nangarhar Shura (Council) in the east. After the fall of Jalalabad, Sarobi, and then
 Kabul, Rabbani fled to Takhar in the north where he proclaimed that the Govern-
 ment had relocated. At year's end, Rabbani and Masood controlled two Tajik major-
 ity northeastern provinces, Badakhshan and Takhar, as well as pockets in Kunduz,
 Parwan, and Kapisa, including the Panjshir valley. Hekmatyar continued to coin-
 
 
 1414
 mand allegiance from several commanders located in Baghlan and Kunduz prov-
 inces. Dostam's National Islamic Movement controlled five to six north central prov-
 inces. After the fall of Kabul, Rabbani/Masood, Dostain and the Khalili-led Shi'a
 Party formed an alliance, the Supreme Council for the befense of Afghanistan, to
 combat the Taliban.
 Although there are governors and local councils in the north, most power there
 is concentrated in the hands of Dostam and a few generals. Masood retains control
 in the northeastern ethnic Tajik-majority provinces through his commanders and
 political organization. The three eastern provinces-Nangarhar, Laghman, and
 Konar-were controlled by a neutral commander, but all fell to the Tahiban in mid-
 September. The Taliban controlled more than two-thirds of the country by year's
 end, including Kabul. However, discontent with Taliban strictures and village val-
 ues was strong in large non-Pashtun cities such as Herat and Kabul.
 In September former King Zahir Shah declared from his residence in exile that
 he was prepared to return to Afghanistan and discuss with the relevant parties the
 formation of an interim government. Although many representatives of the factions
 visited the former King, he did not return to the country. The Taliban were ambiva-
 lent about a possible role for the former King, although some Taliban adherents
 supported his return. Some observers believed that some Afghans welcomed the
 Taliban to their areas because they thought that they were the former King's van-
 guard.
 The United Nations and the international community continued their efforts to
 help Afghans reach a political settlement. In April and October, the U.N. Security
 Councilheld open discussions on Afghanistan. In October a Security Council resolu-
 tion was adopted that called for an end to the fighting and the start of a political
 dialogue aimed at national reconciliation and a lasting political settlement. It also
 called upon the outside parties to stop supplying arms and ammunition to the war-
 ring factions and for all Afghan groups to respect human rights and permit the de-
 livery of humanitarian assistance.
 In the fall, attempts by U.N. Special Envoy Holl to broker a ceasefire among the
 parties failed. However, Holl succeeded in getting talks underway between two of
 the major groups, Dostam and the Taliban. In October the Organization of Islamic
 States (OIC) called for a peace conference of Afghans in Jeddah, but received no
 positive response. On November 18, the U.N. Secretary General convened a meeting
 of countries concerned with the Afghan situation to bolster international support for
 the U.N.'s mediation efforts and to engage the neighboring and regional states in
 a common approach to the conflict.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There was no functioning central government in the country. The Rabbani regime
 cooperated with the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Afghanistan, Dr.
 Choong-hyun Paik, who traveled to Afghanistan in January and May 1995, visiting
 Kabul, Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad, and Mazar-i-Sharif. In February his report to
 the U.N. Commission on Human Rights concluded that the lack of a central govern-
 ment posed extreme difficulties and complexities in redressing human rights viola-
 tions. He concluded that it was necessary then to stress the importance of account-
 ability at the level of regional administrations, which might assume responsibility
 for violations of human rights committed in their particular region. He noted that
 the collapse of an impartial judicial system prevented the administration of justice,
 which posed an insurmountable challenge to citizens' right to a fair trial and af-
 fected, in particular, detainees in prisons.
 In April Dr. Paik's mandate as special rapporteur was renewed by the U.N. Com-
 mission on Human Rights. In July he traveled again to Afghanistan, as well as
 Pakistan and Iran. Also in July, the Kabul authorities under Rabbani permitted a
 2-day visit to Kabul by three representatives of Amnesty International. They met
 with Rabbani and Dostam to discuss the human rights situation in the country. Als
 reqests to meet with Taliban representatives were denied.
 In October the U.N. Special Rapporteur noted in his interim report that Afghani-
 stan over the years had signed a number of international human rights conventions.
 However, the Taliban recognize only the validity of Islamic law. They do not accept
 the notion of secular law, nor binding international human rights norms. In early
 October, Jose Ayala Lasso, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, publicly
 invited the Taliban leadership to ensure respect for women's rights, such as the
 right of women to work and the right of girls to an education without discrimina-
 tion.
 The Afghan League of Human Rights operated both in Afghanistan and Pakistan;
 it produces an annual report. The Cooperation Center for Afghanistan (CCA) is an
 
 
 1415
 Afghan NGO that operated in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. CCA maintains an
 office in Peshawar where it produces a monthly newsletter on the Afghan human
 rights situation. It also works inside Afghanistan to document human rights abuses.
 IHowever, the civil war and lack of security made it difficult for human rights orga-
 nizations to adequately monitor the situation inside the country. In October a 2-fay
 workshop on human rights in Afghanistan was held in Peshawar, Pakistan.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There are no constitutional provisions that prohibit discrimination based on race,
 sex, religion, disability, language, or social status. It is not known whether specific
 laws pohibit discrimination; local custom and practies generally prevail. Discrimi-
 nation against women varies from area to area, depending on the local leadrship's
 attitude towards work and education for women. Traditionally, the minority Shi'a
 faced discrimination from the majority Sunni population. There was more general
 acceptance of the disabled as the number of people maimed by land mines increased
 and the presence of the disabled became more prevalent.
 Women.-As lawlessness and interfactional fighting continued in some areas, vio-
 lence against women occurred frequently, incuding beatings, rapes, forced mar-
 riaes, dsappearances, kidnapings, and kings. Such incidents generally went un-
 reported an most information was anecdotaLIt was difficult to document rapes,
 in particular, given the social stigma that surrounded the problem.
 Afghan traition imposes limits on women's activities beyond the home, particu-
 larly in the Taliban-dominated Pashtun areas of the south. Under the Communist
 regmne of the 1980's, a growing number of women, particularly in urban areas,
 worked outside the home in nontraditional roles. This trend was reversed when the
 Communists were ousted in 1992 and an Islamic government was installed. In 1996
 the trend towards excluding women from public service continued, although some
 women retained employment as artisans, weavers, doctors, and nurses i some
 areas. In northern Afghanistan and pre-Taliban controlled Kabul, women were al-
 lowed to work and girls to attend school.
 When the Taliban took Kabul in late September, they immediately issued pro-
 nouncements forbidding women to work, including female doctors and nurses in has-
 pitals. This move affected as many as 40,000 women, including civil servants, teach-
 ers, bakers, and charwomen. Some working women ap pealed to the Taliban that
 they had no other means of livelihood to support several family members if they did
 not work. Taliban tender restrictions often interfered with the ability of UN relief
 agencies and NGO a to employ women and deliver assistance to women and girls.
 Man re ef organizations had to scale back their actties, and at least one, Oxfam,
 suspended operations altogether in Talian areas. However, most continued their
 principal programs. After gender restrictions threatened to disrmpt the delivery of
 health services, the Taliban allowed some female medical staff, including doctors
 and nurses, to resume their jobs in Kabul and elsewhere, but generally only under
 strict guidelines. Female nurses were discouraged from working alongside male doc-
 tors. Male doctors could not attend to femae patients. Actual practice, however, var-
 ied from place to place. The Talian allowed female doctors and nurses to tend other
 females and even, in some instances, to attend to male patients. In one province,
 a male doctor who ran a clinic was allowed to see female patients but only with
 his wife present.
 Female employment outside of the health sector was forbidden by the Taliban in
 Kabul, Herat, and elsewhere. The Taliban have completely stopped women from
 teaching in boys' schools, thereby preventing many boys from gett g an education.
 In Kabul and elsewhere, women were prohibited from working outside the home.
 The Taliban promised to pay women salaries to remain at home but did not. In
 Herat resistane to the Taliban   edicts forbidding employment led to punishment,
 including beatings. The Talian also limited women a access to education by stop-
 ping most women's educational programs in areas they took over, including the clo-
 sure of a nursing school in Kandahar.
 The Taliban decreed what women would wear in public. They were required to
 don an all-encompassing head-to-toe garb known as the chadori which has only a
 mesh screen for vision. In conservative areas, this was the normal garb for rural
 women. In Kabul women found in public not wearing the chadori were beaten by
 Taliban militiamen. In one incident, a woman covered by a chadori was reportedly
 harassed by a Taliban street patrol in Kabul for not properly covering her bare feet.
 A few reports indicated that some women in ferat are covering their heads with
 large scarves that leavee   ofe  heatuncovered and have not faced reprisals.
 The appearane and movement of women inpubic has been discouraged, even
 with approved clothing. In the days after the Taiban takeover of Kabul, a Taliban
 
 
 1416
 patrol stopped two women and beat them with a broken-off car antenna, even
 though they were appropriately dressed. However, women were not prevented from
 leaving their homes altogether. They went to the market without accompanying
 male relatives in Kandahiar, the most socially conservative of the larger cities, as
 well as in Herat and Kabul, though in smaller numbers than before the Taliban
 takeover. Women also visited open bazaars, but were sometimes discouraged from
 entering small shops. Instead, they had to conduct business with the shopkeepers
 from the street.
 Most women in Dostam-controlled Mazir-i-Sharif now wear the chador, a marked
 change from last year. Dostam's political organization issued strict instructions that
 women on the streets should be modestly attired.
 In October the U.N. Secretary General issued a statement criticizing the Taliban's
 directive on women and warned that international assistance to Afghanistan could
 be jeopardized if international human rights standards were not observed. The U.N.
 Security Council held an open discussion on October 16 at which many countries
 addressed the problem of human rights in Afghanistan, particularly the rights of
 women and girls.
 Children.-Local administrative bodies and international assistance organizations
 undertook further children's welfare to the extent possible. Taliban restrictions on
 the movement of women and girls in areas that they controlled hampered the ability
 of U.N. agencies and NGO's to effectively implement education programs aimed at
 both boys and girls. UNICEF discontinued programs in Herat, Kandahar, and Kabul
 where girls were denied access to education. One NGO decided not to proceed with
 a planned program aimed at girls' education in Herat. The general disruption of
 health services countrywide due to the Soviet invasion and civil war put many
 young people at grave risk. UNICEF continued to operate some health-relatedpro-
 grams in Taliban-controlled areas. Local authorities n all parts of Afghanistan have
 supported UNICEF/WHO mass vaccination campaigns. Education, also disrupted
 due to the Soviet invasion, 10 years of resistance, and civil war caused a generation
 of children to miss all of their schooling, reportedly raising illiteracy levels above
 75 percent.
 The Taliban have stopped most of the few opportunities for girls' education that
 were in place in areas they have taken over. Since capturing Kandahar in 1994,
 there has been no girls' education-either secular or religious-in the city. Since
 capturing Herat city in 1995, girls' schools have remained glosed. Kabul had more
 girls' schools than any other city. According to a U.N. survey conducted in May,
 Kabul had 158 public schools accommodating 148,223 boys and 103,256 gis 
 grades K-12. Of 11,208 teachers, 7,793 were women. According to UNICEF, no
 women were teaching in and no girls were attending public schools in Kabul at
 year's end as a result of Taliban policies on female employment and education. The
 effect on boy' education was unknown; 3,415 male teachers presumably were still
 employed. UNICEF believed that girls ma still be attending a few private schools,
 but no details were available. However, Taliban authorities reportedly permitted
 girls' education in some of the rural areas of Herat province. Limited girls' education
 continued in Taliban-controlled Ghazni, Khost, and Konar provinces in the south,
 at schools and in private homes. Even in areas where education is possible, facilities
 are inadequate and access is limited by custom and poverty. Simple education for
 boys, both secular and religious, continued in Taliban-controlled areas, including
 Kabul. However, these opportunities were diminished since female teachers were
 prohibited from teaching in boys' schools.
 People With Disabilities.-Both the former Rabbani regime and the new Taliban
 authorities in Kabul took few measures to protect the rights of the mentally and
 physically disabled or to mandate accessiblity for them. Victims of land mines were
 a major focus of international humanitarian relief organizations, which devoted re-
 sources to providing prostheses, medical treatment, and rehabilitation therapy to
 amputees. In Jalalabad an NGO provided bicycles to amputees for transportation
 as well as physical therapy, rehabilitation skills, and literacy training. There was
 more public acceptance of people with disabilities because of the prevalence of the
 maimed due to land mines. The U.N. Development Program (UNDP) conducted a
 million dollar project to stren hen comprehensive community-based rehabilitation
 services for disabled citizens. The ICRC and some NGO's were actively involved in
 programs for people with disabilities throughout the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Little is known about labor laws and practices, al-
 though only an insignificant fraction of the work force has ever labored in an indus-
 trial setting. There were no reports of labor rallies or strikes. Labor rights are not
 defined, in the context of the breakdown of governmental authority, and there is no
 
 
 1417
 
 effective central authority to enforce them. Many of Kabul's industrial workers are
 unemployed due to the destruction or abandonment of the city's minuscule manufac-
 turing base. The only large employer in Kabul is the governmental structure of
 minimally functioning ministries.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Afghanistan lacks a tradition
 of genuine labor-management bargaining. There are no known labor courts or other
 mechanisms for resolving labor disputes.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-No information is available on
 edicts regarding forced or compulsory labor. There were no confirmed reports of al-
 leged forced-work road prejects.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no evidence that authori-
 ties in any part of the country enforce labor laws, if they exist, relating to the em-
 ployment of children. Children from the a es of 6 to 14 often work to help support
 their families by herding animals in rural areas, and by collecting paper and fire-
 wood, shining shoes, begging, or collecting scrap metal among street debris in the
 cities. Some of these practices expose children to the danger of land mines.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no available information regarding a
 statutory minimum wage or the enforcement of safe labor practices. Many workers
 are apparently allotted time off regularly for prayers and observance of religious
 holidays.
