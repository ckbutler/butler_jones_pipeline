 GHANA
 Ghana returned to a constitutional, democratically elected
 government on September 24, 1979. The return to civilian
 rule through free elections contested by five political
 parties brought with it the restoration of civil rights,
 suspended since the overthrow of Ghana's last civilian
 government in 1972.
 The new government is headed by an executive president, Dr.
 Hilla Limann, an independent 140-member unicameral legisla-
 ture, and an independent judiciary. Each branch of govern-
 ment is now functioning in accordance with the provisions of
 the new constitution. The People's National Party controls
 the executive and the parliament, the latter by a slender
 margin.
 The past year was notable for the success the new administra-
 tion achieved in creating democratic institutions. The main
 challenge now confronting the government of President Limann
 is rebuilding the economy, which after years of mismanagement
 is in shambles (real per capita income-has declined by
 almost 25 percent in the past five years).
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Section 23 of Ghana's 1979 constitution prohibits torture,
 inhuman or degrading punishment or any other condition that
 detracts, or is likely to detract, from the dignity and worth
 of the person as a human being. There have been no known
 instances of the use of torture or degrading treatment by
 government authorities since the inauguration of the Third
 Republic. The Ghana Bar Association and National Catholic
 Secretariat and other independent organizations confirm
 this.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Section 23 of the constitution specifically prohibits cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, whether or not
 a person is arrested, restricted or detained. No instances
 of such practices have been reported since the advent of the
 Limann administration. No death penalties or unduly harsh
 prison sentences have been imposed.
 Prison conditions are crowded and poor. The minister of the
 interior is devoting a large share of the ministry's fiscal year
 80-81 budget to improving prison conditions. There is no
 reported discrimination in Ghana's prisons on the basis of
 sex, race, religion or tribal affiliation.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no evidence that people in Ghana are abducted,
 secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention by
 officials of the government.
 
 
 104
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Preventive Detention Act, a law enacted under the
 Nkrumah regime, is still on the books. As far as can be
 ascertained the act has not been used during the past year.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 During the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council's (AFRC) rule
 in the summer of 1979, 78 persons were imprisoned and doubt
 exists whether due process was accorded during their revolu-
 tionary court trials. Article 16 of the transitional
 provisions of the constitution provides that "notwithstand-
 ing anything contained in the 1979 constitution any confis-
 cation of property and other penalties imposed by or under
 the authority of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council...
 shall not be reversed by any authority under this constitution."
 There have been no court decisions overturning decisions of
 the AFRC. The newly established supreme court may be asked to
 rule on the legality of the transitional provisions of the
 constitution or to rule on individual cases originating
 during AFRC rule.
 According to the attorney general, those imprisoned cannot be
 considered politial prisoners; neither human rights groups
 nor the bar association have identified them as such.
 Section 21 of the constitution requires that persons arrested,
 restricted or detained upon reasonable suspicion of having
 committed, or being about to commit a criminal offense and
 who are not released, shall be brought before a court within
 twenty-four hours.
 The constitution also'provides that persons arrested and
 charged will be tried within a reasonable time, or be
 released unconditionally or upon-reasonable conditions.
 Section 25 of the constitution provides that a person
 who is charged with a criminal offense shall be permitted to
 defend himself before the court in person or by counsel of
 his own choice. This provision is being observed. There
 are no clandestine, political or secret courts.
 All courts are established under the constitution. The
 press has reported that one civilian has'been tried by a
 military court -- with a group of military for conspiring to
 overthrow the government -- since the advent of the Third
 Republic. When civilians are tried by military courts, they
 may appeal such sentences to the highest court in the land.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Articles 24 and 25 of the constitution provide that no
 person shall be subjected to the search of his person or his
 property nor shall his property or premises be entered
 into or intruded upon by others, except through due
 process of law. Warrants are issued by magistrates and
 judges acting as agents of courts of law. The government
 respects this proscription.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 
 
 105
 President Limann has taken steps to revive Ghana's de-
 vastated economy but it is still difficult for the average
 citizen to obtain food, clothing and shelter. The govern-
 ment recently launched a two-year program of agricultural
 rehabilitation and rural development and is attempting
 to restore balance to government finances and channel
 more resources toward rehabilitation of the existing infra-
 structure.
 Ghana's population, approximately 11 million or 400 per
 square mile is growing at about 3.1 percent per annum.
 Approximately one half of Ghana's population lives at
 or near a subsistence level. Ghana's per capita gross
 national product, measured in 1977, has been estimated by
 the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development at
 $380.
 Only a third of the population has access to potable water.
 The Government of Ghana estimates that at least 50 percent
 of the population suffers from preventable parasitic and
 water-borne diseases and that, at present, some 130,000
 Ghanaians, mostly women and children, die each year from
 preventable causes. At least 70 percent of Ghana's popula-
 tion have no access to modern medical care when sickness
 and disability strike. Life expectancy at birth is 56 years
 in the urban areas and 42 in the rural areas. Infant
 mortality averages 115 per 1000 live births. Ghana's health
 delivery capabilities include: 1031 doctors, or one for
 every 10,600 persons; 6,152 nurses or one for every 1800
 persons; 60 dental surgeons, or one for every 162,000
 persons; and 4,952 midwives, or one for every 2,200 persons;
 12,973 hospital beds, or one for every 765 persons.
 Ghana's inflation rate in 1979 was 54 percent. Annual
 price increases have been a major factor in the deteriorat-
 ing standard of living of many Ghanaians. The president
 on October 28 announced a threefold increase in the minimum
 daily wage to become effective on November 1. Wage in-
 creases have been given to water and electrical workers and
 teachers.
 Article 9 of Ghana's constitution provides that parliament
 shall enact laws that will ensure every citizen an adequate
 means of livelihood and opportunity to obtain employment;
 public assistance as needed; just and humane conditions
 of work with adequate facilities for leisure, social and
 cultural life; safeguarding of health, welfare and safety
 in employment; adequate health and medical facilities;
 equal pay for equal work without regard to sex; guarantees
 against exploitation of the young and the aged, and provi-
 sions for retirement (public and private sectors) and old
 age pensions.
 The Factories, Offices and Shops Act of 1970 regulates
 safety, occupational health and welfare at the work place.
 Workmen's compensation is regulated under provisions of
 the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1963, which includes
 employers' liability, medical examinations, compensation,
 and provisions for judicial review. The Social Security
 Decree of 1972 -- provides for a comprehensive social
 security program covering workers in establishments with
 five or more employees. Finally, the Industrial Relations
 Act of 1965 provides additional guarantees in each of the
 above sectors.
 
 
 106
 -mifficult economic conditions prevent-full implementation
 "of-these provisions. Ghanaian labor union officials report
 that the government tries to adhere to these laws.
 The literacy rate for adults is 30 percent. Article 10
 of Ghana's constitution provides that the government shall
 endeavor to provide equal and adequate educational opportuni-
 ties in all fields and at all levels for the people of
 Ghana. Lack of money prevents this goal from being met,
 particularly in rural areas.
 Basic rights of women in Ghana are guaranteed under the
 constitution. Article 19 provides that every person in
 Ghana, whatever his race, place of origin,-political opinions,
 color, creed, or sex shall be entitled to-the fundamental
 ri-ghts and freedoms. -Further protection for the rights of
 mothers, spouses, and children is enumerated in article 32
 of the 1979 constitution; "Where assistance, special care,
 and facilities necessary for the maintenancei safety, and
 development of a woman as a mother are provided by or at the
 expense of the state, such assistance, special -care, and
 facilities shall be available to all mothers without discrimi-
 nation. No spouse may be deprived of a-reasonable provision
 out of the estate of a spouse whether the.estate be testate
 or intestate."
 The constitution also assures women of -property rights and
 rights to education. National Redemption Council Decree 322
 establishes the National Council on Women and Development
 whose basic-purpose is to review and evaluate women's
 -integration in the tota- development effort at local,
 regional, and national levels. According.to the Ghana
 Assembly of Women and .other women who-follow women's activi-
 ties, the status of women .in mast areas is still not equal to
 that of males in Ghanaian society. Income level disparities
 are still the norm in many sectors. Nevertheless, Ghanaians
 assert that the machinery to insure change is in place, and
 their efforts are actively dedicated.to.this end.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedomof Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly.
 -Ghana is noted-for its general respect-for these rights.
 Guarantee of these rights is contained in Ghana's constitu-
 tion: article 27 (Religion), article 28 (Freedom of Ex-
 pression), and article.29 (Assembly and Association).
 Article 195 provides .that parliament shall have no power to
 enact a law requiring official government permission to
 operate a newspaper or other media. A press commission
 (required under article 192 of.the constitution) has been
 -established. It acts as a- buffer for government-owned media
 against editorial control by the government. Thus far the
 government-has made no attempt to exercise press censorship.
 Freedom of assembly is respected. Ghana has a record of
 religious freedom.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 
 
 107
 The right of voluntary repatriation is guaranteed under
 Ghana's constitution and is honored by the government.
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country.
 Numerous internal checkpoints, once quite prevalent under
 military regimes, have been considerably reduced. Citizens
 move about the country freely without having to produce
 identity documents. Similarly, persons with appropriate
 travel documentation may travel in and out of Ghana without
 restriction. Foreign exchange is hard to obtain. This lack
 restricts movement in and out of Ghana. There is no discrim-
 ination in this regard as to race, sex, national origin,
 tribal affiliation or class. These rights are guaranteed
 under articles 30 and 31 of Ghana's constitution.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process.
 Ghanaian citizens are guaranteed freedom to participate in
 the political process under article 29 of the constitution.
 National elections have been open, free and without coer-
 cion. Ghana's electoral commission regulated the electoral
 process in a fair and impartial manner. The June 1979
 parliamentary elections were contested by six political
 parties, five of which won seats in the parliament. The
 ruling People's National Party has 71 of the 140 seats.
 4.     Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights.
 As far as is known, Ghana cooperates whenever there is such
 an enquiry. Ghana also participates in the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission and chairs a subcommittee investigat-
 ing disappeared persons. The Ghana Bar Association, the
 Ghana Assembly of Women and the United Nations Student
 Association are among organizations which observe, report
 and contest human rights violations in Ghana. During the
 past year none has done so.
