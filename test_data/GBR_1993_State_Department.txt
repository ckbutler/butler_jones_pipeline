 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN
 IRELAND*
 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is a constitu-
 tional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary government elected in periodic,
 multiparty elections. Although there is no written constitution, human and civil
 rights are recognized by statute and strongly held traditions. Human rights are "re-
 sidual," i.e., assumed unless limited by statute.
 Throughout the UK, public order is maintained by civilian police forces responsive
 to and controlled by elected officials. Because of terrorist violence, the Royal Ulster
 Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland is supported by army units.
 The United Kingdom has a highly developed industrial economy. Persons may
 own property and pursue private economic interests. The Government provides com-
 prehensive social welfare services.
 Terrorist bombings and killings carried out by the illegal Provisional Irish Repub-
 lican Army (Provisional IRA) and other "Republican (Catholic) and "Loyalist"
 (Protestant) terrorist groups in Northern Ireland and Great Britain continue to be
 the greatest threat to public order and security in the UK. By the end of 1993, over
 3,000 people had died in 24 years of "the troubles" in Northern Ireland, which has
 a population of 1.5 million. Since the troubles began, more than 100 persons have
 been killed in Provisional IRA attacks in Great Britain, including 3 in 1993. Emer-
 gency measures enacted because of the terrorist problem in the past 20 years sus-
 pend certain due process guarantees and restrict freedom of movement, expression,
 and association. There were no new reported instances of extrajudicial killings by
 security forces in Northern Ireland. However, allegations of the use of excessive
 force continued. Eleven members of the security forces were killed in Northern Ire-
 land. Aspects of the criminal justice system remained under scrutiny as investiga-

 report on the United Kingdom.

 tions exposed shortcomings, and a Royal Commission recommended extensive
 changes in the treatment of confession evidence and handling of appeals.
 Primarily because of fear of terrorist violence, Protestant and Catholic commu-
 nities in Northern Ireland are increasingly segregated. Most firms continue to re-
 cruit predominantly from one community or the other, and workers are reluctant
 to commute across sectarian borders. In December the British and Irish Govern-
 ments issued a joint declaration which seeks to aormodate the aspirations of all
 communities in Northern Ireland and to encourage an end to violence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Riling.-There were no political killings by
 the Government and no charges of other extrojudicial killings by government forces.
 However, during 1993 there were four inquests into the deaths of people killed by
 the security forces under disputed circumstances in previous years. In Northern Ire-
 land, 84 persons were killed in incidents related to terrorism, including 47 by Loyal-
 ists and 35 by Republican terrorists (one Loyalist and one Republican accidentally
 killed themselves). Eleven victims were members of British security forces, all killed
 by Provisional IRA. Although no deaths resulted from shootings by security forces
 in Northern Ireland, charges continued that soldiers resorted to lethal force
 precipitately and carried out a "shoot to kill" policy.
 The Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ), an independent Northern
 Ireland civil liberties organization, claims that there have been approximately 340
 killings by the security forces under disputed circumstances since "the troubles"
 began in 1968, with criminal prosecutions in only 30 cases, and 4 convictions by the
 end of 1993.
 The authorities investigated several deaths in which critics of the security forces
 le     a "shoot to kill" policy was in effect. A January inquest into the 1986 killing
 of Seamus McElwaine an acknowledged Provisional lRA volunteer and escaped
 prisoner, ruled that soldiers had opened fire without giving him the opportunity to
 surrender and that McElwaine had actually been killed5 minutes after being
 wounded in the initial gunfire. The Director of Public Prosecutions reviewed the
 case to determine whether prosecution was warranted. An inquest into the August
 1988 killings of three IRA members was inconclusive. None of the security forces
 members involved in the shooting was required to be present at the inquest; their
 written statements were read out as evidence. They admitted they gave no warnings
 before r'wing, and the jury found incnclusive the evidence on who had fired first.
 An inquest into another case, a February 1988 death in which a soldier claimed his
 rgers were wet and had slippd on the trigger of his gun, determined that the sol-
 diers involved were guilty of contravening orders in relation to the handling of
 weapons.
 In the case of the deaths of four Provisional IRA terrorists after an attack on a
 police station in Coalisland in 1992, the court ruled in 1993 that the involved secu-
 rity forces were innocent of murder but enjoined five of the six accused to take more
 caution. Relatives of the three Provisional IRA terrorists who were killed in Gibral-
 tar by UK security forces in 1988 have claimed that the terrorists were lured into
 an ambush. They were unarmed at the time the attack occurred although British
 officials have claimed t  they intended to bomb a military band concert. A police
 investigation and inquest in Gibraltar found in favor of the Government, but the
 relatives sued the Government for compensation. The Government claimed exemp-
 tion for actions of its forces overseas, but the European Commission on Human
 Rights ruled that the European Court should consider the case. Two Royal Marines
 who were charged with the murder of Fergal Caraher in 1992 were acquitted in De-
 cmber when the judge, citing conflicting and in some cases apparently perjured tes-
 timony, accepted the Marines1 contention that they beieved another member of
 their patrol was in danger. In the September 1990 killing of Karen Reilly, a Belfast
 Crown Court found one soldier guilty of murder and another guilty of evading the
 investigation. They were sentenced to life in prison and 7 years respectively. The
 McBrid   ase aeand another case involving the death of a 19-yearold student were
 still pending at year's end. Following an investigation, the DPP decided not to pros-
 ecute in the cae  Goverinvolving the death of Pearse ordn (see 1992 report).
 In 1993 the European Commission found that the use of lethal force to prevent
 the running of a roadblock by a person reasonably suspected of being a terrorist is
 not a violation of international human rights law.
 The RUC investigates all killings committed in Northern Ireland by the RUC as
 well as by the Army. The Independent Commission for Police Complaints (IC),
 established by the Government, supervises investigations by police but has little
 
 
 1122
 
 independent investigative capability. The RUC Chief Constable may accept or reject
 its recommendations for disciplinary action, as may the DPP in the case of criminal
 prosecutions. In 1992, 66 police officers were disciplined as a result of ICPC inves-
 tigations, and criminal charges were brought against 8 police officers. The ICPC has
 no responsibility for complaints leveled against the Army (see Section 1.c. for addi-
 tional discussion of the ICPC). In early 1993, the Northern Ireland Secretary named
 a senior British lawyer as Independent Assessor of Military Complaints to deal with
 procedures for complaints a ainst the Army; he has no independent investigative
 powers. His first report was gue in early 1994.
 Although the European Convention on Human Rights established a standard for
 use of lethal force only when "absolutely necessary' in specific circumstances, Brit-
 ish law recires only that the use of lethal force be "reasonable in the cir-
 cumstances. Soldiers involved in shooting incidents have argued that they were in
 "imminent danger" before opening fire. The courts have generally accepted this de-
 fense, and very few on-duty soldiers have been convicted.
 Security forces members are subject to the same legal guidelines on the use of
 lethal force as are other citizens. In practice, this means that if a court determines
 in a death case that a policeman or soldier intended to cause serious bodily harm
 but was not justified in doing so, the only applicable charge is one of murder. Man-
 slaughter is applicable in death cases only where there is no intent to cause serious
 bodily harm. This means a charge of manslaughter is possible when a negligent dis-
 charge of a weapon is suspected, and there have been a few convictions on this
 basis. Since sentencing rules require a life sentence for murder, the courts have
 been unwilling to impose such heavy penalties in borderline cases.
 Human rights organizations have called for the establishment of an independent
 public inquiry to investigate allegations of police threats to and intimidation of de-
 fense lawyers in Northern Ireland, including an investigation of the 1986 killing of
 Patrick Finucane, counsel to many Provisional IRA suspects. In February the U.S.-
 based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights released the report of its investigation
 into Finucane's death in which they concluded that there was "credible evidence
 suggesting collusion between elements within the security forces and Loyalist
 paramilitaries" in Finucane's killing. Three people were charged and convicted of
 possession of the weapons used to kill Finucane, but police have not found sufficient
 evidence to charge them with murder. The case remains open. The Government
 maintained that harassment of defense lawyers was unacceptable and invited those
 with evidence of such actions to provide it to the ICPC.
 Security forces in Northern Ireland continued the use of plastic bullet rounds
 (PBR's) for riot control, though in recent years their use declined sharply, consonant
 with the decline in the number of street riots. PBR rounds were shot at Protestant
 groups in the riots leading up to the annual July 12 celebration, resulting in some
 minor injuries and a serious one.
 For the second year in a row, Loyalists killed more people than did the Provi-
 sional IRA. Loyalist terrorists continued to perpetrate random sectarian killings of
 Catholics in Northern Ireland, culminating in the indiscriminate slaughter of seven
 Catholics in Greysteel in late October. The Provisional IRA conducted bomb attacks
 that led to numerous deaths. A Provisional IRA bomb in Belfast in October killed
 nine civilians as well as one of the bombers. A huge Provisional IRA bomb in Lon-
 don in April caused massive damage and one death, and two smaller bombs in a
 shopping district in Warrington, England, killed two small boys and injured more
 than 50 others.
 In August police arrested Joy Gardner, a Jamaican illegal alien subject to a depor-
 tation order. According to official reports she collapsed and died of renal failure
 after 4 days on life support in a hospital. Her family alleges she died of asphyxiation
 after being gagged by the police. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police or-
 dered an immediate investigation and suspended the officers involved. In January
 1994, the Home Office issued guidelines banning the use of gags.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no disappearances attributed to government
 forces. Instances of persons abducted or held hostage by terrorists in Northern Ire-
 land continued.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 British laws forbid torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of
 prisoners and provide penalties for violations of those laws. Confessions obtained by
 such methods are not admissible as evidence in court. However, Helsinki Watch as-
 serted that "evidentiary rules in nonjury courts permit the admission into evidence
 of unreliable confessions, some of which may have been secured by abusive treat-
 ment in detention." Allegations of torture and ill-treatment of persons detained by
 the police in holding facilities in Northern Ireland continued. A new code of prac-
 tices, which went into effect January 1, 1994, is designed to implement greater
 
 
 1123
 
 standardization of police interrogation procedures and strengthen oversight require-
 ments.
 The "Beechmount Five" and the "Ballymurphy Seven" were two groups of teen-
 agers arrested and interrogated in connection with two separate attacks on the
 RUC. They alleged that they were coerced into making confessions, in the absence
 of their lawyers, after being subjected to mental and-physical abuse. Inadequate
 methods for monitoring police interrogations make it virtually impossible to prove
 or disprove these claims. The Beechmount Five were convicted primarily on the
 basis of confession evidence. The trial of the Ballymurphy Seven began but has not
 been concluded. In March an eighth teenager fmmar&    ymurphy was tried, con-
 victed, and sentenced to 14 years. The principal evidence against him was the state-
 ment which he claimed he was coerced into signing.
 The Independent Commission for Police Complaints in Northern Ireland has lim-
 ited powers. It reviews all complaints against the police and automatically super-
 vises police investigations in cases involving death or serious iury, as well as any
 other cases of its choosing. It may insist that disciplinary charges be preferred
 against police officers and may comment on the quality of police investigations, but
 it has no control over the outcome of disciplinary cases. The ICPC has been unable
 to substantiate any claim of ill-treatment in police custody submitted. In most cases,
 complainants refused to cooperate with the police or the ICPC. Some claimed they
 could not get a fair trial. The Government notes that complainants often prefer to
 sue in civil court, where they may be awarded substantial damages as a result of
 court rulings or out-of-court settlements, and where a lower evidentiary standard
 is a plied.
 Te U.N. Committee Against Torture as well as many human rights groups have
 raised concerns about ill-treatment of detainees in Northern Ireland and rec-
 ornmended that interrogations in police custody be videotaped. The Government re-
 fused to accept their recommendation on the grounds that the tapes could com-
 promise ongoing operations and jeopardize the safety of detainees who cooperate
 with the police.  stead, the Government announced in December 1992 the appoint-
 ment of a senior barrister as Independent Commissioner for Holding Centers in
 Northern Ireland. He has the authority to make irregular and unannounced visits
 to any of the three holding centers, observe interrogations on television monitors,
 and interview detainees. His first report is due to be submitted in early 1994.
 Security forces in Northern Ireland, both the Army and the RUC, frequently har-
 ass citizens verbally, particularly young people in areas where community support
 for terrorists is considered strong. Security forces have also been accused of more
 serious incidents of physical mistreatment. The CAJ reported that harassment in-
 cluded threats to kill, kidnap, or maliciously prosecute. Most complaints come from
 Republican neighborhoods, but after police crackdowns on Loyalist terrorism,_ there
 were also reports of abusive house searches and street harassment in some Protes-
 tant areas. Officials state that soldiers and policemen found guilty of harassment
 are punished severely but have provided no statistics.
 Northern Ireland terrorist groups, both Loyalist and Republican, frequently carry
 out "punishment shootings" of persons allegedly engaged in "antisocial activities."
 These assaults, which typically involve shooting through one or both knees at short
 range, have been widely condemned.
 Prison facilities in the UK vary depending upon location. Remand facilities, which
 tend to be located in old Victorian structures, are often overcrowded and lack proper
 exercise areas and modern sanitation. Permanent facilities are generally good, al-
 though a government-appointed investigator found problems of overcrowding, sub-
 standard conditions, and lax discipline at some prisons in Great Britain. In North-
 ern Ireland, prison facilities have improved notably in recent years, but conditions
 at the three holding centers are substandard. Uniformed police can observe all inter-
 rogations on television monitors although the content of the interviews cannot be
 heard, and, as noted above, they do not allow tapes to be made.
 Some teenagers continued to be detained in adult holding centers in Northern Ire-
 land despite a government policy to separate them from adult prisoners. Helsinki
 Watch reported allegations by young detainees that they had been subjected to
 physical and mental abuse and pressured to become informers during detention.
 Children under the age of 18 convicted for murder may be held for an indetermi-
 nate length of time. for example, the two 10-year-old children who murdered toddler
 Jamie Buler received indeterminate sentences. Such sentences are periodically re-
 viewed. If it is found that a person has been rehabilitated, the individual may be
 released. Throughout the UK there are some 400 children under the age of 18 serv-
 ing indeterminate sentences.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In instances when reasonable cause to
 suspect criminal guilt exists, police may make arrests without warrants. Those ar-
 
 
 1124
 rested without warrants must be released on bail within 36 hours unless brought
 before a magistrate's court. The court may authorize an additional 60 hours of de-
 tention before charges must be brought. Generally, persons charged with what Brit-
 ish law defines as 'nonserious" offenses may be released on bail. In cases such as
 crimes of violence, however, magistrates have remanded persons for periods of up
 to 3 years before trial.
 Reacting to the violence in Northern Ireland, the Government adopted the North-
 ern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1991 (EPA) which is applicable only to
 Northern Ireland, and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of
 1989 (PTA), most of which is applicable to the entire United Kingdom. Both Acts
 replaced earlier versions enacted in 1973 and 1974 respectively, and both must be
 renewed annually by Parliament.
 Under the EPA, police and military personnel, in dealing with cases of suspected
 terrorism, may enter and search without a warrant, and members of the armed
 forces on duty may arrest without a warrant any person suspected of having com-
 mitted or being a  ut to commit any offense. Such persons may be held for up to
 4 hours after which they must be transferred to police custody or released. The
 1991 EPA introduced new offenses--of directing a terrorist organization and pos-
 sessing items intended for terrorist purposes-and gave authorities new powers to
 examine financial and other documents found in terrorist-related searches. The PTA
 allows the police to arrest without a warrant, anywhere in the UK, persons whom
 the reasonably suspect to be involved in terrorism. The authorities may detain
 such persons, even those under 18, for up to 48 hours without legal representation
 or judicial review. Suspects may be interrogated during this time, and confessions
 obtained may be used in subsequent court proceedings. Although people detained in
 England and Wales under the PTA have the right to have lawyers present during
 interrogation, in Northern Ireland lawyers are never allowed to be present during
 interrogation of PTA detainees. Judicial review may be delayed up to a further 5
 days on the authority of the Home Secretary or, in Northern Ireland, the Secretary
 of State for Northern Ireland. In 1988 the European Court of Human Rights held
 that this practice violated the European Human Rights Convention. As a con-
 sequence, the UK derogated from that portion of the Convention. In 1993 the Euro-
 pean Court held that British derogation from this portion of the Convention was al-
 lowable. The Court reasoned that detention of suspected terrorist beyond 4 days was
 reasonable under the circumstances.
 The Government does not practice exile (see, however, Section 2.d.). In Northern
 Ireland, the Provisional IRA and to a lesser extent Loyalist paramilitaries forced a
 substantial number of Catholics and Protestants to leave the province by threaten-
 ing them with death or injury if they remain. The paramilitaries claim that these
 persons have cooperated with security forces or engaged in "antisocial behavior, but
 the latter reportedly includes personal feuds with paramilitary members. Families
 Against Intimidation and Terror, an organization that assists persons under threat,
 dealt with 35 cases in 1993 including 7 entire families.
 e. Denial of Fair Public ia/.-Fair trial is provided for by law and observed in
 practice but there have been some serious exceptions. In the late 1980's, after 10
 years of intense public pressure on several cases, the Home Secretary directed the
 courts to reconsider them. The cases were reviewed at the appellate level and the
 appellate courts reached a number of troubling conclusions: lower courts often relied
 too heavily on uncorroborated confessions and assumed the integrity of the police
 was irreproachable; appellate court judges tended to accept lower court rulings with-
 out closely examining procedural flaws and new evidence and occasionally displayed
 open hostility to the defense; and courts accepted tainted forensic evidence and ex-
 culpatory evidence was withheld from the defense. As a result of these apparent
 miscarriages of justice the Government in 1991 established a Royal Commission to
 review all aspects of tie criminal justice system in England and Wales (see below).
 An indigent defendant has the right to counsel of his choosing. All criminal pro-
 ceedings must be conducted in public, with the exception of juvenile court cases and
 cases involving public decency or security. In a trial under the Official Secrets Act
 the court may be closed at the judge's discretion, but the sentence must be passed
 in ublic.
 Re UK has several levels of courts. The vast majority of criminal cases are heard
 by magistrate's courts, which are managed by locally based committees. Their deci-
 sions may be appealed to the Crown Court, which also hears criminal cases requir-
 ing a jury trial, or to the High Court. From the Crown Court, convictions may be
 appealed to the Court of Appeal, which in turn may refer cases involving points of
 law to the House of Lords. The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (which
 consists of senior judges and is functionally distinct from the legislative arm of the
 House) is the final court of appeal in the UK. Once all these appeals have been ex-
 
 
 1125
 hausted, defendants in England and Wales may appeal to the Home Secretary to
 refer a case back to the courts if fresh evidence has emerged which casts doubt on
 the conviction. (Appeals may be made to the Northern Ireland Office and the Scot-
 land Office in those jurisdictions.)
 Since 1989, following referrals from the Home Secretary, courts in England have
 overturned the convictions of 18 persons previously imprisoned in connection with
 Provisional IRA terrorist attacks in the 1970's. A precedent has been established
 that all evidence held by the prosecution, whether or not intended for use in court,
 may be released to the defense at the judge's discretion.
 Perceived miscarriages of justice prompted the Government in March 1991 to ap-
 point a Royal Commission to review all aspects of the criminal justice system m
 England and Wales. The Commission spent 2 years collecting submissions from nu-
 merous professional bodies, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals, and
 commissiomng surveys of lawyers, defendants, and the general public on how the
 administration of justice is perceived. The Commission's report was released in 1993
 and includes 352 recommendations. The following recommendations have generated
 the most discussion: credible confession evidence should be allowed, if the judge
 gives a strong warning to the jury- in so-called either way cases-triable in either
 a magistrate's court or the Crown 6ourt; where the case is tried is dependent upon
 the severity of the case-a defendant should not have the right to insist on trial
 by jury, the defense should disclose its theory of the case after the prosecution has
 disclosed its case; an independent criminal cases review authority that would send
 cases to the Court of Appeal (instead of the Home Office) should be established- and
 continuous video recording of all custody offices, passages, and stairways should be
 introduced as soon as possible. The proposal that the defense should reveal its case
 theory and the denial of a defendant's right to opt for a jury in an either way case
 stirred the most controversy. Some proposals from the report were included in the
 crime bill introduced into Parliament in December (see below).
 Although the Commission did not study Northern Ireland, the Government indi-
 cated it would consider whether changes implemented as a result of the Commis-
 sion's findings might also be applied inNorthern Ireland.
 In October the Home Secretary announced a series of proposals designed to crack
 down on rising crime rates throughout the UK, some of which have caused concern
 among human rights monitors. These include allowing judges, at their discretion,
 to instruct juries that they could draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's re-
 fusal to answer questions during interrogation or trial; ending the presumption in
 favor of bail for serious or repeated offense; and creating new categories of terrorism
 offenses. The proposals were included in a criminal justice bill introduced into Par-
 liament in December. Opposition parties and human and civil rights groups particu-
 larly criticized the erosion of the right to remain silent.
 In 1973 the Government suspended the right to trial by jury for certain terrorist-
 related offenses in Northern Ireland because of intimidation of the judiciary, jurors,
 and lawyers. In such cases, a "Diplock Court," in which a single judge presides over
 a trial without jury, is used. The judge in a Diplock Court must justify his or her
 decision to convict in a document that becomes part of the court record, and appeal
 courts may overturn Diplock Court convictions on substantive as well as legal
 grounds. These courts have been widely criticized. The Government claims that the
 conviction rate for defendants pleading not guilty in Diplock Courts is virtually
 identical to the rate in regular courts,but one human rights group has contested
 this claim, citing other statistics that indicate a 50 percent higher conviction rate
 in Diplock Courts in 1991. The group also notes that most Dip ock convictions are
 based on uncorroborated confessions.
 A court in Northern Ireland may draw whatever inference it deems proper, in-
 cluding an inference of  ilt, if a subject remains silent during interrogation bypo-
 lice or at trial, though he cannot be convicted solely on the basis of such an infer-
 ence. The change was intended to deal with a Provisional IRA tactic of advising
 members not to say anything under interrogation, then to present a surprise alibi
 at trial, but it substantially erodes the presumption of innocence and the right not
 to be compelled to testify against oneself or confess guilt. Furthermore, it is part
 of the general criminal law of Northern Ireland and applies to all criminal suspects,
 not only terrorist suspects.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy is generally respected in both law and custom, though see below
 on Northern Ireland. Warrants are normally required for a police search of private
 premises. However, under the EPA, on-duty members of the armed forces or police-
 men may enter any premises or other place if they consider it necessary to preserve
 peace or maintain order. The Act requires a standard of "reasonable grounds of sus-
 picion" before a dwelling may be entered without a warrant.
 
 
 1126
 In Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, where distrust of the Government
 has deep historical roots, many believe that the conduct of some members of the se-
 curity forces in carrying out security checks constitutes unwarranted harassment
 and intimidation. The Government conducts intensive training of security personnel
 in proper procedures but acknowleges that official guidelines are still sometimes vio-
 lated.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Strongly held common law tradition, an inde-
 pendent press, and &. democratic political system combine to secure freedom of
 speech and press. .Viewpoints critical of the Government are well represented. Brit-
 ish print media are dominated by a handful of national daily newspapers all pri-
 vat-ly owned and highly independent (though often generally aligned with one of
 the major politicm  parties). About half the electronic media are run by the British
 Broadcasting Service (BBC), which is funded by the Government but enjoys com-
 plete editonal independence. The remainder are run by corporations under renew-
 able government license.
 The Government continued toprohibit radio and television in the UK from broad-
 casting the voices of members of proscribed terrorist organizations such as the Pro-
 visional IRA, and of representatives of Sinn Fein (the legal political arm of the Pro-
 visional IRA), as well as the voices of those who 'solicit, support, or invite support
 for such organizations." Critics charge that the vagueness othis last category in-
 timidates broadcasters into applying the ban even in ambiguous cases. However,
 there are no restrictions on reporting such persons' words, and broadcasters may
 and do use actors with similar accents to read the words in synchronization with
 the lips of the actual speaker. Exceptions to the ban are made for coverage of elec-
 tion campaipns and pariamentary proceedings.
 Human rights and civil liberties organizations continued to criticize the Official
 Secrets Act of 1990, which prohibits disclosure of a broad range of foreign policy and
 national security information. They claim that, in the absence of freedom of informa-
 tion legislation, actions of the Government are effectively shielded from the public,
 even in instances where government agencies have acted improperly or illegally. Al-
 leged offenses under the Act may be tried in secret and the Government need not
 dis lose its justification for holding a secret trial. In practice, however, the Act is
 seldom invoked and has not prevented the disclosure of numerous internal govern-
 ment documente and instances of alleged wrongdoing. Attempts by the Government
 in the 1980's to prosecute officials who leaked documents generally failed.
 The Government demonstrated its commitment to freedom of speech by providing
 olice protection to author Salman Rushdie, the subject of an incitement to murder
 Yformer Iranian leader Khomeini, and by affording Rushdie a series of meetings
 with senior British officials. The Government has stated that the refusal of Iranian
 authorities to repudiate the incitement to murder, or to lift the bounty offered for
 his death by an Iranian organization, prevents the restoration of full relations be-
 tween the two countries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Public Order Act of 1986
 gives police broad powers to restrict or ban public demonstrations, marches, and as-
 semblies when they deem that violence or vandalism is likely to result. The Act is
 seldom invoked, but has been used in recent years to prevent "New Age Travelers"
 from gathering on private property or at ancient monuments such as Stonehenge.
 The PTA and EPA include sections prohibiting membership in, or support of, organi-
 zations involved in terrorism. These organizations are specifically listed in the stat-
 utes. The lists do not include political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.--Government policy a.d general practice ensure freedom
 of religion. Britain has two established churches legally recognized as official
 churches of the State: in England the (Anglican) Church of England, and in Scot-
 land the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the Constitution
 Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination by public authorities on the basis of religious
 belief or political opinion (see Section 5 onerning the Fair Employment Act).Min-
 isters of the Church of England and the Church of Scotland are ineligible to sit in
 the House of Commons. However, the most senior ministers of the established reli-
 gions hold seats in the House of Lords.
 The Government provides funds for many schools maintained by various reli.ious
 denominations, including. Anglicans, Catholics, Methodists, and Jews. In May 1992,
 the High Court ruled that a local council's decision to deny funding to a Muslim-
 run school was "manifestly unfair" and that the Education Secretary should recon-
 side-r. In August the decision not to fund the school was reconfirmed. In Northern
 Ireland, the Government provides full funding for nonsectarian (but overwhelmingly
 Protestant) state schools. For denominational (mostly Catholic) schools, the Govern-
 
 
 1127
 ment provides 100 percent of operating costs and 85 percent of capital costs. In De-
 cember 1992 the Government announced that denominational schools could qualify
 for full state funding if no single (sectarian) group comprised a majority of the
 school's board of governors.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens of the UK enjoy freedom of movement within the country and
 in foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, with very limited exceptions as noted
 below. The Home Secretary may exclude from Great Britain anyone connected with
 terrorism in Northern Ireland, unless that person was born in Great Britain or has
 been resident there for 3 years. Similar authority is granted to the Secretary of
 State for Northern Ireland to exclude persons not native to or resident in that prov-
 ince. In ordering exclusion, the Secretary of State need only be 'satisfied" that a
 person is or hasbeen involved in the commission, preparation, or instigation of acts
 of terrorism. Currently 92 persons are subject to exclusion orders, including 2 new
 orders issued in 1993 by the Home Office. In April John Matthews was arrested in
 London and detained for 10 weeks in connection with a Provisional IRA bombing.
 When the case came to court in July, the prosecution dropped charges, but Mat-
 thews was immediately served with an exclusion order and flown back to Northern
 Ireland. Several Members of Parliament, human rights groups, and most of the Brit-
 ish media objected to the exclusion order. In October the exclusion order on Sinn
 Fein president Gerry Adams was reinstated after 10 years during which he had
 been elected to Parliament but had not traveled to Britain. Exclusion orders are
 contentious because the Secretary of State need not reveal the grounds for exclu-
 sion, the evidence is not tested in any court, and there is no formal right of appeal
 to the courts.
 Immigration rules require that all requests for asylum be considered by the Home
 Office in accordance with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.
 The Government makes generous provision for political refugees, but faced with an
 exponential rise in asylum applications in recent years, it introduced legislation to
 speed processing of unsubstantiated requests. Human rights groups claim the legis-
 lation would undermine Britain's commitment to provide haven for legitimate refu-
 gees. In 1992 approximately 24,000 people (excluding dependents) applied for asy-
 lum. This was about 20,000 fewer than in 1991. The Government believes the de-
 crease is largely due to a more rigorous applicant recording system. Approximately
 5 percent of the applicants received asylum; most of the remainder were granted
 exceptional leave to stay in the UK. In July former Home Secretary Baker was
 found in contempt of court for failing to stay the deportation of a Zairian teacher,
 whom the court had granted a right to remain in the UK.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government is formed on the basis of a majority of seats in the House of
 Commons, which are contested in elections held at intervals not longer than 5 years.
 Participation in the political process is open to all persons and parties. All citizens
 18 years of age and older may vote. Northern Ireland has city and district councils,
 as in the rest of the UK, but with somewhat fewer powers. England and Wales also
 have county councils, while Northern Ireland does not. (Scotland's structure is dif-
 ferent still.) From 1922 to 1972, Northern Ireland had a devolved provincial Par-
 liament at Stormont, which was suspended because its domination by the unionist
 majority was seen as contributing to the troubles. Several attempts have been made
 since then to restore devolved government. Another major effort continued in 1993.
 Women and minorities face no legal constraints on their ability to participate in
 the political process through voting or holding office. The Head of State is a Woman,
 the Head of Government was a woman from 1979 to 1990, two women are members
 of the present Cabinet, and the deputy leader of the main opposition party is a
 woman. The Labor Party has initiated a policy of reserving a substantial number
 of candidacies for women, with the qoal of equalizing the number of its male and
 female Members of Parliament (M.P. s). Several members of minority ethnic groups
 serve in parliament. However, voter turnout among some ethnic minorities is far
 below that of the majority community, and some women M.P.'s complain that late-
 night sittings and lack of child care facilities pose unfair obstacles to female politi-
 cians.
 Most British dependent territories--Hong Kong is an exception-have small popu-
 lations, under 60,000, and all are ruled by appointed governors or administrators
 assisted by executive councils (usually appointed) and legislative assemblies or
 councils (partly elected).

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A large number of local nongovernmental human rights organizations operate
 freely with no government interference or restriction. In 1973 a Standing Advisory
 Commission on Human Rights was established by the Government to monitor
 human rights in Northern Ireland, although the Government has declined to adopt
 many of its recommendations.
 A number of international nongovernmental human rights organizations, includ-
 ing Amnesty International, are based in the UK. The Government cooperates fully
 with international inquiries into alleged violations of human rights and usually
 takes steps to rectify its own laws and policies when they are found inconsistent
 with human rights agreements to which it is a party.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law in Great Britain bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, national-
 ity, or national or ethnic origin and outlaws incitement to racial hatred (see below).
 Women.-Equal opportunity for both sexes is protected by law. An Equal Opportu-
 nities Commission (EOC) supports persons whobring discrimination cases be ore in-
 dustrial tribunals and courts, and it produces guidelines on good practice for em-
 ployers. Employed women throughout the UK earned approximately 25 percent less
 than their male counterparts in comparable positions.
 In 1992 the number of complaints filed with the EOC, including those involving
 sexual harassment, reportedly increased almost 65 percent. Complaints from males
 made up about 40 percent of the total. The Inspectrate of Constabulary, in an offi-
 cia report, said there were "serious" problems of sexual harassment and denial of
 equal opportunities in the country's police forces. On December 8, Sarah Locker was
 awarded an out of court settlement of 32,000 pounds (approximately $50,000), an
 apology from the Metropolitan Police Commiasioner, and a prmtion. Scotla.nd Y~ard
 decided to set up a women's support network and begin training for all ranks in
 equal opportunity and race awareness.
 although there were continuing reports of careerwprgres by women in most sec-
 tors of the economy, the adequacy of ritih law andad Onitration in dealing with
 sex discrimination was subjected to a series of legal challenges. In August 1992, the
 European Court of Justice ruled that the UK's statutory limit on financial awards
 in discrimination cases, th  equivalent of $16,500, was illegal. Shortly after that nl-
 ing, the Trade Unions Congress (TUC), Britain's central labor organization, riled a
 complaint with the European Commission charging that the Government, by abol-
 ishing the statutory wage councils (which set minimum wages in certain low-paid
 and largely female industries), was violating its obligations under EC law to provide
 the affected women workers with equal opportunity. (Other aspects of the alition
 of the wage counoils were the subject of a separate complaint to the International
 Labor Organization  (ILO); see Section 6.b.) The EOC endorsd the TUC action and
 announced it would be filing its own complaint with the EC, alleging that the UK
 legislation, in its entirety, "fails to provide effective access to justice."
 The same statute which abolished the wage councils also established EC-man-
 dated maternity leave of 14 weeks, and protections against dismissal on maternity-
 related gound.
 Women have equal prerty rights and equal rights in the divorce courts, and in
 1993 a divorced wife's claim to a share of her husband's pension was upheld in
 court. Although there are no reliable statistics, exerts on women's studies suspect
 that violence against women is the predominant ?orm of violence in the UK. How-
 ever, in an effort to educate and encourage women who have been the victims of
 abuse, the Women's Aid Federation, a private voluntary organization, organized an
 advertising campaign outlining the problems of abuse and stressing that women
 need not suffer them. The advertisement gives phone numbers where women may
 seek help. It has been disseminated widely. Offenders in domestic violence cases are
 prosecuted and are subject to imprisonment. Victims of battery and rape sre given
 assistance, including accommodation and counseling, and the courts have held that
 nonconsensual marital sex can constitute a criminal offense.
 Women in Northern Ireland's Maghaberry Prison maintained that the conditions
 under which they were imprisoned were a usive and discriminatory, and a group
 brought an action for sex discrimination against the Northern Ireland Office. They
 cmpclained that, compared to the male prisoners at Maghaberry, women had short-
 er visiting hours, poorer facilities for visits, and, as opposed to male prisoners, no
 prvisions for care of visiting children. The women further claimed they had less
 access to educational and exercise facilities than men.
 
 
 1129
 Children.-In 1989 Parliament passed the Children's Act, which covers England
 and Wales and highlights growing acceptance of children's rights in domestic law.
 The basic premise of the Kct is twofold: first, the best interests of the child must
 be taken into account when decisions are made regarding the child; and second, chil-
 dren should be consulted about their wishes and desires. Various governmental
 agencies (e.g., healtht education, social servies) also play a role in childrens' law.
 The overlapping legislation paints a complex legislative picture. However, it is clear
 that children have the right to apply for court orders, to give or withhold consent
 for medical treatment (where they have sufficient cognitive ability to make an in-
 formed decision), to make complaints to the relevant local authority, to have their
 ethnic, inguistic, and religious background onsidered, to have reasonable contact
 with their family (usually applied in a circumstance where there has been abuse),
 and to be consulted rearding their desires. Scotland and Northern Ireland employ
 principles and law si  ar to that found in the children's act. Children receive gen-
 erous benefits packages. Children's advocates have commented that the laws reflect
 a growing acceptance of children's rights in domestic law. However they are con-
 cerned about cuts in social services to children, inconsistent application of the Chil-
 dren's Act of 1989, and lack of adequate monitoring of the law (e.g., statistics are
 not adequately kept).
 National IRaci IEthnic Minorities.-Approximately three million persons in the
 UK   representing 5V2 percent of the population, belong to ethnic minorities. About
 half of them are Asians of Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi descent. While Brit-
 ish law bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, nationality, or national or
 ethnic origin and outlaws incitement to racial hatred, racial discrimination is not
 specifically outlawed in Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State for Northern Ire-
 land agreed to investigate the scope for possible legislation on racial discrimination
 and determine what additional action should be taken by government departments
 to further enhance equal treatment of ethnic groups. A government-appointed, inde-
 pendent Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) supports persons taking court action
 under the Race Relations Act of 1976, provides guidelines on good practice, and may
 initiate court action. After formally investigating complaints, the CRE may issue no-
 tices requiring that discrimination cease. Such notices are followed up over a 5-year
 period to ensure compliance.
 Although law prohibits discnation based on race, persons of African and South
 Asian origin face substantial discrimination. In 1992 a government study concluded
 that racial discrimination existed at all stages of the criminal justice system. Sev-
 eral studies showed that ethnic minorities were less likely to obtain jobs and mort-
 gages and more likely to live in overcrowded housing than were whites. Members
 of Asian and African minorities were also victims of racial insults and occasional
 "skinhead" violence. The Home Office reported over 7,700 racial incidents in Eng-
 land and Wales in 1992. CRE commented that the great majority involved insults
 or verbal abuse. About a dozen persons have been killed in racial attacks since June
 1992. In April a black youth was stabbed to death by whites at a south London bus
 stop. In September a Bangladeshi youth was badly beaten by a group of whites in
 London's East End, sparking a weekend of violent clashes between Asians and
 whites. In October a black man was beaten, stabbed, and run over with a car by
 three white persons in east London. The Government is strongly opposed to dis-
 crimination and violence and prosecutes cases in which evidence is available.
 Religious Minorities.-Although discrimination in employment on the grounds of
 religious belief or political opinion has been unlawful since 1976, it continued to
 occur in Northern Ireland, including at times by local governments. Within the
 Northern Ireland civil service, the proportion of Catholics under age 36 reflects over-
 all demographic patterns, but they continue to be underrepresented in the upper
 age  rups and grades. A Fair Employment Tribunal adjudicates individual cases
 o a eged discrimination. In 1992 the Fair Employment Commission noted that
 Catholics were not as well represented in the senior management levels of the pub-
 lic work force. In mid-November the civil service announce its intention to increase
 Catholic representation in the senior management levels. Government efforts to in-
 crease recruitment of Catholics into the police force and related security fields have
 been hampered by Provisonal IRA assassinations and death threats, as well as pub-
 lic suspicion of the security forces. For a variety of historical and social reasons, the
 Protestant community controls much of the local economy, and anti-Catholic dis-
 crimination persists in the private sector. Despite government efforts and a recent
 drop in unemployment in Northern Ireland, the Catholic male unemployment rate
 remained 22 times that of Protestant men, partly due to Catholic inability or un-
 willingness to engage in security-related work.
 The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act of 1989 was intended to end employ-
 ment discrimination and aimed at outlawing even unintentional or "indirect' dis-
 
 
 1130
 crimination. All public sector employers and private firms with more than 25 work-
 ers must register with the Fair Employment Commission, monitor the religious com-
 position of their work force, supply annual monitoring reports to the Commission,
 and review their overall employment practices at least once every 3 years. These
 obligations were extended to small firms (employing between 11 and 25 workers) be-
 gnning in 1992. While the Fair Employment Act has been criticized for not estab-
 lishing sufficiently rigorous targets and timetables, it has generally been praised by
 leaders of the Catholic community as a positive step. Employers who fail to comply
 face criminal penalties and loss ofgovernment contracts, and victims of employment
 discrimination may be awarded damages. In 1992, six companies were subject to
 criminal sanctions and fines for failure to comply with the Act.
 People with Disabilities.-According to surveys, 6.5 million inhabitants of the UK
 have disabilities. Official discrimination against disabled persons is not sanctioned.
 However, studies indicate that social discrimination exists. Although the UK does
 not have one overarching law which addresses the rights of disabled people, a num-
 ber of pieces of legislation guarantee social services. Benefits packages for disabled
 people are administered by various governmental departments. The benefits are de-
 signed to provide education, mobility, home care, and access to buildings. Access to
 buildings is generally poor.
 Interest groups point out that the age of most buildings in London makes it dif-
 ficult for a physically disabled person to obtain access even if there are ramps. Many
 buildings do not have elevators. Since 1985, government regulations have required
 that all new buildings meet the access requirements of all individuals with impaired
 mobility. In June 1992, the government made similar regulations for sensory im-
 paired persons.
 Government regulations mandate that by the year 2000 all taxis be wheelchair
 accessible. In 1944 the Government passed the Disabled Person's Employment Act,
 which instituted a quota system requiring businesses with more than 20 employees
 to hire disabled persons as 3 percent of their workforce. There have been 10 pros-
 ecutions under this Act. Government estimates are that 75 percent of companies fail
 to comply with the Act. Statistics with regard to unemployment of the disabled are
 not kept.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form and join representa-
 tive organizations, associate freely, choose representatives, publish journals, openly
 promote members' interests and views, and elect representative assemblies to deter-
 mine union policies and procedures. Unions participate freely in international orga-
 nizations.
 Unions are free of government control but, like employers' associations, must reg-
 ister their accounts with a government-appointed "certification officer." Senior union
 officers must be elected by secret ballot. The law mandates secret ballots before a
 strike call, prohibits unions from disciplining members who reject a legal strike call,
 and allows individual trade union members to lodge complaints against their union
 with a government-appointed "Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Mem-
 bers."
 No specific statutory "right to strike" exists in the UK. Voluntary cessation of
 work may be considered a breach of contract. A system of legal immunities, which
 protected unions from prosecution when engaged in lawful industrial action, was
 narrowed by a series of acts of Parliament introduced in the 1980's. These acts ex-
 cluded secondary strikes and actions judged to have political motives. Unions en-
 couraging such strikes are subject to fines by the courts and may have their assets
 seized. The legislation also restricts the ability of unions to act against subsidiaries
 of prime employers with whom they are in dispute when the subsidiaries are not
 party to the dispute and are the employers of record. This has led to union com-
 plaints that they have no protection against the transfer of work within the cor-
 porate structure (making unions the victims of a form of employer secondary action).
 The 1990 Employment Act made unions liable for all industrial actions, including
 unofficial strikes, unless the unions concerned write to strikers repudiating their ac-
 tion. Unofficial strikers may be legally dismissed. In instances where the right to
 strike is prohibited (e.g., for police officers), there are alternative means to resolve
 differences.
 The Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act of 1993 abolished the Wage
 Councils (see also Section 5 above) and placed new procedural requirements on
 union strikes, dues collection, and membership rules. It also permits private citizens
 to seek damages, with government aid, when denied goods or services through ille-
 gal strike action.
 
 
 1131
 
 Except in the case of the armed forces, the police, or the security services, it is
 illegal to deny a person employment on the ground he or she is not a union member.
 An amendment to the 1993 Act also reverses a court ruling that banned employers
 from offering rinancial inducements to workers in exchange for giving up trade
 union representation.
 The compatibility with Great Britain's international undertakings of parts of the
 recent legislation affecting unions has been subject to challenges by the TUC in var-
 ious European and international bodies (see below and also Section 5).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although there is no legal ob-
 ligation for employers to bargain with workers' representatives, and despite the fact
 that labor-management contracts are not enforceable in the courts collective bar-
 gaining is longstanding and widespread, covering about 40 percent o? the work force.
 Recent British legislation affecting trade union rights and protection have been
 the subject of challenge by the TUC in various international forums (see below and
 also Section 5).
 Workers who believe themselves victims of antiunion discrimination may seek re-
 dress through industrial tribunals. Remedies available include payment of indem-
 nities and reinstatement.
 The adequacies of these protections and the impact of recent legislation on trade
 unions and their members have been the subject of repeated complaints by the TUC
 to the International Labor Organization (ILO), the European Community (EC) and
 the Council of Europe (COE).
 In May 1993, the Governing Body of the ILO endorsed the findings of the Com-
 mittee on Freedom of Association on complaint filed by the TUC. At issue was the
 compatibility of British law and practice with ILO Convention 98 on the Right to
 Organize and Bargain Collectively, as it concerned the circulating of blacklists of
 trade unionists seeking employment. The ILO held that the British Government is
 obliged, inter alia, to protect trade unionists from such discrimination.
 In September 1993, the Committee of Ministers of the COE accepted its Commit-
 tee of Experts' finding that UK labor law was in violation of the European Social
 Charter. The issue, based on a TUC complaint, was that the British legislation
 which permits an employer to dismiss all employees who take part in strikes and
 then, after 3 months' time, selectively rehire them, was incompatible with the Char-
 ter's protection of collective action. The Committee recommended that the Govern-
 ment take this decision into account and notify it of what measures it will adopt.
 As of August 1993, the Committee of Experts of the ILO had before it several
 other outstanding complaints from the TUC concerning various aspects of British
 labor law and practice. These were:
 -the ban on unions at the Government's communications center GCHQ, an al-
 leged violation of Convention 87 on Freedom of Association. The Government is to
 report in 1994 on efforts to negotiate a settlement.
 -various provisions of the Trade Union Act of 1988 which prevent unions from
 disciplining members who refuse to join lawful strikes and bar unions from reim-
 bursing their officials or members. All are alleged violations of Convention 87.
 - the removal of unions' protection from civil liability for strike action and the
 inadequacy of legal protection against the dismissal of strikers. Both are alleged vio-
 lations of Convention 87.
 -the denial to school teachers in England and Wales of the right to have their
 pay determined through collective bargaining. An alleged violation of both Conven-
 tion 87 and 98 (right to organize).
 -various provisions of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act of
 1993, including the abolition of the wage councils (Convention 100 on equal pay),
 abolition of the Mediation Services' mandate to promote collective bargaining, new
 procedural limits on strikes and the collection of dues, and the removal of protection
 from disciplinary action short of dismissal designed to deter trade union member-
 ship. All are alleged to be violations of Conventions 87 and 98.
 Exprt processing zones do not exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-School attendance until the age
 of 16 is compulsory. Children under the age of 16 are not permitted to work in an
 industrial enterprise except as part of an educational course.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated minimum wage. The
 Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act of 1993 abolished the wage council
 system, which prior to August 30, 1993 had established minimum hourly wages and
 overtime rates for adult workers in 26 low-wage industries. The UK does not have
 a law limiting daily or weekly working hours.
 
 
 1132
 
 The Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 requires that the health and safety
 of employees not be placed at risk. A Health and Safety Commission enforces regu-
 lations on these matters and may initiate criminal proceedings. The system of oocu-
 pational health and safety is efficiently managed and operates with the full involve-
 ment of workers' representatives.
