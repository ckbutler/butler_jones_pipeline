 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 k member of the British Commonwealth, Antigua and Barbuda
 zelebrated its fourth anniversary of independence from the
 United Kingdom on November 1, 1985. Respect for human rights
 in Antigua and Barbuda is grounded in its domestic laws and
 reinforced by the democratic political values and traditions
 that evolved before independence and which have continued
 developing since. Its population supports these values and
 expresses dissent openly, aided by a free press. The
 Constitution provides for a parliamentary system of government
 based on majority rule, and requires general elections at
 least every 5 years.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the Antigua
 Defense Force, an 80-man infantry unit. The police are
 organized, trained, and managed according to British law
 enforcement practices. These forces have a good reputation
 for respecting human rights in the performance of their law
 enforcement duties.
 Poverty remains widespread despite active development efforts
 centered on increasing investment. Although the State holds
 equity in some enterprises, the private sector is strong and
 individuals are free to pursue private interests and hold
 private property. Some political opponents of Prime Minister
 Vere C. Bird, Sr., however, complain that their businesses
 have suffered from government retaliation for their political
 activities.
 The nation's human rights record continued to be good in 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No instances of political killing were reported in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances, extralegal detentions or politically
 motivated abductions were reported in 1985.
 c. Torture aid Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and cruel or inhuman
 treatment of prisoners or detainees. These prohibitions are
 respected in practice. Prison conditions are adequate, and
 the authorities permit regular visits by a prisoner's family
 and attorney as well as by members of the clergy.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and detention are prohibited by the
 Constitution and do not occur in practice. Criminal
 defendants are guaranteed the right of habeas corpus, and
 detainees must be brought before a court within 48 hours of
 arrest or detention. No cases of involuntary exile have been
 reported.

 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and
 such practices are not known to take place in Antigua and
 Barbuda.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Criminal defendants are guaranteed a fair, open, and public
 trial. The independent judiciary is widely respected for its
 fairness and professionalism. The highly regarded regional
 West Indies Court of Appeal serves Antigua and Barbuda. The
 Government guarantees legal assistance at its expense to
 persons without means to retain a private attorney.
 There are no political prisoners in Antigua and Barbuda.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Arbitrary police or government actions against a person's
 home, family, or privacy have not been reported. The police
 must obtain a warrant before searching private premises.
 Leftist political groups have charged that the Government
 tampers with their mail, but these allegations have neither
 been supported with evidence nor brought to court.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, the press, and
 other forms of communication. The electronic media--the only
 source of daily local news--are dominated by the Government;
 ABS radio and ABS-TV are state-owned, and the only privately
 owned radio station is controlled by the Prime Minister's
 family. Opposition politicians have complained that they have
 almost no access to air time to present their positions. A
 different situation exists in the nation's print media.
 Weekly newspapers representing the opposition publish a
 variety of opinions and are free to criticize the Government.
 Religious organizations also publish their own newspapers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures the right of peaceful assembly.
 Peaceful public meetings and organized demonstrations are held
 without police interference.
 Less than a majority of Antigua and Barbuda's workers belong
 to unions, but labor organizations are free to organize and
 bargain collectively. The right to strike can be limited if
 the Court of Industrial Relations is involved in a given
 dispute. Unions are free to affiliate with international
 labor organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is free exercise of religious beliefs. The population
 is overwhelmingly Protestant, but adherents of other religious
 denominations proselytize openly without stigma or government
 interference.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The movement of citizens within the country is not restricted
 by law or practice. Travel outside the country is generally
 unrestricted, although the Government has confiscated the
 passports of a few political opponents to ensure their
 attendance at court proceedings. Opponents claim these court
 cases to be politically motivated, but the judiciary enjoys a
 reputation for independence and respect for the law.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Antigua and Barbuda has a multiparty political system which
 accommodates widely divergent views. All citizens 18 years of
 age and older may register and vote. Individual parties
 conduct voter registration drives free from government
 interference. The Government is obligated by law to hold
 voter registration during a fixed period each year.
 Prime Minister Bird's Antigua Labor Party won an overwhelming
 victory in the April 1984 elections, winning every
 constituency in Antigua. In Barbuda, an independent won the
 sole seat and became the Government's only parliamentary
 opposition. Despite the lopsided ALP victory, the elections
 were considered to be fair and open.
 One of Prime Minister Bird's sons is Minister of External
 Affairs, Economic Development, Tourism, and Energy; another is
 Minister of Public Utilities and Communications. The
 opposition energetically attacks the Bird Government,
 particularly on the issue of alleged government corruption.
 On the smaller island of Barbuda, which has less than 2
 percent of the country's total population, separatist
 sentiments remain a political problem for the Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Internationally recognized human rights organizations have not
 expressed particular interest in Antigua and Barbuda; there
 were no requests for investigations or inquiries into alleged
 violations in 1985. The Government is sensitive to human
 rights issues and has condemned abuses elsewhere.
 Amnesty International did not mention Antigua and Barbuda in
 its 1985 report. Freedom House describes the country as
 "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The country's population of approximately 81,000 is growing at
 the rate of 2.6 percent annually. Tourism dominates the
 economy of Antigua and Barbuda; half of the country's gross
 domestic product (GDP) is derived directly or indirectly from
 tourism. Per capita GDP was estimated at $1,537 in 1982.
 Following 2 years of low growth, the economy picked up
 dramatically owing to increases in tourist arrivals.
 Manufacturing accounts for another 10 percent of GDP, but
 higher tariffs and new nontariff barriers erected by other
 Caribbean Community members have limited growth in this

 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 sector. Factory closures and bankruptcies have resulted in
 increased unemployment and government budgetary shortfalls, as
 tax revenues from manufacturing dry up. Efforts to attract
 foreign investors continue, but the primary problem remains
 the identification of potential foreign markets for
 domestically manufactured goods.
 The decline of agriculture after 1967, when Antigua and
 Barbuda became semiautonomous, caused the countryside to lose
 population to the city. With agriculture now accounting for
 about 7 percent of GDP, the Government is promoting a "back to
 the land" movement, providing financial incentives to young
 men and women willing to work in the agricultural sector.
 The Government has continued its capital development program
 for education and health. Adult literacy approaches 90
 percent, and enrollment of eligible children in primary
 schools is 85 percent. The Government has earmarked funds to
 upgrade secondary and higher education. Infant mortality has
 dropped to 22.4 per 1,000 live births.
 The legal minimum working age is 13, a law which is
 respected. The workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and workers
 are guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks annual leave. There are
 no occupational health and safety laws or regulations. The
 minimum wage established by law is arguably less than that 6n
 which a person can be reasonably expected to live.
 The role of women in society is not restricted by law, but
 tradition limits women to home and family, particularly in
 rural areas. As elsewhere in the region, these traditional
 roles are changing. The Government has begun programs to
 provide enhanced educational opportunities for both sexes as
 well as family planning, which many expect to lead to greater
 participation by women in Antigua and Barbuda's public,
 social, and political life.
 Two female senators sit in Parliament, and are the highest
 ranking female political figures in the country. The
 Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health and the Chief
 Establishment Officer are both women. A woman also heads the
 Department of Tourism. There is a "Woman's Desk" in the
 Government to monitor compliance with the laws and statutes
 regarding women and to safeguard their legal rights. Ninety
 percent of the Assistant Permanent Secretaries in the
 Government are women, as are 6 out of 10 personnel in the
 Civil Service. Women receive equal pay for equal work by law.
