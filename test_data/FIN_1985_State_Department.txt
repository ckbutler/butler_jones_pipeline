 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic, a democratic state built
 upon the principle of the rule of law. Sovereign power in
 Finland rests with the people as represented by their
 delegates assembled in Parliament. Legislative power is
 exercised by Parliament. Supreme executive power is vested in
 the President. A Cabinet, consisting of a Prime Minister and
 16 ministers and responsible to Parliament, works with the
 President in governing the country. Judicial power is
 exercised by an independent judiciary headed by the Supreme
 Court and Supreme Administrative Court. The Finnish people
 freely choose by direct election a 200-member unicameral
 Parliament every 4 years. They also choose electors every
 6 years who in turn. elect the President. At present, there
 are nine political parties represented in the Parliament, four
 of which form a center-left coalition government.
 The police and security forces are controlled by elected
 officials and supervised by the courts.
 Finland has a mixed economy with state-owned, privately owned,
 and publicly owned companies. Citizens are free to pursue
 their legitimate private interests, hold private property, and
 engage in economic activity without government interference.
 Aliens in most cases may own real property only with the
 Government's permission and are prohibited from engaging in
 political activity.
 During 1985, there were no reported violations in Finland of
 fundamental human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political motives by the Government or opposition
 political organizations does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearances, abduction, or
 clandestine detention by official or opposition forces in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. By law, prisoners must be treated with respect for
 their human dignity and without distinction made on the basis
 of race, color, sex, language, nationality, religious or
 political conviction, social position, wealth, or any other
 grounds. The security police are subject by law to judicial
 scrutiny.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment or exile is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. A suspect may be
 detained by the police for questioning for 3 days; for special
 reasons not specified in the law this period may be extended
 
 
 969
 FINLAND
 for 14 additional days, though the court must be notified of
 this fact. During the investigative period, the accused may
 be denied access to a lawyer. Following formal arrest, the
 accused is permitted free access to the lawyer of his choice.
 The state will pay legal fees for indigents. A court hearing
 must take place within 8 days of notification of the arrest if
 in a city or within 30 days if in rural areas. The
 circumstances of an arrest are subject to judicial review when
 the accused is brought to trial. Should the arrest be shown
 to have been incorrect, or should the accused be found
 innocent, he may apply to the same court for civil damages for
 loss of freedom.
 The Government has introduced a bill proposing amendments to
 the pretrial procedure. The investigative detention period
 will be shortened considerably, and the accused will have
 access to a lawyer during that time. The purpose is to
 achieve uniformity with the practice in other Western
 countries.
 The institutions of habeas corpus and bail do not exist as
 such in Finland. Those accused of serious crimes must by law
 remain in custody. Those accused of minor offenses may be
 released on personal recognizance at the court's discretion.
 Preventive detention is authorized only during a declared
 state of war for narrowly defined offenses such as treason,
 mutiny, and trafficking in weapons. Supervisory personnel
 from the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Interior, as
 well as the parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of
 Justice, have authority to enter prisons and order the release
 of prisoners held without charge. By law, Finnish citizens
 cannot be exiled.
 New legislation on the status of conscientious objectors to
 Finland's obligatory military service was passed in June
 1985. It will take effect at the beginning of 1987 for a
 trial period of 5 years. Giving the individual the option of
 serving in the military or becoming a conscientious objector,
 the law abolishes the investigative board which previously
 decided whether to confer the status of conscientious
 objector. The new law also lengthens the alternative civilian
 service for conscientious objectors to 16 months, twice the
 minimum length of military service. Jehovah's Witnesses are
 exempted from military service altogether under the new law.
 The passage of the bill stemmed from the investigative board's
 rejection of an increasing number of applications for civilian
 service in recent years. Under the old law, those, including
 Jehovah's Witnesses, who refused unarmed service within the
 defense forces and were not granted alternative civilian
 service, went to jail.
 In its 1985 Report (covering the year 1984), Amnesty
 International named one such person sentenced to 9 months'
 imprisonment in January 1984 a prisoner of conscience. He
 accepted alternative service and was released in March 1984.
 In October 1985 Amnesty International declared two other
 conscientious objectors to be prisoners of conscience. It
 indicated that 19 other prospective conscientious objectors
 whose cases were awaiting trial would be declared prisoners of
 conscience if convicted and sentenced. It also criticized the
 longer period of alternative civilian service in the new law
 as punitive in nature.

 FINLAND
 Finland has ratified International Labor Organization
 Convention 105 prohibiting compulsory labor and observes its
 provisions.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Finnish citizens and aliens legally
 present in Finland have the right to counsel. Charges must be
 clearly stated. Local courts may decide to conduct a trial
 behind closed doors in juvenile, matrimonial, and guardianship
 cases, or when the publicity would offend morality or endanger
 the national security. In "national security" cases, the
 judge may withhold any or all information pertaining to
 charges against individuals, verdicts, and sentencing.
 Sanctions may be imposed if such information is made public.
 Civilians may not be tried by military courts except in time
 of war. There are no separate "security" courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, including
 prohibition of eavesdropping and mail tampering, are
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 For the commemorative meeting in Helsinki of the Conference
 for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in July and
 August 1985, a special powers act was passed authorizing the
 police to take measures for the protection of the meeting's
 participants. On an exceptional basis, it gave the police the
 right to inspect the person, residence, car, or mail of
 anyone, without the usual justification. In effect from
 mid-July until the end of August 1985, it was applied in only
 a few cases, mainly to order that windows facing the
 Conference Hall be closed. Several human rights demonstrators
 in front of the hall-were peacefully removed during the
 meeting in accordance with the law.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 According to law and in actual practice, an effective
 judiciary, an independent press, and a functioning democratic
 political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and
 press. There have been no instances of abuse or legal
 decisions restricting freedom of the press. The press
 occasionally exercises self-restraint in treating issues
 deemed to be potentially harmful to the national interest but
 is under no compulsion from the authorities to do so.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is guaranteed by
 the Constitution. However, if the purpose of the association
 is to influence political issues, only Finnish citizens may
 participate. Public demonstrations require notification to
 the police. An anti-Soviet demonstration by Baltic refugees
 and their descendants in Helsinki on the eve of the CSCE
 celebration was permitted in accordance with Finnish law.
 However, the police peacefully dispersed a later demonstration
 at the Soviet Embassy of which police had not been notified.
 
 
 971
 FINLAND
 Some of the protesters in the latter demonstration were
 briefly detained but not charged.
 The right of workers to join trade unions is constitutionally
 guaranteed. Likewise, trade unions are constitutionally
 guaranteed the right to organize, assemble peacefully, bargain
 collectively, and strike. They enjoy a protected status and
 play an important role in political and economic life. The
 average rate of organization is 85 percent among the labor
 force in Finland. The central organization of Finnish Trade
 Unions (SAK), a 1-million-member confederation of blue-collar
 workers, dominates the trade union movement. Three other
 central organizations cover white-collar, professional, and
 technical employees. All trade unions are democratically
 organized and managed and are independent of both government
 and political parties. Most trade unions maintain relations
 with their Nordic counterparts. The four trade union
 confederations also maintain contact with the Soviet All-Union
 Central Council of Trade Unions. SAK and one white-collar
 confederation are members of the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions. SAK, through two of its affiliates,
 also has ties to the Communist-dominated World Federation of
 Trade Unions. Finnish trade unions participate in the
 International Labor Organization.
 The Finnish Government encourages voluntary organizations and
 subsidizes many private groups formed to achieve a public
 purpose. They are permitted to maintain relations with other
 international groups in both Communist and Western countries.
 However, if the membership of an organization is more than
 one-third foreign, it requires the Government's permission to
 operate.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Finland has two state religions: the Lutheran and the
 Orthodox. Taxes are collected by the Government from members
 to support these churches. Other Christians, Muslims, and
 Jews enjoy unrestricted freedom of worship. Approximately
 89.5 percent of the population of Finland belongs to the
 Lutheran Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Finns are free to travel in Finland and abroad. Within the
 area of the Nordic countries--Finland, Norway, Denmark,
 Iceland, and Sweden--they may travel without passports. In
 addition, they do not need exit visas for travel to other
 countries. Over 200,000 Finns have emigrated to Sweden in the
 past two decades to seek employment, and over one-half of that
 number have returned. No restrictions have been placed on
 emigration or repatriation.
 The debate on the criteria which the Finnish Government
 applies when deciding to grant political asylum continued in
 1985. The Government maintains that, "in accordance with the
 Geneva Agreement, Finland gives asylum to individuals arriving
 (in Finland) who have the characteristics of refugees
 determined by the agreement." The Ministry of the Interior
 categorically denies that any agreement exists with the Soviet
 Union regarding repatriation of Soviet would-be refugees. In
 1985, the Government disclosed that it had given temporary
 visas to three Estonians who had entered Finland illegally.

 Finland does not grant asylum to people wishing to escape
 economic hardship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Finland is a multiparty parliamentary democracy in which all
 citizens over the age of 18 freely elect their representatives
 from'among multiple candidates representing a wide spectrum of
 political ideologies. The country has the longest tradition
 of women's suffrage in Europe. Three women are Ministers in
 the Cabinet, and 62 are representatives in the Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Finland participates actively in international human rights
 organizations and was a member of the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission in 1985. Finland has not been the subject
 of an international investigation of alleged human rights
 violations. Within Finland,-several organizations monitor
 human rights performance, including the Finnish Red Cross, the
 government-sponsored Equality Council, the Women's Rights
 Union, and Amnesty International. A Finnish Helsinki Watch
 Group was established in July 1985 but was not very active
 during the year. Under the auspices of the Abo Academy, a
 Swedish-language'university in Turku, a Human Rights Institute
 was founded in the spring of 1985. Its purpose is to conduct
 human rights research and studies as well as to distribute
 information.
 Amnesty International's 1985 Report, as noted in Section l.d.,
 included a section on Finland which discussed the status of
 conscientious objectors. Freedom House rated Finland "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Finland has a population of 4.9 million and its per capita
 income was $10,740 in 1984. A prosperous industrial market
 economy, Finland has privately owned, cooperative, and
 state-owned property enterprises. Private property is
 protected by law. Between August 1984 and August 1985, the
 level of unemployment was 6.1 percent, and the rate of
 inflation dropped to 5.8 percent.
 Basic human needs are fully met for the entire population
 without discrimination. The infant mortality rate is 6.2 per
 1,000 live births in the first 12 months, and life expectancy
 at birth is 73.4 years. According to World Bank statistics,
 primary school enrollment was 93 percent in 1982, but the
 Finnish Ministry of Education states the correct figure was
 over 99 percent, as no one is exempted from compulsory primary
 school education. Finland enjoys a virtual 100 per cent
 literacy rate.
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 16 years.
 However, the law permits youths of 14 and 15 years of age to
 spend up to two-thirds of their school holidays at work up to
 a maximum of 7 hours per day and 36 hours per week. Workers
 under 18 years of age also work less than a standard workweek,
 and night work is prohibited.
 
 
 973
 FIN
 The minimum wage varies according to the industry but is
 roughly $3.57 per hour. This provides a decent living for
 workers and their families. A 40-hour workweek is standard,
 although persons working straight shift work have a 36-hour
 workweek, and those in certain occupations can work longer in
 a week subject to an 80- or 120-hour maximum in 2 or 3 weeks
 respectively.
 Several laws and regulations protect workers while on the job
 and in transit to and from their work. Enforcement machinery
 includes the National Board of Labor Protection and labor
 protection delegates elected by the workers themselves.
 Cooperation between labor and management in safety and health
 has been mandatory by statute since 1974.
 To redress existing inequities between the sexes, the
 government-established Council for Equality coordinates and
 sponsors legislation to meet the needs of women as workers,
 mothers, widows, and retirees. During 1985 Parliament passed
 two bills designed to improve the status of women in Finland.
 The first, a comprehensive equal rights bill, ensures equal
 treatment for women in the work place, and the second, a
 family name bill, permits women to retain their maiden names
 after marriage as their only surname. The law also makes it
 possible for the husband to take his wife's name.
 Government statistics indicate that in 1985 women's wages and
 salaries remained, on the average, at 77 percent of those of
 men. The rate of participation in the labor market for
 Finnish women in 1985 was 65.7 percent; for men it was 74.3
 percent.
