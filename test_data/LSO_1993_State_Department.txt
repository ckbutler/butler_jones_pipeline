 LESOTHO
 Lesotho held democratic elections in March, marking the end of 7 years of mili-
 tary rule and 23 years of unconstitutional rule. The Basotholand Congress Party
 (BCP) won all 65 seats in the Assembly (lower house) and formed a Government
 under Prime Minister Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle. The upper legislative house, the Senate,
 is comprised of the Kingdom's 22 principal chiefs and 10 members nominated by the-
 Council of State. Given the absence in the Assembly of any opposition party rep-
 resentatives, the BCP offered to nominate 4 opposition party members among the
 11 appointive Senate seats. Only one clearly identified opposition politician accept-
 ed. Several Cabinet members were also appointed from the ranks of the opposition.
 Coincident with the assumption of power by the BCP Government on April 2,
 
 
 143
 Lesotho's new Constitution came into force. After the election, controversy over who
 should rightfully occupy Lesotho's throne died down. King Letsie III continued as
 monarch despite the presence of his father, ex-King Moshoeshoe I, who returned
 in 1992 from exile imposed by the military government in 1990. The new Constitu-
 tion clearly defines the king's role as ceremonial.
 The Royal Lesotho Defense Force (RLDF) of about 2,500 troops is responsible for
 internal and border security. The RLDF is assisted by the Royal Lesotho Mounted
 Police (RLMP) of about 2,000 men and women. The RLDF is responsible to the Min-
 ister of Defense (a portfolio held by the Prime Minister) while the RLMP answers
 to the Home Affairs Minister. However, both services' actions and policies are under
 the ultimate control of the service chiefs through the Defense Commission, not
 under the control of Parliament. Members of both forces occasionally beat or other-
 wise mistreat detainees.
 A landlocked country surrounded by South Africa Lesotho is almost entirely de-
 pendent on its sole neighbor for trade, finance, employment, and access to the out-
 side world. A large proportion of the adult male work force is employed in South
 African mines. Miners' remittances play a substantial role in Lesotho's balance of
 ayments, accounting for around 40 percent of gross national product in 1992.
 tate-owned organizations predominate in the agroindustrial and agribusiness sec-
 tors, but private sector activity dominates in manufacturing and construction.
 Under Lesotho's traditional chieftainship structure, land is controlled by the chiefs
 and owned by the kingdom, precludingprivate ownership of property.
 Human rights in 1993 were accorded increased attention by the civilian Govern-
 ment but serious abuses occurred. The elections were peaceful, free, and fair, accord-
 ing to over 130 international observers, and during the election process the freedoms
 of speech, press, and assembly expanded. However, police brutality continued
 against detainees, criminal suspects, and trade unionists. No government action to
 curb police brutality was taken. The Government appeared to condone harsh police
 measures against legitimate trade union activities. Women's rights continued to be
 severely restricted. Parliament scaled back but did not completely remove restric-
 tions on freedom of assembly. The Internal Security Act of 1984 (ISA), as amended
 in 1986, with its draconian limitations on basic civil and  litical liberties, including
 provisions for lengthy detentions without trial, remained in force. The Government
 acknowledged that a number of laws were inconsistent with human rights guaran-
 tees of the new Constitution but did not act to repeal them.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reported incidents of
 political killing in 1993, but local press and parliamentary inquiries identified at
 least two extrajudicial killings. The Government announced its intention to charge
 two RLMP troopers with murder in one case. Excesses by law enforcement agencies
 continued, including fatal shootings of criminal suspects. One person was killed by
 police during a labor dispute. There were no investigations into any of the dozens
 of allegations of police brutality, including deaths in custody, suffered prior to 1993
 by trade unionists and criminalsuspects.
 b. Disappearance. -There were no reports of politically related disappearances in
 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Credible reports of police brutality, including beatings of detainees, continued dur-
 ing 1993. There were continued reports of random beatings of civilians by police and
 military personnel. On July 2, police attacked and clubbed trade unionists marching
 peacefully to present a petition; several marchers were hospitalized. There were sev-
 eral other incidents of police brutality against trade unionists, notably those in-
 volved in strikes against garment manufacturers. No known investigations or other
 official measures were launched as a result of these practices. Prison facilities are
 overcrowded and in need of repair. There was no progress on an investigation into
 allegations that RLDF Captain Samuel Tumo was tortured during his incarceration
 on a charge of murder in 1990.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-About a dozen cases of arbitrary arrest
 of trade unionists for violation of provisions of the ISA came to light in 1993. The
 General Secretary of the Construction and Allied Workers Union of Lesotho was ar-
 rested while leading a peaceful march July 2 for having failed to obtain prior police
 permission as then required under the ISA. Other arbitrary arrests occurred in the
 course of demonstrations against various factories by striking garment industry
 workers. In general, pretrial detainees constitute a significant portion of total prison
 population; up to one-half, in some locations. Pretrial remand can last several years.
 
 
 144
 In civil and criminal cases, persons arrested or detained have the right to imme-
 diate consideration of habeas corpus appeals as well as the right to legal counsel.
 The 1981 Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act, as amended in 1984, provides for
 the granting of bail. Under the Act, the High Court is the only judicial body empow-
 ered to grant bail in cases of armed robbery or homicide.
 Although it was acknowledged by the Government to be partly inconsistent with
 human rights guarantees in the new Constitution, the Internal Security (General)
 Act (ISA) of 1984 remained in force. The ISA provides for so-called investigative de-
 tention without charge or trial in political cases for up to 42 days (the first 14 days
 on order of the police; the second 14 days on order of the Police Commissioner; and
 the final 14 days on order of the Minister of Defense - a portfolio now held by the
 Prime Minister). A political case is defined as involving "subversion," defined in the
 ISA to include "supporting, propagating, or advocating any act or thing prejudicial
 to public order, the security of Lesotho, or the administration of justice; connection,
 association, or affiliation with or support for an unlawful organization;" and other
 similarly loosely defined transgressions, most within the judgment of a police officer.
 During the second stage of the detention, ministerially appointed "advisers" (all of
 whom have to date been government employees) are available to report on the
 health of the detainee, investigate whether the detainee has been involved in sub-
 versive activities, and advise the Minister of Defense whether continued detention
 is needed. Detainees under the ISA may make representation about their own treat-
 ment only through the adviser. The ISA also allows for detention of witnesses in
 security cases. There were no known detentions under the ISA in 1993; legal profes-
 sionals held that any such attempt to detain persons would promptly be declared
 unconstitutional by the High Court. The ISA also allows the Minister of Defense to
 "restrict" a person who, in the opinion of the Police Commissioner, is conducting
 himself in a manner prejudicial to public order, security, administration of justice,
 or obedience to the law or lawful authority; there were no known "restrictions" in
 1993.
 The ISA was used in 1993 to charge trade unionists with illegal assembly, al-
 though no unionist was ever brought to trial. Pressure from Parliament and the Le-
 sotho Human Rights Alert Group grew throughout 1993 to scrap the ISA in order
 to bring Lesotho's Legal Code into compliance with the Constitution. At year's end,
 Parliament was debating establishment of a law reform commission which would re-
 view all laws for consistency with the Constitution and each other.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary consists of the Court of Appeal
 (which meets semiannually), the High Court, magistrate's courts, and customary or
 traditional courts, which exist largely in rural areas to administer customary law.
 Judges on the High Court are relatively independent; magistrates appear more sus-
 ceptible to governmental or chieftainship influence. The Court of Appeal's early 1993
 release on bail of a royalist army officer convicted of conspiracy to murder, a person
 greatly feared by the then ruling military council, demonstrated its independence.
 Court decisions and rulings are respected by the authorities and are generally free
 of interference by the executive. Accused persons have and use the right to counsel
 and public trials. The courts have acted to limit infringements of law on numerous
 occasions in past years, e.g., the April 1988 annulment on procedural grounds of the
 state of emergency, which, however, the military government then in power quickly
 reinstituted.
 Under the system of Roman-Dutch law applied in Lesotho, there is no trial by
 jury. Criminal trials are normally adjudicated by a single High Court judge who
 presides, with two assessors serving in an advisory capacity. In civil cases, judges
 normally hear cases alone, The High Court also provides procedural and substantive
 advice and guidance on matters of legal procedure to military tribunals; however,
 it does not participate in arriving at judgments. Military tribunals have jurisdiction
 only over military cases.
 An inquiry into the 1986 slayings of two former Cabinet ministers and their
 wives, initiated by the Attorney General in November 1989, resulted in the arrest,
 trial, and conviction of two military personnel; those convictions were upheld by the
 Court of Appeal in 1993.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though search warrants are usually required, the ISA provides police with sweeping
 powers to enter and search homes and cars without a warrant when the presence
 of explosives or the 'unlawful use of radio transmitters" is suspected. Such searches
 occurred generally in the context of police operations against criminal activity, pri-
 marily theft. The Government is believed routinely to monitor telephone conversa-
 tions of scnior officials and some foreigners on national security grounds.
 
 
 145
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Prior to March 1993 elections, the government-
 controlled press continued editorial warnings to royalists and partisans of ex-King
 Moshoeshoe II against interference in the elections during the weeks leading up to
 the vote. Political meetings were covered impartially, and all political parties were
 allotted time by government-controlled media. Following the election, the new Min-
 ister of Information and Broadcasting encouraged the independent and government-
 owned media to report impartially on newsworthy events. Opposition viewpoints
 were routinely expressed in the independent press, which consisted of Sesotho-lan-
 guage weekly newspapers published by the Roman Catholic Church and the Lesotho
 Evangelical Church, and two independent English-language weeklies.
 The Government controls the official media (one radio station, a 1-hour daily
 newscast on a local television channel, and two weekly newspapers) and ensures
 that they faithfully reflect official views. Prior to the elections, however, the Govern-
 ment made available free time on television and radio to each of the 16 contesting
 political parties. There were charges that government media gave favorable
 preelectoral coverage to the political activities of the Basotho National Party (BNP).
 Academic freedom was generally respected. Political meetings were held on the
 National University campus during the election campaign.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The police prevented several
 peaceful assemblies of union members in 1993. Prior to the elections, the Govern-
 ment prevented several planned public meetings of supporters of ex-King
 Moshoeshoe II. However, political party meetings and rallies, particularly those held
 by the two main parties, the BCP and BNP, occurred regularly throughout the coun-
 try in preparation for the vote. Nonpolitical organizations and professional groups
 were freely formed and allowed to hold public and regular meetings.
 Under a mid-1993 revision of the ISA, a public meeting, rally, or march no longer
 requires prior police permission, only advance notification. Police or local authorities
 may still restrict or prohibit such gatherings on loosely defined "public order"
 grounds.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion. Free and open religious prac-
 tice is permitted and encouraged. Christianity is nominally the dominant faith of
 the majority of Basotho, and Roman Catholicism has the most adherents, although
 less than half of the population. A significant Protestant minority is composed of
 the Lesotho Evangelical Church, the Anglican Church, and a number of smaller de-
 nominations. Conversion is permitted. No apparent social or political benefit or stig-
 ma is attached to belonging to any particular church. There are no barriers to mis-
 sionary activity or work by foreign clergy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens generally are allowed to move freely within the country and
 across national boundaries. The Government distinguishes between "international"
 passports and "local" passports. The latter, which are the more readily available, are
 or use only in travelling to South Africa, as many Basotho do on a regular basis
 for work or shopping. A refundable deposit of up to $730 (2,500 maluti), depending
 on the destination, is required to obtain an international passport, in theory to cover
 the cost of eventual repatriation if necessary. The Government places no obstacles
 in the way of its own citizens who wish to emigrate. As of late 1993, fewer than
 100 refugees, the majority of them South Africans, who were registered with the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had been granted asy-
 lum in Lesotho. The local office of the UNHCR also reported over 4,000 South Afri-
 cans in "refugee-like status;" most have lived in Lesotho for many years. There is
 no forced resettlement of refugees. The UNHCR closed its Lesotho office in mid-
 1993, owing to the lack of new refugee cases.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised their right to choose their own government in 1993 for the first
 time in over 20 years. The March 27 multiparty elections were judged free and fair
 by over 130 international observers. Under its new Constitution, Lesotho has a
 democratically elected Parliament with universal suffrage for those over 21, an inde-
 pendent judiciary, and a constitutional monarch. National elections are to be held
 again no later than 1998. The Constitution is based largely on the independence
 Constitution of 1966, modified by the National Constituent Assembly which met
 intermittently from 1990 to 1992.
 The new civilian Cabinet includes Lesotho's first female cabinet minister. While
 there are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or politics,
 many practical impediments exist. As noted in Section 5, married women are consid-
 ered minors under law, requiring permission from their husbands for basic business
 
 
 146
 activities (e.g., opening a bank account). Single women face a social stigma that
 mitigates against their achieving senior positions in the private or public sector (al-
 though there are prominent exceptions, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 chief civil servant.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government did not hinder the activities of the Lesotho Human Rights Alert
 Group, the umbrella nongovernmental organization (NGO) formed in 1992, which
 aimed to bring under its leadership all other NGO's active in human rights issues.
 Union allegations of worker rights violations and official anti-unionism were aired
 by the media, including government-controlled media.
 The Government worked closely with the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 in preparing and implementing a new labor code.
 Section 5. Discrimination based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The rights of women are severely limited by both law and custom in
 such areas as property, inheritance, and contracts. Women have the legal and cus-
 tomary right to make a will and sue for divorce. However, under Lesotho's cus-
 tomary law, a married woman is considered a minor during the lifetime of her hus-
 band; she cannot enter into any legally binding contract, whether for employment,
 commerce, or education, without her husband's consent. A woman married under
 customary law has no standing in court and may not sue or be sued without her
 husband's permission. Women traditionally have been the stabilizing force in the
 home and in the agricultural sector, given the absence of tens of thousands of
 Basotho men who work in South Africa. More female than male children complete
 primary and secondary schools, and literacy rates are estimated to be higher among
 women than among men. No government has seriously addressed the issue of wom-
 en's rights.
 Domestic violence, including wife beating, occurs frequently. Statistics are not
 available, but the extent of the problem is thought to be great.  Basotho tradition,
 a wife may return to her "maiden home" if physically abused by her husband; in
 the common law, wife beating is a criminal offense and defined as assault. A 1976
 High Court case reversed a Roman-Dutch legal tradition which recognized a hus-
 band's right to chastise his wife at will. Women's rights organizations have formed.
 The local chapter of the International Federation of Woman Lawyers has taken a
 leading role in educating Basotho women about their rights under customary and
 common law and highlighted the importance of women's full participation in the de-
 mocratization process. Women in Business is an advocacy group that seeks to pro-
 mote the empowerment of independent businesswomen.
 Children.-The Government devotes substantial resources to primary and second-
 ary education, and enrollment rates are relatively high. There is no pattern of soci-
 etal abuse against children. Young "herdboys" live a rigorous and harsh existence
 tending their parents' cattle, sheep, or goat herds and often miss formal schooling
 as a result. This practice constitutes a socially entrenched rite of passage.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Most citizens speak a common language and
 share common historical and cultural traditions. Small numbers of Asians (pri-
 marily ethnic Chinese and Indians) and South African whites are active in the coun-
 try's commercial life. Economic and racial tension between the Chinese business
 community, specifically textile industry employers, and the Basotho remained an
 issue in 1993. There was no generalized, ethnically based violence as occurred in
 1991, but foreign shop owners remained subject to the 1987 Trading Enterprise
 Order, which calls on foreign owners to enter into joint ventures with Basotho na-
 tionals. Although equity transfers would entail compensation and the program has
 not been strongly enforced, it remains a concern to non-Basotho businesspeople.
 People with Disabilities.-The Government has not legislated or mandated phys-
 ical accessibility to public buildings for the handicapped.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to join or form unions
 without prior government authorization. A large portion of the active male labor
 force between the ages of 20 and 44 seeks work in the Republic of South Africa,
 mainly in gold and coal mines. Most of the remainder are engaged in traditional
 agriculture. The rest are employed mainly by the Government and in small indus-
 tries and enterprises in Lesotho. A majority of Basotho mineworkers are members
 of the South African National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Because the NUM is
 a foreign organization, it is not permitted to engage in union activities in Lesotho.
 
 
 147
 Under a new Labor Code, prepared with the assistance of the ILO and effective
 in April, all trade union federations were required to seek government registration.
 The Government has withheld registration from the Congress of Democratic Unions
 (CDU) since its formation by four recognized independent unions in 1991. The Labor
 Commissioner maintained in 1993 that the CDU still did not meet registration re-
 quirements under the new code, but the authorities took no action to inhibit CDU
 activities. The Goverpment's refusal to register the CDU was in part an effort to
 require it to join a rival federation, the officially recognized Lesotho Labor Congress
 (LLC), composed of 24 affiliated trade unions.
 Overall, unionized workers represent only about 10 percent of the total work
 force. The Lesotho Allied Clothing and Textile Workers Union is the only major in-
 dustrial union within the LLC. All major unions professed political neutrality in the
 elections. After the elections, tension increased dramatically between labor and em-
 ployers, with particularly frequent and violent confrontations occurring in the textile
 and garment industries. Although the newly elected Government voiced no hostility
 toward unions, it appeared to condone harsh police measures against wildcat strik-
 ers, including teargassing, beatings, and detentions or arrest.
 Settlement procedures are so lengthy and cumbersome that no legally sanctioned
 strike has occurred in Lesotho since independence in 1966. Dozens of strikes oc-
 curred in 1993, particularly amid heightened expectations among workers after the
 March elections, but none was recognized as "legal" by the Government. Legal pro-
 tection for strikers against retribution has not been enforced in cases of illegal
 strikes; several hundred workers in the textile industry were dismissed in 1993 fol-
 lowing wildcat strikes, and the Government maintained it could not oblige their em-
 ployers to reinstate them.
 Workers engaged in peaceful assembly were in 1993 harassed by police. In one
 case, members of the Construction and Allied Workers Union of Lesotho (CAWULE)
 were in early July teargassed, assaulted, and arrested when attempting to march
 peacefully to deliver a petition to the Minister of Labor. CAWULE members were
 charged with violating the Internal Security Act of 1984 by failing to obtain permis-
 sion to march; CAWULE claimed that it had requested such permission but the po-
 lice never responded.
 The ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association noted the Government's 1993 re-
 sponse to a complaint lodged in 1992 concerning intimidation of CAWULE activities
 at the Lesotho Highlands Water Project construction site. The Committee, however,
 asked to be kept informed of developments in this case, reflecting an incomplete
 governmental response to charges made.
 There were no instances in 1993 of governmental restrictions on international af-
 filiations or contacts by unions or their members.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-All legally recognized trade
 unions in Lesotho in principle have the right in law to organize and bargain collec-
 tively, but exercise of these rights is often thwarted. There was some minor bargain-
 ing between unions and empfoyers to set wage and benefit rates in 1993, although
 wage rates continued to be set primarily through unilateral action by employers.
 Credible reports of government acquiescence to private employers' intimidation of
 union officials continued. In one case, members of a local executive committee of the
 Lesotho Amalgamated Clething and Textile Workers Union (LACTWU) were pre-
 vented by police from meeting. An Unfair Labor Practices Tribunal investigates un-
 fair labor practices and charges of antiunion discrimination. Both the LLC- and
 CDU-affiliated unions charge the Government with maintaining an antiunion bias.
 Lesttho has several industrial estates grouping together companies, mostly textile
 and apparel firms, engaged in manufacturing for export. All national labor laws
 apply in these industrial zones, but LACTWU officials charge that the Government
 colludes with industry employers to inhibit union organizational activities in the
 work place.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the 1987 Employment Act, and there is no indication of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legpal minimum age for em-
 ployment in commercial or industrial enterprises is 15. Persons under age 16 may
 not work more than 4 consecutive hours without a 1-hour break, nor may they work
 more than 8 hours per day. In practice, however, children under 14 are employed
 in family-owned businesses. The employment of minors in commercial, industrial, or
 nonfamil enterprises involving hazardous or dangerous working conditions is pro-
 hibited. Basotho under 18 years of age may not be recruited for employmnt outside
 the country. Enforcement of these laws by inspectors nf the Ministry of Labor and
 Employment is lax. In Lesotho's traditional society, rigorous working conditions for
 the counts young "herdbsys" are considered a prerequisite to manhood and a fun-
 damental feature of Basotho culture beyond the reach of labor laws.
 
 
 148
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Wages are extremely low. The Government,
 following the recommendation of a tripartite wages advisory board, last raised the
 statutory minimum wage rates for various types of work in 1992. Monthly minimum
 wage rates in the established categories range from the equivalent of $75 for a mes-
 senger to $144 for a heavy-vehicle driver. At the low end, wages at these rates are
 insufficient for a minimum decent standard of living for a worker and family. Most
 wage earners supplement their monthly income through subsistence agriculture or
 remittances from relatives employed in South Africa. Many employers in Lesotho
 now pay more than minimum wages in an effort to attract and retain motivated em-
 ployees.
 The 1993 Labor Code spells out basic worker rights, including a 45-hour work-
 week, a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, 12 days' paid leave per year, and
 paid public holidays. Employers are required to provide adequate light, ventilation,
 and sanitary facilities for employees, and to install and maintain machinery in ways
 which minimize the risk of injury. In practice, these regulations are generally fol-
 lowed only within the wage economy and are enforced haphazardly by inspectors
 from the Department of Labor of the Ministry of Labor and Employment. Staff
 shortages in the Ministry limit effective enforcement to the major urban areas.
