 CAMBODIA
 A new coalition Government was formed on November 30 between the Cambodian
 People's Party (CPP) and the National United Front for a Neutral, Peaceful, Cooper-
 ative, and Independent Cambodia (FUNCINPEC). CPP leader Hun Sen is Prime
 Minister and Prince Norodom Ranariddh of FUNCINPEC is President of the Na-
 tional Assembly. A 1993 coalition government had collapsed when forces loyal to
 Hun Sen ousted then-First Prime Minister Prince Ranariddh from power in July
 1997. In July, in the first national elections since 1993, the CPP won a plurality
 of votes. The electoral campaign and its aftermath were marked by protests, voter
 intimidation, and partisan violence, some of it government-directed. Despite the in-
 cidents of political violence, intimidatiun, and election irregularities, the formation
 of the new Government reflected the will of the electorate. King Norodom Sihanouk
 remains the constitutional monarch and Head of State. Most power lies within the
 executive branch, and the National Assembly does not offer a significant check to
 executive power. The judiciary is not independent and suffers from corruption.
 The seriously weakened Khmer Rouge continued to wage a low-level guerrilla in-
 surgency against the Government. From July 1997 until November, Khmer Rouge
 troops cooperated with resistance forces loyal to FUNCINPEC against government
 troops. Former Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in April. At year's end, following
 mass defections and the surrender of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, the only re-
 maining Khmer Rouge leader at large was General Ta Mok.
 The National Police, an agency of the Ministry of Interior, have primary respon-
 sibility for internal security,, but the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), in-
 cluding the military police, also have domestic security responsibilities. Government
 efforts to improve police and RCAF performance were hampered by political fac-
 tionalism within the forces and by budgetary limitations. Members of the security
 forces committed numerous human rights abuses.
 Cambodia has a market economy in which approximately 80 percent of the popu-
 lation of 11 million engage in subsistence farming, with rice as the principal crop.
 Annual per capita Gross Domestic Product is approximately $300. Foreign aid is an
 important component of national income. Economic growth stalled following the July
 1997 political violence, with decreases in business, investment, and tourist activity;
 the economic slump continued through the year.
 There were numerous, serious problems in the Government's human rights record.
 Military and civilian police were responsible for at least five extrajudicial killings.
 Members of the security forces regularly tortured, beat, and otherwise abused per-
 sons in custody. There were credible reports that members of the security forces tor-
 tured, beat, or killed some opposition-party supporters before and after the elections
 in July and during demonstrations in August and September.. Police were respon-
 sible for at least two deaths during the postelection demonstrations. In the days
 after the demonstrations, 24 unidentified bodies were discovered; most showed evi-
 dence of torture or violent death. The Government rarely prosecuted members of the
 security forces for such abuses. Prison conditions are harsh. Arbitrary arrest and
 detention, prolonged detention, and infringement on citizens' privacy rights were
 
 
 825
 problems, particularly during the September demonstrations. Immunity for those
 who commit human rights abuses is a continuing problem. The Government lacked
 the political will and the financial resources to act effectively against persons, par-
 ticularly members of the military services who were suspected of being responsible
 for human rights abuses. Democratic institutions, especially the judiciary, remain
 weak. The judiciary is subject to influence by the executive branch and is marred
 by inefficiency, a lack of training, a shortage of resources, and corruption related
 to low wages. Politically related crimes rarely were prosecuted. Citizens effectively
 were denied the right to a fair trial.
 The Government sometimes limits press freedom and fear of government-directed
 violence against the press created a clate that encouraged self-censorship by some
 journalists. However, the number of newspapers critical of the Government re-
 mained high, with frequent vehement criticism of the CPP. The Government per-
 mitted some freedom of assembly during the election period, but at times restricted
 this right. The Government allowed large demonstrations to protest against claimed
 election irregularities in August and September. However, police forcibly dispersed
 a public protest critical of Hun Sen that had been organized by the FUNCINPEC
 and Sam Rainsy parties following the demonstrations. Over 2 dozen opposition fig-
 ures left the country temporarily after the inauguration of the National Assembly
 in September.
 The Government at times restricted freedom of association and movement. Do-
 mestic violence against women and abuse of children are common. Trafficking in
 women and children for forced prostitution is a problem. The ethnic Vietnamese mi-
 nority faced widespread social discrimination and some acts of violence perpetrated
 by the Khmer Rouge and persons loyal to the FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy par-
 ties; discrimination against the disabled persists. The Government sometimes does
 not enforce existing legal provisions against antiunion discrimination adequately.
 Forced labor, including forced labor by children, remains a problem. Child labor per-
 sists. Mob violence against ethnic Vietnamese resulted in a number of deaths.
 Khmer Rouge forces committed a number of abuses, including killings, and com-
 mitted violence against the ethnic Vietnamese minority.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were numerous political and
 extrajudicial killings. The United Nations Center for Human Rights (UNCHR) docu-
 mented 49 reported killings carried out in connection with the electoral process. Of
 these, the UNCHR found that three likely were committed by police or local govern-
 ment authorities and 13 others by remnant Khmer Rouge soldiers. UNCHR inves-
 tigation of most of the remaining reported cases disclosed either no political motive
 or mixed political and personal motives. The Government has made no arrests in
 connection with these crimes.
 On June 19, the body of Em Iem, a Sam Rainsy Party district official, was ex-
 humed in Kompong Chain province. He had been arrested by the village chief, hav-
 ing left his home 9 days earlier to travel to the district headquarters of his party.
 Witnesses reported that police handcuffed and blindfolded Em Iem and took him in
 the direction of a nearby rubber plantation where his body later was found. His
 death followed several documented threats against him and other Sam Rainsy party
 members by local Kompong Cham government officials for anti-CPP political activi-
 ties.
 On June 24, Som (Thong) Soi, a Reastr Niyum party representative, was shot and
 killed by a concealed gunman while returning from work in Kompong Chhnang
 province. He earlier had left his position as a CPP group leader recently to join the
 Reastr Niyum Party and had expressed fear for his life in the days prior to his kill-
 ing, naming two local officials whom he believed would be responsible if he were
 killed. Although he had known personal conflicts with other villagers, the balance
 of evidence suggested a political motive for his death.
 On June 27, the badly mutilated body of FUNCINPEC commune electoral ob-
 server Thong Sophal was found in Kandal province after he had been missing for
 10 days. According to fellow villagers and relatives, he had no known problems with
 neighbors or others and was a respected member of his community. Party colleagues
 confirmed that he had been a FUNCINPEC supporter for several years, but his wife
 and son had participated in a CPP gift distribution in April, when she registered
 him with the CPP. According to the UNCHR, the evidence collected about his
 FUNCINPEC political activities immediately prior to his disappearance, the atti-
 tude of the national police and local authorities, and the circumstances of his dis-
 appearance suggested a political motive for his killing.
 
 
 826
 In addition to killings during the election period, there were credible reports of
 political and extrajudicial killings during the period of opposition protests in August
 and their subsequent suppression by government security forces in September. Ac-
 cording to the UNCHR, at least 34 persons were killed in August and September,
 including 2 deaths prior to the demonstrations, 2 deaths that occurred when secu-
 rity forces intervened to halt the demonstrations, and 2 other unrelated deaths.
 There were four killings of Vietnamese residents targeted specifically because of
 their ethnicity (see Section 5). No direct link was established by the UNCHR be-
 tween the remaining 24 deaths and involvement in the demonstrations or other po-
 litical activities; however, investigations showed that most of these unidentified bod-
 ies bore signs of torture or violent death.
 On September 7, Chem Pich was killed by gunfire in front of the Cambodiana
 Hotel where he had gone to participate in a demonstration. He reportedly also was
 beaten by a person using a rifle butt. He died on the way to a hospital.
 On September 11, Chun Samnang was shot and killed in Phnom Penh, apparently
 by security personnel during a political demonstration.
 On September 30, Vorn Meak was killed by police outside his village in Kompong
 Chain province following his arrest earlier in the day. The arresting officer accused
 him of being a FUTNCINPEC party member and of having been involved in an
 armed robbery. His hands were tied behind his back and he was taken to a police
 post before being taken into a jungle area where he was killed.
 In December two senior Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea,
 ceased resistance to the Cambodian Government and moved to Pain, a town nomi-
 nally under the control of the national Government. Hun Sen initially stpped back
 from earlier government commitments to bring senior Khmer Rouge leaders to jus-
 tice by questioning the need for an international tribunal for the two leaders. After
 public criticism, Hun Sen and other public officials indicated their willingess to co-
 operate with the international community in bringing the Khmer Rouge to justice.
 From July through September, at least four ethnic Vietnamese persons were
 killed in mob violence. Some were killed during postelection demonstrations; others
 were killed by mobs that suspected that Vietnamese had engaged in food poisonings.
 Poice investigations uncovered no evidence. No persons were prosecuted or pun-
 ished (see Section 5).
 On August 20, Sieng Sean, a driver for the Kyodo News Agency, was killed out-
 side the Interior Ministry in Phnom Penh by a hand grenade during a protest
 against alleged election fraud; the protest was led by opposition leader Sam Rainsy
 inside the Interior Ministry compound. Sieng Sean was standing outside the com-
 pound in the street when the perpetrators fired from a passing car and threw a gre-
 nade toward the gate of the ministry. The perpetrators escaped.
 On September 7, Orn Saphorn was beaten to death by a truck driver or a mob
 shortly after a hand grenade attack at the city residence of then-Second Prime Min-
 ister Hun Sen. Saphorn appeared to be one of two persons involved in a traffic acci-
 dent close to Hun Sen's residence and was suspected of involvement in the grenade
 incident. No arrests were made.
 On September 24, Sar Chan Rithy was killed in Siem Reap when a propelled gre-
 nade aimed at a Hun Sen motorcade detonated in his family's house. The motorcade
 was traveling to the opening of the National Assembly.
 The UNCHRi reported that 13 of 49 killings carried out in connection with the
 election process likely were committed by remnants of the Khmer Rouge.
 In April Khmer Rouge soldiers killed 23 persons in Kompong Chhnang Province
 (see Section 5).
 oIn July the Khmer Rouge reportedly killed 3 persons in Kratie province (see Sec-
 tion 5).
 On July 17, a driver named Mon and a militia guard named Ngor were killed
 when a group transporting election materials was attacked near a village close to
 the former  erouge stronghold of Anlong Veng. Available evidence indicates
 that the attackers were either remnant Khmer Rouge forces or Khmer Rouge defec-
 tors from Anlong Veng.
 On election day, July 26, 11 persons were killed during an attack by suspected
 Khmer Rouge soldiers near Anlong Veng. Seven of those killed were civilians; two
 were RCAF soldiers; and two others were attackers. All evidence indicated that the
 incident was aimed at disrupting the election process.
 b. Disappearance.-There were at least 53 credible reports of politically motivated
 disappearances during and following the August and September demonstrations, in-
 cluding 4 Buddhist monks. The U.N. High Co ssioner for Refugees (UNH R) re-
 ported the presumed arrests of 6 persons whose whereabouts could not be deter-
 mined; 47 other persons not known to be detained also remain unaccounted for. As
 
 
 827
 of year's end, the UNHCR's efforts to establish the whereabouts of all 53 persons
 were continuing.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and physical abuse of prisoners; however, torture,
 beatings, and other forms of physical mistreatment of persons held in police or mili-
 tary custody continued to be a serious problem. The problem is compounded further
 by government impunity, whereby perpetrators of torture frequently are protected
 from prosecution or disciplinary action by government authorities, despite some re-
 cent government efforts to address problems of accountability.
 There were credible reports that military and police officials used torture and se-
 verely beat criminal detainees, particularly durng interrogation. According to the
 UNCHR, municipal police in the Serious       Department in Phnom Penh beat
 or tortured persons routinely, and nearly half the 60 detainees interviewed in Koh
 Kon  province complained of torture in police custody. One human rights non-
 governmental organzation (NGO) received credible reports of 50 incidents of torture
 or beatings in custody through November.
 One local NGO documented five cases of beatings in Battambang province in Feb-
 ruary. In each case, militia or police officials hit the persons in custody on the back
 and head with a stick or a rifle butt until the victims bled or lost consciousness.
 In a case documented in May by the UNCHR, three young boys held in the youth
 rehabilitation center of Phnom Penh were whipped with an electric cable on several
 p arts of their bodies by a police officer and another official while in detention. The
 beatings occurred in the presence of a group of child prisoners sharing their open
 cell; a subsequent medical examination confirmed the beatings.
 In another case documented by a local NGO in November, a female prisoner in
 Phnom Penh was beaten severely in an unsuccessful effort to obtain a confession
 to a robbery. Prison police officials repeatedly kicked her on the chest and hips, beat
 her with an electric baton on her neck, and whipped her with an electric wire before
 she lost consciousness. While in detention, she refused to reveal the names of the
 officers due to continued fears for her safety.
 Vorn Meak was killed by Kompong Chhnang police following his arrest on Sep-
 tember 30 (see Section l.a.).
 Prison conditions are harsh and deteriorated during the year. Government efforts
 to improve prison conditions were hampered by lack of funds. Human rights organi-
 zations cited a number of serious probuems, including overcrowding, food and water
 shortages, malnutrition, and poor security. Use of shackles and the practice of hold-
 ing prisoners in small, dark, cells continued in some prisons. Government ration al-
 lowances for purchasing prisoners' food are inadequate, exacerbating their malnutri-
 tion.
 The Government continued to allow human rights groups to visit prisons and to
 provide human rights training to prison guards.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention; however, security forces continued to arrest and detain citizens
 arbitrarily. A penal code drafted by the U.N. Transitional Authority for Cambodia
 (UNTAC) in 1992 and approved by the Interim Supreme National Council remains
 in effect, asndos the 1993 criminal procedure law enacted during the State of Cam-
 bodia period. The criminal procedure law in principle provides for adequate protec-
 tion for criminal suspects; however, in practice the Government frequently ignored
 these provisions. One human rights NGO reported 32 complaints of unlawfl deten-
 tion and arrest by police, military, or local government authorities through October.
 Although lengthy detention without charge is illegal, suspects often are held by
 authorities for on  eriods before being charged or released. Accused persons le-
 gally are entitled to a lawyer, although in practice they often have no access to legal
 representation. Prisoners routinely are he d for several days before gaining access
 to a lawyer or family members. Although there is a bail system, many prisoners,
 particularly those without legal representation, often have no opportunity to seek
 release on bail. The recent introduction into the legal system of newly tralned law-
 yers, who frequently received supplemental training by NGO's, resulted in signifi-
 cant improvements for those defendants who were provided with counsel, including
 a reduction in the pretrial detention period and improved access to bail.
 The Government does not use forced exile; however, several newly elected parlia-
 mentarians fled the country in a state of self-imposed exile following their inaugura-
 tion on September 24. These politicians included Prince Norodom   Ranariddh
 (FUNCIN  EC), Sam Rainsy, and over two dozen other FUNCINPEC and SRP Par-
 liamentarians. While many of the FUNCINPEC officials returned without incident
 shortly thereafter, Prince Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy, and most of the SRP parliamen-
 tarians returned in November only after receiving personal assurances of security
 from King Sihanouk and Prime Minister-designat Hun Sen.
 
 
 828
 Prince Chakrapong remained in exile at year's end.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the Government does not respect this provision in practice. The
 courts are subject to influence by the executive, and there is widespread corruption
 among judges, virtually none of whom receives a living wage.
 The court system consists of lower courts, an appeals court, and a Supreme Court.
 The Constitution also mandates a Constitutional Council, which is empowered to re-
 view the constitutionality of laws, and a Supreme Council of Magistrates, which ap-
 points and disciplines judges. The composition of both of these bodies is viewed
 widely as favorable to the CPP. There is a separate military court system.
 The 1994 law on civil servants requires the courts to seek Ministry of Justice per-
 mission to prosecute a member of the civil service, which includes the police. The
 Ministry of Justice is required, in turn, to forward requests for prosecution to the
 relevant ministry. Although the Minister of Justice and other senior government of-
 ficials sought to reform the law to make it easier for the courts to prosecute civil
 servants, there was no legislative effort in the National Assembly to do so. The mili-
 tary forces are not covered by this law .    .      ..
 Human rights groups indicate that, in practice ministries sometimes decline to re-
 spond to the courts, or refuse their requests for prosecution. Delays in respond'.mg
 to the courts' requests sometimes allow those accused of crimes to flee or otherwse
 escape prosecution, effectively leading to impunity for most government officials who
 commit crimes.
 Trials are public. Defendants have the right to be present and to consult with an
 attorney, to confront and question witnesses against them, and to present witnesses
 and evidence on their own behalf. However, trials are typically perfunctory, and ex-
 tensive cross-examination usually does not take place. The serious shortage of attor-
 neys-especially outside of Phnom    Penh-remains a significant impediment to
 broader implementation of the right to counsel in practice.
 Defendants legally also are entitled to the presumption of innocence and the right
 of appeal. However, because of extensive corruption, defendants often are expected
 to bribe the judge for a favorable verdict and therefore effectively are denied the
 presumption of innocence.
 A serious lack of resources and poor training contribute to inefficiency in the judi-
 cial branch, and in practice the Government does not ensure due process. For exam-
 ple, judges often lack copies of the laws on which they are expected to rule. As a
 result of these weaknesses, citizens often were denied the effective right to a fair
 trial.
 Ongoing cooperation between the Government, foreign donors, and NGO's to im-
 prove the legal system remains hampered by the suspension of some assistance pro-
 grams after the July 1997 violence.
 In September Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) official Siun Vong Vannak, who had been
 convicted of the 1996 murder of Mrs. Hun Sen's brother-in-law, was released from
 prison after receiving a pardon from King Sihanouk. The King granted the pardon
 after receiving approval of the country's political leadership.
 The courts often pressure victims of crimes to accept small cash settlements from
 the accused. When a case does make its way to court, the verdict often is deter-
 mined by a judge before the case is heard, sometimes on the basis of a bribe paid
 by the accuser or the defendant. Sworn, written statements from witnesses and the
 accused usually are the extent of evidence presented in trials. Such statements by
 the accused often result from beatings or threats by investigating officials, and illit-
 erate defendants often are not informed of the content of written confessions that
 they are forced to sign. In cases involving military personnel, military officers often
 exert pressure on judges to have the defendant released.
 The military court system suffers from deficiencies similar to those of the civilian
 court system.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The Con-
 stitution protects the privacy of residence and correspondence and includes a provi-
 sion against illegal search; however, there were reports that the Government mon-
 itored private electronic communications, including during police investigations of
 suspected criminal activity.
 The police routinely conducted warrantless searches and-seizures. In October in
 response to a surge in crime in Phnom Penh, the Government announced that it
 would conduct searches of private residences for illegal weapons. The searches were
 to be conducted without any notice, consent, or judicial authorization. After protest
 by legal NGO's, the Government took no action to implement the program.
 Citizens largely were free to live where they wished. There were continued reports
 of land disputes between residents, local authorities, and business persons. Since
 
 
 the forced collectivization during Khmer Rouge rule before 1980 and the return of
 thousands of refugees, land ownership is often unclear.
 The Government does not coerce or forbid membership in political organizations
 systematically. However, there were credible reports that government officials used
 intimidation and threats to force FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party members to
 sign oaths of loyalty to the CPP and vote for the CPP in the July elections. More-
 over, FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party supporters reported several credible in-
 stances of intimidation in the days following the election, when dozens of provincial
 party workers from those parties fled to Phnom Penh amid a climate of fear (see
 Section 3).
 There were reports that military officers forcibly conscripted adults and children;
 the Government denied that it engages in this practice (see Section 6.c.).
 Membership in the Khmer Rouge, which has conducted an armed insurgency
 against the Government, is illegal.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Sporadic fighting between government and Khmer Rouge forces continued
 throughout much of the year; however, negotiations in November between the Gov-
 ernment and Khmer Rouge commanders secured the defection of most of the re-
 maining Khmer Rouge soldiers and civilians and contributed to a cessation of armed
 conflict by year's end. Civilians were killed or wounded by indiscriminate shelling
 and by land mines deployed by all sides.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, press, and publication; however, the Government sometimes limits press free-
 dom in practice. Some journalists practice self-censorship. The Constitution implic-
 itly limits free speech by requiring that speech not adversely affect public security.
 The Constitution also declares that the King is "inviolable." A Press Law in effect
 since 1995 provides journalists with a number of rights, including a prohibition on
 prepublication censorship and protection from imprisonment for expressing opinion.
 However, the Press Law also includes a vaguely worded prohibition on publishing
 articles that affect national security and political stability. The Government engaged
 in harassment and intimidation of some journalists during the election campaign,
 and fear of government-directed violence against the press created a climate that
 led some journalists to practice self-censorship.
 Although limited in circulation, newspapers are a primary source of news and ex-
 pression of political opinion. All major political parties have reasonable and regular
 access to the printed media. The press remained highiy partisan, with many news-
 papers receiving financial support from political parties. There are approximately 40
 Khmer language newspapers in Phnom Penh, of which approximately 28 are major
 newspapers published regularly. Of these, 14 are considered to be pro-CPP journals,
 13 are considered to support either the FUNCINPEC or Sam Rainsy Parties, and
 1 is considered to be antimonarchy. In addition there is one French language daily,
 on  nlish language daily, and two other English language newspapers published
 regularly. Many of~ the Khmer language newspapers frequently publish reports
 translated from the English language newspapers.
 Most newspapers criticize the Government frequently, and Prime Minister Hun
 Sen frequently came under strong attack by opposition newspapers both before and
 after the election. There were some instances of government intimidation or retribu-
 tion against newspapers for their critical reporting.
 On August 20, a driver for the Kyodo News Agency was killed by unknown assail-
 ants outside the Interior Ministry (see Section l.a.).
 In September the Ministry of Information suspended Moneaksekar Khmer
 (Khmer Conscience), a pro-Sam Rainsy Party newspaper for 30 days for its publica-
 tion of an article critical of King Sihanouk.
 In October the Government threatened two English language newspapers, the
 Cambodia Daily and the Phnom Penh Post, and one news agency, Deutsche Press-
 Agentur, with closure in reaction to alleged misreporting of the September 24 rocket
 attack on then-Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's motorcade in Siem Reap province.
 The Government also threatened to revoke the visas of the Western journalists al-
 legediy responsible for the reporting. The Government rescinded the threats follow-
 ing diplomatic intervention.
 Unlike previous years, no journalist was killed for publishing critical articles.
 However, there was one report of a violent attack against a journalist. On June 8,
 Thong Uy Pang, the editor of the pro-CPP Koh Santepheap (Island of Peace) news-
 paper, was wounded by gunfire from close range by unknown assailants. The shoot-
 ing came after the newspaper printed a critical article about corruption of police and
 military authorities. The assaiants escaped.
 
 
 The Government, the military forces, and political parties continued to dominate
 the broadcast media. This domination created an imbalance in equitable access to
 the broadcast media during the election, which were permitted to disseminate politi-
 cal statements during a 1-month election campaign period. According to a report
 published by the UNCHR, procedures for licensing and allocation of radio and tele-
 vision frequencies from the media were not impartial, and decisions were made on
 a party political basis. In addition news about opposition politicians and their views
 were virtually excluded from the broadcast media during the election process.
 Unlike prior years, there were no reports that authorities inhibited discussion of
 some political issues at the University of Phnom Penh.
 The Khmer Rouge did not allow freedom of speech or press  in zones that they con-
 trolled during the year."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaefu~il assembly; however, the Government at times restricted this
 right in practice.--
 In April pro- and anti-government demonstrations following Prince Ranariddh's
 return from abroad led to some violence among demonstrators; police injured several
 persons when they attempted to break up the demonstrations. In June the Phnom
 Penlh municipal governmentcited security concerns in issuing a ban on public dem-
 onstrations in the period prior to the election. The ban was ignored widely and
 never implemented; the Government did not interfere with several demonstrations
 that took place. Two weeks later, the government reversed its position and only re-
 quested that poitical parties inform ofcials of planned rallies. Several demonstra-
 tions and marches thereafter took place without incident or security incidents.
 In August large antigovernment demonstrations and marches to protest alleged
 election irregularities were organized-by opposition leaders Prince Ranariddh and
 Sam Rainsy. Frequent marches by thousands of persons proceeded through Phnom
 Penh without incident During this period, a sit-in began near the National Assem-
 bly, which consisted of several hundred persons who remained at the site continu-
 ously. In September progovernment demonstrations contributed to fears of major vi-
 olence. In September government security forces intervened to break up the dem-
 onstrationis and the sit-in; at least two persons were killed during the police inter-
 vention, and the bodies of at least 24 others bearing signs of violent death were
 found thereafter (see Section l.a.).
 In December there was a demonstration by more than 300 persons against a toxic
 waste dump in Sihanoukvile. Demonstrators attacked the local port office, the home
 of the deputy governor, and a luxury hotel in protest against allegedly corrupt offi-
 cials who allowed the waste to be brought in from Taiwan. One person died in -a
 hospital after being hit on the head by furniture thrown from the ransacked home.
 Police fired their weapons into the air to disburse the demonstrators after appeals
 over loudspeakers had little effect. Two employees of LICADHO, a human rights
 NGO, were arrested and charged with robbery and destruction of property after pro-
 tests against the Sihanoukville toxic waste dump turned violent.
 LICADHO defended its employees, stating that they had no part in the riot or
 the protests, although the protesters had spoken with them a few days before the
 violence began.
 Numerous groups assembled peacefully, including workers, opposition activists,
 peace marchers, and local groups protesting land disputes, all without incident.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, the Government at
 times restricted this right by interfering with political party offices during the pe-
 riod prior to the election (see Section 3). Government officials reportedly also forced
 FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party supporters to sign oaths of loyalty to the CPP
 prior to the elections (see Section 1.f.)."
 Membership in the Khmer Rouge is illegal.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and
 prohibits discrimination based on religion. The government respects this right in
 practice. Buddhism is the state religion and over 95 percent of the population is
 Buddhist. Most of the remainder is made up of ethnic Chain Muslims, who generally
 are well integrated into society and fae no reported persecution.
 The Khmer Rouge traditionally discouraged religion, and continue to do so.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government generally does not restrict domestic or international
 travel; however, in September it imposed a ban on international travel by opposition
 politicians. The ban was lifted following the inauguration of the new National As-
 sembly on September 24, after which many politicians from the FUNCINPEC and
 Sam Raisy Parties left the country without incident. At least one prominent politi-
 cian, Kem   Sokha of the Son Sann Party, was prevented from leaving during this
 period. The Government claimed that he was subject to lawful arrest as a result of
 
 
 831
 his illegal activities during the demonstrations. Ker Sokha subsequently went into
 hiding and ignored two official documents summoning him to court for questioning.
 Following the agreement to form a new coalition Government in November, Kern
 Sokha appeared in court without incident in response to a third summons. At year's
 end, it was unclear whether a travel ban was still in effect for him.
 Monks can move internally without restriction.
 There are no longer illegal security checkpoints; however, the presence of land
 mines and bandits make travel in some areas perilous.
 Following sporadic partisan fighting in the nort and northwest, several hundred
 refugees left the country for temporary refugee camps in Thailand. These refugees
 joined the approximately 50,000 refugees who had left the country following the po-
 litical violence of July 1997. There were no reports of refugees being forced by Thai
 authorities to return to Cambodia involuntarily. By year's end, approximately 9,000
 refugees had been repatriated by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) voluntarily, and there were no reports of persecution or discrimination
 against those who returned. At year's end, approximately 35,000 refugees remained
 in the camps. In addition to those refugees repatriated by the UNHCR, several
 thousand more also returned voluntarily. Internally displaced persons also were al-
 lowed to resettle in other areas of the country.
 The Government allows noncitizens to apply to the UNHCR for refugee status.
 The Government did not provide first asylum during the year and has mot agreed
 to UNHCR requests to issue refugee travel documents. The new Government has
 not formulated fully a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first asylum; its political
 platform promised cooperation with international organizations to prepare for the
 repatriation of remaining refugees from Thailand.
 There were no reports that the Government forced any persons to return to an-
 other country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government,
 and most citizens exercised this right by participating in the national elections in
 July. Citizens could not exercise this right in areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge.
 The July 26 national elections were the first since the 1993 U.N.-sponsored elec-
 tions that resulted in a coalition government dominated by the CPP and
 FUNCINPEC until July 1997. This coalition collapsed after forces loyal to Hun Sen
 ousted Ranariddh from power in July 1997. Ranariddh fled the country along with
 other leading politicians from FUNCINPEC and other political parties. With their
 return in March, the campaign leading to the July elections belatedly began, and
 elections ultimately were held in July. More than 93 percent of the eligible elector-
 ate voted. The CPP received 41.4 percent of the vote; FUNCINPEC 31.7 percent;
 the Sam Rainsy Party 14.3 percent. The 36 other parties together received 12.6 per-
 cent. Following more than 3 months of political deadlock, during which government
 legal institutions dismissed claims of election irregularities and parties conducted
 large public demonstrations, a new coalition government was formed.
 Until March the Government denied opposition parties their political rights and
 precluded them from opening offices or putting up party signs. In March the Gov-
 ernment registered 44 parties as legal political parties, which gave them the right
 to operate, put up signs, receive funds, engage in political activities, and otherwise
 campaign freely. In June the National Election Commission registered 39 parties for
 the election. Although there were no significant problems associated with these pro-
 cedures in the majority of places, opposition party members were unable to cam-
 paign in some remote areas because of threats or fears of violence. There were a
 number of attacks on party signs, which intimidated campaign workers.
 There were credible reports that government officials used intimidation and
 threats to force FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party members to sign oaths of loy-
 alty to the CPP and to vote for that party's candidates in the elections (see Section
 1.f.).
 The UNHCR received 18 reported cases of killings and two cases of attempted
 killings during the preelection period. Of these, only three were determined to have
 been clearly politically motivated, and two others were perpetrated by Khmer Rouge
 forces. Of the 18 cases, at least 5 involved the killing of CPP officials. The UNHCR
 also received numerous reports of illegal arrests, physical abuse, threats, harass-
 ment, and intimidation during the period. Intimidation claims frequently involved
 threats to party sign boards, but not persons. Many of the suspected perpetrators
 were members of local security forces or local CPP officials; in many cases, the per-
 petratrs were not identified.

 Voter registration generally was considered a success by election monitors, as very
 large numbers of eligible voters registered. However, some problems were reported
 that may have limited the rights of persons to vote. They included reports of armed
 soldiers, police, militia, and local officials in and around registration stations in vio-
 lation of the election law. There were also reports that illegal registration took place
 before and after official hours and of expedited registration of large groups of per-
 sons transported to registration sites. by party officials, raising questions about their
 eligibility. Widespread but unconfirmed opposition reports claimed that there was
 mass registration of ethnic Vietnamese persons who were not Cambodian citizens.
 Structural problems with registration included: Confusion over opening and clos-
 ing dates for registration; the very short period for registration (22 to 23 days); lack
 of information about the registration process; and confusion about where registra-
 tion must take place. No arrangements were made to allow the significant number
 of eligible voters among Cambodian citizens in refugee camps in Thailand to reg-
 ister. In addition no provisions were made for the large number of citizens living
 abroad to register.
 The Government dominated the broadcast media during the election campaign, as
 news about opposition politicians and their views were virtually excluded from cov-
 erage during the election process (see Section 2.a.).
 In National Assembly elections, each province elected members through a .system
 of proportional representation. Three of the 39 parties that took part 3 won seats:
 The CPP won 64 seats; FUNCINPEC won 43 seats; and the Sam Rainsy party won
 15 seats. Over 93 percent of the eligible persons cast ballots. Despite the incidents
 of political violence and intimidation and the failure of legal institutions to resolve
 complaints of election irregularities sufficiently, most international observer groups
 certified the election as acceptable. The formation of the new Government reflected
 the will of the electorate.
 However,, the political opposition was harassed after the election. According to
 Human Rights Watch, there was "a wave of reprisals by officials and security
 forces" affiliated with the CPP. Local officials, forces loyal to the CPP, and others
 reportedly coerced members of opposition parties to flee their villages, sometimes
 firing on them (see Section 1.f.). An atmosphere of fear and political intimidation
 prompted dozens of opposition politicians to flee the country temporarily after the
 National Assembly inauguration (see Section 1.d.). �
 After more than 3 months of political negotiation, the CPP and FUNCINPEC, the
 two parties that won the largest number of votes and seats in the National Assem-
 bly, entered into a coalition government in November that provided for a roughly
 equal power sharing between the parties, with Hun Sen as Prime Minister and
 Prince Ranariddh as President of the National Assembly. Of the 9 National Assem-
 bly committee chairs, four were allocated to the CPP, four to FUNCINPEC, and one
 to the SRP. The National Assembly approved this coalition government in Novem-
 ber, and the government portfolios were announced in December along with a politi-
 cal platform for the new Government.
 The legislature remained weak in comparison with the executive branch. The pre-
 vious government appointed the provincial governors and their deputies, who gen-
 erally are divided between the CPP and FUNCINPEC parties; by year's end, new
 appointments had not yet been made. District and commune officials also were ap-
 pointed by the previous government; most of these officials are appointees from the
 previous regimes, the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the State of Cambodia.
 Communal elections were scheduled for 1999, but the National Assembly has not
 enacted the communal election law.
 Traditional cultural practices inhibit the role of women in government. In its po-
 litical platform, the Government in November pledged to promote women's develop-
 ment in politics. Women took an active part in the elections, and 5 of the 39 political
 parties vying for National Assembly seats were headed by a woman. Representation
 of women in the National Assembly and Cabinet increased slightly following the
 election. There are 10 women among the 122 members of the National Assembly
 and 2 ministers and 4 state secretaries in the Cabinet.
 The Government established a new cabinet Ministry of Women's and Veteran's Af-
 fairs in December and appointed a woman as minister and to both state secretary
 positions. The Government also appointed a woman to head the Ministry of Culture
 and appointed women as state secretaries in the Justice and Social Affairs and
 Labor Ministries.
 There are several members of ethnic and religious minorities in the Cabinet and
 the National Assembly (see Section 5).
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The large domestic and international human rights community that began operat-
 ing during the UNTAC period remained active and engaged in diverse activities.
 Numerous human rights organizations and the UNCHR conducted human rights
 training for election observers, military officers, villagers, the legal community, and
 other groups. There are approximately 40 NGO's involved in human rights activi-
 ties, but only a small portion were involved actively in organizing training programs
 or carrying out investigations of abuses. The Government generally cooperated with
 human rights workers in performing their investigations, but one local NGO re-
 ported limited cooperation from some provincial authorities in conducting inspec-
 tions of prison conditions.
 The Government established the Cambodian Human Rights Committee in June
 to conduct investigations of individual cases of alleged human rights violations. The
 committee also is charged with improving the administration of justice and drafting
 a law establishing an independent permanent national human rights commission.
 By year's end, the national commission had not been established.
 In May the Government and the UNCHR agreed to an extension until March
 2000 of its activities in the country. The UNCHR maintains a head office in Phnom
 Penh and has six provincial offices. The U.N. Special Representative for Human
 Rights continued to work with government officials at all levels, as well as with rep-
 resentatives of political parties and NGO's.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, language, reli-
 gious beliefs, or political views. Although the Government does not engage in dis-
 crimination systematically, it often fails to protect these rights in practice.
 Women.-International and domestic NGO workers report that violence against
 women, including rape and domestic violence, is common. Although there were re-
 ports of rape and domestic abuse, accurate statistical documentation is not avail-
 able. Authorities normally decline to become involved in domestic disputes, and the
 victims frequently are reluctant to complain.
 Prostitution and trafficking in women are serious problems. Due in part to budg-
 etary limitations, the Government has not enforced adequately a 1996 law against
 prostitution and trafficking in women. Despite sporadic government crackdowns on
 brothel operators in Phnom Penh that resulted in the closure of many brothels and
 the arrest of over 30 brothel owners, the prostitution trade continues to flourish in
 the capital. In June, following an investigation by a local NGO, the owner of one
 of the largest brothels in Poipet was arrested for killing a young woman who refused
 to have sex relations with customers.
 According to NGO reports, women constitute 52 percent of the population, 60 per-
 cent of agricultural workers, 85 percent of the business work force, 70 percent of
 the industrial work force, and 60 percent of all service sector workers. Women often
 are concentrated in low-paying jobs in these sectors and largely are excluded from
 management positions.
 The Constitution contains explicit language providing for equal rights for women,
 equal pay for equal work, and equal status in marriage. In practice women have
 equal property rights with men, have the same status in bringing divorce proceed-
 ings, and have equal access to education and to some jobs. However, cultural tradi-
 tions continued to limit the ability of women to reach senior positions in business
 and other areas. There are a large number of women's NGO's, which concentrated
 on training poor women and widows and on addressing social problems such as
 spousal abuse and prostitution.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for children's rights, and ensuring the wel-
 fare of children is a specific goalof the Government. However, according to the U.N.,
 20 percent of children under 5 years of age suffer from acute malnutrition. The Gov-
 ernment relies on international aid to fund most social welfare programs targeted
 at children, resulting in only a modest flow of funds to ameliorate problems affecting
 children. Children frequently suffer from the inadequacy of the health care system.
 Infant mortality is reported at 89.4 per thousand, and 12 percent of children do not
 live to the age of 5 years. Child mortality from preventable diseases is high.
 Children also are affected adversely by an inadequate educational system. Despite
 an extensive government school construction program, schools are overcrowded and
 short of equipment. Less than 5 percent of primary school teachers have completed
 high school. The Government does not deny girls equal access to education, but in
 .practice families with limited resources often give priority to educating boys.
 
 
 834
 Child abuse is believed to be common, although there are no statistics on the ex-
 tent of the problem. Poverty and domestic violence often drive children onto the
 streets; local NGO's estimate that there are more than 10,000 street children in
 Phnom Penh alone who are easy targets for sexual abuse and exploitation.
 Although sexual intercourse with a minor under the age of 15 is illegal, child
 prostitution and trafficking -in children are common. There were reliable reports
 that children were kidnaped in some provinces and forced into the illegal sex trade,
 both in Cambodia and abroad (see Section 6.c.).
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not require that buildings or gov-
 ernment services be accessible to the disabled. According to the Government, ap-
 proximately 1 in 246 citizens is missing at least one limb. This statistic reflects the
 continuing effects of land mine detonations. Programs administered by various
 NGO's have brought about substantial improvements in the treatment and rehabili-
 tation of amputees. However, amputees face considerable societal discrimination,
 particularly in obtaining skilled employment
 Religious Minorities.-Muslims are the largest religious minority, and experience
 little or no discrimination in practice. The small Christian community has not expe-
 rienced serious or systematic discrimination. Unlike the previous year, there were
 no reports of local tension between Cambodian Christians and non-Christians.
 Christian missionary groups have not encountered significant difficulties in perform-
 ing their work.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Citizens of Vietnamese and Chinese eth-
 nicity have long constituted the largest ethnic minorities. Ethnic Chinese citizens
 are well accepted in society. However, fear and animosity continue among Khmer
 citizens toward ethnic Vietnamese, who are seen as a threat to the Cambodian na-
 tion and culture. The rights of minorities under the 1996 nationality law are not
 explicit; constitutional protections are extended only to "lKhmer people," that is,
 Cambodians.
 There were credible reports that both security personnel and ordinary citizens
 routinely singled out Vietnamese citizens for discrimination during the election cam-
 paign. During the registration period, many were given language tests, then refused
 registration because of their accent or vocabulary. At the urging of opposition par-
 ties, the National Election Commission deleted some ethnic Vietnamese citizens
 from voter registration lists on insufficient evidence and without notice. Some lead-
 ing opposition politicians campaigned on a theme of ethnic hatred and used ethnic
 slurs to urge expulsion of Vietnamese immigrants.
 After the election, some opposition politicians, including Ranariddh and Sam
 Rainsy, made inflammatory statements propaganda directed against ethnic Viet-
 namese citizens and Vietnamese residents. Many Vietnamese received verbal death
 threats and other harassment from both security personnel and ordinary citizens in
 the aftermath of the demonstrations in August and September. Some prominent op-
 position politicians used racial epithets and anti-Vietnamese slogans during the
 antigovernment rallies. At least 4 ethnic Vietnamese were killed in ethnic violence
 following the demonstrations during a wave of popular suspicion that Vietnamese
 were responsible for a number of alcohol or food poisoning incidents. In September
 Nguyen Van Minh was beaten to death by a crowd on suspicion that he had
 poisoned wine at a shop in Phnom Penh, where he had gone to buy a pack of cards.
 Police found no evidence of poisoning. Also in September, an unidentified Vietnam-
 ese woman was beaten to death on a street in Phnom Penh by a crowd after an
 argument over poisoning. A-Vietnamese husband and wife, Nguyen Thi Muy and
 Tong Van Hoi, sought to intervene and also were killed by the crowd. No poison
 was found at the scene.
 The Khmer Rouge continued a calculated campaign against ethnic Vietnamese
 residents. In April Khmer Rouge attackers massacred 23 persons in a predomi-
 nanty Vietnamese fishing village in Kompong Chhnang province, including 13 eth-
 nic Vietnamese. In another attack blamed on the Khmer Rouge in July,  3 ethnic
 Vietnamese were killed in Kratie province (see Section L.a.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 The new Government's political platform announced plans to consolidate imple-
 mentation of the Labor Law and international treaties relating to labor and the
 rights of unions.
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1997 Labor Law provides workers with the right
 to form professional organizations of their own choosing without prior authorization,
 and all workers are free to join the trade union of their choice; however, the Govern-
 ment's enforcement of these rights has been uneven. Membership in trade unions
 or employee associations is not compulsory, and workers are free to withdraw from
 such organizations. The Government issued decrees and subdecrees clarifying the
 
 
 835
 Labor Law in a number of areas, including the registration of labor unions, the elec-
 tion of worker representatives, the registration of collective bargaining agreements,
 and the calculation of overtime pay rates. However, despite these legal advances,
 the Government's enforcement efforts have been hampered by a lack of resources,
 little knowledge of the law by factory managers, and a lack of qualified labor inspec-
 tors.
 There were a large number of strikes and labor demonstrations in the first half
 of the year, virtually none of which were carried out in accordance with the law.
 The Government allowed all peaceful strikes and demonstrations to take place, al-
 though police intervened in violent strikes at several garment factories. In reaction
 to the wave of strikes, the Government established a Strike and Demonstration Set-
 tlement Committee in February chaired by the general director of the national po-
 lice. Despite concerns that the committee would become a vehicle to suppress peace-
 ful labor demonstrations, it appeared to have little effect.
 The Labor Law requires unions and employer organizations to file a charter and
 lists of officers with the Ministry of Social Affairs, Labor, Vocational Training, and
 Youth Rehabilitation. The Ministry registered approximately 25 new unions during
 the year, and a total of 44 unions have been registered since the Labor Law was
 passed in January 1997. However, most of these unions have few resources and op-
 erate at a very low level of activity. Many have close ties with the Government or
 management and are not independent in practice. Very few unions are able to-nego-
 tiate with management as equals.
 Some observers have charged that the Ministry of Labor has shown clear political
 bias in its administration of the April 1997 subdecree on union registration. As a
 result, unions that have close relations with the CPP can obtain registration easily,
 while the applications of unions linked to the opposition are subject to numerous
 delays. The Ministry registered the opposition Free Trade Union of the Workers of
 the Kingdom of Cambodia in December after having held up its application for more
 than 8 months for technical reasons. Observers also charged that the subdecree is
 unduly burdensome and requires unions to fie an excessive number of documents.
 The Ministry has held elections for shop stewards in more than 50 factories.
 While shop stewards in some factories have begun to represent workers to manage-
 ment, there is evidence that elections in other factories were conducted improperly
 due to collusion between labor inspectors and management.
 Most workers are subsistence rice farmers and have little knowledge of trade
 unions. Nearly all trade union activity has been concentrated in the rapidly growing
 garment sector. Although there is an expanding service sector, most urban workers
 are engaged in low-level commerce, self-employed skilled labor, or unskilled day
 labor. The Labor Law does not apply to workers in the public sector.
 Unions may affiliate freely, but the law does not address explicitly their right to
 affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Law provides for
 the right to organize and bargain collectively; however, the Government's enforce-
 ment of these rights has been uneven.
 In the two years since the passage of the Labor Law, there has been confusion
 over the overlapping roles of labor unions and shop stewards. The Labor Law gives
 unions the right to negotiate with management over wages and working conditions
 and allows unions to nominate candidates for shop steward positions. However, the
 Labor Law gives the shop stewards the right to represent the union to the company
 director and to sign collective bargaining agreements.
 In practice very little collective bargaining takes place. During the wave of strikes
 and demonstrations in the first half of the year, workers at some factories asked
 political figures to negotiate collective agreements on their behalf; many of these
 agreements are no longer honored. A successful strike in February by a union at
 a Phnom Penh cigarette factory represented the first known instance in which an
 officially registered trade union held a strike that generally conformed with Labor
 Law requirements.
 The Labor Law prohibits discrimination against the leaders of registered trade
 unions and protects them against dismissal. Employers are required to obtain per-
 mission from the Ministry of Social Affairs, Labor, Vocational Training, and Youth
 Rehabilitation before terminating officers of trade unions. However, these provisions
 are not enforced adequately, and observers have charged that in several instances
 the Ministry of Labor has allowed the firing of union leaders. In the first decision
 of its kind, a court in Kandal province ruled in January that a Phnom Penh gar-
 ment factory had violated the Labor Law when it fired union leader Srey Em in
 June 1997. The court ordered that Em be reemployed and receive back pay and com-
 pensation for damages that she has sustained. However, management at the factory
 
 
 836
 defied the court and refused to rehire Em; both sides later agreed to a severance
 pay package.
 The Government sets wages for civil servants. Wage rates in other sectors largely
 are based on market conditions and are set by employers.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Law prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, including forced labor by children; however, the Government
 does not enforce prohibitions against forced or compulsory labor adequately. In 1996
 the National Assembly adopted the Law on the Exploitation and Trafficking of Hu-
 mans. The law establishes a jail sentence of from 15 to 20 years for any person con-
 victed of trafficking in persons under the age of 15.
 There were credible reports of mandatory overtime in the garment industry as
 well as reports of women and girls being forced to work as prostitutes. The most
 recent survey of this problem, made by a human rights NGO in 1995, indicated that
 31 percent of female prostitutes were between the ages of 12 and 17. Half the girls
 involved were sold into prostitution by their families and forced to work as pros-
 titutes. There we also reports that children were kidnaped and forced to work in
 the illegal sex trade (see Section 5).
 Although the institution of bonded labor does not appear to be widespread, there
 were credible reports of bonded labor in -the wood-processing, rubber, and brick
 manufacturing industries, There were also reports that military officers have imple-
 mented the forced conscription of both adults and children; the Government denies
 that it has engaged in this practice.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Law establishes 15 years as the minimum age for employment. However, the
 law permits children between the ages of 12 and 15 to engage in "light work" that
 is not hazardous to their health and does not affect school attendance. The Ministry
 of Social Affairs, Labor, Vocational Training,- and Youth Rehabilitation has not set
 up an apparatus t enforce this law and has not published a list of occupations con-
 sidered acceptable for minors.
 In May the Government issued a subdecree that established the labor advisory
 committee responsible for setting industry minimum wage rates and specifying par-
 ticular occupations that are hazardous to the health, safety, or morality of adoles-
 cents and that cannot employ workers under age 18. The committee is also respon-
 sible for consulting with the Ministry of Labor to determine the types of employ-
 ment and working conditions that constitute "light work" for children between the
 ages of 12 and 15.
 Children under the age of 15 routinely engage in a variety of jobs, including street
 trading, construction, agriculture, and small-scale manufacturing. According to an
 ILO study, 9.2 percent of children are "economically active." More than 90 percent
 of working children live in rural areas. The law prohibits forced labor by children;
 however, the Government does not enforce the law effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law requires that a minimum
 wages be established for each sector of the economy based on recommendations by
 the Labor Advisory Committee. To date, a minimum wage has been set only in one
 sector, the garment industry, where workers must be paid a minimum of $40
 (151,000 reil)per month after the conclusion of their training period. Although there
 have been numerous, credible reports of employers paying less than this minimum
 wage, enforcement of the provision improved. This wage is not sufficient to provide
 a worker and family with a decent standard of living.
 The Labor Law provides for a standard legal workweek of 48 hours, not to exceed
 8 hours per day. The law stipulates time-and-one-half overtime pay, and double
 overtime pay if the overtime hours are worked at night or on the employee's day
 off. The Government does not enforce these standards adequately, and workers fre-
 quently complain about being required illegally to work more than 48 hours a week.
 Another common complaint in the garment industry is that management violates
 the law by paying the overtime rate only for the salary component of workers' pay-
 checks, leaving piece rates unchanged regardless of the number of hours worked.
 The Labor Law states that the workplace should have health and safety stand-
 ards adequate to ensure workers' well-being. The Government issued several in-
 structions on workplace standards during the year, but enforced these standards in-
 adequately. Work-related injury and health problems are common. Conditions in
 small-scale factories and cottage industries generally are poor and often do not meet
 international standards. Penalties are specified in the Labor Law, but there are no
 provisions to protect workers who complain about unsafe and unhealthy conditions.
 Workers who remove themselves from unsafe working conditions risk loss of employ-
 ment.
