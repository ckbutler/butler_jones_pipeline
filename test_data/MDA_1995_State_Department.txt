 MOLDOVA
 Moldova gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1994 it adopt-
 ed a Constitution which provides for a multiparty, representative government with
 power divided among a president, cabinet, parliament, and judiciary. Multiparty
 elections were held in February 1994; independent observers considered them gen-
 erally free and fair. The Democratic Agrarian Party achieved a majority and formed
 a new government with Andrei Sangheli as Prime Minister, a post he has held since
 1992. The Democratic Agrarian Party lost its majority in August when 11 of its
 members joined a new party formed by President Mircea Snegur, the Party of Re-
 newal and Conciliation. The alliance of the Socialist Party and the Movement for
 Equal Rights (Unitatea-Edinstvo) generally has voted with the Democratic Agrarian
 Party.
 Moldova remains divided, with     mostly Slavic separatists controlling the
 Transdniester region. This separatist movement, though unwilling to accept the po-
 litical and economic implications of Moldovan independence, has entered negotia-
 tions with the Government on the possibility of a special political status for the re-
 gion. Progress was blocked, however, by the separatists' demands for "statehood*
 and the creation of a confederation of two equal states. The Organization of Security
 and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Russian Federation act as mediators
 and were joined by Ukraine this year. Tranadniester authorities continued to com-
 mit human rights abuses. The two sides have generally observed the cease-fire of
 July 1992, which ended armed conflict between them. The Modovan Government
 successfully resolved a conflict involving a separatist movement led by the Gaganz
 (Christian Turkic) minority in the southern part of the country by granting the re-
 gion local autonomy._
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs has responsibility for the police. The Ministry of
 National Security controls the other security organizations. The Constitution as-
 signs to Parliament the authority to investigate the activities of these ministries to
 ensure they comply with legislation in effect, and Parliament has excercised this au-
 thority on several occasions. Some members of the security forces committed human
 rights abuses.
 Moldova ontinued to make progress in economic reform. A privatization program
 based on vouchers issued to all citiens is virtually complete. However, the economy
 is largely based on agrculture, and agricultural privatizatio continues to lag be-
 hind. In February Parient passed a law slowing the onversion of land belonging
 to agricultural ollectives into private property. A p proximately 75 percent of collec-
 tive farms have become joint stock companies, with shares being issued to collective
 farmers. Some 27,000 Moldovans registered as private farmers but the total number
 of private farmers is estimated to be from 47,000 to 50,000. The per capita gross
 domestic product is $367.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, however
 there were problems in some areas. The police occasionally beat some detainees and
 prisoners. The new Constitution improved protection for basic human rights but in-
 corporated language potentially limiting the activities of political parties and the
 press, especially Artice 32, which forbids "contesting or defamg the State and the
 people," and Article 41, which declares unconstitutional parties that militate against
 the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Moldova. Addressing a mi-
 nority concern, the new Constitution provides parents with the right to choose the
 language of education for their children. A 1995 judicial reform created a Constitu-
 tional Court and a system of appellate courts; however the appellate court system
 is not yet in place. Although the Constitution provides for an independent judiciary,
 the prosecutor's office still has undue influence over the judiciary. Security forces
 monitor political opposition members and use unauthorized wiretaps.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no verified reports of po-
 litically motivated killings either in Moldova or its separatist region. Information
 
 
 950
 from the Transdniester region is, however limited. In September Moldovan authori-
 ties claimed that since the beginning of the year 459 victims of violence have been
 buried in unmaed graves in a cemetery in Tiraspol, the capital of the separatist
 region.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no allegations of torture of civil or criminal prisoners by Moldovan au-
 thorities, but there were credible reports that police sometimes beat prisoners or
 suspects.
 Conditions are harsh in most prisons. They are especially harsh in prisons used
 to hold people awaiting trial or sentencing. These prisons especially suffer from
 overcrowding, bad ventilation, and a lack of recreational and rehabilitation facilities.
 Conditions or those serving sentences are only marginally better. Jailers sometimes
 tolerate prisoners abusing other prisoners and occasionally beat prisoners them-
 selves ostensibly for disciplinary reasons. Following a recommendation by the Coun-
 cil of Europe, responsibility for prisons is being transferred from the Ministry of the
 Interior to the Ministry of Justice.
 In the Transdniester region, four Moldovans, whose trial was criticized by inter-
 national human rights organizations as flawed, are still serving their sentences.
 They have been allowed regular access to their families. The International Commit-
 tee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which visited these prisoners, on two occasions (1992
 and 1993) in Tiraspol, was denied the possibility to repeat such visits despite nu-
 merous representations, most recently in July, to the Tiraspol authorities. However,
 the local Helsinki Watch chapter was able to visit one of the prisoners in March.
 In September a group of Moldovan doctors was allowed to examine all four pris-
 oners. The doctors found that three of the four were debilitated enough for item
 to recommend that they be hospitalized. They noted that the prisoners' refusal to
 accept medication apart from that brought to them by their families may have con-
 tributed to their deciine.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The former Soviet Code on Penal Proce-
 dure remains in force with some amendments. Prosecutors issue arrest warrants.
 Under the new Constitution, a suspect may be detained without charge for 24 hours.
 The suspect is normally allowed family visits during this period. The 24-hour time
 limit appeared to be generally respected. If charged, a suspect may be released
 pending trial. There is no system of bail, but in some cases a friend or relative, in
 order to arrange release, may give a written undertaking that the accused will ap-
 pear for trial.
 Suspects accused of violent or serious crimes are generally not released before
 trial. The new Constitution permits pretrial arrest for an initial period of 30 days,
 which may be extended to 6 months. The accused has the right under the new Con-
 stitution to a hearing before a court regarding the legality of his arrest. In excep-
 tional cases, Parliament may approve extension of pretrial detention on an individ-
 ual basis up to 12 months. According to figures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,
 9,985 people are in detention in faciities designed to hold 12,400. However, foreign
 diplomats who visited one detention facility believed it to be overcrowded.
 According to the new Constitution, a detained person must be informed imme-
 diately of the reason for his arrest, and he must be made aware of charges against
 him "as quickly as possible." The accused is provided the right to a defense attorney
 throughout the entire process, and the attorney must be present when the charges
 are brought. If the defendant cannot afford an attorney, the State will provide one.
 In practice, the State sometimes impedes access to lawyers or provides a lawyer who
 is less than competent or energetic.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The independence of the judiciary has increased
 since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Constitution provides that the Presi-
 dent, on the nomination of an expert judicial body, the Superior Council of Mag-
 istrates, appoints judges for an initial period of 5 years. They may be reappointed
 for a subsequent 10 years after which they serve until retirement age. This provi-
 sion for judicial tenure is designed to increase judicial independence.
 The 1995 judicial reforms approved by Parliament were not fully implemented.
 The reforms created a Constitutional Court to deal with constitutional issues and
 a system of appeals courts. The reforms call for district courts of the first instance
 and there  gonal appeals courts or courts of the second instance. There will be a
 higher appeals court as well as the final court of appeal, the Supreme Court. But
 staffs for the appeals courts have not been named nor facilities provided. The Su-
 preme Court supervises and reviews the activities of the lower courts. By law, de-
 fendants in criminal cases are presumed innocent. In practice,  rosecutors' rec-
 ommendations still carry considerable weight and limit defendants right to a pre-
 sumption of innocence.
 
 
 951
 Generally, trials are open to the public. Defendants have the right to attend pro-
 ceedings, confront witnesses, and present evidence. Defense attorneys are able to re-
 view the evidence against their clients when preparing their cases. The accused en-
 joys a right to appeal to a higher court (currently the Supreme Court). In a number
 of cases, decisions of the lower court were overturned on appeal.
 To date, no pattern of discrimination has emerged in the judicial system. The new
 Constitution provides for the right of the accused to have an interpreter both at the
 trial and in reviewing the documents in the case. If the majority of participants
 agree, trials may take place in Russian or another acceptable language instead of
 Romanian/Moldovan.
 There continue to be credible reports that local prosecutors occasionally bring un-
 justified ch  as ainst individuals in retribution for accusations of official corrup-
 tion or for political reasns. Prosecutors occasionally use bureaucratic maneuvers to
 restrict lawyers' access to clients.
 In the Transdniester region, four Moldovans, members of the 'Tiraspol Six, re-
 main in prison following their conviction in 1993 for allegedly assassinating two sep-
 aratist officials. International human rights groups raised serious questions about
 the fairness of the trial, and local organiations alleged that the Mldovans were
 prosecuted for political reasons, solely because of their membership in the Christian
 Democratic Popular Front, a Moldovan party that favors reunification with Romania
 (see Section 1..).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Pros-
 ecutors may issue search warrants. In some instances, searches are conducted with-
 out warrants. Courts do not exclude evidence that was illegally obtained. There is
 no judicial review of search warrants.
 The Constitution specifies that searches must be carried out "in accordance with
 law" but does not specify the consequences if the law is not respected. It also forbids
 searches at night, except in the case of flagrant crime.
 It is widely believed that the security forces continued to use electronic monitor-
 ing of residences and telephones of opponents of the Government. By law, the pros-
 ecutor's office must authorize wiretaps and may do so only if a criminal investiga-
 tion is under way. In practice, the prosecutor's office lacks the ability to control the
 security organizations and police and prevent them from using wiretaps illegally.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the law provide for free-
 dom of speech and the press, although with some restrictions. The Government does
 not abridge freedom of speech, and the print media express a wide variety of politi-
 cal views and commentary. National and city governments own a number of news-
 papers, but political parties and professional organizations, including trade unions,
 also publish newspapers.
 Several independent radio stations broadcast in Moldova, including at least one
 religiously oriented station. An independent television station started broadcasting
 in August. The independent media outlets maintain news staffs and conduct a num-
 ber of public interest programs. The Government owns and operates a television
 channel and several of the major radio stations.
 The press law retains language (after some modification as a result of rec-
 ommendations made by the Council of Europe and the OSCE) that forbids 'contest-
 ingor defamin the State or the people." These restrictions are also contained in
 the new Constitution. They appear to be aimed at journalists publishing material
 in favor of reunification with Romania and questioning the legal right of the Repub-
 lic of Moldova to exist.
 The Government does not restrict foreign publications. Western publications do
 not circulate widely since they are very expensive by local standards. Romanian and
 Russian publications also have become difficult to obtain due to their expense.
 Moldova receives television and radio broadcasts from Romania and Russia. Cable
 subscribers receive the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) Super Channel,
 Euro-News, and a number of entertainment networks.
 In the Transdniester, print media, with the exception of a paper published by
 local Russian army units, are controlled by the local authorities. The one independ-
 ent cable television station is under pressure from the authorities. Most Moldovan
 papers do not circulate in the Transdniester. A few copies of the Moldovan govern-
 ment paper and a paper sponsored by the ruling Democratic-Agrarian party do cir-
 culate there, but in extremely limited fashion. Circulation of all print media in
 Transdniester is greatly limited by the local economic crisis, which is more severe
 than in the rest of Moldova.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 to peaceful assembly. The mayor's office generally issues permits for demonstra-
 
 
 952
 tions; it may consult the national Government if the demonstration is likely to be
 extremely large.
 During the late summer, the Chisinau city government closed the large central
 square in front of the government buildings. The square was the site of major dem-
 onstrations for sovereignty in late perestroika times and is still the most popular
 place in the country for demonstrations. The city claimed that it was necessary to
 turn the square into a parking lot. It was forced to rescind its decision after a few
 weeks because of extensive public criticism. Nonetheless, permits are often issued
 for a nearby park or other central locations rather than the central square. Private
 organizations, including political parties are required to register, but applications
 are approved routinely.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-he practice of religion generally is free. Parliament
 passed a law on religion in 1992 which codified religious freedoms, although it con-
 tained restrictions that could inhibit the activities of some religious groups. The law
 provides for freedom of religious practice, including each person's right to profess
 his religion in any form. It also provides for alternative military service for conscien-
 tious objectors, protects the secrets of the confessional, allows denominations to es-
 tablish associations and foundations, and states that the Government may not inter-
 fere in the religious activities of denominations. The law, however, also requires
 that religious gups register with the Government in order to function and that de-
 nominations obtain specific government approval to hire noncitizens. The law also
 prohibits proselytizing.
 Some Protestant denominations are concerned that the prohibition on proselytiz-
 ing could inhibit their activities, although many denominations hold large revival
 meetings apparently without official interference. To date, the authorities have
 taken no legal action against individuals for proselytizing.
 Protestant groups have increased their ties with coreligionists abroad; foreign
 missionaries are aso established in Moldova. About 20 denominations are registered
 and active in Moldova, including Baha'i, followers of Krishna, and Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses. These groups had been denied registration in the past. A Protestant sect and
 the Salvation Army, however, have not been able to register as religious denomina-
 tions because they do not meet the requirement of having a Moldovan citizen as the
 organization's legal head.
 Although Eastern Orthodoxy is not designated in the law on religion as the offi-
 cial religion of Moldova, it continued to be the strongest religious force and exerted
 significant influence. The Metropolitanate broke away from the Moldovan Orthodox
 Church, which is under the authority of the Patriarch of Moscow, to adhere to the
 Romanian Orthodox Church in 1992. The Government has consistently refused to
 register the church, citing unresolved problems connected to the new church's prop-
 erty claims as the principal reason it will not register the group. In September a
 district court ruled that the Government's refusal to register the "Metropolitanate
 of Bessarabia--old style" was illegal. The Government is appealing the case. Har-
 assment of the Metroplitanate by local authorities and priests of the Moldovan Or-
 thodox Church virtually ceased this year. Officials of the Metropolitanate attribute
 this decrease to the support of international organizations and Western govern-
 ments.
 The Jewish community, although small, is very active. Jewish leaders report that
 their relations with the Government and local authorities are cooperative. A Jewish
 secondary school was opened in September.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 p atriation.-There are no closed areas or restrictions on travel within Moldova.
 oldovans generally are able to travel freely, however there are some restrictions
 on emigration. Close relatives with a claim to support from the applicant must give
 their concurrence. The Government may also deny permission to emigrate if the ap-
 plicant had access to state secrets. Such cases, however, are very rare, and none
 were reported in 1995.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Moldova held its first multiparty parliamentary elections in February 1994. Inter-
 national monitors from OSCE member countries observing the elections deemed
 them generally free and fair. Some observers, however, noted several problem areas,
 including unequal access to the media and the use of state resources by the domi-
 nant party. The elections were based on straight roportional representation, with
 a 4-percent threshold for entry into Parliament. Four parties or blocs entered Par-
 liament. The Democratic Agrarian Party, the largest bloc in the former Parliament,
 won 56 of the 104 seats. The Socialist/Unity Bloc won 28 seats and usually votes
 with the Agrarians.
 
 
 953
 In August eleven Agrarian deputies left the ruling party (one later returned) to
 join a new political party, the Party of Renewal and Conciliation, founded by Presi-
 dent Snegur. The Democratic Agrarian Party then expelled three of the defectors
 from their parliamentary posts. The Constitutional Court overturned the expulsion,
 saying that Parliament had not followed its own procedures in expelling them. Par-
 liament accepted the decision, thus averting a constitutional crisis, and reinstated
 the deputies briefly to their posts. Parliament then expelled the defectors from their
 posts again, this time following its prescribed procedures.
 Other seats are held by the Peasants and Intellectuals Bloc and the Christian
 Democratic Popular Front. These groups emphasize the importance of increased use
 of the Romanian language in public life, closer economic and cultural ties with Ro-
 mania, and increased privatization of agricultural land. Some members of these
 groups advocate reunification with neighboring Romania.
 The new Constitution provides for the division of power between the popularly
 elected President, the Cabinet, the Parliament, and the judiciary. The President, as
 Head of State, in consultation with the Parliament, appoints the Cabinet and the
 Prime Minister, who functions as the Head of Government. Parliamentary elections
 are scheduled to take place every 4 years, as are presidential elections.
 The Constitution states that citizens are free to form parties and other social-po-
 litical organizations. A controversial article states, however, that those organizations
 that militate against political pluralism, the principles of the rule of law, or of the
 sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova, are
 unconstitutional. Opposition parties, some of which favor rapid or eventual reunifi-
 cation with neighbring Romania, have charged that this provision is intended to
 impede their political activities.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice barring the participation of women
 or minorities in political life. But women generally are underrepresented in leading
 positions of political parties. Women hold only 5 of the 104 parliamentary seats. The
 Association of Moldovan Women, a social-political organization, competed in the
 1994 elections but received less than 3 percent of the vote. Russian, Ukrainian, Bul-
 garian, and Gagauz minorities are represented in Parliament; debate takes place in
 either the Romanian/Moldovan or Russian language, with translation provided.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 . vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups exist. The local Helsinki Watch organization
 maintains contacts with international human rights organizations, as does the Hel-
 sinki Citizens Assembly, whose President is the Chairman of the Parliamentary
 Human Rights Commission and leader of the minority rights movement Unity.
 Human rights groups operate without government interference.
 The Government has welcomed and supported the work of the OSCE, which has
 had a mission in the country since 1993 to assist with finding a resolution for the
 separatist conflict. The Transdniester separatist authorities have always stated that
 they would cooperate with the OSCE mission, but only permitted its representatives
 to participate in all meetings of the joint commission this year after more than 2
 years of negotiations. The commission, composed of Russian, Moldovan, Ukrainian
 and Transdniester members, reviews violations of the cease-fire agreement. Pre-
 viously, the commission had agreed to allow the OSCE to participate in only about
 half the meetings. The mission now eIjoys full, though unofficial, access to the "se-
 curity zone' along the river dividing the separatist-controlled territory from the rest
 of Moldova.
 Moldova has cooperated with the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) in the past, permitting visits to prisoners from the 1992 conflict (since re-
 leased). Transdniester separist authorities did not allow the ICRC access to the
 members of the "llascu Six" currently serving their sentences since 1993. Such visits
 took place in 1992 and 1993, but were suspended at the end of 1993, because the
 ICRC was not allowed to make them in conformity with its standard modalities.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Article 16 of the Constitution says that all persons are equal before the law re-
 gardless of race, sex, disability, religion, language, or social origin. There are rem-
 edies, such as court orders for redress of grievances, but these are not always en-
 forced.
 Women.-Women who suffer physical abuse by their husbands have the right to
 press charges; husbands convicted of such abuse may receive prison sentences (up
 to 6 months is not uncommon). Public awareness of the problem of violence in fami-
 lies generally is not very high and no special government programs exist to combat
 
 
 spouse abuse. According to knowledgeable sources, women do not generally appeal
 to police or the courts for protection against abusive spouses because they are em-
 barrassed to do so. Police generally do not consider spouse abuse a serious crime,
 although, when cases do reach a court, they appear to be treated seriously. Women
 and legal authorities report that spouse abuse is not widespread. Through Novem-
 ber the Ministry of Internal Affairs recorded 220 cases of rape or attempted rape.
 The law provides that women shall be equal to men. However, according to statis-
 tics, women have been disproportionately affected by growing unemployment. By
 law, women are paid the same as men for the same work. Though still victimized
 by societal discrimnation, anecdotal evidence suggests women are now mre em-
 yable than men (more flexible, better workers), and are working now in order to
 make ends meet. There are a significant number of women managers in the public
 sector.
 Children.-Moldova has extensive legislation designed to protect children, includ-
 ing extended paid maternity leave and government supplementary payments for
 families with many children. The health system devotes extensive resources to child
 care. No special problems concerning child abuse came to light in 1995.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legal discrimination against people with dis-
 abilities. However, there are no laws providing for accessibility to buildings, and
 there are few government resources devoted to training people with disabilities. The
 Government does provide tax advantages to charitable groups that assist the dis-
 abled.
 Religious Minorities.-Drunks vandalized 40 headstones in the Jewish cemetary
 in one incident in Chisinau in May; police reacted quickly, arresting and jailing the
 perpetrators. In Bender, largely controlled by separatists, several Jews were report-
 edly beaten. Local Jewish leaders do not view either incident as part of a pattern
 of anti-Semitism.
 National IRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Moldova has a population of about 4.3 mil-
 lion, of which 65 percent are ethnic Romanian Moldovans. Ukrainians (14 percent)
 and Russians (13 percent) are the two largest minorities. A Christian Turkic minor-
 ity, the Gagauz, lives primarily in the southern regions. They are largely Russian-
 speaking and represent about 3.5 percent of the population.
 Moldova's citizenship law, adopted in 1990, offered an equal opportunity to all
 persons resident in Moldova at the time of independence to adopt Moldovan citizen-
 ship. The OSCE's Office of Democratic Institutio ns and Human Rights praised the
 law as being very liberal. The law permits dual citizenship on the basis of a bilat-
 eral agreement, but no such agreements were in effect.
 In 1994 the Parliament voted to delay until 1997 the implementation of the lan-
 guage testing foreseen in the lanuage law of 1989 and due to begin in 1994. The
 principle inherent in the language law is that, in dealing with any official or com-
 mercial entity, the citizen should be able to choose the language to use. Officials are
 therefore obligated to know Russian and Romanian/Moldovan "to the degree nec-
 essary to fulfill their professional obligations." Since many Russian-speakers do not
 speak Romnian/Moldovan (while all educated Moldovans speak both languages),
 they argued for a delay in the implementation of the law to permit more time to
 learn the language. Parliament also decided to review the procedures for testing and
 the categories of individuals to be tested. The Constitution provides parents with
 the right to choose the language of instruction for their children.
 In the separatist region, however, discrimination against Romanian/Moldovan-
 speakers continues. In most areas of the separatist region, Moldovan schools must
 use the Cyrillic alphabet when teaching Romanian. (The Cyrillic script was used to
 write the Romanian language in Moldova until 1989, since "Moldovan,* as it was
 then called, was officially decreed during the Soviet era to be a different language
 than Romanian, which is written in the Latin alphabet. The 1989 Language Law
 reinstituted the use of the Latin script.) A few schools finally obtained permission
 to use the Latin alphabet, but this permission is now being rescinded. Many teach-
 ers, parents, and students objected to the use of the Cyrillic script to teach Roma-
 nian. They believe that it disadvantages the children for higher education opportu-
 nities in the rest of Moldova or even Romania. They further object since it is a re-
 turn to one of the more oppressive and despised policies of the pre-Gorbachev era.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assoiation.-The 1990 Soviet Law on Trade Unions, which was
 endorsed by Moldova's then Supreme Soviet and is still in effect, provides for inde-
 pendent trade unions. Moldovan laws passed in 1989 and 1991, which give citizens
 the right to form all kinds of social organizations, also provide a legal basis for the
 formation of independent unions. The new Constitution further declares that any
 employee may found a union or join a union which defends workers' interests. How-
 
 
 ever, there have been no known attempts to establish alternate trade union struc-
 tures independent of the successor to the previously existing official organizations
 which wera part of the Soviet trade union system.
 The successor organization is the Federation of Independent Trade Unions
 (FITU). FITU's continuing role in managing the state insurance system and its re-
 tention of previously existing official union headquarters and vacation facilities pro-
 vide an inherent advantage over any newcomers who might wish to form a union
 outside its structure.
 However, its industrial or branch unions are becoming more independent entities;
 they maintain that their membership in FITU is voluntary and that they can with-
 draw if they wish. Virtually all employed adults are members of a union.
 Government workers d not have the right to strike, nor do those in essential
 services such as health care and energy. Other unions may strike if two-thirds of
 the members vote for a strike in a secret ballot. There were several labor actions
 for payment of back wages, including a number of strikes by teachers in various
 parts of the country. High hidden and official unemployment made workers con-
 cerned about job security. Unions may affiliate and maintain contacts with inter-
 national organizations.
 b. The Rght to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Moldovan law, which is still
 based on former Soviet legislation, provides for collective bargaining rights. How-
 ever, wages are set through a tripartite negotiation process involving government,
 management, and unions. On the national level, the three parties meet and nego-
 tiate national minimum wages for all categories of workers. Then, each of the
 branch unions representing a particular industry negotiates with management and
 the government ministries responsible for that industry. They may set wages higher
 than the minimum set on the national level and often do, especially if the industry
 in question is more profitable than average. Finally, on the enterprise level, union
 and management representatives negotiate directly on wages. Again, they may set
 wages higher than negotiators on the previous level
 There were no reports of actions taken against union members for union activi-
 ties. The 1990 Soviet Law on Trade Unions provides that union leaders may not be
 fired from their jobs while in leadership positions or for a period after they leave
 those positions. This law has not been tested in Moldva.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The new Constitution prohibits
 forced labor, and no instances of it were reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 under unrestricted conditions is 18 years. Employment of those ages 16 to 18 s per-
 mitted under special conditions, including shorter workdays, no night shifts, and
 longer vacations. The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection is prmarily respon-
 sible for enforcing these restrictions, and the Ministry of Health also has a role.
 Child labor is not used in Moldvan industry, although children living on farms do
 sometimes assist in the agricultural sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The current minimum monthly wage is *20.50
 (90.3 Moldovan lei). The average wage of $30.50 (138.2 Moldovan ei) does not pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The new Constitution sots
 the maximum workweek at 40 hours, and the Labor Code provides for at least 1
 day off per week. Due to severe budgetary constraints, the Government and enter-
 prises often did not meet the payroll Cor employees.
 The State is required to set and check safety standards in the workplace. The
 unions within F    also have inspection personnel who have a right to stop work
 in the factory or ine the enterprise if safety standards are not met. Further, work-
 ers have the right to refuse to work but may continue to draw their salaries if work-
 ing conditions represent a serious threat to their health. In practice, however, the
 declining economic situation has led enterprises to economize on safety equipment
 and generally to show less concern for worker safety issues. Workers often do not
 know their rights in this area.
