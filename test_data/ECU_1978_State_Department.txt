 ECUADOR
 Ecuador nas been governed by military regimes since
 1972. Tne present Government, which took power in
 January 1976, consists or a junta representing
 the tnree armed forces. The Government nominally
 accepts the strictures of the Constitution but
 in practice has operated without appreciable insti-
 tutional restraints. Violations of human rights
 retlect the regime's arbitrariness in individual
 cases, rather than concerted efforts to coerce-parti-
 cular groups or segments of the population, with
 the exception of trade unions. Ecuador is presently
 in the midst of a drawn-out election process which
 is intended to return the country to civilian,
 constitutional rule unaer an elected President
 in 1979.
 Ecuador's record in the area of economic rights is
 difficult to assess with precision. It is tne
 fifth poorest country in Latin America, by the
 gross indicator of per capita income. The level
 of economic development and of resources available
 to meet human needs is insufficient to satisfy
 those needs for the entire population. Ecuador's
 limited national income is maldistributed in the
 extreme. The country has had no thoroughgoing
 socio-economic reform, although this is a major
 issue underlying the current Presidential campaign.
 I.   Respect tor tne Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 141, Section 1 of the Constitution prohibits
 torture and the death penalty. In 1978 there
 were no reported cases of torture, in the context
 
 
 242
 
 of political or national security cases. However,
 tnere have oeen two recent reports of intentional
 mistreatment or common prisoners during initial
 interrogation by the police.
 o. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Article 141, Section 1 further states that penal
 institutions shall be organized to effect the
 re-education and social rehabilitation of the
 criminal. In 1978 there were no reported cases
 of deliberate cruel, innumnan or degrading treatment
 or punishment. However, the standards of Ecuador's
 prisons are such that confinement in them can,
 of itself, sometimes constitute inhuman or aegraaing
 punishment. Prison officials can determine the
 form of imprisonment, ranging from relatively
 comfortable private cells or detention in a medical
 clinic to extended stays in "bullpens" with minimal
 comfort and sanitation standards. Prisoners are
 allowed to receive visits and supplies fron their
 ramilies. Groups such as the Red Cross are permitted
 access to prisons.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrests and detentions occur occasionally.
 Those involved include persons who have criticized the
 Government or who are alleged to have plotted against
 it, and persons who have engaged in illegal strike
 activity. Approximately ten such cases, involving
 politicians, journalists and student union activists,
 are known to have occurred in 1978. Confinement
 in those cases ranged from one day to two weeks.
 There have also been undocumented reports that
 Chilean exiles living in Ecuador have been detained
 without just cause, in some cases deported, or
 had their papers confiscated.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The great majority of Ecuadoreans have access to fair
 puDlic trial, within the procedural confines of the
 
 
 243
 civil code legal system. However, exceptions occur,
 particularly when the Government feels strong measures
 are necessary to preserve public order. Institution-
 alized denial of trial does occur in cases of illegal
 strikes.
 Public employee unions are forbidaen by law to strike.
 It is also necessary for trade unions to comply with
 certain Labor Ministry requirements before going on
 strike. The Government has decreed summary imprison-
 ment for those leaaing strikes of the first type.
 Two leaders of the National Teachers' Union served
 more than one year of two year sentences imposed
 in the wake of a national strike in May 1977. The
 Government released those leaders on September 11,
 1978.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Article 141, Section 8 of the Constitution insures
 the inviolability of the home, stating that "no
 one may enter a home against the will of its resident
 or without an order from the competent authority,
 issued in the-manner and in those cases that the
 law provides."
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfill-
 ment of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter,
 Health Care and Education
 Within constraints imposed by the relative scarcity
 of resources anu the generally low level of socio-
 economic development, Ecuador has made considerable
 efforts to fulfill economic and social needs. No
 sector of the population is formally excluded from
 access to education. Educational opportunity has
 expanded, with low or no cost education being pro-
 vided through university level to most sectors of
 the population. However, many poor Ecuadoreans,
 especially in the rural areas, forego education
 since they must seek gainful employment at a very
 early aye. Approximately 25 percent of the Govern-
 rent's published budget is devoted to education.
 
 
 244
 During the past few years rural health and sanitation
 services have been expanded significantly. Limited
 amounts of low-cost housing have been constructed,
 although insufficient to meet the aemand. Basic
 foodstuffs are sold at subsidized prices, bringing
 them within reach of all. Assistance to the small
 farmer is still insufficient although recent Govern-
 ment measures are intended to fill this need. The
 key element of this effort has been provision of
 low-cost credit to small farmers. The Central Bank
 has established a fund for marginal rural development
 aimed at assisting the poorest members of the agricul-
 tural sector. Ecuador's population is growing at
 a rate of 3.4 percent a year. Economic growth over
 the period 1975-77 averaged 7.5 percent.
 3.   Respect for Civil an Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 ana Assembly
 Aware that the Government will not tolerate slanderous
 or aeflamatory attacks against high officials, the
 press exercises some self-censorship. But there are
 no formal Government controls over what is puolished.
 Since the Government occasionally arrests, detains
 or fines individuals who make statements considered
 deflamatory by high Government otficials, freedom
 of speech is not completely unrestricted.
 There is no established religion and Ecuadoreans are
 free to practice the religion of their choice. Foreign
 missionaries operate freely.
 A peculiar phenomenon is the series of isolated bomings
 (seventy in two years) which have caused almost no per-
 sonal injuries and little property damage. Targets
 have included newspapers, politicians and other
 critics of the Government. Some politicians and
 
 
 245
 social critics charge that the Government is behind
 many of these bombings, seeking either to intimidate
 its critics or to sow suspicion and aistrust among
 the civilians.
 Street demonstrations require prior Government consent,
 which is normally forthcoming for political and non-
 political gatherings. Consent is usually withheld
 only for events which public security officials Delieve
 have a potential for public disorder. This rationale
 is usually interpreted quite narrowly. There are no
 restrictions on indoor meetings.
 Labor legislation is generally liberal, except for
 the decree providing for summary justice to leaders
 of illegal strikes. The legislation tends to favor
 workers over employers. However, the present military
 Government has adopted an hostile attitude towards
 organized labor and the legislation has not prevented
 arbitrary, anti-labor measures from being taken.
 One example was the abolition of the national teachers'
 union in the wake of the May 1977 strike.
 Women enjoy the same constitutional rights, as men.
 However, tradition and custom limit to a very large
 degree women's roles and opportunties in society.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There are no formal internal or external travel re-
 strictions. Ecuadoreans may emigrate freely. However,
 given the nature of the present governmental system,
 these rights, as others, are subject to arbitrary
 abuse. No such incidents were reported in 1978.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 While governed by a military junta, Ecuador is current-
 ly in the process of returning to elected, civilian
 
 
 246
 government. The military Government appears to be
 committed to its pledge to restore the country to
 democratic rule. Results of the July 16, 1978 first
 round gave the lead to a candidate who favors reform.
 The culmination of the electoral process is scheduled
 to take place Auyust 10, 1979. All political groups
 which were previously registered as parties or which
 could produce 25,000 valid signatures on registration
 lists were to have been permitted to participate in
 the electoral process. Most parties across the polit-
 ical spectrum did so. However, Government manipulation
 of the electoral process prevented two popular candi-
 dates from qualifying.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Ecuadorean Government has been an active supporter
 of human rights in international organizations. Ecuador
 ratified the American Convention on Human Rights on
 October 21, 1977 and is a member ot the Organization
 of American States' Juridical-Political Committee which
 oversees human rights efforts in the hemisphere.
 There were no requests in 1978 for formal investigations
 of human rights violations.
