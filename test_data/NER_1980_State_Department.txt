 NIGER
 Niger's military regime took the initiative in 1980 to
 liberalize the political climate and encourage greater
 participation in government. It released from prison to
 house arrest former President Hamani Diori, and Djibo
 Bakary, a prominent pre-independence political figure
 whose Swaba party has tried to overturn both the Diori
 and Kountche governments. The government also created a
 commission to draw the blueprints for a new political
 institution, the National Development Society, whose
 principal avowed objective is to make government at all
 levels more responsive to the popular will.
 These improvements not withstanding, Niger's political
 structure remains authoritarian. The constitution has
 been suspended since the military oveithrew the civilian
 government in 1974, claiming that corruption was wide-
 spread and that emergency measures were necessary to deal
 with the critical food shortages resulting from the Sahel
 drought. The freedoms of expression, assembly and political
 activity remain restricted, and the government rules by
 decree. The authority traditionally accorded chiefs and
 the pre-independence French legal system constitute the
 basis for the administration of justice in civil and crimi-
 nal cases. However, the authorities occasionally disregard
 judicial procedures to treat perceived offenders summarily.
 President Kountche has stated that it is not desirable
 for Niger to return to civilian rule because the past
 experience was disastrous. He believes the Diori regime's
 incompetence and corruption aggravated the effects of the
 Sahel drought. Kountche also has expressed the view that
 conventional western or eastern forms of civilian govern-
 ment have not worked in African settings where tribalism
 remains strong, educational standards are low, and escape
 from grinding poverty the focus of national energies.
 The priority which the government has accorded to economic
 development, particularly in self-sufficiency in food pro-
 duction, has brought continued improvement in living stan-
 dards. Revenues from minerals exploitation and foreign
 assistance have been almost completely devoted to the most
 pressing needs of the Nigerien people, with a heavy emphasis
 on those of the overwhelming rural population. Thanks to
 these investments and to favorable weather, food production
 has equalled consumption for two years.
 Despite the government's efforts, however, living standards
 (and per capita income) remain among the lowest in the
 world. The recent substantial drop in uranium prices will
 force a cutback in public investment and a slowdown in the
 economic growth rate. Economic conditions could create
 problems for the government, but so far, wise economic
 planning, frank warnings from President Kountche, and
 bountiful harvests have diffused potential discontent.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no reports of the use of torture in Niger.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are no reports of such treatment or punishment in
 Niger under the current regime. Nor is there evidence of
 summary execution. Prisons are over-crowded and facilities
 are generally inadequate, but this may be the result of a
 dearth of resources and trained personnel, rather than
 government policy. Such resources as are available are
 directed to sectors such as agriculture, public health and
 education, rather than prison infrastructure and staff.
 C. Disappearances
 There are no reports of "disappearance" in Niger.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 With the constitution suspended, there is no specific
 statutory protection against arbitrary arrest or imprison-
 ment. Instances of arrest and imprisonment without due
 process do occur. Most have involved either members of the
 previous regime or of the Sawaba Party, which has been banned
 since independence. Amnesty International reported in 1976
 that it had taken up the cases of 18 persons, most from the
 Sawaba group, who were accused of plotting against the govern-
 ment and jailed without trial. As of 1979, 12 remained
 imprisoned. In spite of Diori's release from prison, a half
 dozen members of his administration are still detained, most
 of whom are believed to be among the twelve prisoners reported
 still jailed in 1979. Diori and Djibo Bakary are under house
 arrest in Niamey but free to receive members of their families
 and other callers, including journalists. An estimated 12
 political prisoners were being held in Niger as of October
 1980.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a public trial is observed for civil and criminal
 cases not involving political acts (comprising attempts to
 overthrow the state by force and/or assassinate its leaders,
 as well as participation in conspiracies with these objectives).
 Legal counsel is provided for indigent defendants accused of
 felonies or other major offenses if they are under 18 years
 of age, handicapped or faced with a possible sentence of 10
 years or more. There is no evidence that courts are subject
 to political influence or pressure in ordinary criminal and
 civil cases. Cases involving political acts, such as those
 of the plotters executed in connection with a March 1976
 attempted coup, are handled by specially designated military
 courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home is respected but not guaranteed
 by law, given the suspension of the constitution.

 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Economic development is the first priority of the Niger
 government. Average growth in per capita income has been
 nine percent in recent years. Government expenditures per
 capita rose from $13 to $70 annually over the period 1974-
 1980. Almost all uranium income and foreign assistance
 is devoted to financing projects identified in the National
 Development Plan. The emphasis is on projects in health,
 agriculture and rural infrastructre. Defense spending
 declined from 63 percent of government expenditures in
 1978 to the current five percent.
 Despite these efforts, living standards in Niger remain
 very low. Annual per capita income was estimated at $267
 in 1978 (the last year for which data was available), and
 education, health care and shelter are all at low levels.
 The factors principally responsible are Niger's meager
 resource base and the critical shortage of trained person-
 nel, e.g., the adult literacy rate is less than 10 percent.
 The government is committed to the economic rights outlined
 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but because of
 Niger's extreme povery is not yet able to provide them to
 the Nigerian people.
 At present only 20 percent of school age children are receiv-
 ing some education, but this is at least twice as many as 10
 years ago. During the 1979-1983 Five-Year Plan, the Ministry
 of Education will receive 13 percent of the public sector
 spending. Niger's rural health program currently reaches
 less than a third of the population. The-average life
 expectancy is 39 years, and the infant mortality rate is
 over 16 percent in the first year. For this reason, the
 Ministry of Public Health budget will receive five percent
 of total public spending during the Five-Year Plan. There
 is substantial seasonal unemployment, which is an inevitable
 consequence of limited local agricultural possibilities and
 of the country's very modest industrial base.
 The Niger government is attempting to spread the benefits
 of development as broadly as possible. As previously noted,
 the emphasis is on investment in the rural sector, where
 most Nigeriens live. Special programs including livestock
 improvement, range management, well drilling, veterinary
 posts, special schools and mobile health teams have been
 designed to reach the country's nomadic groups. The public
 health'and veterinary programs for nomads are considered
 to be among the best in the Sahel. One of the regime's
 first steps once uranium revenues began to flow in was to
 abolish the head tax and tax on livestock, which were the
 only direct taxes paid by the country's poorest classes.
 Access to educational opportunities is by competitive
 examination. Salaries of government officials are modest.
 Instances of corruption have been rare, and when discovered,
 are followed by stiff punishment of those involved. There
 is little private ownership of land in rural areas, as most
 is held communally. However, farmers enjoy secure usufruct
 rights. Wages and working conditions in the cities are
 regulated by the government in an effort to eliminate
 
 
 191
 exploitation. The government also attempts to control
 the prices of basic commodities to ensure that they remain
 within the reach of the urban poor majority.
 Although the trend is an improving one, women do not enjoy
 equal rights or opportunities in Niger. The persistence of
 traditional attitudes gives boys a better chance to be
 educated. The property rights of women are circumscribed,
 and in the event of divorce, custody of all but children
 under eight years of age is given to the husband. The
 government is making an effort to improve the social and
 economic position of women. Some have been promoted to
 management positions within the administration. The govern-
 ment has fostered the establishment of the Association of
 Nigerien Women, which this year initiated the publication of
 a quarterly magazine. The government also has announced that
 an office of women's affairs will be created in the Ministry
 of Youth, Sports, and Culture. Issues of special concern to
 women, e.g., the practice of polygamy, are debated in the
 government-controlled media.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are restricted in Niger. Dissent is rarely
 voiced, largely because the institutions which might make its
 articulation possible do not exist, e.g., a legislature or
 private media.. There are no evident opposition groups either
 inside or outside Niger. Some forms of voluntary association
 and expression, such as trade unions, churches, and other
 religious groups function freely, on the understanding they
 will remain nonpolitical or support government policy.
 Although the population is over 90 percent Muslim, Christian
 churches operate. Members of the Catholic community received
 government travel assistance so they could participate in the
 Pope's visit to Ouagadougou. Several Christians hold high
 government offices. The right to strike exists and is fully
 exercised without government supervision or permission. The
 news media are government-controlled. On one recent occasion
 a journalist was imprisoned for a few days when he wrote an
 article critical of the government. There is no censorship
 of the foreign press or books. Government approval is
 required for all research proposals by foreign scholars.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration amd Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Niger. Nigeriens
 wishing to travel abroad or emigrate must obtain exit visas,
 which are granted routinely. During 1980 several hundred
 refugees from the Chadian conflict entered eastern Niger.
 They were assisted to resettle but encouraged to remain in
 areas near the border in the hope they will return to Chad
 when conditions there permit. There are no restrictions on
 repatriation of Nigerien nationals.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process is limited by
 the nature of the political system. Niger is governed by the
 Supreme Military Council (SMC), which is composed of the army
 
 
 192
 officers who organized the 1974 coup. Most of the members
 also serve as ministers or prefets (governors) of Niger's
 seven departments. The other members of the 20-man cabinet
 are civilian technocrats, including most of those directly
 concerned with development
 Government leaders maintain contact with the population through
 regular personal visits. The President spends approximately
 20 percent of his time traveling around Niger investigating
 local conditions. Cabinet members, prefets and sous-prefets
 are even more peripatetic. Nigeriens also have an opportunity
 to communicate with government leaders through the hierarchy
 of traditional chiefs, which reaches into every village and
 is in regular contact with the administration. The Niger
 government plans to establish a political structure to be
 known as the National Development Society. The National
 Commission appointed to draft the constitution for this
 institution has a two-year mandate which expires at the end
 of 1981. Its members are drawn from all social, economic and
 ethnic groups. Subordinate commissions have been created at
 the departmental level in an effort to elicit grass roots
 opinions. In August President Kountche announced that these
 regional bodies also will serve as local assemblies advising
 the prefets. It is too early to assess their impact, or to
 predict the form the National Development Society will
 take.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 There have been no requests for outside investigations of
 human rights in Niger. Amnesty International has in the past
 stated that officials of the government have answered their
 inquiries about human rights and that these replies have been
 prompt and forthcoming. There are no domestic organizations
 which focus on human rights issues. Niger has not been an
 active participant in international and regional human rights
 bodies.
