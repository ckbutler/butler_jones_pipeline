 INDONESIA
 Despite a surface adherence to democratic forms, the Indonesian political system
 remains strongly authoritarian. The Government is dominated by an elite compris-
 ingPres ident Soehart (now in his sixth 5-year term), his close associates, andthe
  .The Government requires allegiance to a state ideology known as
 "Pancasila," which stresses consultation andconsensus, but is also used to limit dis-
 sent, to enforce social and political cohesion, and to restrict the development of oppo-
 sition elements. The judiciary is subordinated to the executive and the military.
 The primary mission of the 450,000-member armed forces, which includes 175,000
 police, is maintenanc of internal unity and stability. Military spending is approxi-
 mately 1.4 percent of the gross national product. Despite a decrease in the number
 of active or retired military officers in key government positions, the military re-
 tained substantial nonmilitary powers under a 'dual fuinction" concept that accords
 it a political and social role in "developing the nation." There continued to be nu-
 merous, credible reports of human rights abuss by the military and the police.
 Indonesia has a vigorous and rapidly growing economy. The benefits of economic
 development are widely dispersed, but pervasive corruption remains a problem.
 Pressures for change and sporadic unrest led to stronger demands that the Govern-
 mment act more effectively to address social and economic inequities. In rural areas,
 disontent often focused on the grievances of small land owners-especially those
 forced off their land by powerful economic and military interests. In some regions,
 exploitation of natural rsources has entailed environmental degradation with ad-
 verse social consequences.
 The Government continued to commit serious human rights abuses. Rising pres-
 sures for change, including those by political activists and opponents, triggered
 tough government actions that further infringed on fundamental rights. The au-
 thorities maintained their tight grip on the political process, which denies citizens
 the ability to change their government democratically. In other areas, such as in-
 creased police and army accountability for abuses, the decline in extra-legal execu-
 tions, access to prisoners, the variety of information sources, and tolerance of public
 criticism, there were encouraging signs along with substantial grounds for continu-
 .ing concern. Reports of extrajudicial killings-including killings of unarmed civil-
 ans, disappearances, and torture and mistreatment of detainees by security forces
 continued. In practice, legal protections against torture are inadequate, and security
 forces continued to torture and mistreat detainees, particularly in regions such as
 Irian Jaya and East Timor. There were persistent reports that some of the detainees
 seized by the Government during unrest in Jakarta sparked by the government-
 backed seizure of an opposition party headquarters on July 27 and during the sub-
 sequent crackdown on political opponents were subjected to mistreatment. Reports
 of arbitrary arrests and detentions and the use of excessive violence (including dead-
 
 
 659
 ly force) continued. Prison conditions remained harsh, and security forces regularly
 violated citizens' right to privacy.
 The Government continued to impose severe limitations on freedom of assembly
 and association. In anticipation of the 1997 parliamentary elections, the Govern-
 ment took a number of actions to intimidate political opponents. Notably, the Gov-
 ernment crudely engineered the removal of a popular opposition party leader and
 the forcible takeover of the party headquarters. The headquarters-takeover and the
 subsequent rioting in Jakarta, the worst in decades, resulted in at least 5 dead, over
 20 nissing, scores of injuries, and over 200 arrests. Some witnesses testified in
 court that one person was killed during the takeover of the party headquarters. The
 Government, invoking limited use of the controversial Antisubversion Law, re-
 sponded with a wave of arrests, interrogations, and expanded surveillance aimed at
 reining in nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) and political activists. The Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross ICRC) and the National Human Rights Com-
 mission were able to visit many of those detained or hospitalized after the takeover
 and riot, although access has been sporadic.
 An independent election monitoring committee, formed by private organizations,
 prompted a mixed government response. Its head was calledin for questioning dur-
 ing the Government's crackdown on political opponents and NGO's after the July
 27 incident. On the other hand, the Indonesian National Human Rights Commis-
 sion, despite limited resources, and occasional government pressure and intimida-
 tion, vigorously undertook investigations and publicized its independent findings
 and recommendations. In some but not all cases, the Government acted on these
 findings.
 The judiciary is still subservient to the executive branch and subject to wide-
 spread corruption. A justice's criticism of judicial corruption focused increased atten-
 tion on the need to reform the judicial system. In a controversial and much criti-
 cized action, the Supreme Court reimposed a prison sentence on Indonesia's most
 prominent independent labor leader, Muchtar Pakpahan, reversing its own 1995 de-
 cision to overturn the conviction. Reversing lower court decisions, the Supreme
 Court also upheld the legality of the Government's closure of three magazines in
 1994.
 The Government continued to exercise indirect control over and intimidation of
 the press. Criticism of the Government was tolerated, but critics of the President,
 senior officials, or powerful local interests risked harassment, arrest, or intimida-
 tion. Despite these problems and government pressure on the media in the wake
 of the July 27 events, observers considered the print media more open and out-
 spoken than in recent years. The Government continued to impose some restrictions
 on freedom of religion and movement. Discrimination against women and the dis-
 abled and violence against women are endemic problems.
 Security forces displayed improved discipline in responding to several incidents of
 unrest in Irian Jaya, where newl issuedhuman rights guidelines were in effect,
 but brutality in handling unruly demonstrations in Pontianak and Ujung Pandang
 resulted in civilian deaths. In the July rioting in Jakarta, the police beat demonstra-
 tors and onlookers. Higher authorities punished increased numbers of police and
 military personnel, including officers, for infractions of the law or indiscipline. Pun-
 ishment,however, usually failed to match the severity of the abuse.
 The Government maintained its opposition to alternatives to the government-
 sponsored labor movement and to the development of a free trade union movement.
 Members of the principal unauthorized labor organization cited continued instances
 of harassment. Government pressure on this organization-widely viewed as an at-
 tempt to discredit or destroy it-has increased since the July 27 violence in Jakarta.
 In a move that has elicited considerable domestic and foreign criticism, the Govern-
 ment detained and brought subversion charges against the leader of this organiza-
 tion (the same man against whom the Supreme Court had reinstated a conviction
 it had earlier overturned) for alleged political activities. Abuses, including the use
 of child labor, mistreatment of labor, and inadequate remuneration continued. On
 the positive side, the Government raised the minimum wage again and, for the first
 time, allowed unions to collect and distribute their own dues.
 In East Timor, still troubled by a low-level insurgency and a disaffected indige-
 nous population that generally resents Indonesian rule and has inadequate oppor-
 tunity to determine its own affairs, there were further instances of killings, dis-
 appearances, torture, and excessive use of force by the military and insurgents. Re-
 spected observers noted a decrease in serious incidents, but 1996 Nobel Peace Prize
 co-laureate Bishop Belo said that it would be a mistake to conclude that the human
 rights environment in East Timor was improving. No progress was made in account-
 ing for the missing persons following the 1991 Dili incident or the others who dis-
 appeared in 1995-96. Troop levels remained unjustifiably high. The Government
 
 
 660
 
 granted limited access to the aea to foreign journalists but banned travel by all for-
 eign human rights NGO's except the ICRO. In several cases, the Indonesian military
 punished abuses by its personnel. The National Human Rights Commission in a
 small, symboically important step--whose practical effect remains to be seen-
 opened a branch offie in Dii. Young disgruntled East Tiinorese mounted repeated
 intrusions into embassies in Jakarta seeking asylum and publicity for their cause.
 In Iian Jays, tribal resentment against government and private companies' poli-
 cies viewed as heavyhanded and arbitrary remained. Real and perceived discrimina-
 tion against native Irian people led to several outbreaks of violence and a strength-
 ened military presence in Timika. Guerrilla terrorists seeking separation or auton-
 omy for Irian Jaya took hostages in four incidents and murdered several of their
 captives.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings.-Historically, politically related
 extrajudicial killings have occurred most frequently in areas where separatist move-
 ments were active, such as East Timor, Aceh, and Irian Jaya. Security forces contin-
 ued to employ harsh measures against separatist movements in East Timor and
 Irian Jaya. Although the Government claims that the "Aceh Merdeka" movement
 has been eliminated, Aceh is still officially listed as one of Indonesia's three "trouble
 spots" (along with East Timor and Irian Jaya), and the Government has issued pub-
 lic calls for the "rebels" to come home to their families. There are credible reports
 that the Aceh Merdeka movement still exists, but its activities are now under-
 ground. Security forces in East Timor killed two unarmed civilians in April in sepa-
 rate unrelated incidents. On April 25, near Baucau an unarmed East Timorese civil-
 ian allegedly attempted to escape questioning by security personnel and was killed
 when one of them fired what was described as a warning shot. A military officer
 was convicted of accidentally killing the victim. On April 28, in Dili a member of
 the security forces fired on and killed an unarmed civilian during an altercation
 caused because the victim was allegedly burning an Indonesian flag. In early Au-
 gust, a student was killed after quarreling with soldiers and them seeking to escape
 arrest.
 Four soldiers received 1- to 3-year prison terms in February as a result of the kill-
 fig of three civilians in Irian Jaya in the spring of 1995. These convictions resulted
 from reports by the National Human Rights Commission, the Catholic Church, and
 NGO's about the killings of 16 or more civilians in Irian Jaya between mid-1994
 and mid-1995. However, these convictions resulted from one case only, and the mili-
 tourt addressed only charges of murder and did not address charges of rape
 of indigenous women. Five other cases of alleged human rights violations in Irian
 Jaya, cited in a September 1995 report by the National Human Rights Commission,
 have languished. Moreover, in the one prosecuted Irian Jaya case, many court docu-
 ments were declared to be "state documents," precluding their release to the public.
 The killing of unarmed civilians by security forces was not limited to the areas
 with active separatist movements. Military personnel abducted and allegedly tor-
 tured an unarmed civilian in West Kalimantan in April following a minor traffic ac-
 cident. One civilian was killed and at least four were injured when military person-
 nel fired upon unarmed civilians who attacked the local military headquarters in
 protest. Six military personnel were tried and convicted and received sentences
 rangng from 3 to 11 months for involvement in this incident. Six others, who had
 originally been named by the military authorities as suspects in the case, were pun-
 ished for disciplinary infractions but not tried.
 At least three civilian deaths occurred when security personnel in Ujung Pandang
 responded to student demonstrations in April. The Government acknowledged that
 three deaths occurred, claiming that the students drowned in a river while fleeing
 security forces. However, photos of the three bodies of the dead students showed
 bruises and what may have been knife wounds. The investigation by the National
 Human Rights Commission confirmed the number of deaths but identified excesses
 by the troops. Some student groups asserted at the time that the number killed was
 higher. Twelve soldiers were subsequently charged in the case. Six low-ranking offi-
 cers were tried and convicted in October receiving sentences of 90 to 105 days.
 The Government assisted the forcible takeover of the Indonesian Democratic Par-
 's (PDI) headquarters on July 27, and the harsh treatment of demonstrators later
 in the day by security forces, sparked Jakarta's most serious rioting in years. The
 Government acknowledged that four deaths occurred. A report released on October
 12 by the National Human Rights Commission-which cited government interven-
 tion as a factor in the violence-put the casualties at 5 dead, 149 injured, and 23
 
 
 661
 missing. No members of the military or police have been held accountable by the
 Government in connection with this violence, which included police caning of indi-
 viduals in a crowd who fell during a police charge. PDI witnesses testified in court
 that one person was killed during the government-backed assault against the party
 headquarters.
 The police employed excessive and sometimes deadly force in apprehending sus-
 pects or coping with alleged criminals. In response to prtests  at the methods
 used were unjustifiably harsh and amounted to execution without trial, poice gen-
 erally claimed that the suspects were fleeing, resisting arrest, or threatening the po-
 lice. Accurate statistics about the number of such cases are not available. In Decem-
 ber police in Jakarta shot and killed a robbery suspect who they said was trying
 to escape from custody, and in November they did the same to a crime suspect in
 West Java. Also in November, a human rights organization charged that security
 forces, during a crackdown on street vendors, beat and kicked vendors, and that one
 of the vendors fell into a river and drowned while he was fleeing.
 In the past higher authorities rarely punished the military or police for using ex-
 cessive force. There were some indications that this situation was improving, al-
 though the action taken by the authorities is usually not commensurate with the
 gravity of the security force abuses.
 h-ian Jaya rebels, including some from the Free Papua Organization (OPM), ab-
 ducted civilian hostages on four occasions in Irian Jaya. In two of these incidents
 hostages were killed by their abductors. A rescue attempt by Indonesian special
 forces May 15, succeeded in freeing nine hostages, but two others died of slash
 wounds inflicted by their abductors. Government troops killed eight of the abductors
 in a fight that also involved armed local villagers who supported the rebels. Earlier
 in this hostage taking, government forces sought to bring an end to the incident
 through ICRC mediatfon, which eventually failed due to bad faith on the part of the
 abductor leader, Kelly Kwalik. On September 18, Armed Forces of the Republic of
 Indonesia (ABRI) elements in pursuit of Irian Jaya rebels, who had taken 14 logging
 company employees hostage August 14, reported that two of the hostages had een
 found murdered. Government reports claimed the two had been tortured before they
 were killed by their abductors, though a knowledgeable source later shed doubt on
 this claim. The armed forces conducted operations to hunt down the OPM guerrillas.
 On at least two occasions OPM and government forces exchanged fire with reports
 of casualties. Access to the general area was restricted by the Government to pre-
 vent additional hostage-taking. There were unconfirmed claims from government
 critics that military campaigns to capture the hostage takers had resulted in civilian
 losses.
 ABRI reportedly suffered casualties in East Timor during a clash with guerrillas
 in August. In ensuing military operations, five East Timorese reportedly were ar-
 rested. ABRI does not release its casualty statistics, but reliable reports indicate sol-
 diers have been killed throughout the year. Guerrillas carried out attacks against
 immigrants and prgovernment Timorese, and suspected informers that resulted in
 several deaths according to government and Indonesian press sources.
 On December 24, in Dll an out-of-uniform police officer was beaten to death by
 a crowd when he was discovered to be carrying a pistol and a hand radio. Several
 other policemen including the Dili chief of police were injured, some seriously.
 b. Disappearance.-Following the July 27 violence and its aftermath, the National
 Human Rights Commission on October 12 released a report that listed 23 missing,
 149 injured, and 5 dead, one of whom had been shot. The Commission's attention
 to the number of missing reflected persistent reports from human rights groups that
 people remain unaccounted for following the July 27 violence. In contrast, the Gov-
 ernment did not acknowledge that any people were missing. Security forces in Indo-
 nesia sometimes held suspects incommunicado before acknowledging their deten-
 tion. In certain cases, including after the July 27 violence, suspects were held for
 substantial periods of time before formal charges were brought; in some cases
 charges were not brought, and they were simply released. A respected international
 human rights NGO reported to the United Nations the disappearance of a Timorese
 man from Same, on or around May 13.
 There were no new efforts by the Government to account for the missing and dead
 from the November 12, 1991 military shooting of civilians in Dli, East Timor. Of
 those still listed as missing in a report that the military gave to Human Rights
 Watch/Asia, no additional cases were resolved during the year. Knowledgeable ob-
 servers continued to believe that most of the missing are dead and that members
 of the armed forces know where their bodies are located.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Criminal Code makes it a crime punishable by up to 4 years in prison for any
 official to use violence or force to elicit a confession. It establishes pretrial proce-
 
 
 662
 dures to give suspects or their families the right to challenge the legality of an ar-
 rest or detention. In practice, however, legal protections are both inadequate and
 widely ignored, and security forces continued to employ torture and other forms of
 mistreatment, particularly in regions where there were active security concerns,
 such as Irian Jaya and East Timor. Police often resort to physical abuse, even in
 minor incidents.
 In East Timor, military units regularly detain civilians for interrogation; often
 these civilians are mistreated for several days and then released. According to credi-
 ble reports, in January security forces seized nine East Timorese from their homes
 in the Zumlai "Kecamatan" because they were suspected of cooperating with guer-
 rilla forces. One of the detainees alleged that they had been beaten and mistreated,
 including being placed in a small underground hole. There were other reports that
 military and police units make frequent use of random torture against young men
 to maintain order in urban areas of East Timor. Credible sources reported that on
 November 27, following the stoning of police hut in Baucau, police entered a high
 school student dormitory and arbitrarily detained and severely beat two students.
 In Irian Jaya, after an investigation, reliable sources concluded that all 130 per-
 sons detained during the March 18-20 demonstrations and rioting in Jayapura were
 mistreated and that some were tortured.
 The Government continued to maintain an excessive military presence in East
 Timor. Taking advantage of high unemployment among young men ABRI recruited
 local East Timorese to constitute an East Timorese force subordinate to ABRI. Some
 East Timorese sources charged this force with human rights abuses as well. The
 Government, as it does elsewhere, also relied on bands of youths, organized and di-
 rected by the Government, to intimidate and harass its opponents in East Timor.
 There were persistent assertions that some of the prisoners and detainees seized
 on July 27 and during the subsequent crackdown were subjected to mistreatment.
 This included both prisoners who were awaiting trial and detainees who were ques-
 tioned and then released. Examples of the alleged mistreatment included kicking,
 beating, and electric shocks, notably while in the custody of military intelligence or
 the poie. The ICRC and National    omission on Human Rights were unable to
 confirm these allegations. One case of alleged mistreatment involved five students
 who were said to have been beaten in Yogyakarta while in police detention in early
 August. Another case involved a raid on the headquarters of an Indonesian NGO.
 One of the staff members, the relative of a member of a small unauthoiized political
 party that the authorities consider subversive (the People's Democratic Party or
 Rt), was detained and subjected to beatings and electric shocks. Regarding the ar-
 rests of PRD members following July 27, Human Rights Watch/Asia stated that "a
 clear pattern has emerged where students are taken first to military intelligence for
 interrogation and often subjected to severe physical abuse, including electric shocks,
 for a period that can last up to a week." Lawyers for three of the PRD defendants
 publicly charged in October to the Human Rights Commission that their clients had
 been tortured.
 In West Java, Tjetje Tadjudin died while in police custody in October. Initially
 the police claimed that his death was caused by respiratory problems. However, his
 examination at the hospital showed that injuries had been inflicted upon him, indi-
 cating that he had been tortured. The national police chief held the detective who
 had conducted the interrogation responsible and relieved him from duty. The police
 chief has promised to investigate the case thoroughly and take disciplinary action.
 Before Tjetje died, he had been "lent" to the military police for questioning because
 there were allegations that military personnel were involved in the initial crime.
 However, high level military officials insisted that the military had no role in his
 death.
 A foreign human rights group reported that in January security forces detained
 14 people in East Kalimantan. Several of the detainees were representing their vil-
 lage, Menemang in Kutai Regency, in a longstanding dispute with a company that
 had been clear-cutting land of disputed ownership in the area of the village. Accord-
 ing to this report, the 14 were severely mistreated by the security forces, including
 being stripped, repeatedly beaten, kicked and pistol whipped, and some were burned
 with cigarettes.
 In December in Cibentang, West Java, security forces reportedly clashed with vil-
 lagers on two occasions. The villagers were resisting the installation of electric ca-
 bles by a state-run company, which involved the expropriation of their land, because
 they believed they had been inadequately compensated. During one of the clashes,
 which reportedly occurred on December 26, the villagers claim that 200 security
 force personnel were involved, and five villagers alleged that they had been mis-
 treated. The security forces claim that only 30 personnel were involved.
 
 
 663
 Prison conditions are harsh with violence among prisoners and mistreatment and
 extortion of inmates by guards common. In Novemer a thirteen-year-old boy died
 of respiratory problems while serving a murder sentence. His lawyer publicly
 charged that the boy died because of poor conditions in the detention center, and
 this claim was supported publicly by some of the defendants in the July 27 violence
 case who were detained in that facility as well. The incidence of mistreatment by
 prison officials dropped sharply once a prisoner had been transferred from police or
 military intelligence (BIA) custody into the civilian prison system or into the custody
 of the Attorney General. Officials publicly condemned police brutality and harsh
 prison conditions and occasionally took disciplinary action, including transfer, dis-
 missal, and trials leading to prison. Political prisoners were usually mixed with the
 general prison population, although in the Cipinang prison in Jakarta high-profile
 political prisoners were segregated
 The Government allowed the ICRC access on one occasion to those detained on
 antisubversion charges by the Attorney General following the July 27 violence. Au-
 thorities denied a visiting foreign official access to imprisoned East Timorese guer-
 rilla leader Xanana Gusmao in Jakarta, although he was permitted to visit East
 Timor. In September the Attorney General's office invited a senior-level foreign gov-
 ernment delegation to visit two individuals detained in connection with the July 27
 violence.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Criminal Procedures Code contains
 provisions against arbitrary arrest and detention, but it lacks adequate enforcement
 mechanisms and is routinely violated. The code specifies that prisoners have the
 right to notify their families and that warrants must be produced during an arrest
 except under specified conditions, such as when a suspect is caught in the act of
 committing a crime. The law also requires that families of detainees be notified
 promptly. The law authorizes investigators to issue warrants to assist in their inves-
 tigations or if sufficient evidence e   that a crime has been committed. However,
 authorities sometimes made arrests without warrants.
 The law presumes defendants innocent and permits bail. They or their families
 may also challenge the legality of their arrest and detention in a pretrial hearing
 and may sue for compensation if wrongfully detained. However, it is virtually impos-
 sible for detainees to invoke this prcedure, or to receive compensation, after being
 released without charge. In both military and civilian courts, appeals based on
 claims of improper arrest and detention are rarely, if ever, acpted. The Criminal
 Procedures Code also contains specific limits on periods of pretrial detention and
 specifies when the courts must get involved to approve extensions, usually after 60
 days. In addition, suspects charged under the 1963 Antisubversion Law are subject
 to special procedures outside the code. These give the Attorney General the author-
 ity to hold a suspect upto 1 year before trial,  may renew this 1-year period with-
 out limit. In the case of individuals held by the Attorney General's Office in connec-
 tion with the July 27 violence in Jakarta, the Attorney General's Office waived au-
 thority under the Antisubversion Law to hold suspects indefinitely, and sought judi-
 cial approval of continued detention as provided for under criminal law.
 The authorities routinely approve extensions of periods of detention. In areas
 where active guerrilla movements exist, such as East Timor and Irian Jaya, there
 are instances of people being detained without warrants, charges, or court proceed-
 ings. This was also the case following the July 27 violence in Jakarta. Bail is rarely
 granted, especially in political cases. The authorities frequently prevent access to
 defense counsel while suspects are being investigated and make it difficult or impos-
 sible for detainees to get legal assistance from voluntary legal defense organizations.
 Special laws on corruption, economic crimes, and narcotics do not come under the
 code's protections.
 The Agency for Coordination of Assistance for the Consolidation of National Secu-
 rity (BAKORSTANAS) operates outside the legal code and has wide discretion to de-
 tain and interrogate persons thought to threaten national security. Despite the ex-
 istence of this agency, ABRI began discussing publicly in September the need for
 a new internal security act to give the Government greater power to suppress dis-
 sent prior to the 1997 parliamentary elections. There is no reliable data on which
 to quantify the number of arbitrary arrests or detentions without trial, particularly
 in East Timor and Irian Jaya.
 In the period March 10-13, Irianese with grievances against the Government and
 the policies and practices of a foreign mining corpany rioted in the Timika-
 Tem bagapura area. There was also rioting inasuburb of Jayapura March 18-19.
 Fatalities were reported in both instances though not, apparently, at the hands of
 security forces. Approximately 7 persons were detained in the wake of the Timika-
 Tembagapura rioting while over 100 reportedly were detained in the wake of the
 Jayapura rioting.
 
 
 664
 
 According to credible reports, numerous individuals were seized from their homes
 in Dili and arbitrarily detained in February. There were similar reports of persons
 being arbitrarily detained in Baucau in November, and in Viqueque in December.
 According to a report from a foreign human rights group, four Irianese were de-
 tained in March due to a peaceful prtest they carried out in Jakarta. Without being
 informed of the charges, they were held incommunicado for over a week and then
 released. Documents confiscated from one of these individuals were not returned.
 According to the Government, 206 people were arrested on the weekend of July
 27 in connection with the violent, government-assisted takeover of PDI head-
 quarters and the ensuing disturbances. Scores of persons were detained by the Gov-
 ernment on July 27 for refusing to shut down a "free speech forum" organized by
 supporters of ousted PDI leader Megawati Sukarnoputri and for continuing to oc-
 cupy the PDI headquarters. Plain clothes police clandestinely tape recorded speech-
 es given at the forum that were generally critical of the Government. On November
 27 the central Jakarta district court ordered the release of 124 of that group who
 had been charged with assault and resisting orders. Judges acquitted 9 of the ac-
 cused and sentenced the other 115 to time already served. Assault charges were
 dropped. Many of those convicted plan to appeal. In addition, the leader of an
 unsanctioned labor union, Muchtar Pakpahan, and 12 members of the People's
 Democratic Party (PRD), including its leader Budiman Sudjatmniko, had been ar-
 rested. The trials of nine of the P  memers for subversion began in Jakarta in
 December, as did the trial of Pakpahan who was also charged with subversion. Out-
 side of Jakarta there were numeros arrests and detentions, some temporay, of
 those suspected of having a connection to the PRD or responsibility for the July 27
 riots. For example, five students were detained in Yogakarta in early August. At
 least two PRD members were detained in Semarang in September, andheld incom-
 municado for at least 2 weeks. In a raid conducted against a Jakarta NGO, detain-
 ing forces failed to provide identification or misidentifled themselves. In response to
 instances of illegal military detention of suspects, the National Human Rights Com-
 mission issued a public caution that only police were empowered to carry out ar-
 rests.
 In February, 15 women reportedly protested the 5-month detention of their hus-
 bands and sons to the local Lmpung legislature. They claimed that their famil y
 members had not received due process, that one of the detainees had been killed
 in pfrisen, and that another had been severely injured.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution stipulates the independence of
 the judiciary, but in practice the judiciary is subordinated to the executive and the
 military. In many cases procedural protections, including those against coerced con-
 fessions, particularly those coerced by the police and military intelligence (BIA), are
 inadequate to ensure a fair trial. Several court challenges to the Government's
 transparent manipulation of the PDI leadership structurehave  hen dsmissed, re-
 suits that were widely expected given the judiciary's subservience to the executive
 and military on kem y issues.
 A quadripartite judiciary of general, religious, military, and administrative courts
 exists below the Supreme Court. The right of appeal from district court to high court
 to Supreme Court exists in all four systems of justice. The Supreme Court does not
 consider factual aspects of a case, only the lower courts' application of law. The Su-
 preme Court theoretically stands   coequal with the executive and legislative
 branches, but it does not have the right of judicial .review over laws passed by Par-
 liament. The Supreme Court has not yet exercised its authority (held since 1985)
 to review ministerial decrees and regulations. In 1993 Chief Justice Purwoto
 Gandasubrata laid out procedures for limited judicial review. Judges are civil serv-
 ants employed by the executive branch, which controls their assignments, pay, and
 promotion. They are subject to considerable pressure from military and other gov-
 ernmental authorities that often determines the outcome of a case. The Supreme
 Courts's unprecedented reversal of its own 1995 decision freeing labor leader
 Muchtar Pakpahan from prison throws its lack of independence into sharp relief.
 Corruption is a common feature of the legal system and the payment of bribes can
 influence prosecution, conviction, and sentencing in civil and criminal cases. A Su-
 preme Court justice who alleged widespread corruption and collusion within the
 court system was the subject of efforts by the Chief Justice to secure his dismissal
 from the court. The Government did not act on this recommendation.
 A panel of judges conducts trials at the district court level, poses questions, hears
 evidence, decides guilt or innocence, and assesses punishment. Initial judgments are
 rarely reversed in the appeals process, although sentences can be increased or re-
 duced. Both the defense and the prosecution may appeal.
 
 
 Defendants have the right to confront witnesses and to produce witnesses in their
 * defense. An exception is allowed in cases in which distance or expense is deemed
 excessive for transporting witnesses to court. In such cases, sworn affidavits may
 be introduced. However, the Criminal Procedures Code does not provide for wit-
 nesses' immunity or for defense power of subpoena. As a result, witnesses are some-
 times too afraid of retribution to testify against the authorities. The courts com-
 monly allow forced confessions and limit the presentation of defense evidence. De-
 fendants do not have the right to remain silent and can be compelled to testify
 against themselves. The Criminal Procedures Code gives defendants the right to an
 attorney from the moment of their arrest, but not during the prearrest investigation
 period, which may involve prolonged detention. Persons summoned to appear as wit-
 nesses in investigations do not have the right to be assisted by lawyers even though
 information developed in the course of rendering testimony can subsequently be-
 come the basis of an investigation of the witness. The law requires that a lawyer
 be appointed in capital cases and those involving a prison sentence of 15 years or
 more. In cases involving potential sentences of 5 years or more, a lawyer must be
 appointed if the defendant desires an attorney and is indigent. In theory, destitute
 defendants may obtain private legal help, such as that provided by the Legal Aid
 Institute (LBH). In practice, however, defendants are often persuaded not to hire
 an attorney, or access to an attorney of their choice is impede d.
 Signs of nascent judicial independence were less evident in 1996. In June the Su-
 preme Court overturned rulings by the lower courts and maintained the ban on the
 periodical Tempo and two other publications. In 1995 an administrative court in Ja-
 karta had found in favor of the plaintiffs, employees of Tempo, in their civil suit
 against the Minister of Information for revoking Tempo's publication license in
 1993. The High Court unanimously upheld this decision in November 1995, stating
 that the ministerial regulations permitting publications to be banned were in con-
 flict with press freedoms contained in the Constitution. The Government appealed
 the High Court ruling to the Supreme Court, which found in favor of the Govern-
 ment. In November the Supreme Court revealed that it had reversed its earlier deci-
 sion to overturn the 1994 verdict against independent labor leader Muchtar
 Pakpahan. This reversal prompted broad criticism by legal scholars and by one
 highly regarded Supreme Court justice who had chaired the panel which overturned
 the 1994 decision.
 The Antisubversion Law, which carries a maximum penalty of death (which has
 never been invoked in recent years), makes it a crime to engage in acts that could
 distort, undermine, or deviate from the state ideology or broad outlines of state pol-
 icy, or which could disseminate feelings of hostility or arouse hostility disturbances,
 or anxiety among the population. The excessively vague language of this law makes
 it possible to prosecute people merely for peaceful expression of views contrary to
 those of the Government. independent labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan and PRD
 members were charged with subversion in trials that opened in December.
 Various sources estimate that several hundred people are serving sentences for
 subversion, including members of the banned Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI),
 Muslim militants, and those convicted of subversion in Irian Jaya, Aceh, and East
 Timor. Following the July 27 violence, the Government in December charged 10 in-
 dividuals under the Antisubversion Law. Scores, and possibly hundreds, more were
 believed to be serving sentences under the Hate-Sowing or Sedition laws. Some of
 these persons advocated or employed violence, but others are political prisoners who
 were convicted for attempting to exercise such universally recognized human rights
 as freedom of speech or association, or who were convicted in manifestly unfair
 trials.
 fL Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Judicial
 warrants for searches are required except for cases involving suspected subversion,
 economic crimes, and corruption. However, security agencies regularly made forced
 or surreptitious entries. A Jakarta NGO was raided by security personnel who
 misidentified themselves as police. The intruders reportedly tortured one staff mem-
 ber and confiscated documents (see Section 1.c.). The NGOhas not been able to re-
 gain the confiscated documents because the intruding officials neither presented a
 warrant nor properly identified themselves. Security forces also engagedin surveil-
 lance of persons and residnces and selective monitoring of local and international
 telephone calls without legal restraint.
 Following the July 27 violence, the authorities charged that a small, unauthor-
 ized, leftist-oriented group, the Democratic People's Party (PRD) had incited the vio-
 lence and was a Communist organization bent on forcibly overthrowing the Govern-
 ment. They launched a nationwide search for PRD members and promised to cap-
 ture the leaders. PRD leader Budiman Sudjatmiko has been detained since earfy
 August. The Government intimidated political activists through a campaign of police
 
 
 666
 questioning. Ousted PDI Chair Megawati Sukarnoputri was questioned several
 tmes as a witness in several cases, and prominent human rights, environmental,
 labor, and democracy activists faced similar treatment. Soerjadi, who replaced
 Megawati as PDI chair, was also questioned. The questioning sessions by the police
 or Attorney General's Office were lengthy, lasting a full day in some cases. Most
 of those questioned were not named as suspects, but the Government stated publicly
 that witnesses could become suspects. Following up on this threat, in late Septem-
 ber, the Government called a PDI legislator in for questioning as a suspect, claiming
 that he had "insulted the President" at the "free speech forum"
 Government security officials monitor the movements and activities of former
 members of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PHI) and its front organizations, es-
 pecially persons the Government believes were involved in the abortive 1965 Com-
 munist-backed coup. These persons and their relatives sometimes are subject to sur-
 veillance, required check-ins, periodic indoctrination, and restrictions on travel out-
 side their city of residence. One of the methods the Government has used to monitor
 the activities of these people has been to require that the initials "E.T." ("Ex-Tapol"
 or political prisoner) be stamped in their identification cards. This allows the gov-
 ernment and prospective employers to identify former Communist Party members,
 and subjects them to official and unofficial discrimination. Although the require-
 ment that E.T. be stamped in identification cards is being phased out, many individ-
 uals still carry such cards.
 In recent years the Government significantly reduced its transmigration program,
 which moves large numbers of people from overpopulated islands to more isolated
 and less developed ones. Human rights monitors say that the program violates the
 rights of indigenous people and dupes some transnigrants into leaving their home
 vilages without any means of return. Transmigrants and migrants outside the Nov-
 ernment transmigration program received indirect government support in the form
 of developmental assistance programs and contracts with ABRI or local government
 officials. This practice, particularly in East Timor and Irian Jaya, led to resentment
 among indigenous populations. The resulting communal tensions led to rioting in
 both locations.
 The Government prohibits the import of Chinese-language publications (see Sec-
 tion 5).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the 1945 Constitution and the 1982
 Press Law provide for freedom of the press, the Government continued to restrict
 press freedom in practice. Following the revocation of the publishing licenses of
 three well-known newsmagazines in 1994, in June the Supreme Court overturned
 lower court rulings and upheld the 1994 ban on Temp magazine.
 The Government uses the issuance of publishing licenses under a 1984 ministerial
 decree to control the press. Other means of control include regulation of the amount
 of advertising permitted and of the number of pages allowed in newspapers. In sen-
 sitive areas, the authorities continued to provide guidance to local journalists and
 editors on what they should print, although there were many cases where such
 guidance was ignored.
 Vigorous debate on a number of sensitive topics, such as corruption, the role of
 the first family in business, and lack of government fiscal accountability, continued,
 particularly in the English-language press. Major Indonesian-language newspapers
 were more cautious in covering controversial subjects.
 While public dialogue is freer than it was a number of years ago the Government
 continues to impose restrictions on free speech. For example, the violent expulsion
 of Meawati Sukarnoputri supporters from the PDI headquarters in Jakarta on July
 27 effectively shut down the "free speech forum" that had been held at the head-
 quarters for several weeks. In May a Jakarta district court supported the Govern-
 ment's position when it convicted former Member of Parliament Sri Bintang
 Pamungkas of insulting President Soeharto during an April 1995 lecture in Berlin.
 He was sentenced to 2 years and 10 months, but has not yet started serving his
 sentence pending appeal.
 Nobel Prize co-laureate Bishop Belo was subjected to intense government pressure
 to retract published remarks critical of some government and military actions in
 East Timor. He eventually did so, after being the target of government-organized
 demonstrations when he travelled to Jakarta and issued a partial repudiation of
 some parts of the article in which he had been quoted. A number of students were
 detained after a November 25 demonstration in Dili, apparently for displaying anti-
 Soeharto banners; all but one were eventually released. A journalist in Yogyakarta
 was attacked in his home by unidentified intruders, possibly in connection with arti-
 cles he had written that were critical of local government officials' actions in land
 
 
 cases. He died several days later as a result of the injuries sustained during the
 attack. The investigation into the case was taken out of the hands of the local police
 several weeks after the incident. The police arrested a suspect in the crime, but the
 Human Rights Commission expressed concerns about the process in which the sus-
 pect was detained and there was widespread public doubt as to whether the right
 person had been apprehended. The suspect was released from custody in December,
 but remains under suspicion.
 In addition, there were several cases of violent attacks on, and intimidation of the
 news media during and after the PDI related disturbances in Jakarta. During a
 June 20 clash between PDI demonstrators and security forces, an employee of a for-
 eign news organization was hit by security personnel, and there were reports that
 other foreign and local news personnel suffered injuries that day as well. During
 the July 27 incident, at least three foreign journalists had minor injuries inflicted
 by the police. At least two local journalists suffered police beatings that required
 hospitalization. Two journalists in Surabaya were reportedly detained during a pro-
 test against the takeover of PDI headquarters. Although they identified themselves
 as journalists, they were beaten while in custody. A group of Western journalists
 was threatened with a drawn pistol by a police officer while witnessing the violent
 breakup of a PDI demonstration by security forces on July 28. On October 28, secu-
 rity forces raided a printing house used to produce the October edition of the Alli-
 ance of Independent Journalists' (AJI) unlicensed magazine Suara Independen.
 They seized 5,000 copies of the magazine and arrested a print shop technician and
 an AJI activist who was picking up the magazine. The two were charged with dis-
 tributing printed material defaming the President, and if convicted could each be
 imprisoned for 6 years.
 The electronic media remained more cautious in their coverage of the Government
 than the print media. The Government operates a nationwide television network
 with 12 regional stations. Private commercial television companies, many with own-
 ership by, or management ties to, the President's family, continued to expand. All
 are required to broadcast government-produced news, but many also produce public
 affairs style programming with news content.
 Over 600 private radio broadcasting companies exist in addition to the Govern-
 ment's national radio network. Theya  were required to belong to the government-
 sponsored Association of Private Radio Stations (PRSSNI) to receive a broadcasting
 license. The government radio station produces the program "National News," which
 is the only news permitted by law to be broadcast in Indonesia. It is relayed
 throughout the country by private stations and 49 regional affiliates of the Govern-
 ment station. By law, the private radio stations may produce only "light" news, such
 as human interest stories, and may not discss politics. In practice, however, many
 broadcast interviews and foreign news as well.
 Foreign television and radio broadcasts were readily accessible. Satellite dishes
 have proliferated throughout the country, and there was access to the Internet. The
 Government made no effort to restrict access to this programming, and has pro-
 claimed an "open skies" policy. Some signals have been scrambled by broadcasters
 for commercial reasons.
 The Government closely regulates access to Indonesia, particularly to certain
 areas of the country, by visiting and resident foreign correspondents. It occasionally
 reminds the latter of its prerogative to deny requests for visa extensions. Numerous
 foreign journalists were still in Jakarta on July 27, following the Association of
 Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meetings the week before, and were able to cover
 the incident for an international audience. The Government requires a permit for
 the importation of foreign publications and video tapes, which must be reviewed by
 government censors. Importers sometimes avoided foreign materials critical of the
 Government or dealing with topics considered sensitive, such as human rights. For-
 eign publications are widely available.
 Publishers sometimes refused to accept manuscripts dealing with controversial is-
 sues. Most books by the prominent Indonesian novelist and former political prisoner
 Pramoedya Ananta Toer are banned. The Attorney General's Office reported pub-
 licly that two publications were banned in 1996.
 Special permission is necessary for foreign journalists to travel to East Timor,
 Aceh, and Irian Jaya. With a few exceptions (including permission for journalists
 to accompany a diplomatic delegation in April, to cover President Soeharto's visit
 in October, and to attend a press conference by Bishop Belo in November) press ac-
 cess to East Timor was restricted. A number ofjournalists repeatedly requested per-
 mission to go to East Timor without success.
 While the law provides for academic freedom, constraints exist on the activities
 of scholars. Political activity and discussions at universities, while no longer for-
 mally banned, remained constrained. Some scholars displayed caution in producing
 
 
 668
 or including in lectures and class discussions materials that might provoke govern-
 ment displeasure.
 b. Freedom of Peacefd Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association; however, the Government places significant
 controls on the exercise of these rights. Until 1995 public meetings of five or more
 persons, as well as academic or other seminars and marches and demonstrations,
 required permits from the police and several government agencies. While obtaining
 such approval was usually routine, the authorities occasionally arbitrarily and in-
 consistently withheld permission or broke up peaceful gatherings for which no per-
 mit had been obtinedL The Government promulgated regulations in December 1995
 that eliminated the permit requirements for some types of public meetings. A re-
 quirement to notify the police remained. Some meetings continued to be prevented
 or broken up. Meetings by the Indonesian Prosperity Union (SBSI) were broken-up
 in October and December, despite the fact that it had given the police notification.
 Various NGO's had difficulty obtaining approval to hold meetings following the July
 27 violence.
 The 1985 Social Organizations Law (ORMAS) requires the adherence of all orga-
 nizations, including recognized religions and associations, to the official ideology of
 Pancasila. This provision, which limits political activity, is widely understood as de-
 signed to inhibit activities of groups seeking to engage freely in democratic political
 competition, make Indonesia an Islamic state, revive communism, or return the
 country to a situation of partisan ideological division. This law empowers the Gov-
 ernment to disband any organization it believes to be acting against Pancasila and
 requires prior government approval for any organization's acceptance of funds from
 foreign donors, thereby hindering the work of many local humanitarian organiza-
 tions. Nevertheless, a significant number of organizations, including the independ-
 ent labor organization Serikat Buruh Sejahtera Indonesia (SBSI), continued to be
 active without official recognition under this law. Sri Bintang Pamungkas estab-
 lished the Democratic Union Party (PUDI) in May. As only three political parties
 are permitted in Indonesia, it was not recognized by the Government but was not
 banned. However, after the July 27 violence, the Government cited the unauthorized
 PRD as a subversive, ne-Communist organization and has sought to arrest its
 membership (see Section 1.f.).
 In the past few years, NGO's have proliferated in such fields as human rights,
 the environment, development, and consumer protection. Until 1996 the Govern-
 ment gave them rather wide latitude to pursue their aims, including public criticism
 of government policies and in some cases lawsuits against the Government. Follow-
 ing the July 27 violence, the Government moved to monitor activities by certain
 NGO's and activists more closely, which had an intimidating effect. In November
 high level government officials threatened publicly that legal action could be taken
 against selected NGO's deemed to be "truble-making." Even before July, there were
 signs of government concern over political activism. The establishment of the Inde-
 pendent Election Monitoring Committee (KIPP) by political activists in March met
 with a mixed response from the Government and sporadic harassment. KIPP's na-
 tional leader was called in for questioning after the July 27 violence. On April 21,
 the Legal Aid Foundation's (LBH) Medan office was stoned by unidentified individ-
 uals during a gathering of local activists preparing to form a local chapter of KIPP.
 Several police officers were nearby but took no action to stop the attack. Early the
 next morning, the LBH office was burned and completely destroyed.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom and belief
 in one Supreme God. The Government recognizes Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism,
 Buddhism, and Hinduism, and permits the practice of the mystical, traditional be-
 liefs of "Aliran Kepercayaan." Although the population is over 85 percent Muslim,
 the practice and teachings of the other recognized religions are generally respected,
 and the Government actively promotes mutual tolerance and harmony among them.
 However, some restrictions on certain types of religious activity, including unrecog-
 nized religions, exist.
 Because the first tenet of Pancasila is belief in one Supreme God, atheism is for-
 bidden. The legal requirement to adhere to Pancasila extends to all religious and
 secular organizations. The Government strongly opposes Muslim groups that advo-
 cate establishing an Islamic state or acknowledging only Islamic law. The Govern-
 ment banned some religious sects including Jehovah's Witnesses, Baha'i, and in
 some provinces the messianic Islamic sect Darul Arqam. The Government closely
 monitors Islamic sects considered in danger of deviating from orthodox tenets, and
 in the past has on occasion dissolved such groups.
 High-level officials continued to make public statements and emphasize by exam-
 ple the importance of respect for religious diversity in the country. Lower-level offi-
 
 
 669
 
 cials, however, were frequently alleged to be reluctant to facilitate and protect the
 rights of reli..'h gious minorities.
 law aows conversion between faiths, and such conversions occur. The Gov-
 ernment views proselytizing by recognized religions in areas heavily dominated by
 another recognized religion as potentially disruptive and discourages it. Foreign
 missionary activities are relatively unimpeded, although in East Timor and occa-
 sionally elsewhere missionaries have experienced difficulties and delays in renewing
 residence  rmits, and visas allowing the entrance of new foreign clergy are difficult
 to obtain. Laws and decrees from the 1970's limit the number of years that foreign
 missionaries can spend in Indonesia, with some extensions granted in remote areas
 like Irian Jay a. Foreign missionary work is subject to the funding stipulations of
 the ORMAS Law. Citizens practicing the recognized religions maintain active links
 with coreligionists inside and outside the country and travel abroad for religious
 gatherings.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although in 1993 the Government drastically reduced the number of
 people barred either from entering or departing Indonesia from a publicly an-
 nounced fignre of 8,897 "blacklisted people to a few hundred, such restrictions still
 exist. The Government also restricts movement by citizens and foreigners to and
 within parts of the country. In addition, it requires permits to seek work in a new
 location in certain areas, primarily to control further population movement to
 crowded cities. Special permits are required to visit certain parts of Irian Jaya. The
 authorities require former pitical detainees, including those associated with the
 abortive 1965 coup, to give notice of their movements and to have official permission
 to change their place of residence (see Section 1.f.). Following the July 27 incident,
 a travel ban was imposed on Budiman Sudjatmiko and other PRD members sought
 by government authorities.
 In past years, the Government offered first asylum to over 125,000 Indochinese
 boat people. In September Indnesia's Galang Island camp was closed as the last
 remaining asylum seekers were repatriated. There remain, however, some 18 per-
 sons awaiting a third country resettlement opportunity. While providing first asy-
 lum for Vietnamese and Cambodian boat people, the Government has not formu-
 lated a policy regarding asylum seekers ofother nationalities. In 1996 the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (U-NHR) assisted 21 non-Indochinese
 who were recognized as refugees under the UNHCR mandate. The Government has
 refused to grant these refugees asylum or legal permission to stay in Indonesia.
 Some have been accepted for resettlement in third countries, while others have been
 held in detention or allowed to stay in Indonesia without legal status. There were
 no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 A number of East Tnorese asylum seekers who took refuge in various embassies
 in Jakarta were permitted to emigrate after negotiations.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government through democratic
 means. In June the Government engineered the ouster of the popular leader of the
 Indonesian Democratic Party (PD)-Megawati Sukarnoputri, who had become the
 subject of public speculation as a possible candidate for president in 1998-and the
 subsequent violent removal of her supporters from PDI headquarters in July. So far
 there has never been an electoral challenge to President Soeharto.
 The 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), is constitutionally the
 highest authority of the State. It meets every 5 years to elect the President and Vice
 President and to set the broad outlines of state policy. The MPR is effectively con-
 trolled by President Soeharto and his government, therefore, the election of any can-
 didate other than one of his choosing is essentially impossible. Five hundred mem-
 bers of the MPR come from the National Parliament (DPR), 425 of whose members
 will be elected in elections in 1997 (up from 400 elected members in 1992). The re-
 maining 75 members will be military appointees. In 1993 the MPR elected Soeharto
 to his sixth uncontested 5-year term as President. Legally the President is constitu-
 tionally subordinate to the Parliament, but actually he and a small group of associ-
 ates exercise governmental authority.           C th
 Under a doctrine known as dual function, te military assumes a significant socio-
 political as well as a security role. Members of the military were allotted 100
 unelected seats in the DPR, in partial ompensation for not being permitted to vote.
 In 1995 the Government legislated a reduction in the number o these seats from
 100 to 75, or 15 percent of a total of 500, effective in 1997. This reduction has al-
 ready taken p lace through attrition. The military will ontinue to hold an unelected
 20 percent of the seats in provincial and district parliaments, and to occupy numer-
 
 
 670
 ous key positions in the administration. The other 85 percent of national and 80
 percent of local parliamentary seats are filled through elections held every 5 years.
 All adult citizens, except active duty members of the armed forces, convicted crimi-
 nals serving prison sentences, and some 36,000 former members of the Communist
 Party, are eligible to vote. Voters choose by secret ballot between the three govern-
 approve  po  ica organizations, which field candidate lists in each electoral
 district. Those lists must be screened by BAKORSTANAS, which determines wheth-
 er candidates were involved in the abortive 1965 Communist coup or pose other
 broadly defined security risks. Critics charge that these screenings are unconstitu-
 tional, since there is no way to appeal the results, and note that they can be used
 to eliminate critics of the Government from Parliament.
 Strict rules establish the length of political campaigns, access to electronic media,
 schedules for public appearances, and the political symbols that can be used. The
 Government formally permits only three political organizations to exist and contest
 elections (see Section 2.b.). The largest and most important of these is GOLKAR,
 a government-controlled organization of diverse functional groups that won 68 per-
 cent of the seats in the 1992 elections. The President strongly influences the selec-
 tion of the leaders of GOLKAR. The other two small political organizations, the
 United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI),
 gained 17 and 15 percent respectively of the remaining vote. The two smaller par-
 ties are not permitted to maintain party offices below the district level, placing them
 at a disadvantage to the government-supported GOLKAR. The law requires all
 three political organizations to embrace Pancasila, and none of the organizations is
 considered an opposition party. (After the July violence in Jakarta, the Government
 cracked down on the PRD, a small leftist organization that it charged was an unau-
 thorized political party bent on subverting the Government (see Section 1.f.). Gov-
 ernment authorities closely scrutinize and often guide the activities of the three po-
 litical organizations, as evidenced by the blatant intervention in the internal affairs
 of the PDI in 1996. Members of the DPR and the provincial assemblies may be re-
 called from office by party leaders.
 GOLKAR maintains close institutional links with the armed forces and KORPRI,
 the association to which all civil servants automatically belong. Civil servants may
 join any of the political parties with official permission, but most are members of
 GOLKAR. Former members of the PK9 and some other banned parties may not run
 for office or be active politically. The DPR considers bills presented to it by govern-
 ment departments and agencies but does not draft laws on its own, although it has
 the constitutional authority to do so. The DPR does make technical, and occasionally
 substantive alterations to bills it reviews. In practice, it remains clearly subordinate
 to the executive branch, but recently it has become more active in scrutinizing gov-
 ernment policy, and exercising oversight of government budgetary expenditures and
 program implementation through hearings at which members of the Cabinet, mili-
 tary commanders, and other high officials are asked to testify. The Speaker of the
 DPR has publicly called for a larger role for the body. The DPR has also become
 increasingly a focal point of appeals and petitions from students, workers, displaced
 farmers, and others protesting alleged human rights abuses and airing other griev-
 ances. It rarely is the source of any relief to petitioners other than providing a chan-
 nel through which their complaints can be aired.
 While there are no legal restrictions on the role of women in politics, they are
 underrepresented in government. About 11 percent (55 of 500) DPR members are
 women; 2 women are cabinet members. During the selection process of candidates
 for Parliament, discussion of the underrepresentation of women has arisen. The
 State Minister for Women's Roles complained publicly that GOLKAR was nominat-
 ing fewer women than had been promised.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights organizations and other NGO's have been subjected to a
 systematic government crackdown since the July 27 violence at PDI headquarters.
 The Government has used the violence associated with the July 27 incident as a
 pretext to intimidate, arrest, and otherwise pressure human rights and other activ-
 ists into limiting their activities. NGO's faced government harassment including po-
 lice raids on their offices, surveillance by police or military intelligence, interroga-
 tions at police stations, or cancellations of private meetings; in some cases high level
 government officials threatened that legal action would be taken against them be-
 cause they were considered to be trouble-making. While no NGO's had been banned
 or subject to formal legal action as of the end of the year, the harassment and in-
 timidation continued. Moreover, some small NGO's were effectively forced to close
 their doors after July 27.
 
 
 671
 The Government has resisted a proposal by the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission to open an office in Jakarta that would have the capacity to monitor
 human rights developments. The Government had indicated a willingness to permit
 an office to opea in Jakarta only if its mission was restricted to technical operations
 such as conducting seminars without any monitoring function.
 The Government considers outside investigations or foreign-based criticism of al-
 leged human rights violations to be interference in its internal affairs. It emphasizes
 its belief that linking foreign assistance or other sanctions related to its human
 rights observance constitutes interference in its internal affairs and is therefore un-
 acceptable.
 Sources in Irian Jaya claim that the Government has obstructed NGO and church
 efforts to investigate ABRI actions in the Mapenduma area, where hostage taking
 had occurred early in the year, which, according to unconfirmed reports from gov-
 ernment critics, had resulted in losses among the civilian population. The Govern-
 ment claims that it has limited access to the area for all nonresidents as a security
 measure.
 The ICRC continued to operate in East Timor, Irian Jaya, and Aceh, and to visit
 prisoners convicted of participation in the abortive, Communist-backed coup in 1965,
 convicted Muslim extremists, and East Timorese prisoners. The Government also
 permitted the ICRC to visit 10 detainees in the custody of the Attorney General's
 Office who had been arrested in connection with the July 27 violence in Jakarta.
 The Government also invited senior foreign government officials to visit with two
 of these detainees on one occasion.
 While receiving support for its work from the Government in principle, the ICRC
 periodically faced difficulty in implementing its humanitarian program in East
 Timor. The ICRC no longer maintains an office in Irian Jaya, but it visits that prov-
 ince from Jakarta several times a year. The ICRC was deeply involved in the at-
 tempt to negotiate an end to the January-May hostage crisis in Irian Jaya, working
 in close collaboration with the Government to achieve a nonviolent end to that cri-
 sis. The ICRC also visits Aceh regularly, but the Government has not approved the
 ICRC's request to open an office there. Travel to East Timor by foreign human
 rights NGO's has not been approved. Domestic human rights organizations are able
 to visit East Timor.
 The Government-appointed National Human Rights Commission, in its third year
 of operation, continued to be active in examining reported human rights violations
 and continued to show independence and a willingness to criticize government ac-
 tions and policies. It investigated the April deaths of students in Ujung Pandang,
 issued a forthright statement in June condemning the Government's interference in
 internal PDI affairs, and launched an investigation of the July 27 incident, which
 was widely considered to be its greatest challenge yet. Its report on the July 27 inci-
 dent, released October 12, found the Government and its security a pparatuspar-
 tialy responsible for the violence. The Government has not responded to the Com-
 mission's report or taken any steps to punish those government and government-
 backed personnel responsible for the violence.
 Lacking enforcement powers, the Commission attempts to work within the sys-
 tem, sending teams where necessary to inquire into possible human rights problems
 and employing persuasion, publicity, and moral authority to highlight abuses, make
 recommendations for legal and regulatory changes, and encourage corrective action.
 The Commission now occupies its own permanent facilities, but still continues to
 have very limited staff support.
 Although the Government appointed the original Commission members, the Com-
 mission fills vacancies in its ranks independently by internal election. A new chair-
 man and four new members, replacing those who had died while in office, were
 elected in the fall.
 The Commission opened an East Timor office in June. This was widely regarded
 as a positive step in the ongoing effort to address and resolve human rights abuses
 in East Timor. However, many observers also had doubts about the potential effec-
 tiveness of the East Timor office because of its location next to the local military
 headquarters, its leadership by a non-Timorese, its reliance on government-provided
 staffing, and the fact that it could only receive complaints and send them back to
 Jakarta, but not take action itself. The initial flow of citizens to the facility tended
 to comprise people who did not make complaints regarding the Government, the
 military, or local authorities, conveying the impression that the local population
 were reluctant to approach the facility. As of year's end, the office had limited itself
 to dealing only with nonpolitical cases and therefore had made little impact with
 regard to the more serious human rights problems in East Timor. The Commission
 is trying to address some of the problems that have impeded the effectiveness of the
 office.
 
 
 Findings issued by the Commission that were critical of the Government or dis-
 agreed with the government perspective, notably with regard to the interim report
 on the July 27 rioting in Jakarta, have dawn thinly veiled government rebukes and
 warnings. Moreor ver       ernment has tended to ignore some commission find-
 ings or, in some instances, has moved lethargically in reaction to them. The Govern-
 ment has not responded to the Commission's final report on the July 27 violence
 issued October 12. Of six cases of ABRI abuse of indigenous people in Irian Jaya
 identified by the Commission in September 1995, only one had led to court action
 by year's end.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution does not explicitly forbid discrimination based on gender, race,
 disability, language, or social status. However, the Constitution stipulates equal
 rights and obligations for al citizens, both native and naturalized. Chapter 4 of the
 1993 Guidelines of State Policy (legal statutes adopted by the People's Consultative
 Assembly) explicitly states that women have the same rights, obligations, and op-
 portunities as men. However, marriage law dictates that men are the head of the
 family. The Constitution grants citizens the right to practice their individual reli-
 gion and beliefs; however, the Government imposes some restrictions on religious
 activity.
 Women.-Violence against women remains poorly documented. However, the Gov-
 ernment has acknowledged the problem of domestic violence in society, which some
 say has been aggravated by social changes brought about b rapid urbanization.
 Longstanding traditional beliefs that the husband may "teach eor control" the wife
 through several means, including violence, also contribute to the problem. Rape by
 a husandof a wife is not a crime, although women's groups are tryingto change
 this law. While police could bring assault charges against a husband for, eatg his
 wife, due to social attitudes they are unlikely to do so. Cultural norms dictate that
 problems between husband and wife are private problems, and violence against
 women in the home is rarely reported. The Government provides some counseling,
 and several private organizations exist to assist women. Many of these organiza-
 tions focus on reuniting the family rather than on providing protection to the
 women involved. Many women rely on extended family systems for assistance in
 cases of domestic violence. In 1995 the first drop-in center for battered women was
 founded in Jakarta by an NGO. Another drop-in center was founded in Jakarta by
 the official, government-sponsored National Women's Organization (KOWANI).
 There is one crisis center for women in Yogyakarta run by an NGO. There are NGO
 plans for training volunteer counselors to work at a women's crisis center/shelter,
 which is also to have a hot line, which is expected to open as soon as funds are
 available.
 Rape is a punishable offense in Indonesia. Men have been arrested and sentenced
 for rape and attempted rape although reliable statistics are unavailable. Mob vio-
 lence against accused rapists is frequently reported. Women's rights activists believe
 that rape is grossly underreprted owing to the social stigma attached to the victim.
 Some legal experts state that if a woman does not go immediately to the hospital
 for a physical examination that produces physical evidence of rape, she will not be
 able to bring charges. A witness is also required in order to bring charges, and only
 in rare cases is there a witness. Some women reportediy fail to report rape to police,
 because the police do not take their allegations seriously.
 There is no sexual harassment law, only an indecent behavior law. Sexual harass-
 ment charges, however, can damage a civil service career. The current law report-
 edly covers physical abuse only, and requires two witnesses. Women job applicants
 and workers have complained of being sexually victimized by foremen and factory
 owners.
 According to the Constitution, women are equal to and have the same rights, obli-
 gations, and opportunities as men. However, in practice women face some legal dis-
 crimination. Marriage law, based on Islamic law, allows men to have up to four
 wives if the first wife is unable "to fulfil her tasks as a wife." Permission of the
 first wife is required, but reportedly most women cannot refuse. A civil servant who
 wishes to marry a second woman also must have the consent of his supervisor. To
 set an example, the President has forbidden cabinet officials and senior military offi-
 cers from having second wives. In divorce cases women often bear a heavier evi-
 dentiary burden than men, especially in the Islamic-based family court system. Ali-
 mony is rarely received by divorced women, and there is no enforcement of alimony
 pa ent. By law, a woman cannot pass citizenship to her child, born inside or out-
 side Indonesia, if the father of the child is not a citizen. The child must obtain resi-
 dency visas to remain in Indonesia, and can only apply for citizenship when he or
 
 
 673
 she reaches the age of 18. A case in which the court ordered the deportation of a
 4-year-old child of an Indonesian woman and non-Indonesian man attracted consid-
 erable media attention during the year.
 Although some women enjoy a high degree of economic and social freedom and
 occupy important mid-level positions in both the public and private sectors, the ma-
 jority of women do not experience such social and economic freedoms and are often
 disproportionately represented at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. Although
 women constitute one-quarter of the civil service, they occupy only a small fraction
 of the service's top posts. Income disparity between men ad women diminishes sig-
 nificantly with greater educational attainment.
 Female workers in manufacturing generally receive lower wages than men. Many
 female factory workers are hired as day laborers instead of as full-time permanent
 employees, and ompanies are not required to provide benefits, such as maternity
 leave, to day laborers. Female activists report that a  wing trend in manufactur-
 ing is the hiring of women to do work in their homes or less than minimum wage.
 Unemployment rates for women are approximately 50 percent higher than for men.
 Women are often not given the extra benefits and salary that are their due when
 they are the head of household, and in some cases do not receive employment bene-
 fits for their husband and children, such as medical insurance and income tax de-
 ductions.
 Des ite laws that provide women with a 3-month maternity leave, the Govern-
 ment gas conceded that pregnant women are often dismissed or are replaced while
 on leave. Some companies require that women sign statements that they will not
 become pregnant. The employment law mandates 2 days of menstrual leave per
 month for women.
 Women disproportionately experience illiteracy, poor health, and inadeuate nu-
 trition. The President has called for expanded eorts to reduce the materiainortal-
 ity rate, which at 425 per 100,000 live births is veiy high. The Government, with
 the help of international donors, launched a major effort in December to reduce the
 maternal mortality rate. Women's educational indicators have improved in the last
 decade. For example, the number of girls graduating from high school tripled from
 1980 to 1990. A number of voluntary private groups work actively to advance wom-
 en's legal, economic, social, and political rights and claim some success in gaining
 official cognizance of women's concerns.
 Women s NGO's have felt pressure from increased government scrutiny of all
 NGO's in the wake of the July 27 violence in Jakarta.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare, but is
 hampered by a lack of resources that prevents it from translating this commitment
 into practice. A 1979 law on children's welfare defines the responsibility of the State
 and parents to nurture and protect children. However, implementing regulations
 have never been developed, and the law's provisions have yet to go into effect. The
 Government has made particular efforts to improve primary education and mater-
 nity services. Although primary education is in principle universal, the United Na-
 tions Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that more than 1 million children drop
 out of primary school every year due mainly to the cost of supplies, uniforms, and
 other expenses, in addition to the professed need for the children to supplement
 family income. Government figures put the number of working children between the
 ages of 10 and 14 at 8 percent of the total, half of whom go to school and also work
 and half of whom work exclusively. Unofficial estimates are higher.
 According to the Ministry of Social Affairs, there are between 20,000 and 30,000
 street children in Jakarta. Thousands more live in other cities. They sell news-
 papers, shine shoes, help to park or watch cars, and otherwise earn money. Many
 thousands more work in factories and fields (see Section 6.d.). According to NGO
 sources there are thousands of children working on fishing platforms off the coast
 of North Sumatra for average monthly salaries of $12 to $18. There are reports of
 harsh living conditions and virtual abduction of children from parents who are mis-
 led into thinking the children will be paid and treated well.
 There is reportedly growing Government concern about street children, because
 in some cities they have become well organized and more interested in protecting
 their rights.
 NGO's criticize government efforts to help street children and worki  children
 as inadequate, although the Government is beginning to address the problems. The
 Ministries of Manpower, Education, Welfare, and Foreign Affairs, along with the Re-
 gional Planning Board, the United Nations Development Program, and four indige-
 nous NGOs are designing a program to address the needs of working children. The
 project incorporates many ideas generated by the NGO community, including estab-
 isig"open houses" in targeted areas which will provide vocational training and
 basic education to street children. The project has begun on a pilot basis in Jakarta
 
 
 674
 and Surabaya, and is planned for Bandung, Yogyakarta, Semarang, Ujung Pandang,
 and Medan.
 Another approach being taken to the street children problem utilizes the National
 Program for Discipline and Clean Cities Decree. The street children are physically
 removed from cities by bus. Usually, they are taken outside the city and left there.
 Sometimes they are taken to "holding houses" where they are first interrogated and
 later released. One NGO reported that in the latter part of the year, Bandung city
 expanded efforts to "clean" the streets of street children, and was busing them out
 of the city several times a week.
 NGO's working for the rights of children experienced increased harassment by the
 authorities. Several groups have reported that it became more difficult to obtain the
 required government permission for their activities. An exhibition and seminar
 about street children and violence planned by an NGO was canceled by the authori-
 ties the day before it was to open. Visiting street children were put in buses and
 escorted out of the region by the military.
 Child prostitution and other sexual abuses occur, but data on their incidence are
 lacking. While there are laws designed to protect children from indecent activities,
 prostitution, and incest, the Government has made no special enforcement efforts
 in these areas. Greater attention was paid to the problem of child prostitution in
 the press, which may have resulted in increasing awareness of a problem that is
 poorly documented.
 A separate criminal justice system for juveniles does not exist. Police officials
 admit !hat juveniles are often imprisoned with adult offenders. Currently juvenile
 crime is handled by ordinary courts. A juvenile justice law was passed December
 19. It defines juveniles ab children between the ages of 8 and 18, and establishes
 a special court system and criminal code for them. The draft bill had been controver-
 sial because four articles were seen as not in line with Islamic law and doctrine.
 They covered custody, adoption, neglected children, and care of delinquents, and
 among other things would have permitted the adoption of Muslim children by non-
 Muslims. The Government removed the contentious article to secure passage of the
 bill.
 A form of female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is
 practiced in some parts of Indonesia. There are no statistics available; the only in-
 formation available is anecdotal. Usually a small section of the tip of the clitoris is
 cut or a small incision is made with the purpose of drawing a few drops of blood.
 Total removal of the clitoris is not the objective of the practice, although it does
 occur if ineptly performed. It usually takes place within the first year after birth,
 often on the 40th day, though it can be done up to age seven. It is performed either
 at a hospital or, especially in rural areas, by a local traditional practitioner or
 "dukun." more severe forms of FGM are reportedly practiced in certain areas.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution stipulates that the Government pro-
 vide care for orphans and the disabled, but does not specify how the term "care"
 should be defined, and the provision of education to all mentally and physically dis-
 abled children has never been inferred. Regulations specify that the Government es-
 tablish and regulate a national curriculum for special education by stipulating that
 the "community" provide special education services to its children.
 There are no accurate statistics on the numbers of disabled in the general popu-
 lation. Families often hide their disabled family members to avoid social stigma or
 embarrassment. The disabled face considerable discrimination in employment, al-
 though there are factories that have made special efforts to hire disabled workers.
 In several provinces there are "rehabilitation centers" for the disabled. Disabled peo-
 ple are reportedly taken off the streets by the authorities and brought to these cen-
 ters for job training.
 NGO's are the primary providers of education for the disabled. There are cur-
 rently 1,084 schools for the disabled; 680 are private, and 404 are government
 schools. Of the government schools 165 are "integrated," serving both regular and
 special education students. In Jakarta there are 98 schools for the disabled, 2 of
 which are government-run, and 96 of which are private. The Government also runs
 three national schools for the visually, hearing, and mentally disabled. These
 schools accept children from throughout Indonesia.
 There is no law that mandates accessibility to buildings and public transportation
 for the disabled, and virtually no buildings or public transportation are designed
 with such accessibility in mind.
 Indigenous People.-The Government considers the term "indigenous people" to be
 a misnomer, because it considers all Indonesians to be indigenous. Nonetheless, it
 publicly recognizes the existence of several "isolated communities," and that they
 have a right to participate fully in political and social life. The Government esti-
 
 
 675
 mates the number of people in isolated communities is 1.5 million. This includes,
 but is not limited to, groups such as the Dayak population in Kalimantan who live
 in remote forest areas, indigenous communities throughout Irian Jaya, and economi-
 cally disadvantaged families living as sea nomads onboats near Riau in east Suma-
 tra and near Ujung Pandang in Southern Sulawesi. Critics maintain that the Gov-
 ernment's approach is basically paternalistic and designed more to integrate indige-
 nous people more closely into Indonesian society than to protect their traditional
 way of life. Human rights monitors criticize the Government's transmigration pro-
 gram for violating the rights of indigenous people (see Section 1.f.).
 A majority of the cases brought to legal aid organizations throughout Indonesia
 concern complaints about land seizure. According to a law derived from Dutch prac-
 tices all subsurface mineral resources belong to the Government. The Basic Agrar-
 ian Law states that land rights cannot be "in conflict with national and state inter-
 ests," which provides the Government with a broad legal basis for land seizures.
 When disputes cannot be settled the Government has the authority to deme fair
 compensation for land. There are a number of reports of the use of intimidation,
 sometimes by the authorities, for land acquisition. In East Kalimantan, according
 to a foreign human rights group, 14 men were severely mistreated by military per-
 sonnel after failed negotiations over a land dispute between villagers and a logging
 company (see Section 1.c.). In West Kalimantan reliable sources reported that local
 military accompanied plantation owners during negotiations with local land owners
 for land acquisition. In this case, although intimidation was used, two villages still
 refused to relinquish their land.
 Where indigenous people clash with development projects, the developers almost
 always win. Decisions regarding development projects, resource-use concessions, and
 other economic activities are generally carried out without the participation or in-
 formed consent of the affected communities. Indonesian environmentalNGO's that
 have sought to aid these communities have been subjected to verbal attacks, raids,
 and other forms of intimidation by government security forces.
 Tensions with indigenous people in Irian Jaya, including in the vicinity of a for-
 eign mining concession area near Timika, continued, highlighted by large-scale riot-
 ing by Irianese tribesmen in March. The Government and the foreign mining com-
 pany alleged that Indonesian environmental NGO's and international NGO's had
 prodded the tribesmen to action. The Government and the foreign mining company
 have since tried to reach a financial settlement with tribal representatives. Indige-
 nous Irian Jaya residents complain of racism, religious bias, paternalism, and con-
 descension as constant impediments to better relations with non-Irian people, in-
 cluding members of the Government, the miitary, and the non-Irian business com-
 munity. They also complain of abusive behavior by the Indonesian security forces
 (see Section L.a.). Rioting in numerous Irian Jaya towns, including Timika!
 Tembagapura, Nabire, Jayapura, and Wamena, resulted in several deaths and many
 injuries. The riots tended to pit newly arrived nonindigenous peoples against indige-
 nous  -ups who claimed that the "outsiders" were monopolizing jobs, exploiting
 local Faber, and illegally expropriating indigenous lands. As a result of the deaths
 of civilians and other violent human rights abuses brought to light in 1995, four sol-
 diers received prison terms in February (see Section L.a.) Irianese have expressed
 anger that the Government has prosecuted only one of six cases identified in a Sep-
 tember 1995 Human Rights Commission report as warranting government prosecu-
 tion. In the one case that was prosecuted, the military court addessed only charges
 of murder and did not take up charges of rape of indigenous women.
 Human rights monitors have expressed concern about the practices of some log-
 ing compames that recruit indigenous people for work. According to Human Rights
 Watch/Asia, this activity in Irian Jaya has separated these people from their tradi-
 tional economies. In many cases, these new recruits for development projects are ill-
 prepared for the modern world, leading to their being forced into debt and then in-
 dentured (see Section 6.c.). Most civil servants in local governments in Irian Jaya
 and other isolated areas continue to come primarily from Java, rather than from
 the local indigenous population.
 Religious Minorities.-There were several instances of religion-related mob vio-
 lence. In July several Christian churches were burned in Surabaya. On October 10,
 Muslim rioters associated with the National Ulama (NU) Islamic organization
 burned or ransacked and destroyed 24 churches and a Buddhist temple on the East
 Java coast. A Protestant minister, his wife and child, and a church worker were
 burned to death. The riot was triggered by perceived insufficiency of a sentence
 meted out by a court for a man's alleged blasphemy against Islam. NU leader
 Abdurrahman Wahid, in an effort to maintain calm after t e riot, expressed regrets
 for the riot. The reported police beating of Islamic teachers on December 23, along
 with the false rumor that one of the teachers had been killed, apparently was the
 
 
 cause of serious rioting in Tasikmalaya, West Java on December 26, involving thou-
 sands of people. Although sparked by anger over police abuse, the rioting reportedly
 targeted businesses, factories, and shops, including those owned by members of the
 Ch nese community, churches, and police offices. The incident was being inves-
 tigated by the National Human Rights Commission and the Legal Aid Foundation
 (LBH) as the year ended. In September a group of young people burned a Catholic
 church in east Jakarta. The group was apprently Musim, and was seeking to
 eliminate non-Muslim influences in the area. In Augst, in Viqueque, East Timorese
 demonstrated against government-sponsored Muslim migrants to the area, and
 burned a number of shops owned by these migrants. In     u   so in East Timor,
 the desecration of either a picture or statue of the Virgin Mary in Baucau sparked
 rioting on the part of the Catholic East Timorese. This ed to numerous arrests and
 at least one serious injury.
 NationalIRaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Government officially promotes racial
 and ethnic tolerance. Ethnic Chinese, at approximately 3 percent of the population
 by far the largest nonindigenous minority group, are the target of both official and
 societal discrimination. Since 1959 noncitizen ethnic Chinese have been denied the
 right to run businesses in rural Indonesia. Regulations prohibit the operation of all
 Chinese schools, formation of exclusively Chinese cultural groups or trade associa-
 tions, and public display of Chinese characters. Since August 1994, firms working
 in the tourist industry have been allowed to produce Chinese-language brochures,
 programs, and similar material for Chinese-speaking tourists. However, Chinese-
 language publications, with the exception of one government-owned daily news-
 paper, may neither be imported nor produced domestically.
 Private instruction in Chinese is generally prohibited but takes place to a limited
 extent, and since 1994 has been allowed to train employees in the tourism industry.
 The University of Indonesia has Chinese-language courses. State universities have
 no formal quotas that limit the number of ethnic Chinese. The law forbids the cele-
 bration of the Chinese New Year in temples or public places, but its enforcement
 is limited.
 East Timorese and various human rights groups charge that the East Timorese
 are underrepresented in the civil service in East Timor. The Government has made
 some efforts to recruit more civil servants in both East Timor and Irian Jaya, and
 there has been some increase in the number of civil servant trainees for these two
 provinces, despite a "no growth" policy for the civil service as a whole. East Timor-
 ese and Irianese, however, have been very reluctant to accept government jobs out-
 side their own provinces. East Timorese have expressed concerns that the
 transmigration program (see Section 1.f.) could lead to fewer employment opportuni-
 ties ana might eventually destroy East Timor's cultural identity. However,
 transmigration projects in Timor have been reduced in recent years and are limited
 to Hindus and Christians to avoid religious friction. In 1995 a government official
 claimed that 75 percent of the transmigrants were from other parts of East Timor,
 and only 25 percent from other areas. Inthe last several years, informal predomi-
 nantly Muslim migration to the province has sparked socioeconomic tension in
 urban areas, proving an even greater concern than the formally sponsored
 transmigration program.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Private sector workers are by law free to form work-
 er organizations without prior authorization. However, government policies and cur-
 rent numerical requirements for union recognition constitute a significant barrier to
 freedom of association and the right to engage in collective bargaining. The Depart-
 ment of Manpower uses a regulation that requires that a union be set up "by and
 for workers" to deny recognition to groups that include people it considers nonwork-
 ers, such as lawyers or human rights activists, who are involved as labor organizers.
 Until 1994 only the government-sponsored Federation of All-Indonesian Trade
 Unions (SPSI) could legally bargain on behalf of employees or represent workers in
 the Department of Manpowers labor courts. However, single company unions were
 widespread in practice. A 1994 regulation provides that workers in a single company
 with more than 25 employees can join together as a "plant-level union" and nego-
 tiate a legally binding agreement with their employer outside the SPSI framework,
 although the Government encourages these plant-level unions to join the SPSI. Ac-
 cording to the Department of Manpower, 1,144 plant-level unions had been estab-
 lished by year's end. Nongovernmental organizations have charged, however, that
 many of these unions are "yellow unions" formed by company management with lit-
 tle or no worker participation. There are also credible reports that local Department
 of Manpower officials accept payments from employers to set up plant-level unions
 in their factories because they are considered even weaker than SPSI. On the other
 
 
 677
 hand, there are numerous reports of successful strikes by these single company
 unions, particularly against foreign ventures.
 There is a de facto single union system, the SPSI and its 13 federated sectoral
 unions. The SPSI completed in 1995 a transformation from a unitary (centralized)
 to a federative (decentralized) structure. Its 13 industrial sectors are now registered
 as separate national unions; the SPSI is the only trade union federation recognized
 by the Department of Manpower. The Minister of Manpower has stated that any
 unions that are formed should affiliate with the SPSI federation, and that the Gov-
 ernment will not recognize any unions outside the federation. The Government's
 stated policy is to improve effectiveness of the recognized SPSI unions rather than
 to allow the formation of alternative organizations.
 The Government may dissolve a union if it believes that the union is acting
 against Pancasila, although it has never actually done so, and there are no laws or
 regulations specifying procedures for union dissolution.
 Two labor groups other than SPSI are active but not recognized by the Govern-
 ment: the Serikat Buruh Sejahtera Indonesia (SBSI, Indonesian Prosperity Trade
 Union), and the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI). The SBSI, created in
 1992, claims that it has formed the necessary number of factory-level units to meet
 the legal requirements for registration as a labor union, but its most recent request
 (in November 1994) for registration as a trade union was denied. The Department
 of Manpower has also blocked SBSI attempts to register with the Department of
 Home Affairs as a social organization under the ORMAS Law. The Government con-
 siders the SBSI to be illegal. Although the Government has not disbanded it, it con-
 tinues to harass the SBSI, by means such as disbanding its meetings and training
 seminars. Specific government actions against the SBSI included the detention of
 Roliati Harefa, an SBSI organizer in Binjai, North Sumatra, for a month in January
 and again in April. Assault charges were filed against her after she had complained
 to the police that her supervisor-had assaulted her. SBSI leader Muchtar Pakpahan
 was arrested on July 30. His trial on charges of subversion and sowing hatred
 against the Government began on December 12 and was still proceeding at year's
 end. Before his trial, the Government stated that he was being held for political ac-
 tivities, not labor activities. However, the Government's indictment against
 Pakpahan refers to his activities as head of the SBSI, states that he undertook ac-
 tivities together with fellow board members of the SBSI, and lists specific labor ac-
 tivities (e.g., a labor rally) as the basis for the charges against him. In October the
 Supreme Court, in an unprecedented decision, reinstated an old conviction against
 Pakpahan for fomenting labor unrest, thus requiring him to serve out a 4-year sen-
 tence that it had previously overturned.
 Government pressure on the SBSI intensified after the July 27 violence in Ja-
 karta, as the Attorney General's Office has questioned members of the union's
 Central Leadership Council and SBSI organizers around the country. Police con-
 fiscated SBSI archives from the union's central office in Jakarta, and closed down
 the union's office in Garut, West Java. In November a senior official of the Ministry
 of Home Affairs stated that the SBSI was one of the trouble-making NGO's the Gov-
 ernment would investigate (see Section 4). It is widely believed that the Govern-
 ment's actions against the SBSI leadership were intended to discredit or destroy the
 organization.
 The Association of Indonesian Journalists (PWI) is the only government-sanc-
 tioned organization representing journalists. Although press laws stipulate that all
 journalists must belong to PWI, a few journalists have avoided membership. In the
 wake of the 1994 banning of three publications approximately 80 journalists formed
 the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) as an alternative to the government
 union. A government crackdown in March 1995 resulted in the imprisonment of
 three AJI members charged with "sowing hate." Despite occasional pressure on pub-
 lications employing AJI members, the Government allows AJI a continued under-
 ground existence.
 Because of past Department of Manpower regulations, many SPSI factory units
 are led by persons who have little credibility with their units' members because they
 were selected by employers. A 1995 regulation states that employees must only no-
 tify their employer that they wish to form a union and that they may proceed if
 they do not receive a response from their employer within 2 weeks. Despite this pro-
 vision, strikes continue to occur when employers attempt to prevent the formation
 of union branches. These stries are generally successful, and the formation of an
 SPSI unit follows shortly thereafter. However, workers who are active in the forma-
 tion of the union are frequently dismissed and have no practical protection by either
 law or government practice.
 Civil servants are not permitted to join unions and must belong to KORPRI, a
 nonunion association whose Central Development Council is chaire by the Minister
 
 
 of Home Affairs. State enterprise employees, defined to include those working in en-
 terprises in which the State has a 5-percent holding or greater, usually are required
 t join KORPRI, but a    small number of state enterprises-have-SPSIlunits. Teachers
 must belong to the Teachers' Association (PGRI). While technically classed as a
 union, the GRI continues to function more as a welfare organization and does not
 appear to have engaged in trade union activities such as collective bargaining. Man-
 datiy KORPRI and PGRI contributions are automatically deducted from teachers'
 salaries.
 Unions may draw up their own constitutions and rules and elect their representa-
 tives. However, the Government has a great deal of influence over the SPSI and its
 federated unions. The head of SPSI and many members of the Executive Council
 are also members of GOLKAR and its constituent functional groups. These persons
 have been given positions in the federated industrial sector unions. The Minister of
 Manpower is a member of the SPSrs Consultative Council.
 The Government announced late in 1995 its intention to relax a regulation requir-
 ing police approval for all meetings of five or more people of all organizations out-
 side offices or normal work sites (see Section 2.b.). However, in practice this regula-
 tion continues to apply to union meetings. Permission was routinely given to the
 SPSI but not to rival organizations such as the SBSI.
 In 1994 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions lodged a formal
 complaint against Indonesia with the ILO, accusing the Government of denying
 workers the right to set up unions of their own choosing, harassing independent
 workers' orgamzations, and of taking other actions ontrary to ILO standards on
 freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. In considering this
 omplaint, the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association in November "deeply de-
 plored" the fact that "virtually no remedial action was taken by the Indonesian au-
 thorities" in response to old and new allegations against it. The Committee found
 that "indonesian legislation comprises requirements that are so stringent as to con-
 stitute a major limitation to freedom of association." The Committee urged the Gov-
 ernment to "take all the necessary measures" to ensure that the SBSI be registered
 "without delay." The Committee also concluded that "there exists a strong presump-
 tion, which the Government has not reversed, to the effect that under the cover of
 allegations of subversive activity, the charges brought and the measures taken
 against Mr. Pakpahan are linked to his trade union activities." It urged the Govern-
 ment to "take without delay the necessary measures for Mr. Pakpahan's release
 (and) to drop the charges related to the July 1996 events."
 While Pancasila principles call for labor-management differences to be settled by
 consensus, all organized workers except civil servants have the legal right to strike.
 While state enterprise employees and teachers rarely exercise this right, private sec-
 tor strikes are frequent. Before a strike can occur legally in the private sector, the
 law requires intensive mediation by the Department of Manpower and prior notice
 of the intent to strike. However, no a pproval is required. In practice, dispute settle-
 ment procedures are not followed, and formal notice of the intent to strike is rarely
 given because Department of Manpower procedures are slow and have little credibil-
 ity with workers. Therefore, sudden strikes tend to result from longstanding griev-
 ances or recognition that legally mandated benefits or rights are not being received.
 Strike leaders often lose their jobs and have no legal recourse for reinstatement.
 The number of strikes during the year increased to 346 from 276 in 1995, but most
 of the increase occurred before the July 27 violence and the subsequent crackdown
 on NGO's. NGO's believe that the actual number of strikes is higher, but agree with
 the general trend. The largest-scale labor protests occurred in Surabaya on July 8-
 9, involving thousands of workers. Police arrested 26 persons in connection with this
 incident.
 The SPSI maintains international contacts but its only international trade union
 affiliation is the ASEAN Trade Union Council.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 vided for by law, andthe Department of Manpower promotes it within the context
 of the national ideology, Pancasila. Until 1994 only recognized trade unions-the
 SPSI and its components--could legally engage in collective bargaining. Since early
 1994, government regulations also permit unaffiliated plant-level workers' associa-
 tions to conclude legally binding agreements with employers, and some 24 had done
 so by mid-1995, according to government figures. Agreements concluded by any
 other groups are not considered legally binding and are not registered by the De-
 art     of Manpower. Once notified that 25 employees have joined a registered
 r independent plant-level union, an employer is obligated to bargain with it.
 In companies without unions, the Government discourages workers from utilizing
 nongovernment outside assistance, e.g., during consultations with employers over
 company regulations. Instead, the Department of Manpower prefers that workers
 
 
 679
 seek its assistance and believes that its role is to protect workers. There are credible
 reports that for many companies, consultations are perfunctory at best and usually
 with management-selected workers; there are also credible reports to the contrary
 from foreign companies. Over half of the factory-level SPSI units have collective bar-
 gaining agreements. The degree to which these agreements are freely negotiated be-
 tween unions and management without government interference varies. By regula-
 tion, negotiations must be concluded within 30 days or be submitted to the Depart-
 ment of Manpower for mediation and conciliation or arbitration. Most negotiations
 are concluded within the 30-day period. Agreements are for 2 years and can be ex-
 tended for 1 year. According to NGO's involved in labor issues, the provisions of
 these agreements rarely go beyond the legal minimum standards established by the
 Government, and the agreements are often merely presented to worker representa-
 tives for signing rather than being negotiated. Although government regulations
 prohibit employers from discriminating or harassing em loyees because of union
 membership, there are credible reports from union officials of employer retribution
 against union organizers, including firing, which is not effectively prevented or rem-
 edied in practice. Some employers reportedly have warned their employees against
 contact with union organizers from the unrecognized SBSI organization. Charges of
 antiunion discrimination are adjudicated by administrative tribunals. However, be-
 cause many union members believe the tribunals generally side with employers,
 many workers reject or avoid the procedure and present their grievances directly to
 the National Human Rights Commission, Parliament and other agencies. Adminis-
 trative decisions in favor of dismissed workers tend to be monetary awards; workers
 are rarely reinstated. The provisions of the law make it difficult to fire workers, but
 the law is often ignored in practice.
 Commenting on antiunion discrimination and restrictions on collective bargaining
 in the context of ILO Convention 98 on the right to organize and bargain collec-
 tively, the ILO's Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommenda-
 tions' June report expressed "the firm hope that the Government will provide it in
 its next report with information with regard to the measures actually taken in order
 to bring law and practice more in line with the provisions of the Convention, and
 in particular to strengthen the protection of workers against acts of antiunion dis-
 crimination accompanied by effective and dissuasive sanctions, to adopt specific pro-
 visions to protect workers organizations against acts of interference by employers
 or their oranizations and to eliminate the restrictions imposed on free collective
 bargaining.
 On June 1, the Minister of Manpower issued a new regulation permitting unions
 affiliated with the SPSI to collect union dues directly through the checkoff system,
 rather than having the Department of Manpower collect dues and transfer them to
 the SPSI. Dues are to be collected at the local level and then transmitted up the
 union chain.
 The armed forces, which include the police, continue to involve themselves in
 labor issues, despite the Minister of Manpower's revocation in 1994 of a 1986 regu-
 lation allowing the military to intervene in strikes and other labor actions. However,
 a  1990   decree giving  the Agency   for Coordination   of National Stability
 (BAKORSTANAS) authority to intervene in strikes in the interest of political and
 social stability remains in effect. There are some indications that military involve-
 ment in labor matters decreased from 1995 to mid-1996, but not all observers agree
 that this has occurred. Workers charge that members of the security forces attempt
 to intimidate union organizers and strike leaders and have been present in signifi-
 cant numbers during some strikes, even when there has been no destruction of prop-
 erty or other violence. Military officials occasionally have been present during nego-
 tiations between workers and management and other union activities. Their pres-
 ence has been described as intimidating by plant-level union officials.
 Labor law and practice are the same in export processing zones as in the rest of
 the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced labor, and
 the Government generally enforces it. However, there are credible reports of teenage
 children being forced to work under highly dangerous conditions on fishing plat-
 forms off the coast of northeastern Sumatra. These platforms are miles off shore
 with access controlled by the employers, and in many cases the children are virtual
 risoners on the platforms and forced to work for up to 3 months at a time for well
 elow the minimum wage. According to knowledgeable sources, hundreds of children
 may be involved. The Government has done little to address the problem. There are
 also allegations that indigenous people who take jobs in the modern sector some-
 times end up indebted to their employers, and exploited as indentured labor (see
 Section 5 Indigenous People).

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor exists in both urban
 and rural areas, and in both the formal and informal sectors. According to a 1995
 report of the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics, 4 percent of Indonesian chil-
 dren between the ages of 10 and 14 work, and another 4 percent work in addition
 to going to school. Indonesia was one of the first countries to be selected for partici-
 pation in the ILO's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor
 (IPEC), and it signed a memorandum of understanding with the ILO in 1992 to
 guide collaboration under this program. Recommendations for an action plan were
 developed at a national conference in Bagor in 1993. By the end of the year, 130
 government labor inspectors had received ILO-sponsared training on child labor
 matters under the IEC program. However, enforcement remains lax.
 The Government acknowledges that there is a class of children who must work
 for socioeconomic reasons, and in 1987 the Minister of Manpower issued regulation
 per-O11men11987, "Protection of Children Forced to Work," to regulate this situation.
 This regulation legalizes the employ nt of children under the age of 14 who must
 work to contribute to the income oftheir families. It requires parental consent, pro-
 hibits dangerous or difficult work, limits work to 4 hours daily, and requires em-
 ployers to report the number of children working under its provisions. It does not
 set a minimum age for children in this category, effectively superseding the colonial-
 era government ordinance of December 17, 1925, on "Measures Limiting Child
 Labor and Nightwork of Women," which is still the current law governing child
 labor and sets a minimum age of 12 for employment. The 1987 regulation is not
 enforced. No employers have been taken to court for violating its restrictions on the
 nature of employment far children, and no reports are collected from establishments
 employing children.
 Act No. 1 of 1951 was intended to bring into force certain labor measures, includ-
 ig provisions on child labor that would replace those of the 1925 legislation. How-
 ever, implementing regulations for the child labor p rvisions have never been is-
 sued. Thus the c fid  or provisions in the 1951 Acthaveno validity.  coa
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-There is no national minimum wage. Rather,
 area wage councils working under the supervision of the national wage council es-
 tablish minimum wages for regions and basic needs figures for each province-a
 monetary amount considered sufficient to enable a single worker to meet the basic
 needs ofnutrition, clot   hin, and l er hile Indonesila has succeeded in dramati-
 cally lowering the level of poverty throughout the country, the minimum wage rates
 until recently have usually lagged behind inflation and even the basic needs figur es.
 The Government raised minimum wage rates each of the last 3 years, and in 199
 required employers to pay workers for 30 days during a month. In Jakarta the mini-
 mum wage i about $2.28 (Rp 5200) per day. An additional increase is planned for
 early 1997.
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of em plyers paying at least the
 minimum wage. Independent observers' estimates range between 30 and 60 percent.
 Several SPSI sector chairmen signed agreements with industry leaders delaying im-
 plementation of the minimum wage in their sectors. According to Department of
 Manpower figures, the Department investigated 75 cases of violations of labor laws
 during the year. Of the 28 cases decided by the end of theyear, 6 cases resulted
 in prisn sentences for company management, and 21 in fines; 1 employer was
 found not guilty. The Department of Manpower increased the number of labor in-
 spectrs and announced a scheme of "blacklisting" offending companies, but enforce-
 ment of minimum wage and other labor regulations remains inadequate, and sanc-
 tions too light. Over 200 companies have applied for and been granted relief from
 the latest minimum wage increases on the ground that the companies would other-
 wise close. In December the State Secretariat submitted a draft basic labor law
 which, among other things, would raise statutory fines, which have been devalued
 by inflation, to more appropriate levels. Some observers believe that increased gov-
 eonent pressures on employers and memories of the 1994 Medan riots have im-
 proved minimum wa      se compliance.
 Laber law and ministerial regulations provide workers with a variety of other
 benefits, such as social security, and workers in more modern facilities often receive
 health benefits, free meals, and transportation. The law establishes 7-hour work-
 days and 40-hour workweeks, with one 30-minute rest period for each 4 hours of
 work. The law also requires 1 day of rest weekly. The daily overtime rate is 1'2
 times the normal hourly rate for the first hour, and 2 times the hourly rate for addi-
 tional overtime. Regulations allow employers to deviate f he m tenoral work hours
 upon request to the Minister of Manpower and with the agreement of the employee.
 Workers in industries that produe retail goods fworkert frequ etyk overtime
 to fulfill contract quotas. Observance of laws regulating benefits and labor standards
 varies from sector to sector and by region. Employer violations of legal requirements
 
 
 681
 are fairly common and often result in strikes and employee protests. The Ministry
 of Manpower continues publicly to urge employers to comply with the law. However,
 in general, government enforcement and supervision of labor standards are weak.
 In December the Government submitted to Parliament a draft basic labor law de-
 signed to update, clarify, and codify laws and regulations affecting labor. Some NGO
 representatives have criticized the draft for not going far enough to protect worker
 rights.
 Both law and regulations provide for minimum standards of industrial health and
 safety. In the largely Western-operated oil sector, safety and health programs func-
 tion reasonably well. However, in the country's 100,000 larger registered companies
 outside the oil sector, the quality of occupational health and safety programs varies
 greatly. The enforcement of health and safety standards is severely hampered by
 the limited number of qualified Department of Manpower inspers as well as by
 the low level of employee appreciation for sound health and safety practices. Allega-
 tions of corruption on the part of inspectors are common. Workers are obligated to
 report hazardous working conditions. Employers are forbidden by law from retaliat-
 ing against those who do, but the law is not effectively enforced.
