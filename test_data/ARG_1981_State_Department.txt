 ARGENTINA
 In 1981 the overall human rights situation in Argentina
 continued to improve.
 Although the country continued to be ruled by a junta
 of the three military commanders -- President Roberto
 Viola was replaced by army commander Leopoldo Fortunato
 Galtieri in December -- and although the country remained
 under a state of siege, restraints on political and
 civil liberties lessened throughout the year. Political
 parties were increasingly able to speak out on national
 issues, even though political party activity remained
 officially proscribed. The five major political parties
 in the country openly joined in an informal coalition
 to offer the country an eventual civilian political
 alternative. Parties and the press criticized the
 government on issues that in the past had been considered
 too sensitive for public discussion. For the first
 time since 1976 such issues were discussed on radio.
 One large newspaper asserted it was the target of
 official intimidation but, in the wake of the controversy,
 continued to publish its views. The courts became
 increasingly active applying the test of reasonableness
 to the executive's action in detaining an individual.
 Jail conditions maintained the level of improvement
 resulting from earlier reforms of prison regulations.
 The number of reported violations of all kinds fell
 dramatically compared to previous years. At the same
 time, the total number of prisoners held on other
 than common criminal charges was reduced to a reported
 1,050. This figure includes approximately 640 people
 who are being held under the president's special state
 of siege powers (the P.E.N. prisoners). In comparison,
 a total of 8,200 people were detained for various
 periods under PEN powers between 1974 and 1980. However,
 a substantial number of these PEN prisoners still
 in detention are being held without trial or charge.
 In 1981 there were no new PEN arrests.
 Against the overall record, several points should
 be noted. In December, Argentine human rights organizations
 asserted that two cases of disappearances had taken
 place in 1981 (the person involved in the second case
 subsequently reappeared, as described below). These
 were the only such incidents reported as having occurred
 in 1981. In March there were two other cases in which
 individuals were apparently detained by security forces,
 but their detention was not acknowledged before they
 were released. They, like a woman who was arrested
 in December, were reportedly mistreated during their
 detention. In addition, in April a man was found
 dead of multiple bullet wounds several days after
 allegedly being arrested by security forces.
 During the year, human rights organizations joined
 by political groups continued to seek an accounting
 for those who disappeared in the past, but there was
 no positive response from the government. In general,
 human rights organizations remained active throughout
 the year. On several occasions their leaders complained
 of harassment and intimidation. In February 1981,
 the leaders of one human rights group were arrested
 by court order, held several days and then freed.

 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution prohibits the use of torture. There
 were reports that two of the men detained in March
 were subjected to electric shocks. A member of the
 Communist Party who was arrested as part of a court-
 ordered investigation reportedly stated in court that
 while detained she was mistreated, including being
 dangled from a window by her heels.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The improved prison conditions for those detained
 for security reasons (reported last year), which resulted
 from government reforms, appeared to have been maintained
 throughout 1981. Unlike 1980, there were no reports
 of suicides in jail during the year. Limited exercise
 and access to reading material at some facilities,
 as well as complaints from prisoners of arbitrary
 disciplinary action from their guards, were reported
 as problems.
 c. Disappearances
 In December 1981, Argentine human rights organizations
 publicly alleged that there had been two disappearances
 during the year. These cases had not been reported
 previously. The first of these alleged disappearances
 reportedly took place in March and the second at the
 end of November. The individual involved in the second
 case subsequently appeared at a police press conference
 where it was announced, and he confirmed, that he
 had been away from home on private business. Human
 rights organizations subsequently made known their
 scepticism about this explanation, affirming their
 original contention that he had disappeared.
 In March 1981, in separate instances, three men were
 temporarily unaccounted for after being taken away
 by people claiming to be security personnel. All
 were subsequently released. One man's detention was
 officially acknowledged, and the government stated
 that he had been detained on common criminal charges,
 which were later dismissed. Human rights organizations
 believe he was arrested for security reasons. Several
 times during the year alleged disappearances for political
 reasons turned out to have been arrests on ordinary
 criminal grounds. Two men were kidnapped by unknown
 assailants in September but were freed two days later.
 The case received extensive publicity in Argentina,
 and there was a widespread consensus that the kidnappers
 were probably opponents of the government. The government
 condemned the kidnappings.-
 Most observers believe that the majority of the many
 thousands of persons listed over the years by human
 rights organizations as disappeared are probably dead.
 These organizations continued to seek an accounting
 for the fate of the disappeared. Their efforts received
 increased public attention through, for example, press
 coverage of statements and demonstrations made by
 human rights activists and paid advertisements placed
 by human rights organizations in major newspapers.
 In December the five-party grouping of major Argentine
 
 
 330
 political forces issued a statement which included
 a call for the armed forces to "make an official explanation
 to the families and the country" of what happened
 to the disappeared. Former President Viola stated
 to an American news magazine in 1981 that the government
 is not in a position to prepare an "adequately correct
 list" of the disappeared because, he said, it is not
 known exactly whether the persons included in certain
 lists are really dead or disappeared.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Argentine constitution establishes the power of
 the executive branch to detain and hold prisoners
 under a state of siege (which has been in effect since
 November 1974). The powers derived under this provision,
 as well as the prisoners held under its authority,
 are often described with the adjective PEN, the Spanish
 acronym for the National Executive Power (Poder Ejecutivo
 Nacional). The constitution places no explicit time
 limit for holding PEN prisoners, although it declares
 that PEN prisoners can choose exile in lieu of detention.
 The supreme court in 1981 decided that a test of reasonableness
 must be applied to continuing PEN detentions. In
 the case which established this doctrine the court
 ordered the prisoner freed, and the government complied.
 Many PEN prisoners have been in jail without charge,
 some for many years, including a significant number
 detained before 1976.
 Between 1974 and 1980, 8,200 persons accused of terrorism
 or subversion have been detained under the special
 executive powers of the president. At the end of
 1981, those imprisoned on other than common criminal
 charges totalled about 1,050. Of these, an estimated
 640 were being detained under PEN jurisdiction. Reports
 vary as to how many of these PEN prisoners are being
 held without trial or charges; the estimates are 300
 to 400 people. The remainder of the 1,050 are serving
 sentences after conviction in civilian or military
 courts, are on trial or are awaiting trial. In 1981
 about 500 people who had been held on other than common
 criminal charges were released from detention, some
 of them on a form of parole. There were no arrests
 under PEN in 1981. The government has set up a system
 to review pending PEN cases periodically.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons accused of subversion or terrorism may be
 tried in either civilian or military courts. Civilian
 courts follow Argentina's customary legal provisions
 regarding open and fair trials. Argentine law, however,
 is based on the French and Spanish system which requires
 written rather than oral testimony, so that "open"
 has a different meaning and different consequences
 than in the United States legal system. Military
 tribunals, before which civilians accused of internal
 security violations may be tried, conduct their proceedings
 in secret. The defendants have access only to a military
 defense counsel, who is usually not a lawyer. Defendants
 legally may be kept unaware of the evidence against
 them in both military and civilian proceedings.
 
 
 331
 Lawyers in the past generally have been reluctant
 to defend people charged with terrorism or subversion,
 fearing harassment or reprisals. Over the past three
 years no lawyers disappeared. It appears that the
 legal profession is now operating more securely.
 The independence of the courts is provided for in
 the constitution. In 1976, however, the government
 replaced all members of the supreme court and removed
 a number of judges in lower courts, though most were
 retained. The courts have often upheld executive
 interpretations of laws and of the constitution, and
 they have not successfully clarified the fate of any
 of the disappearances brought to their attention.
 However, in 1981 the courts increasingly, and with
 success, challenged government actions and interpretations
 of its powers.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 In 1981 there were no reports of security forces violating
 the sanctity of the home.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution provides for these freedoms, but
 they have been circumscribed since the imposition
 of the state of siege in 1974. In 1981 exercise of
 freedom of speech and assembly expanded, although
 political leaders still risked arrest if they overstepped
 the uncertain and undefined bounds of permitted political
 activity and statements. Several retired military
 officers were briefly detained for making unauthorized
 political statements. Civilian political leaders
 in 1981 commented extensively on the government's
 political dialogue, on its promise to issue a new
 law which will allow political parties to reorganize
 and renew their leadership, on government economic
 policies and on human rights issues, including accounting
 for the disappeared. As the year progressed, political
 gatherings were far less subject to disruption and
 prohibition by the police than in the past. Public
 rallies and meetings were, on occasion, prohibited
 by authorities invoking the decree which suspends
 political party activity. Marxist parties to the
 left of the communists have been banned and are subject
 to penalties for illegal activities. All other parties
 increasingly conduct their activities without serious
 official interference.
 The press is not legally subject to official censorship,
 except for moral content and in regard to operations
 of the security services. However, there continues
 to be self-censorship. The Argentine Press Association
 has stated that press freedom is "seriously inhibited"
 and that the existence of Argentine newspapers is
 in immediate danger because of the de facto denial
 of the constitutional guarantees which sustain them.
 Nevertheless, newspapers actively criticize the govern-
 ment in many areas and report the remarks of opposition
 politicians. Coverage of such issues as human rights
 and disappearances increased during 1981. Most foreign
 publications enter Argentina without censorship, even
 
 
 332
 those containing critical articles. However, one
 edition of a United States weekly news magazine containing
 an article highly critical of many aspects of the
 Argentine situation was removed from circulation by
 its distributor.
 The constitution requires that the president be a
 member of the Catholic Church, and the majority of
 Argentines profess this faith. Other religions are
 required to register with the government; all but
 the Jehovah's Witnesses are permitted to function
 freely. There are substantial minority religious
 groups, including a 300,000-450,000 member Jewish
 community. The government publicly condemns religious
 prejudice. Former President Viola has stated that
 "all forms of discrimination, racial, religious, or
 founded on any other pretext, merit the total rejection
 of the Argentine people and government."
 Argentine Jews have well-developed community organizations,
 exercise their religion without restraints and participate
 fully in Argentine economic and cultural life. The
 government maintains correct relations with the Jewish
 community, and there is no evidence of an official
 policy of anti-Semitism, although incidents of anti-
 Semitism occur. During the height of the "dirty war"
 against terrorism there were credible reports of anti-
 Semitic behavior and persecution of Jewish prisoners
 by the security forces. Virulent anti-Semitic literature
 remains on sale in the country, but there have been
 no anti-Semitic programs on state-controlled television.
 In December 1981 the historical drama "The Holocaust,"
 the showing of which had been delayed earlier, was
 broadcast on television.
 There are about 30,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in Argentina.
 As of December 1981, their application for formal
 registration, which is a precondition for the legal
 presence of a religious organization in Argentina,
 was still pending government approval. The Witnesses
 continue to experience some problems in registering
 their children in schools, and some Witness school
 children faced expulsion for refusing to salute the
 flag or sing the national anthem. The Witnesses'
 refusal to perform military service also led to jail
 sentences, as the Argentine conscription law has no
 conscientious objector provisions. On the other hand,
 while still unable to use their places of worship,
 the Witnesses were not subject to arrest when they
 held services in private homes, and they had unrestricted
 access to bibles and other material prepared by their
 organization abroad.
 Several human rights organizations, including activists
 and relatives of the disappeared and detained, continued
 to play a more open role in Argentine public life,
 as they have in the past. They seem to have been
 operating in an enhanced climate of security, reflecting
 the general improvement in respect for civil liberties
 in Argentina. They held press conferences, meetings
 and demonstrations, such as those held by the Mothers
 of the Plaza de Mayo, without incident. However,
 there were instances of harassment of these organizations,
 and individual members reported they were subjected
 to anonymous threats. Reports of harassment diminished
 in the latter part of the year.
 
 
 333
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Argentines are free to travel within the country,
 to take trips abroad and to emigrate. On two occasions,
 human rights activists experienced what appeared to
 be an unusually long delay in renewing their passports.
 However, they did obtain new travel documents, and
 other activists experienced no similar difficulties
 in traveling abroad. Two members of the Mothers of
 the Plaza de Mayo organization were stopped briefly
 at the airport when they returned from the United
 States, and some of their papers taken for inspection.
 Almost all were subsequently returned to them. Married
 women living in Argentina must have the permission
 of their husbands to travel abroad with their children
 if the husband is not accompanying them. The constitution
 permits PEN prisoners to choose self-exile. Exercise
 of this 'right of option* was denied by the military
 government until 1978 and subsequently was restricted
 through implementation of an extensive screening process
 for all applicants. Most applications were denied
 during 1981, even though the applicants had authorization
 to enter other countries. Of the cases approved by
 the United States government for its refugee program,
 14 persons, including family members, were allowed
 to travel to the United States.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Most elements of the political process remained legally
 suspended in 1981. The declared intention of the
 Argentine military remained the same: to return the
 country to civilian political rule under the constitution.
 No timetable for realizing this goal has been established.
 The government of President Galtieri has suggested
 that the political party law, under which the parties
 will reorganize themselves for eventual elections,
 would be promulgated about mid-1982; the law earlier
 had been expected in 1981. The parties were consulted
 on the content of that law, both formally through
 a "dialogue" conducted by the minister of interior
 and informally through continuing contacts between
 politicians and the government. The major parties,
 however, have called for rapid implementation of the
 old party law. In 1981 there was increased civilian
 participation in the national, provincial and municipal
 governments. Major trade unions remained subject
 to intervention, and military men are in some positions
 previously held by union officials. Strikes are prohibited,
 although this ban is frequently not enforced. In
 general, strikes protesting plant closings and the
 government's economic policy occurred with increasing
 frequency and nearly always were settled without violence.
 During periods of labor tension, union leaders as
 well as some rank-and-file strikers were detained,
 but most were quickly released by the executive or
 the courts.
 Progress towards implementation of the 1979 trade
 union organization law was slow. The law calls for
 the definitive dissolution of the old national labor
 confederation and other national-level (*tertiary")
 organizations, most of which were placed under direct
 government control in 1976. From the government's
 point of view, the new law is intended to introduce
 
 
 334
 more grassroots democracy and freedom of association
 than existed in the past. Labor leaders, on the other
 hand, see the law as emasculating union power, because
 it proscribes political activity and greatly restricts
 union control over social welfare funds.
 Although enjoying no official standing or recognition
 by the government, several labor groups are active
 in making their highly critical views of the government
 known, and they receive widespread media coverage.
 These include groups which claim to represent labor
 at the national level. Government officials, including
 the ministers of economy and labor, met with the
 representatives of several tertiary-level organizations
 to exchange views on the government's economic and
 labor policies. One of these groups sponsored a largely
 unsuccessful national strike in 1981.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 United Nations and Organization of American States
 bodies concerned with human rights have considered
 the situation in Argentina. During 1981 private human
 rights organizations have criticized the government
 for what they stated was a failure to implement detailed
 recommendations made by inter-governmental bodies,
 chiefly the Inter-American Human Rights Commission.
 Argentina took strong exception to the Commission's
 1980 report, arguing that the Commission infringed
 on the rights of a sovereign state and did not meet
 minimum standards of justice and objectivity. In
 1981 the United Nations Commission on Human Rights
 considered the Argentine situation under its confidential
 1503 procedures. A Commission working group on disappearances
 inquired into cases in Argentina and reported that
 the Argentine government disputed the group's methods
 of work.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 maintained an active program in Argentina, with government
 approval, on behalf of imprisoned persons. The ICRC
 reported that in the first half of 1981 its delegates
 visited persons either convicted or held at the disposal
 of the executive power in 18 places of detention.
 Most were held in four main prisons: Villa Devoto
 and the Caseros in Buenos Aires, and Rawson and La
 Plata in the provinces.
 Several non-governmental human rights organizations
 have expressed to the Argentine government their concerns
 about the human rights situation and have made recommenda-
 tions, including publication of information about
 disappeared persons and the release of prisoners detained
 without charge.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Argentina's population of 27.3 million enjoys a high
 standard of living. The population growth rate is
 1.6 percent, and population density is only ten per
 square kilometer; more than 80 percent of the population
 lives in urban areas. Availability of food, shelter,
 health and education are not affected by race, religion,
 sex or ethnic background. Per capita income was $2,440.
 
 
 335
 Recession and rising inflation in 1981 were reflected
 in: a rise in unemployment to about six percent of
 the work force -- very high for Argentina, which customarily
 enjoys close to full employment; an increase in under-
 employment; a drop in real wages for the first time
 in several years; and a rise in the percentage of the
 population below the poverty level, which nevertheless
 remained low by global standards. Life expectancy is
 70.2 years, and infant mortality is 58.9 per 1,000 live
 births. These statistics reflect the availability of
 affordable health care to most of the population through
 government, private and trade union programs and consumption
 of a nutritionally adequate, high protein diet (126
 percent of daily caloric requirements). Primary and
 secondary education is free and widely available. Approximately
 94 percent of the population is literate. The government
 of Argentina spends approximately ten percent of its
 central expenditures on education, three percent on
 public health and 4.5 percent on housing.
