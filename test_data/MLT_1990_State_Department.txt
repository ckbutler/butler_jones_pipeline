 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic and parliamentary
 democracy. Executive power is vested in a president who
 appoints as'prime minister the leader of the party which gains
 a plurality of seats in-the quinquennial elections for the
 unicameral legislature. The two major political parties
 reflect widely divergent political views. After 16 years of
 Labor Party rule, the election in 1987 brought the Nationalist
 Party to power with a one-seat majority in Parliament.
 Law enforcement and internal security are the responsibility
 of the Malta police under the command of a civilian
 commissioner. The Minister of the Interior (concurrently
 Minister of Education) has jurisdiction over the police. A
 specially trained riot police, the Special Assignments Group
 (SAG), forms part of the regular police force. Human rights,
 a subject included in the curriculum of the police academy,
 are generally respected by the police force.
 The Maltese economy is a mix of state-controlled and private
 firms. Malta is heavily dependent on tourism. Foreign
 private investment in export-oriented, light manufacturing
 industries is being actively promoted, and the Government is
 also developing Malta as a container transshipment point and a
 center for offshore business activities.
 Constitutional protection for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual is upheld by an independent
 judiciary. The Maltese Government is strongly committed to
 human rights. Women encounter a degree of culturally based
 inequality.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There have been no reports of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of political disappearance are known to have occurred.

 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punishment or
 treatment. These prohibitions are respected in practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is -provided for in
 the Constitution and is generally respected in practice. The

 person for questioning. Within 48 hours, persons so arxested
 must be brought before the court and charged or released.
 There is no right to legal counsel during this 48-hour period.
 Persons incarcerated pending trial have access to counsel, and
 periodic hearings are mandatory. Provision for bail exists.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution requires a fair public trial before an
 impartial court. Defendants have the right to counsel of
 their choice, at public expense if necessary. They enjoy a
 presumption of innocence, may confront witnesses and present
 evidence, and have the right of appeal. The courts'
 jurisdiction is limited in certain areas. Lay tribunals
 (e.g., the Industrial Tribunal, the Commissioners for Justice,
 and the Inheritance Partition Tribunal) have exclusive
 authority over certain judicial functions, although their
 independence is not legally guaranteed. Defendants in cases
 before the Industrial Tribunal or the Public Service
 Commission may not be represented by lawyers.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Protection of the privacy of the home is ensured in the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. Search
 warrants may be issued, on reasonable suspicion of crime, by
 police officers above the rank of inspector without a court
 order. Electronic surveillance is prohibited by law.
 Political party membership and participation is voluntary.
 However, there is strong societal (e.g., family, employment)
 pressure for affiliation with particular parties.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression (speech and press) is protected by the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. The only
 exception is the 1987 constitutional amendment which bans
 foreign participation in local politics (e.g., guest foreign
 speakers sponsored by a political party) during the period
 prior to an election.
 The broadcast media (radio and television) are state owned.
 Opposition viewpoints receive prominent coverage on a par with
 coverage provided to the Government, although both the
 governing and opposition political parties frequently complain
 of bias in news coverage. A constitutionally mandated
 Broadcasting Authority exists to ensure impartiality in
 broadcasting. In 1990 the Government awarded a contract for
 the installation of a cable television system to be completed
 by mid-1991. It also proposed issuing licenses for several
 additional radio channels to be operated by private
 organizations and individuals.
 Ten privately owned daily, weekly, and monthly newspapers
 freely express partisan views. Several newspapers are
 associated with political parties. Academic freedom generally
 is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of peaceful assembly is provided for in the
 Constitution. In 1990 police permits were routinely issued
 for political meetings and other public activities of
 political parties or groups of citizens.

 a. Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice the religion of one's choice is protected
 constitutionally and is respectea. The overwhelmingly dominant
 religion is Roman Catholicism; small numbers of people practice
 other religions, State subsidies are granted only to Catholic
 schools. In the state schools, students have the option at
 some stage to opt for religious instruction in the Catholic
 faith.
 "d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 foreign tr avel, or emigration. Returning Maltese emigrants
 who have acquired the citizenship of another country and
 resided abroad for a minimum of 6 years may hold dual
 citizenship. The law dbes not apply to children of emigrants
 born abroad; nor to women who left Malta to marry foreigners
 and obtained the citizenship of their husbands.,
 Foreign nationals claiming refugee status while visiting Malta
 generally are not permitted to remain in Malta but are allowed
 to stay until arrangements have been made for settlement in a
 third country. The Emigrants' Commission, established in 1987
 as the local representative of the'United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has worked well in
 providing assistance and counseling for refugees until they
 are accepted by the UNHCR%
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Malta is a parliamentary democracy in which the incumbent
 Nationalist Party and the opposition Malta Labor Party dominate
 public life.-- Political activity is often intense, and partisan
 feelings can be verypronounced, heated, and polarized.
 Elections in which all parties participate freely are held
 every 5 years, with universal suffrage for those 18 years of
 age and over. During the 1987 election, 96.11 percent of
 those registered actually voted.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups and persons'interested in
 promoting and protecting human rights operate freely. The
 Government places no restrictions on investigations by
 international-human rights groups. It is strongly committed
 to human rights and is active in international human rights
 forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language; or Social Status
 Maltese citizens have a legal right to housing, employment,
 and education on a nondiscriminatory basis. In conformance
 with its election campaign pledge to obtain redress for
 individual injustices perpetrated during the term of office of
 the previous government, the present Government established
 commissions to investigate alleged injustices with respect to
 the appointments of public officers, the granting of licenses,
 permits, and government contracts, and the provision of public
 services.

 MALTA
 For reasons derived from tradition and culture, Maltese society
 has only recently begun to associate women's rights with human
 rights. There are laws on equal opportunity and equal pay for
 equal work, but discrimination occurs.
 Married women lose entitlements and seniority personally
 acquired (retirement, health benefits, social security) upon
 marriage. Legally, the husband is head of the family unit
 with dominant responsibility for economic and financial
 questions, as well as all major decisions concerning children.
 Married women may own businesses and hold checking accounts
 only with the consent of their husbands. They must be
 represented by their husbands in business or financial
 litigation. This inequity has been challenged by women's
 organizations. The Government has responded by establishing
 the Commission for the Advancement of Women, which has been
 tasked with drafting a new family law aimed at eliminating the
 inferior status and discriminatory treatment of women, as well
 as advising the Government on how to promote equality of
 women. To monitor the implementation of its policy of
 equality, the Government created a Secretariat for the Equal'
 Status of Women under the direction of the Minister for Social
 Policy. It represents the Government's views in international
 organizations and is examining the implications of
 ratification by Malta of the U.N. Convention on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
 There are no laws specifically prohibiting abuse of women.
 Violence in the family and abuse against women and children
 have only recently been brought out in the open. According to
 women's groups, violence is more widespread than was previously
 believed. A church refuge for women, which also assists
 battered women, is partially supported by the Government.
 There is also a privately organized association engaged in
 counseling and assisting battered women. This association and
 the Commission for the Advancement of Women have been pressing
 for better police protection for abused women and specialized
 training for police to deal with family violence.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right, respected in practice, to associate
 freely and to strike. The only groups restrained from
 striking are the uniformed personnel of the armed forces and
 -the police. In 1990 there were 24 trade unions registered in
 Malta representing 54 percent of the work force. The General
 Workers Union (GWU) is the largest union. It has been
 institutionally tied to the Malta Labor Party since 1978.
 Union Haddiema Maghqudin (Union of United Workers), joined by
 three other smaller unions, forms the second largest union
 grouping under the umbrella of the Confederation of Maltese
 Trade Unions. These and other labor unions are independent of
 political parties, and the current Government encourages the
 development of free trade unions without party affiliation.
 Maltese unions belong to a variety of international trade
 union groupings, such as the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions, the World Confederation of Labor, and the
 European Trade Union Confederation.

 MALTA
 There were 20 strikes in the first 9 months of the year,
 ranginfg in duration from I hour to 40 days, most of them
 initiated by the GWU in connection with a general'wage
 increase mandated by the Governm~nt. The GWU position was
 that the wage increase was meant to be in addition to
 increases included in any recently negotiated collective
 bargaining agreements, but most employers did not agree with
 that view. Many employees, however, accepted a compromise
 agreement. One of the disputes, brought before the Industrial
 Tribunal for arbitration, was decided in favor of the
 employer, an international hotel chain. The GWU, however,
 continued'the strike on another issue, and the hotel closed
 its operations. At year's end the hotel was still closed.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act of 1976, the responsible
 minister may refer disputes to the Industrial Tribunal for
 binding settlement. The International Labor Organization
 objects to that provision, pointing out that it in effect
 limits the right to strike; however, both labor and employers
 appear to have no objection to the clause. In practice, a
 striking union can ignore an unfavorable decision by continuing
 the strike on another ground. The Government has initiated a
 study of the 1976 Act aimed at bringing it into conformity
 with European Community laws and improving certain provisions,
 such as those affecting job security.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free, in law and in practice, to organize and
 bargain collectively. While most wages are negotiated between
 unions and employers, in 1990 the Government mandated a
 substantial nationwide wage increase. The increase was made
 at the recommendation of the Labor Board, a board consisting
 of equal representation by labor, employers, and independent
 members.
 According to the Industrial Relations Act, an employer may not
 take action against any employee because he or she belongs to
 a trade union. Complaints may be addressed through a court of
 law or an industrial tribunal composed of one member each
 named by the employer, union, -and the Government. Complaints
 of discrimination may also be lodged with the Commission
 against Injustices.
 There are no export processing zones in Malta.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is constitutiona-lly prohibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children younger than 16 years may not legally be employed.
 The law is generally respected and the Department of Labor,
 which is responsible for enforcement, does so effectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage in Malta in 1990 was approximately $108
 per week. The minimum wage is generally enforced. Given
 government subsidies in housing, health care, and free
 education, the minimum wage provides a decent standard of
 living.

 MALTA
 Maximum hours of work are regulated by Wage Council orders for
 various trades. For most sectors, the maximum is 40 hours per
 week, but in some trades the maximum allowable is 43 or 45
 hours per week. Government labor regulations prescribe daily
 rest periods of 1 hour. Annual paid vacation according to law
 is currently 22 working days. In general, these laws and
 regulations are effectively enforced.
 Enforcement of occupational health and safety standards, the
 responsibility of the Department of Labor, has been lax. The
 .Government has proposed the establishment of an authority for
 workers' health, safety, and welfare that would be responsible
 for educating workers and enforcing occupational safety and
 health standards. Legislation to that effect was being
 debated in Parliament at year's end.
