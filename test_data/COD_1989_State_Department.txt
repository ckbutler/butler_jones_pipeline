 ZAIE
 In 1989 President Mobutu Sese Seko completed 24 years as
 President of Zaire, a huge, poor country with widely disparate
 ethnic, cultural, and linguistic groups, whose transition to
 independence in 1960 was marked by extensive civil strife. He
 is founder-president of Zaire's sole legal party, the Popular
 Movement of the Revolution (MPR). Legislative power is in
 principle vested in the'elected unicameral Legislative
 Council, but the President has the constitutional power to
 promulgate laws by decree, which he did on several occasions
 in 1989. The party doctrine is defined by the Constitution as
 "Mobutuism." All citizens are members of the MPR from birth.
 The Executive Council (Prime Minister and Council of
 Ministers), the Legislative Council, the judiciary, and the
 only legal labor union are all considered organs of the
 party. Legal political activity is limited to the party and
 its affiliates. The focal point of the party and the
 Government is the party's Central Committee (148 members)
 which meets semiannually
 An overlapping array of security organizations, notably the
 civilian National Documentation Agency (AND), the National
 Immigration Agency (ANI), the gendarmerie, the civil guard,
 and the armed forces (especially military intelligence--SARM)
 share responsibility for identifying and controlling potential
 internal and external threats. Their broad powers and uneven
 discipline'have resulted in arbitrary harassment, physical
 mistreatment, and unauthorized detention of ordinary citizens
 as well as political opponents of the Government. In May the
 Government placed four of the security services (AND, ANI,
 SARM, and the civil guard) under the authority of the State
 Commissioner for Territorial Security and gave that position
 to a highly respected general. Late in 1989, this official
 took preliminary steps toward implementing effective
 coordinating mechanisms which could enhance the discipline of
 these forces.
 Zaire has a~mixed economy involving an active private sector
 and an extensive but declining number of state enterprises.
 Major mining, transportation, and communication activities are
 still largely state owned. About 70 percent of the population
 is rural, engaged in subsistence agriculture using traditional
 methods of farming. Per capita income is approximately $180
 per year, among the world's lowest, and is declining further
 as population increases faster (3 percent per year) than
 economic growth (2"percent per year). Zaire's communications
 and transportation infrastructures are greatly eroded, making
 communication between the institutions of government in the
 capital and distant outlying regions increasingly difficult.
 Inflation reached high levels in 1988 and early 1989 due to
 government deficit spending. The implementation of new
 economic policies, aided by high copper prices, had brought
 inflation down from over 20 percent per month to about 3
 percent per month. In June 1989, Zaire launched a new
 International-Monetary Fund stabilization program. The first
 half year revieW by the World Bank and the Fund showed
 positive performance within their guidelines. Still, the
 economy remains vulnerable to changes in world market prices
 of its commodity exports; mining industry income is crucial,
 and the sharp 1989 drop in coffee earnings hurt the structural
 adjustment effort.
 Human rights in Zaire continued to be circumscribed in 1989 in
 such basic areas as freedom of speech, press, assembly, and
 integrity of the person. The Government continued to take
 
 
 414
 ZAIRE
 actions, including arrest and internal exile, to quash
 activities of members of the principal internal opposition
 group, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), who
 advocate the establishment of a second legal political party.
 In 1989 police and military personnel frequently abused their
 authority and arbitrarily arrested, detained, and extorted
 money from civilians. To demonstrate its concern over the
 problems of indiscipline and criminal activity within the
 police and military, the Government held separate, highly
 publicized trials in September, in which soldiers as well as
 civilians were convicted of violent crimes and condemned to
 death, a most unusual sentence in Zaire.
 Through the Judicial Council and the Department (Ministry) of
 Citizens' Rights and Liberties (DCRL), the Government
 continued in 1989 its efforts to prevent human rights abuses.
 The Judicial Council (a super-ministry of justice also charged
 with administration of the court and penal systems) continued
 successful efforts initiated in previous years to moderate
 prison conditions, regularize arrest authority and procedures,
 and hear public grievances. The stated mission of the DCRL,
 which is directed personally by the senior Vice Prime
 Minister, is to defend citizens' rights when all other legal
 recourse has been exhausted. It was able in 1989 to resolve a
 number of cases of a civil nature (titles to land and contract
 disputes) but has exhibited little capability for systemic
 redress of human rights abuses, and its role in the judicial
 process is increasingly unclear.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings
 There were no reported cases of politically-motivated killings
 in 1989. However, while quelling student-led disturbances in
 February, security officials killed a number of students (see
 Section 2.b.). Three officials subsequently were tried and
 convicted for using excessive force.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of disappearance of persons
 for political causes, but at year's end the whereabouts of
 Mangala Ngolu-Ndaki, a UDPS activist, were unknown. Mangala
 traveled with President Mobutu to the United States in
 October. He has not been seen by his family since the trip,
 but human rights observers believe he was being held
 incommunicado by the Government. There were unconfirmed
 reports that some students arrested after January-February
 demonstrations were flown to unknown destinations in the
 interior, and either imprisoned or released. The security
 services often hold detainees incommunicado for varying
 lengths of time. Observers sometimes hear of a person's
 disappearance, but less often of eventual reappearance. The
 number of those who may have disappeared, for political or
 other reasons, is unknown.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture and physical mistreatment of detainees are
 against the law and contrary to officially stated policy, in
 
 
 415
 Z IRE
 practice beatings and other physical mistreatment of prisoners
 and detainees continued during the year, some involving UDPS
 members held at high security prisons. Nonpolitical prisoners
 are also subject to abuse, and private citizens are often
 beaten and robbed by security officials. A 1989 ordinance
 issued by the President suggested that the Government intends
 to take legal action against members of the security services
 in instances of inhumane treatment or torture, which it has
 rarely done in the past. By year's end it was too early to
 tell how effectively the new measures would be implemented,
 particularly in cases involving abuse of political dissidents.
 Hunger and disease have been common in Zaire's prisons in past
 years. The Judicial Council continued to introduce measures
 to improve conditions in Zaire's prison and judicial systems,
 including the establishment of a special commission to
 supervise prison administration. In those prisons under the
 Council's jurisdiction, funding was increased to provide
 prisoners two meals a day, beds, blankets, and medical
 supplies. These measures, in addition to those taken earlier,
 have brought improvement in Kinshasa and in other major
 cities. Their effectiveness in outlying areas is less
 certain, and they have no effect on the military prison system
 where political detainees are likely to be held.
 The International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC) also has
 helped to improve conditions in civilian prisons by providing
 basic medical supplies and clothing. They funded the
 establishment of a dispensary at one prison. Throughout 1989,
 the ICRC was allowed access to most prisons. An exception was
 the prisons controlled by the Special Presidential Division
 (DPS).
 d. Arbitary Arrest, Detention, Exile or Forced Labor
 By law, those arrested by a judicial police officer must be
 brought before a magistrate within 48 hours for an initial
 hearing and determination of sufficient grounds for arrest.
 If this determination is positive, the magistrate can order
 bail or preventive detention for up to 15 days. The case must
 be brought up for review by a three-magistrate body within 5
 days of the defendant's preventive detention. If the decision
 is upheld, the case is ordered to trial when the investigation
 is completed. The law stipulates that these periods of
 detention may be extended only in exceptional cases. In
 practice, arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention without
 charges are common occurrences, affecting many people who come
 into contact with the criminal justice system. Suspects are
 often arrested and held for months without a hearing, often
 incommunicado. In an effort to reduce the frequency of these
 occurrences, Judicial Council personnel are in principle
 supposed to visit prisons and detention centers each night to
 take detainees before a magistrate within the required 48
 hours. Because of the lack of personnel and communications
 and transportation problems, it is not always able to achieve
 this objective.
 Police and military personnel continued to abuse their
 authority in 1989 and frequently harassed, arrested, and
 extorted money from civilians. The civil guard arrested a
 number of local and foreign businessmen on false charges or
 for questionable, albeit common, Zairian business practices.
 They were held in detention until bribes were paid.
 Persons with financial resources are known to buy their way
 out of detention without charges ever being filed. Moreover,
 
 
 416
 ZAIE
 a person with money or strong political ties is often freed
 before serving his sentence, regardless of the gravity of the
 crime committed. On the other hand, detainees and prisoners
 without financial means or political influence often remain in
 custody indefinitely without ever going to trial.
 The President of the Judicial Council pursued efforts to
 enforce a series of presidential ordinances enacted in 1988 to
 rein in corruption and abuses by police and security
 officers. These ordinances regulate arrest authority and
 procedures and cover all officials with arrest powers from
 police or security agencies. The Council has attempted to
 require all arresting officials to take an oath to uphold the
 law and to act solely within legal authority. After taking
 the oath, each is assigned a number and given a photographic
 identification card that must be presented when carrying out
 an arrest, search, or seizure. Citizens have the theoretical
 right to see the identification card. The ordinances specify
 the powers and duties of these officers, including limits-on
 arrest authority, and requirements to arraign detainees within
 48 hours. Thus far, the impact of these ordinances has been
 limited. Judicial police officers under direct Judicial
 Council control and the gendarmerie have taken the oath. The
 civil guard and ANI have not. The AND administrator general
 has notified the Judicial Council that AND officers, while not
 signing the oath, recognize the legal obligations contained in
 it.
 Most persons detained for political reasons are held by means
 of nonjudicial sanctions ranging from administrative detention
 and house arrest to internal exile and restriction of movement
 and travel. They are not formally charged or tried, remaining
 in detention or internal exile until the President or one of
 the security service officials chooses to release them.
 Although such arrests and detentions are not usually a matter
 of public record, the whereabouts of the more important
 detainees are usually known, although sometimes not
 acknowledged-by the Government.
 In recent years, the Government has engaged in actions (using
 both internal exile and prison detention) to both curb and
 co-opt the members of the primary banned internal opposition
 party, the UDPS, back into the MPR. Fifteen UDPS members were
 understood to have been arrested in January. The Government
 appeared especially sensitive to UDPS activity during and
 after the February student demonstrations. In August the U.S.
 Embassy gave the DCRL and Judicial Council a list of 10 UDPS
 members or associates believed arrested in July and still
 held. No response was received by the end of 1989 despite
 several follow-ups. The number of UDPS or other political
 detainees remaining in that status was unknown at the end of
 1989. In November, Amnesty -nternational (AI) estimated that
 there were about 100 UDPS dissidents being held in all. of
 Zaire.
 As in past-years, UDPS leader Tshisekedi wa Mulumba was kept
 under various degrees of arrest, house arrest, or surveillance
 during most of 1989. On July 7, for example, he was arrested
 while attempting to travel to his brother's consecration as a
 bishop in central Zaire. He was released on July 11, but has
 been under de facto house arrest since then, his access to
 visitors frequently has been denied.
 A delegation of the New York-based Lawyers, Committee on Human
 Rights visited Zaire at government invitation in August. The
 
 
 417
 ZAIY3E
 delegation visited a number of Zairian government officials
 and, though denied permission to see Tshisekedi, did talk to
 numerous other critics of the Government. During and after
 their visit, security forces arrested a half dozen of the
 dissidents with whom the delegation met. Four of those
 arrested have been released. One of them, Omene Samba
 Gauthier, has addressed a complaint about his treatment to the
 United Nations.
 A small number of opponents of the Government live in
 self-exile in Europe, including the former chief of staff,
 General Mukoba, who, according to Al's 1989 report was
 expelled from Kinshasa without a formal banishment order.
 There were no known cases of external.exile or expulsion of
 Zairians from the country in 1989. Political opponents in
 exile probably could return safely to.Zaire if they were
 prepared to keep their political views to themselves.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of.Fair Public Trial
 Zaire's highly centralized Government exercises control over
 the judiciary, principally through the Judicial Council. The
 -legal system is rooted in Belgian and customary law. The
 modern court system includes the Supreme Court, Courts of
 Appeal. in each region, and the Court of State Security.
 Defendants are entitled under the Constitution to a public
 trial and defense counsel. Counsel must be engaged (at public
 expense if necessary) in all trials before the Supreae Court
 and before lesser courts (including courts martial) in capital
 cases. Free legal aid may also be provided in other easts at
 the request of the court concerned.
 The availability of counsel is limited in many lesser civil
 and criminal cases by the poverty of the defendants and by the
 fact that there are less than 500 lawyers in all of-Zaire. A
 number of attorneys in Kinshasa, in conjunction with the bar
 of Kinshasa, provide pro bono defense, and two government-
 subsidized offices in Kinshasa were established in 1989 to
 provide legal advicd to the poor. When available, defense
 counsels generally function freely and without coercion. Most
 defendants who are aware of their rights avail themselves of
 the right to appeal. Decisions of the State Security Court
 involving national security, armed robbery, and smuggling are
 not subject to appeal; but all other procedural protections of
 the criminal code apply. While courts-martial generally try
 only cases involving military personnel, in time of emergency
 or during military operations the President can suspend
 civilian courts and transfer jurisdiction over all cases to
 them. In practice-many security-related cases never come.to
 trial.
 At the political level, all judges are members of the MPR and
 are subject to party discipline. Thus, while judges in fact
 perform their functions without political interference in the
 great majority of cases, in sensitive or highly politicized
 cases they operate under .implicit or explicit constraints from
 the executive or security forces. At the daily operational
 level, some magistrates and lawyers accept bribes, applying
 the full rigor of the law only to those who are unable to
 pay. The salary received by magistrates, as in the case of
 members of the security services, im so low as to foster this
 
 
 418
 ZAIRE
 corruption'. At the end of 1989, the Government raised
 magistrates' pay significantly in an effort to stem corruption.
 There is an ongoing effort by the--resident, the Judicial
 Council, and leaders of the legal profession to improve the
 judicial system, and extend its effectiveness beyond
 Kinshasa. In October President Mobutu signed a decree
 dismissing four judges of courts of first instance, a
 counselor of the court of appeals, and a public attorney, for
 refusing to work in the interior of the country as ordered.
 ,The Department  of Citizens' Rights and Liberties (DCRL),
 created in 1986 to redress citizens' rights when all other
 legal avenues had failed, began operation-in 1987. It has a
 centrar office.and district offices in all of Kinshasa's 24
 urban zones and has 32 offices throughout the rest of the
 country. During 1989 the DCRL Minister completed a series of
 highly publicized visits to these regional offices and
 personally participated in hearings of the grievances of
 individual citizens. DCRL representatives noted that lack of
 adequate transportation and other resources had hampered their
 effectiveness in outlying areas, and the Minister has sought
 financial support from Western donors with some success.
 The great majority of'cases handled dealt with such subjects
 as labor conflicts,-title to land, execution of judgments, and
 inheritance. Perhaps one-quarter to one-third concerned human
 rights abuses, such as arbitrary arrests, prolonged
 detentionsp illegal seizures, and abuses by security forces,
 but few results have been achieved to date in such cases. In
 September President Mobutu issued two ordinances, one
 authorizing-the DCRL to bring civil suits against security
 services or their representatives on behalf of alleged torture
 victims, and a second forbidding the Supreme Court from
 considering appeals of DCRL decisions. The second ordinance,
 while apparently designed to strengthen the DCRL's power to
 redress individual grievances, also.circumscribed the Supreme
 Court's power of judicial review, with uncertain consequences
 for the operation of the Zairian judiciary.
 f. Arbitrary-Interference-with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 All Zairians automatically become members of the MPR at
 birth. Party and state security organizations extend down to
 the neighborhood level, and they maintain liaison offices in
 all government agencies (including military units,
 universities, the legislative council, and ministries). Party
 officials, civil servants,.armed forces personnel,
 parliamentarians,: and employees of state enterprises are taxed
 to support-the-activities of the party's major-organs (cadre
 training, mobilization, propaganda, women's affairs, and
 youth). These party cadres are required to attend the party's
 training institute. Absence can result in reprimands and
 suspensions. Government employees, market vendors, and
 blue-coll r workers are often required to participate in
 public events--parades, official arrival and departure
 ceremonies, etc.--or risk losing their jobs. In line with the
 party-state's ideology of Zairian authenticity, Zairian men
 are forbidden to wear ties. Zairians also are forbidden in
 principle to use non-African names, although this provision is
 not normally enforced.
 Except in cases of threats to national security, the law
 requires the police to have a judicial warrant before they can
 
 
 419
 ZAIRE-
 search a home. In practice, police and security authorities
 often enter and search homes without such warrants. Zairians
 widely believe that the security services sporadically open
 mail and tap telephone conversations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties,-Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While the Constitution provides for the right of all citizens
 to express their opinions and feelings freely, it subordinates
 that and all other rights to the need to ensure "publlc order
 and good conduct." Since Zairians are automatically members
 of the sole political party (MPR), the ideology of the MPR is
 the only legally acceptable political thought. The MPR
 ideology comprises the views and policies of the party's
 chairman and founder, President Mobutu Sese Seko, but is not
 necessarily defined in great detail.
 The Government continued to make arrests in 1989 for
 possessing or distributing political literature or documents
 that it found objectionable, including those outlawed undera
 Zairian law foxbidding the distribution of "pamphlets of a
 foreign origin or inspiration and of such a nature as to
 damage the national interest" (see Section l.d.).
 Radio and television are owned and operated by the State. The
 major newspapers are.privately owned but depend upon
 significant government subsidies for survival. In addition,
 they receive most of their news from the Zairian National
 Press Agency (AZAP), a state organization. The media are
 expected to promote the ideals and principles of the party and
 praise its leadership. Generally, publishers and editors are
 active party members. Commentary on domestic or foreign
 issues which the Government considers.sensitive generally is
 discouraged, and direct criticism of the President is
 forbidden. While journalists are circumspect in their
 criticism of other high officials as well, criticism of
 incompetent officials or inadequate government services and
 -corruption frequently appears in print.
 Media censorship tends to be self-imposed. Zairian
 journalists mudt be members of the press union in order to
 practice their profession. The threat of ouster from the
 union and consequent loss of livelihood are strong inducements
 toward'self-censorship. In some instances involving national
 interests, reporting is directed by the Government. For
 'instance, the Department of Information. at one-point
 circulated a memorandum directing the media not to
 editorialize on Zaire's political and economic differences
 with Belgium. In March Makoko. Musheni was dismissed from the
 government-owned Radio and Television Agency for quoting a
 Jeune Afrique article on Zaire's difficulties with Belgium.
 Kafuka Rujamizi was dismissed from the Agency for reporting on
 the evolution of fuel and transport costs. Both men and
 another-journalist fired for critical reporting, Mikiti Kombi,
 have been rehired, but none is currently in a broadcasting
 position.
 The Government also uses other techniques to control the
 media, including detention. In early 1989, Lumpungu Kanyinda,
 the editor of a regional paper, was arrested, though criminal
 charges against him later were dropped in favor of a civil
 suit. No closings of newspapers were reported in 1989. There
 are sevaral clandestine presses that operate sporadically,
 
 
 426
 ZAIRE
 printin4lye~s  and handbills' critical of the Government and
 various"Zairian.leadeis.
 Foreign journalists wishing to visit'Zaire must receive prior
 permission from the Departigent of Information. Artistic and
 academic freedom of e pression 're subject to the same  '
 restrictions and self-censorship as the press. Mandatory
 membership in professional organlzations an' well-developed
 informer networks serve to discourage dissent. Some books are
 prohibited,aed films,- newspapers, and magazines are subject
 to barnig.*'Imporfed pu6licati6ns, including books and
 periodiilas, �afe subject *o censorship if they criticize 2aire
 or its Gidvexnment, although articles criticizing aspects of
 the Goverrnment's economic policy have circulated uncensored.
 b. Fteedom of Peaceful Assem.ly and Association
 Groups other than the party and its affiliates ma! hold public
 meetings only with government authorization. The Government
 permits the existence of nonpolitical associationsk but in
 principle'tfheyrmust notify authorities whed they plan meetings
 or activities iivolving-more than 5 people.  In practice'this
 is rarely eriforce . Meetings of nonofficial organizations
 have been disrupted by g6vernmenA ageniF because of suspected
 political activities. UDPB leader Tshisekedi, in a"Ietter to
 the Commissioner of State for National Defense and Territorial
 Securify, complained that at 10: p.r. on January 17 military
 intelligence had arretted'nine persons at a reception'whichhe
 had just ddparted."
 In February student.demonstrations in Kinshasa, which had
 begun wlth comptaints over transportation, and Lubumbashi took
 on a moie4 political tone.- After the students resorted to
 violence, including stoning and burning cars and buses, the
 Government responded with a omassive .deployment of security
 forces. Some uni1s reportedly fired on demonstrating
 students. Repofts' of the number killed ranged from 2 to Over
 20, with scores of students injured, but these figures could
 not be confirmed: -The GoVdrnment itself criticized the
 excessive security force reaction against the student
 demonstrations inLubumbashi. On April 24, the press reported
 that two army officers and a noncommissioned "officer had been
 convicted (a major for "allowing troops under his command to
 open fire on students," and a corporal for "murder") for their
 roles in iutting down the-Lubumbashi demonstrations. It was
 unknown if the sentences had been carried out by the end of.
 1989.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor uniost, "dee section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is recognized in the Constitution, the
 Government officiallY sanctions most major world religions,
 and religfous practice is generally free. Zaire's population
 is overwhelmingly Christian, though indigenous beliefs and
 religious traditions exert a major influence. Catholics make
 up 50 percent of the population, and Protestants, including
 the local Kimbanguist Church, 36 percent. Five percent of
 Zairians are Muslims. Officially recognized religions are
 free to establish places of worship and to train clergy. Most
 churches maintain active links with coreligionists outside the
 country; and expatriate missionaries are allowed to"
 proselytize and to serve both Zairian and expatriate
 
 
 421
 ZAIRE
 congregations. Affiliation with a recognized religion confers
 neither advantage nor disadvantage with respect to secular
 status.
 Despite the general freedom of religion, the party-state
 ideology on occasion has been interpreted as requiring the
 individual to place loyalty to the State ahead of religion.
 In 1989 President Mobutu canceled'church services one Sunday
 to assure attendance at a political event. New churches are
 required to bbtain government recognition to operate freely,
 and that recognition has been difficult for less well-known
 churches to obtain. Adherents to sects not officially
 recognized by the Government can find themselves at the mercy
 of local officials.
 Traditional African religious groups are allowed to practice
 their beliefs, but are not officially recognized. The
 Jehovah's Witnesses and a number of other religious groups and
 sects, banned in 1986 on charges of fraud or subversive
 activities, remained banned in 1989. These groups are
 considered antigovernment because of their refusal to
 recognize national symbols, such as-the flag and the national
 anthem, or to participate in political ceremonies.
 A government report issued in April 1988 ihdibated that 357
 sects and churches were operating illegally in.Zaire. The
 Government ordered them closed until.such time"as the
 authorities give them permission to function. The report
 noted that the Constitution recognized the rights of Teligious
 associations as long as their activities were pot.contrary to
 the law or public order. A year later, in July 1989, the
 Kinshasa municipal government ordered closure of *over 400
 religious groups," according -to press reports4:

 In 1989 there were estimates of 50,000 oficiafly reqi.skted
 Zairians living as displaced persons or refugees in
 neighboring countries. In 1989 Zaire sighed an-agreement with
 Angola providing for the return of up. to 5,000 refugees, and a
 majority had returned by year's end. A small number of
 political refugees also reside in the Congo and Tanzania.
 There are continuing reports in the east of-refugees fleeing
 for Uganda, in one case after the killing of a Zairian soldier
 and subsequent reprisals against local villagers. It is
 
 
 ZAIRE
 likely .that many Zairian displaced persons could return to
 Zaire if they wished.
 By mid-1988, Zaire was providing Safe haven to approximately
 345,000 refugees, of whom 314,000 are Angolans. Refugees
 generally are allowed to pass.freely into. Zaire, but upon
 entry theyare first processed by military and state security-
 officials , Refugees are sometimes detained or closely
 monitored on suspicion of illegal political activity. The
 Government pro.vides land for resettlement and camps. Outside
 agencies,.;specially the United Nations High Commidsioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR).,- provide food, housing, transportation, and
 medical..care.  -
 Forced'repatriation is contrary to official government policy
 and rarely occurs, but there was at least one such case in
 1989.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Goyernment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government
 throughdemocratic means. Political power in Zaire is highly
 centralized and controlled by the President, who, while
 normally consulting widely, makes all important decisions;
 Policies are executed by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, both
 appointed by the President. Advocacy of a multiparty system
 or opposition to the party-state are contrary to the
 Constitution and laws, as are actions that question the
 authority of the President and the political system.
 Suffrage is universal beginning at age 18, and voting is
 mandatory, enforced in theory by penalties including fines or
 arrest. The national Parliament, municipal councils, and
 rural and urban zone councils are chosen by direct popular
 elections that also take place every 5 years. All candidates
 are carefully screened by party committees at the appropriate
 level, but" voters generally have a choice among several
 candidates. In the 1987 parliamentary elections; over half of
 the incumbents  ere defeated. President Mobutu was reelected
 unopposed in 1984 to a third 7-year term in office.
 Countrywide local elections--annulled in 1987 because of
 government charges of fraud and postponed twice since February
 1988--were held in late May. Just before the scheduled vote,
 President Mobutu ordered postponement of elections in north
 and south Kivu because of growing ethnic tensions over voter
 eligibility. The Zairian press reported only a few incidents
 of voting irregularities or fraud. Many voting places lacked
 voting booths, forcing voters to drop their ballots in urns
 with the candidate's name on it in front of local officials.
 Some estimates put voter turnout at considerably lower than 50
 percent.
 Since 1980 members of the UDPS (see Section l.d.) have been
 involved fn efforts to establish a second political party.
 Their efforts have been rebuffed both by the official party
 and by the President, and UDPS leaders have suffered arrest
 and detention at various times over the past 7 years. The
 UDPS leaders released from internal exile in June 1987 have
 taken two different routes: some UDPS activists have accepted
 government positions; others remain outside the MPR and were
 arrested and detained on several occasions in 1989.

 .Section 4 Govrrxnental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights "
 The Guvernment's attitude toward external investigations has
 been inconsistent, as with the 1989 visits from the Lawyers'
 Committee on Human Rights (see Section l.d.). The ICRC has
 been allowed to maintain a permanent office in-Zaire since
 1978, although at times its access to prisons has been
 restricted. Al asked the DCRL about numerous detainees in
 1989 and received responses to some of its queries. A
 delegation from AI visited Zaire in November. There are no
 independent human rights monitoring organization in Zaire.
 The Government maintains that Zaire's human rights practices
 meet international standards and denies charges of systematic
 and serious violations. It participated in the 43rd, 44th,
 and 45th sessions of the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC),
 and Zaire's representative, the Minister of Citizens' Rights
 and Liberties, cgain defended his Government's concern for
 human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Home to several hundred disparate ethnic groups, most with
 their own'tribal languages, Zaire has a population of over 33
 million. The Government has sought to defuse disputes based
 on linguistic or ethnic differences by adopting French as the
 official language of government and education.
 Though many residents of the President's home region of
 Equateur, and especially of the President's own Ngbandi tribe,
 occupy high positions, the Government strives to counter
 ethnic divisions by recruiting ministers and other high
 government officials from all regions and major ethnic
 groups. There are no significant ethnic or racial groups that
 have suffered official discrimination in the past 10 years.
 Custom, tradition, and existing law constrain women from
 attaining social equality. Women generally hold lower
 positions and earn less than men in the same jobs. However,
 women's rights to own property and participate in the
 political and economic sectors are protected by law, including
 the 1987 family code. This code expressly provides for women
 to inherit their husband's estates and strengthens their right
 to manage personal property and their right to a property
 settlement upon divorce. Nonetheless, it retains provisions
 requiring a married woman to obey her husband and obtain his
 permission for all legal transactions (to open a bank account,
 accept a job, obtain a passport, rent or sell real estate,
 etc.) The party's office of women's affairs promotes greater
 participation by women in the nation's economic, social, and
 political life and has worked with other organizations to
 publicize the provisions of the family code. A growing number
 of women work in the professions, the universities, and
 gbvernment service, but few are in senior, policymaking
 positions.
 Reliable information is not available on violence against
 women, including wife beating. The police do not normally
 intervene in domestic disputes, and few cases come before the
 courts. Violence against women is not a topic of public
 discussion, and therefore not seen-as a major social problem.
 Neither the Government nor women's groups have addressed this
 issue.

 Women, like men, often suffer from the indiscipline of the
 security forces, and there are unconfirmable charges from the
 villages of rape by locally based soldiers. Female
 circumcision is not generally practiced in Zaire, though
 unconfirmed reports suggest it may exist in scattered remote
 areas of northern Zaire.
 Section 6 Wor.er Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The labor movement in Zaire is limited by law to one national
 union, the National Union of Zairian Workers (UNTZa),. which is-
 an integral unit of the sole political party. The Secretary
 Genera7 of.UNTZa is a member of the party's Central Committee,
 and union officials at the regional level serve on regional
 party committees.
 Membership.-in UNTZa is compulsory for civil servants,
 employees of state enterprises, and employees of private firms
 with at least 20 employees. The union claims about l, million
 workers as dues-paying members, for whom there is a check off
 system. The overwhelming majority of the work force is
 self-employed, either in the unofficial sector or in
 subsistence agriculture.
 UNTZa participates actively in the Organization of'African
 Trade Union Unity and maintains ties with a number of foreign
 labor confederations.
 The right to strike is included in the labor law, but because
 the law establ'ishes lengthy and mandatory arbitration and
 appeal procedures which result in the resolution of most labor
 disputes, in practice lawful strikes do not occur. Workers,
 nevertheless, conduct frequent unauthorized strikes against
 employers. In these circumstances, UNTZa is called in to
 attempt to resolve the dispute, though in some instances
 employers and workers have reached a settlement without
 UNTZals participation.
 b. Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While UNTZa has the right to bargain collectively with
 employers, as part of Zaire's party-state structure, it is
 unable to protect worker interests or defend worker rights
 that run counter to government policies. It provides social
 and educational services to members and their families and is
 charged with implementing government programs to improve
 worker benefits.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of
 Experts (COE) has noted the Government's assurances that, as
 part of the revision of the labor code, measures are to be
 taken to'strengthen the provisions protecting workers against
 acts of antiunion discrimination by imposing fines on
 employers dommitting such acts.
 Workers are uniformly covered by labor legislation throughout
 the country, including in the proposed new export processing
 zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution and labor code forbid forced labor. The sole
 political party in the past organized a labor supply for

 ZAIYE
 public works projects by strongly encouraging neighborhood or
 community participation once a week. This practice of
 "salongo" has now been generally abandoned, but is still at
 least sporadically implemented in some limited areas of the
 countryside.
 Zairian legislation providing for compulsory civilian service
 for graduates from.pedagogical and technical institutes was
 ,repealed in March 1987.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of-Children
 The legislatedminimum age;for employment is 18, although
 those between ages 14 and 18 can legally engage in "light
 work" if a parent or guardian consents. Dud to high levels of
 unemployment, many children.under 14 years of age work in the
 informal economic'sector, especially in subsistence
 agriculture, to supplement family income. Minimum wage,
 safety, and health standards are not observed for them.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.
 Workers are entitled to a minimum daily wage (currently less
 than 50 cents), paid holidays, and vacation!; they'receive at
 "least 1 rest. day per week; fringe benefits usually include a
 housing allowance, medical care, uniforms, transportation, and
 a midday meal. Working hours are'llmited to 48 hours a week.
 Workplaces are legally required to meet minimum-safety and
 health standards. Most-workers in the organized wage sector
 know their rights, and the UNTZa is charged with monitoring
 employer compliance with labor laws. This covers only the
 roughly 1 million organized workers out of !a potential work,
 force of 17 million. The majority of the population is
 engaged in subsistence agriculture and small-scale commerce
 outside the formal sector.
 In recent years income in the modern economy has not kept up
 with inflation, and the minimum wage does not provide a decent
 living fo workers and their families. As a result, in the
 private sector, fringe benefits, which are not subject to
 income tax, often constitute more than half the total wage
 package. With these benefits, workers are able to maintain a
 .modest standard of living. In the spring, the Government
 committed itself to a 20 percent salary increase for
 government employees, and as of October workers had begun to
 receive their raises. Public sector remuneration remains low,
 however, and workers are often driven to corruption or to take
 second jobs in the private sector.
