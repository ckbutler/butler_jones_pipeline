 MEXICO
 Mexico is a constitutional federal republic with powers
 divided among independent executive, legislative and
 judicial branches of government. In practice, the
 legislative and judicial branches of the federal govern-
 ment as well as state governments tend to follow the
 leadership of the President. Since the close of the
 1910 Revolution, Mexico has experienced political
 stability. The Institutional Revolutionary Party
 (PRI), while dominating the political scene since
 1929, offers scope for considerable participation and
 internal debate. A new electoral reform has increased
 the number of opposition parties and guaranteed the
 opposition at least 25 percent of the Chamber of Deputies.
 Representatives of the new parties are now contributing
 to the debate on Mexico's economic and social development
 within the Congress. For several decades Mexico as a
 whole has enjoyed rapid economic and social development,
 but not everyone has shared equally in this development.
 Following a period of slower growth in 1976-77, Mexico
 has now resumed its traditional high level of economic
 growth led by the rapid development of the energy
 sector.
 Mexico's constitution, laws and political discourse
 consistently affirm or reflect social justice and
 equality as basic ideals of the Revolution. Individual
 rights, guaranteed by the Constitution, are generally
 respected in practice, although the number of accusations
 of individual hunian rights abuses, connected with
 anti-terrorism or restraint of political opposition,
 is substantial. The Administration of President Lopez
 Portillo has begun to address the problem of human
 rights abuses, primarily through an amnesty program
 and a public accounting for disappeared persons.
 Mexico has a good human rights record in international
 affairs, having traditionally supported the persecuted
 of other countries and participated actively in multilat-
 eral approaches to human rights issues.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Mistreatment sometimes occurs in the period immediately
 following arrest, especially during interrogation.
 Credible press reports and public testimony indicate
 that suspected terrorists and sometimes their families
 are more likely to be subjected to severe forms of
 
 (859)
 
 
 360
 interrogation, including physical abuse, than are
 others detained. Reports from U.S. citizens indicate
 that suspected narcotics traffickers are sometimes
 physically abused by the Federal Judicial Police during
 interrogation. According to both first and secondhand
 reports received by American consular officers, mistreat-
 ment usually takes the form of beating, electric shocks,
 carbonated water forced up the nostrils, or submersion
 in water. The 1978 Amnesty International report said
 that human rights violations occurred most frequently
 in connection with student or labor unrest, land tenure
 disputes, the anti-drugs campaign and left-wing querrilla
 activity.
 Police officers who obtain evidence or a confession
 from a suspected lawbreaker by unconstitutional means
 have, in some cases, been prosecuted as the law provides.
 The courts have the option of rejecting confessions
 or evidence obtained illegally, or of admitting them
 if substantiated by corroborating evidence.
 Government policy condemns the use of torture. Physical
 abuse during arrest or confinement is prohibited by
 the Constitution.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Conditions in many Mexican jails include overcrowding,
 primitive sanitary facilities and inadequate diet.
 In recent years the Government has remodeled or replaced
 some substandard facilities. Prisoners are allowed
 to purchase food and are provided access to medical
 care. Family visitation, including conjugal visits,
 is possible, although visiting privileges may be restricted.
 The most publicized incidents of mistreatment involved
 the September deaths of three escaped bank robbers
 in Merida, Yucatan, following their recapture by police.
 The official report that they died from wounds received
 during a shootout is challenged by press photos that
 show the prisoners walking unarmed with a police escort
 after the incident occurred. The Governor of Yucatan
 refused to order an investigation after requests by
 local attorneys, businessmen, and newspapers. However,
 to mollify the pbblic, prison officials and guards
 were fired on the grounds that prisoners had been beaten
 and robbed. The incident was fully covered in the
 Diario de Yucatan and the national weekly Proceso.
 Other similar events are occasionally reported.
 U.S. consulates have received reports that foreign
 women tourists were jailed on questionable charges
 
 
 361
 and subjected to extortion and sexual advances by
 police or prison guards. In some localities efforts
 have been made to prevent such mistreatment to avoid
 a negative impact on tourism. American prisoners
 are often reluctant to protest mistreatment for fear
 of reprisals. U.S. consulate reports indicate that
 Mexican-Americans are more likely to be mistreated
 by Mexican police if they are unable to readily prove
 their U.S. citizenship.
 In 1977 the United States and Mexico concluded a prisoner
 transfer treaty which provides for mutual repatriation
 beginning December 9, 1977. By December 1979, 442
 Americans and 211 Mexicans had been transferred to
 their own countries.
 According to Embassy and consulate reports, the number
 of U.S. citizens in Mexico who were arrested and jailed
 more than 24 hours from July 1978 to June 1979 increased
 by approximately 162, to 554, from the preceding year,
 while alleged and confirmed cases of mistreatment
 declined slightly. There were 85 alleged cases of
 mistreatment as well as 13 confirmed cases during
 the 1978-79 period. The great majority of alleged
 and confirmed instances of mistreatment of U.S. citizen
 prisoners occurred during arrest and interrogation
 (88 percent). Confirmed types of mistreatment of
 U.S. citizen prisoners included beatings, electric
 shocks, psychological torture, and the refusal to
 notify an American consul of the arrest.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Mexican citizens are guaranteed the right of amparo,
 a constitutional protection providing relief against
 "coercive and abusive acts of authority." Amparo
 is similar but not identical to the right of habeus
 corpus. There are credible charges by human rights
 groups, opposition political parties, and the press
 that arrest without warrant, incommunicado detention,
 and police mistreatment occur. These charges are
 most often made in cases of arrests for politically
 motivated crimes. The Defense Committee for Political
 Prisoners, Disappeared Persons and Exiles (DCPPDPE),
 a Mexican organization, has asserted that during the
 past decade, over 470 people have disappeared while
 in the hands of security forces, or have been detained
 incommunicado. The Government on several occasions
 has denied the existence of secret prisons or that
 disappearances have occurred for political reasons.
 The Government has also consistently denied reports
 that it holds political prisoners, claiming that persons
 were detained for the commission of common crimes
 for political purposes.
 
 
 President Lopez Portillo, in his 1979 State of the
 Nation address, commented on the results of the amnesty
 law enacted in September 1978. He noted that during
 the first four stages of the amnesty, 620 persons
 benefitted from the terms of the law, while 939 persons,
 including 832 campesinos, benefitted from the amnesty
 through the August 21, 1979 release. Thus, 1,539
 persons benefitted from the amnesty through September
 1979. Human rights groups and opposition political
 parties have not been satisfied with the extent of
 the amnesty and have called for a general amnesty.
 The head of DCPPDPE points out that none of the persons
 listed as disappeared by the organization has been
 among those amnestied.
 The Constitution prohibits the detention of a person
 for more than three days without a formal charge and
 prohibits the mistreatment of a detained person.
 It also requires the legal reprimand of officials
 who mistreat prisoners. Legal procedures permit the
 detention of individuals whom the authorities have
 reason to suspect of planning a crime. In general,
 cases of arbitrary arrest are difficult to document
 because victims of mistreatment are reluctant to discuss
 the incidents. It was noteworthy when a Mexican woman
 gave a press statement in August 1979, detailing the
 arrest and torture of herself and members of her family.
 She alleged that agents from the "White Brigade" (a
 clandestine military-civilian security task force)
 took her and her family to the local police station
 and later to two military camps where they were subjected
 to physical and mental abuse. She claimed that she
 saw various people in one military camp who had been
 listed as having disappeared by human rights groups.
 She was released in July 1979, but her husband remains
 in a military camp.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are the norm, but there are exceptions.
 The Mexican legal system, founded on Roman civil law,
 does not grant to the accused the same kind of procedures
 common to the Anglo-American system; even those rights
 provided are not always observed, especially during
 prearraignment interrogation. Mexican law requires
 that trials of prisoners be completed within 12 months
 of arrest. However, this requirement is not always
 followed, as the Embassy has noted in the handling
 of cases involving Americans arrested on drug charges.
 According to Embassy records, as of October 1, 1q79
 there were 15 U.S. citizen prisoners in Mexico who
 had been held at least 12 months and whose trials
 had not been finally decided by a judge. The most
 
 
 363
 frequent causes are (1) delaying tactics by codefendants
 when more than one person is charged and (2) cumbersome
 procedures, administrative inefficiency, and insufficient
 numbers of judges and public defenders.
 A 1978 International League for Human Rights (ILHR)
 mission concluded that many of the alleged political
 prisoners interviewed were effectively denied a fair
 trial and due process of law. On the other hand,
 the ILHR investigators made special note of the freedom
 given defense attorneys under the Mexican judicial
 system. Adequate defense counsel is available to
 those that can afford it. There is a limited public
 defender system. Courts reportedly can be influenced
 by executive branch considerations, but are free of
 military intervention as such in the disposition of
 cases.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home without warrant is prohibited
 by the Constitution. This legal safeguard is generally
 effective. When in "hot pursuit" the police will
 make otherwise unauthorized entry into homes in order
 to apprehend suspects.
 2.     Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education:
 The Lopez Portillo Administration has identified inflation
 as its most pressing concern. In his 1979 State of
 the Nation address, the President said that inflation
 concentrates wealth and creates social tensions. In
 addressing the problem the administration has chosen
 to increase supply rather than to reduce aggregate
 demand. Another major economic problem is unequal
 income distribution. According to a recent government
 survey, in 1977 the upper 10 percent of the population
 received 37.99 percent of national income while the
 lower 20 percent received but 1.74 percent. Compared
 with earlier surveys the 1977 data indicate in general
 that income distribution is becoming more unequal.
 Property is privately owned and the rights of owners
 are reasonably well protected. However, squatters
 frequently occupy urban and rural land, sometimes
 infringing on the property rights of private owners.
 As inheritors of the Mexican revolution, squatters
 often receive title to or legal use of the land they
 occupy. The government has announced that redistribution
 of land, in fulfillment of commitments extending back
 to the 1910 Revolution and as required by land reform
 
 
 legislation, will have been completed in 10 states
 by the end of 1979.
 Faced with critical problems stemming from Mexico's
 growth in population, the President has made the reduction
 of population growth to 2.5 percent per annum by 1q82
 a goal of his administration. A campaign to this
 end is showing considerable success in declining birth
 rates.
 The impact of Mexico's population growth on its develop-
 ment efforts can be seen in the field of education.
 An additional two million children are estimated to
 have entered the primary school system in the past
 eighteen months. The Secretary of Education noted
 that there are 20.5 million students in Mexico this
 year, equivalent to Mexico's entire 1940 population,
 but that there were still 700,000 students who could
 not be admitted for lack of space. Public education
 accounts for 15 percent of the 1980 federal budget
 and the Secretary of Public Education has stated his
 belief that practically all students can be accommodated
 by September 1980. Mexico's literacy rate is approximate-
 ly 75 percent.
 Mexico's social security and medical assistance programs
 reach only about 50 percent of the population, primarily
 in urban areas.
 The President mentioned the impact of corruption on
 Mexico's development and his dedication to combat
 it, in his 1979 State of the Nation address. The
 federal Attorney General told the press in September
 1979 that his office has prosecuted 759 officials
 and recovered over 35 million dollars.
 3.     Respect for Civil and Political Liberties
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Freedom of speech and the press are guaranteed by the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. The
 Government exercises significant indirect influence
 over the media through its monopoly of newsprint and
 its ability to direct government advertising. The
 media customarily avoid direct criticism of an incumbent
 President, but otherwise participate in a robust national
 debate. The local press in Baja California Norte and
 the Yucatan freely attack state government officials,
 while that in Jalisco appears to exercise greater
 restraint. When the ex-Mayor of Zapopan, Jalisco,
 
 
 365
 was removed from office on charges of corruption and
 later found dead under questionable circumstances,
 the local press provided only minimal coverage.
 A wide range of ideas is found in the media and intellec-
 tual circles. The Government censors movies on moral
 grounds and controls broadcast of television programs
 on a similar basis. Cable TV transmission of U.S.
 programs began in November 1979 to include previously
 excluded network and local Texas news programs. The
 free broadcast of U.S. radio news programs is allowed.
 Freedom of religious belief is a constitutional guarantee,
 and there are no restrictions on religious practice.
 There are restrictions on church ownership of property,
 and the clergy are denied participation in politics
 by the Constitution. The Constitution also prohibits
 religious groups from involving themselves in pre-
 university education. However, this restriction is
 not closely followed.
 Assemblies without march or demonstration are permitted
 without permission from governmental authority. Demonstra-
 tions and marches require permits, which normally
 are granted.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreiqn
 Travel and Emigration
 Citizens may travel anywhere and emigrate freely,
 as guaranteed by the Constitution. Foreigners must
 register with federal authorities and must obtain the
 proper visa, but are otherwise free to travel into
 and out of Mexico. One human rights concern of the
 Mexican Government is the, smuggling of Mexicans or
 third-country nationals out of the country and into
 the United States, which it attempts to curtail.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Mexican political system is dominated by one party:
 the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Within
 the PRI and the Government, however, there is give
 and take, wide ideological variation and serious concern
 for the economic and social needs of the country.
 The Electoral Reform Act of 1977 has resulted in the
 registration of three new political parties and the
 July 1 election of their representatives to Congress.
 The Mexican Communist Party is now able to participate
 openly in the political process after being banned
 from elections for over 30 years. The July elections
 were relatively free of the fraud that has accompanied
 
 
 366
 earlier elections. The Electoral College did nullify
 the election of five PRI candidates for fraud. Individual
 citizens are free to join the PRI or the minority
 parties and to participate in their activities. Every
 citizen over 18 years of age has the right to vote.
 Men and women are equal before the law, and women
 participate freely in the political process. The
 participation of women in politics has been encouraged.
 Three of the 64 senators are female. In the July 1
 election the first woman governor was elected. In
 addition, 29 of the 400 federal deputies elected to
 Congress were women. Several women also serve in
 sub-cabinet positions in the executive branch of the
 government. Cultural constraints on women still exist,
 but women who are skilled, experienced, or well educated
 have a fair chance in the job market. A 1979 government
 report indicates that 27 percent of the 1976-77 university
 population were females. Women account for about
 20 percent of the labor force.
 Labor rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 government, and are respected in practice. These
 include the right to strike, if legally authorized,
 and freedom of association. The few strikes that
 occur are generally settled within 10-15 days by applica-
 tion of subtle government and party pressures. If
 a union has complied with all of the provisions required
 by law, the government seldom refuses to grant legal
 authorization for a strike. There are occasional
 illegal strikes conducted both by legal and unauthorized
 unions. On occasion the state or federal authorities
 have intervened, sometimes violently, and arrested
 leaders. The unions affiliated with the PRI dominate
 the labor movement. However, independent unions of
 the left and right do exist. PRI-affiliated union
 leaders also regularly deny dissident leaders or groups
 full exercise of their democratic rights through the
 use of "closed-shop." Expulsion is seldom decided
 by a democratic majority vote procedure.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Mexico has traditionally welcomed the persecuted of
 other Latin American countries and supported multilateral
 approaches to human rights problems.
 The Government has been generally cooperative with
 international human rights organizations. However,
 it has not signed the American Convention on Human
 Rights. In the 34th UNGA the Mexicans joined with
 
 
 367
 delegations from several other countries in a proposal
 to study the possibility of an international migratory
 workers code of conduct.
 During 1978 the Government received a high-level delega-
 tion from Amnesty International and a study group
 from the International League for Human Rights.  Some
 observations and conclusions resulting from these
 visits are described elsewhere in this report.
 Amnesty International's 1979 annual worldwide repori
 describes the beneficial application of Mexico's amnesty
 program but concludes that "the safety of prisoners
 after they have been released has been questioned"
 -- two apparently disappeared immediately after they
 were arrested and others reportedly were merely
 transferred from one prison to another.
