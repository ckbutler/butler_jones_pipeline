 IRAN*
 Five years after the 1979 ouster of the Shah and the advent of
 the Islamic Revolution, Iran remains a revolutionary state.
 The regime is in the process of consolidating the revolution
 and building new political and social institutions. The war
 with Iraq, which began in 1980, continues with little hope for
 a negotiated settlement in the near future. An insurgency in
 Kurdish areas began about five years ago and continues.
 Iran terms itself an Islamic Republic. Its formal system,
 based on the Constitution approved in 1980 by popular
 referendum, follows a parliamentary pattern with a
 legislature, the Majles, and a president elected by universal
 suffrage. Elections, however, are not free in that all
 candidates for office must be certified by the Interior
 Ministry as meeting Islamic criteria. Iran is *Islamic* in
 its constitutional directives that all laws and regulations
 should be based on Islamic principles and that Iran should be
 governed under the leadership of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi
 Khomeini, and in the constitutional provision for a Council of
 Guardians, which reviews legislation to assure that it
 complies with Islamic law.
 The regime officially derives its legitimacy from the elected
 Majles and from Islam. In practice, its hold on power is
 reinforced through intimidation, terror, and other harsh
 methods. Although the trend is toward greater adherence to
 constitutional guarantees of human rights, particularly since
 December 1982, these guarantees are still frequently ignored.
 Iran's political elite is composed of a group of Muslim
 clerics of the predominant Shi'a sect and laymen who have
 aligned themselves with these clerics. Opposition elements
 have not posed a serious threat to the regime since mid-1981
 as a result of a government campaign to suppress political
 dissidents following a series of bombings that killed many
 political leaders.
 The regime, however, is not monolithic, and there are major
 differences on economic issues such as private property
 ownership, government versus private control of foreign trade,
 labor versus management-oriented industrial policy, and on
 strategy for the war with Iraq.
 Economically, Iran is an oil-rich developing country. In the
 years before the revolution, it experienced rapid but uneven
 economic development. The disruptions of the revolutionary
 period caused serious economic deterioration. In the last two
 years, however, the economy has shown some improvement. Oil
 revenue has been sufficient to fund enough imports of food to
 prevent hunger, and a rationing system assures that available
 supplies of basic necessities are distributed in a reasonably
 equitable manner. Inflation and unemployment are high, and
 corruption and black market activities flourish.

 this report draws heavily on unofficial sources.

 IRAN
 The regime is strongly Islamic and does not share Western
 concepts of individual freedom. Dissent from the political
 and religious views of the leadership is repressed. Many
 aspects of Islamic law and culture, including manner of dress,
 are imposed on everyone. Members of officially recognized
 religious minorities--Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians--are
 allowed to practice their religions but face official
 discrimination. The Baha'is, another religious minority in
 Iran, are not officially recognized by the regime; they are
 viewed as heretics and suffer from severe persecution by the
 Government. The regime remains strongly anti-Zionist and is
 distrustful of religious minorities, but there have been no
 reports since mid-1982 of arrests due solely to the religious
 affiliation of members of recognized religious minorities.
 In its war with Iraq, Iran began a major offensive in February
 1984 resulting in the occupation of a salient of Iraqi
 territory along the southern front. Since then, the war has
 been stalemated. Iranian cities have been subjected to
 missile and bombing attacks which have caused considerable
 damage to civilian areas and considerable loss of civilian
 life. Chemical weapons were used by Iraq against Iranian
 troops in early 1984. The war has proved costly to both
 sides. Iran claims that over 100,000 of its soldiers have
 been killed since the war began in 1980. Economic resources
 have been diverted from development to the war effort. Both
 sides have attacked economic targets such as oil export
 terminals'and factories. Iran also claims, plausibly, that
 the war has created about 1 million refugees.
 Iran holds an estimated 45,000 to 50,000 Iraqi prisoners of
 war (POW's). Iranian treatment of POW's became more
 contentious during 1984, with the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) charging that Iran was uncooperative in
 allowing the ICRC to visit POW's and that Iranian treatment of
 Iraqi POW's, including proselytism, is contrary to the Third
 Geneva Convention, to which Iran is a party. The Government
 asserted that it had not only a right but a duty to carry out
 religious and political proselytism among the Iraqi POW's.
 While Iran's human rights record continued to show serious
 abuses, there has been improvement in the past two years,
 particularly after December 1982 when Ayatollah Khomeini nade
 a highly publicized eight-point statement, much of which
 focused on numan rights issues. His speech decreed that
 censorship of mails and telephones was to cease, entry into
 private homes without a search warrant was forbidden except in
 cases involving suspected opposition hideouts, the right to
 travel outside Iran was extended to most Iranians, and the
 tests designed to measure bureaucrats' loyalty to Islam were
 to be discontinued. A Headquarters for the Enforcement of the
 Imam's Decree, headed by the chief justice of the Supreme
 Court, was established with branch offices in most provincial
 cities. Thousands of complaints were received and a number of
 local officials removed. Although many abuses continue,
 conditions have improved over the immediate postrevolutionary
 period, and the institutional framework to correct some human
 rights abuses is in place.
 The revolution involved immense social upheaval. The majority
 of the members of the prerevolutionary upper classes, as well
 as major segments of the middle class, have fled, particularly
 those closely connected with the Shah's regime. Thousands
 were executed during the first four years of the new regime,
 
 
 1235
 IRAN
 and many more thousands were arrested, with victims including
 not only supporters of the former regime but also large
 numbers from the original revolutionary coalition. Having
 eliminated most potential sources of organized internal
 opposition, the regime in the past two years has appeared to
 feel more secure and has been refocusing its energies on the
 institutionalization of the new order. As in 1983, there were
 far fewer killings and fewer arrests in 1984 than in the
 preceding years. Nonetheless, abuses continue, including
 arbitrary arrests, torture, and summary executions.
 Persecution of the Baha'is has increased to the point that
 Iran's Prosecutor General effectively banned all Baha'i
 religious and institutional activities in an August 1983
 order. His order provides the legal basis on which the regime
 can move against all Baha'is in Iran if it chooses to do so.
 At least 29 Baha'is in custody were killed in 1984, and 750 or
 more remained in prison.
 There is considerable circumstantial evidence pointing to
 Iranian involvement in or support of terrorist activities in
 various parts of the world. Although these charges have been
 denied by Iranian leaders, these same leaders have defended
 terrorism as a legitimate policy instrument, particularly as a
 means of combatting what they view as superpower dominance of
 Third World countries.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reliable statistics are not available on the number of people
 killed in Iran for political or religious reasons. Although
 sustained efforts have been made by Iranian exile groups and
 independent human rights organizations to compile lists of
 persons executed, all are dependent on rumor, on reports from
 persons who have been released or escaped from Iranian
 prisons, and on incomplete official announcements. Some
 reports come from opposition political groups that have reason
 to inflate the figures. There is a consensus that, although
 it is not nearly so high as it was in the years 1979-82, the
 rate of political killing remains significant--probably
 amounting to several hundred victims in 1984. Aside from
 purely political killings, at least 29 Baha'is were killed for
 religious reasons in 1984, in addition to at least 165 killed
 in previous years.
 The vast majority of executions for political or religious
 causes are performed in provincial areas following convictions
 by local revolutionary courts. Others have been convicted by
 revolutionary courts in Tehran or executed in Tehran's major
 prisons without benefit of trial.
 Amnesty International's 1984 annual report recorded an
 estimated 5,447 executions in Iran between February 1979 and
 the end of 1983; the report noted, however, that "the total
 number of executions was certainly much higher, with hundreds
 of executions reportedly taking place unannounced."
 Apart from the Government itself, political killings continued
 to be carried out by opposition groups, including the
 
 
 1236
 IRAN
 Mojanedin-e-Khalq, a terrorist organization sometimes known as
 tne People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran. Although now
 supported by many Iranians who are seeking any alternative to
 tne current regime, the Mojahedin have carried out numerous
 political killings directed against the Shah's Government,
 against the U.S. Government, and, after breaking in mid-1981
 with their policy of fervent support for Ayatollah Khomeini
 and the Islamic Revolution, against the present regime. Many
 innocent persons have been killed when large bombs were
 exploded in public places, and several religious leaders have
 been the victims of suicide missions by persons, believed to
 be from the Mojahedin, carrying grenades. The regime's
 repression of the Mojahedin, including the killing over a
 three-year period of thousands of suspected members and
 sympathizers, has reduced but not eliminated the threat of
 this group within the country. For instance, at least 24
 persons were killed in bomb explosions in Tehran in August and
 December.
 Killings related to the insurrection in the Kurdish area also
 continue. Although there are no reliable statistics, there
 have been many deaths resulting not only from fighting between
 dissident Kurdish groups and the regime and from regime
 forces' summary executions of Kurds in captured territory, but
 also as a result of internecine fighting among Kurdish groups.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances are seldom permanent in Iran. People are
 arbitrarily arrested or carried off, they are held without
 charge, and some are summarily executed; the society, however,
 is not tightly controlled, so a persistent relative can
 usually determine who was responsible for the arrest and
 locate the detainee. Although many relatives are not
 officially informed of executions, they seem to find out and
 can often confirm rumor by checking burial records at Tehran's
 cemetery.
 There are, however, some cases of long-term or permanent
 disappearance. One report obtained by Amnesty International
 stated that sometimes opposition members are listed as "killed
 while resisting arrest' when in fact they are still alive and
 in jail. The supposition is that they will be severely
 tortured while in jail, and may well die as a result. Arrest
 in most of these cases is believed to be the work of the
 Revolutionary Guard and to be sanctioned by the regime.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Stories of torture in Iran's prisons are rampant and cover a
 wide range of inhuman practices. Nine cases are known of
 prisoners who died in prison in 1984 following torture, but
 the actual number is believed to be much higher. Beatings of
 all kinds appear to be common. Prisoners are beaten on the
 soles of their feet until they can no longer walk. Others
 have had damaged kidneys as a result of being kicked and
 beaten with sticks. There are stories of men whipped in the
 testicles. Only 3 in 10 were reported to survive this
 treatment in one cell block at Evin Prison in Tehran, Iran's
 largest and most notorious. Mock executions are a favorite
 method of torture there, along with blindfolding, and solitary
 confinement. There are stories of women being held with their
 children, and the children forced to watch while the mother is
 
 
 1237
 IRAN
 beaten, or themselves beaten in the mother's presence. Female
 prisoners have described frequent rapes in addition to the
 beatings received.
 This torture occurs in government prisons or in government
 houses in which prisoners of special interest are held for
 questioning. Presumably it takes place with the sanction of
 top officials. Many of the published first person reports
 relate to events in 1981 and 1982; there is, however, no
 indication that treatment has improved since then. Many of
 these reports come from individuals who themselves were in the
 prisons, and who, in some cases, actually experienced the
 torture. As these stories are widespread and consistent,
 there is little reason to doubt their veracity. In some
 instances there are confirming medical reports.
 The regime is in the process of revising Iran's civil code to
 conform more closely with Islamic law. There are no reports
 of amputations under Islamic justice in Iran, nor are there
 reports that it includes stoning. There are reports of
 floggings, both as a means of torture and as a formal
 punishment, but there is no information which indicates how
 many persons have been flogged for which crimes.
 The jails are grossly overcrowded. Those who were detained at
 the Central Komiteh estimated that there were 1,000 to 1,500
 people held in a facility built for 500. Toilet facilities
 are inadequate or totally lacking. Medical treatment is not
 available, unless the guards believe a prisoner will break and
 'confess' if enticed by treatment of his wounds. Food is
 inadequate and sometimes full of dirt and bugs, and prisoners
 are herded from place to place like animals.
 In its report Torture in the Eighties, Amnesty International
 expressed concern that torture has become a routine practice
 in at least some Iranian prisons and noted in particular two
 kinds of ill-treatment of prisoners: the officially
 sanctioned punishment of prisoners by whipping, and the
 torture of prisoners held in incommunicado detention during
 interrogation to extract confessions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests for expression of views critical or different from
 those of the Government are quite common. They have decreased
 during the past two years largely because of the widespread
 fear of arrest. If there is a formal accusation, the charge
 is usually subversion, anti-regime activities, or treason.
 There is also evidence that many persons are arrested on
 trumped-up criminal charges (for example, on drug charges)
 when their actual 'offenses' are political; the lack of fair
 trials and other procedural safeguards encourages such a
 practice. Political arrests are usually made by members of
 the Revolutionary Guard. Arrests by Komiteh members were
 common, but the Revolutionary Guards have increasingly assumed
 this role. In political cases, there normally are no warrants
 for arrest. There is no judicial determination of the
 legality of detention in Iranian law, nor are there any other
 legal protections. Detainees are frequently held for long
 periods without charge, and in some cases have been tortured,
 only to have the mullah (Muslim cleric) who supervises the
 prison apologize subsequently for the mistake. For political
 crimes, no access to a lawyer is permitted. Cases are heard,
 if at all, by the revolutionary judiciary. Bail is not
 legally permitted.
 
 
 1238
 IRAN
 Although the Constitution does guarantee many basic human
 rights, the revolutionary court system ignores these
 provisions in practice. There are no reliable estimates of
 the number of persons arbitrarily arrested in 1984, but the
 number is probably in the thousands. Amnesty International
 has reported cases of opposition members whom the Government
 has listed as "killed while resisting arrest" but who in fact
 are being held incommunicado.
 Persons suspected of involvement in anti-regime activities are
 all subject to the same procedures. They are arrested by
 members of the Revolutionary Guard. Those suspected of minor
 offenses are held for questioning at local Revolutionary Guard
 offices. Sometimes they are released after several hours or
 several days, a process that may be repeated two or three
 times before the authorities decide the detainee is innocent
 or that he is guilty and should be jailed. Other suspects are
 taken directly to one of the prisons where they may be held
 for weeks, months, or even years prior to being released or
 executed. Some who have been released report being called for
 questioning on several different occasions. In some cases a
 mullah is involved, in others it is unidentified questioners,
 sometimes including torturers. It is also unclear whether
 this questioning constitutes a trial by a revolutionary court
 or whether it is part of the investigative process.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 It is not known how many of those executed had a trial of any
 sort. There are reports of opposition activists being called
 before revolutionary judges, usually mullahs, having the
 charges against them read and then being taken out to be
 shot. Most of these reports date from the 1981-1982 period.
 In the past two years, the number of executions has declined,
 but there is no evidence that procedures have changed.
 So-called trials of major opposition figures are sometimes
 telecast, but no trial by a revolutionary court can be called
 fair or public. If the trial is given publicity, it is
 generally because the prisoner has been forced to confess to
 crimes against the State.
 There is little information regarding trials for common
 criminal offenses. Many elements of the prerevolutionary
 judiciary survive, and common criminals often have the right
 to a public trial with benefit of a lawyer of their own
 choosing, assuming they can afford the fee. Even this
 judiciary is not independent. Many of the former judges were
 retired after the revolution, and new judges selected. One
 criterion for new judges was grounding in Islamic law, and
 political acceptability is an absolute requirement for any
 government position. Assignment of cases to regular rather
 than revolutionary courts is haphazard and apparently occurs
 mainly when arrests are made by regular police.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government is attempting to remake Iranian society
 according to Khomeini's interpretation of Shi'a Islam. It
 rejects the Western distinction between a public sphere which
 the Government may control, and a sphere of private life
 (religion, culture, thought, and private behavior) which the
 
 
 1239
 IRAN
 State may not properly control. The regime defines itself as
 Islamic and attempts to enforce a way of life asserted to be
 Islamic.
 Since Khomeini's eight-point decree of December 1982, Iranians
 have enjoyed greater freedom in their private life. One of
 the eight points was that no one had the right to enter
 private homes without a warrant. An exception was made for
 suspected hideouts of opposition groups. The decree did say
 that if Revolutionary Guards entered a home believing it to be
 an opposition hideout and found they had made a mistake, they
 were to depart, even if they had found evidence of un-Islamic
 activities such as the presence of alcoholic beverages. The
 decree also stated that mail should not be opened nor
 telephones tapped unless there was good reason to suspect
 anti-regime activities. Homes are still entered, mail is
 still opened, and phones are still tapped, but much less so
 than previously. Moreover, Iranians now have a decree by
 Khomeini himself on which to base complaints. A Headquarters
 for the Enforcement of the Imam's Decree was set up, as were a
 number of provincial and local offices. These offices, which
 appear to be still in operation, received thousands of
 complaints about violations of rights of privacy.
 A special unit of the Revolutionary Guard checks on social
 activities. Women whose clothing does not completely cover
 the hair and all of the body except hands and face, or who are
 wearing make-up, are subject to arrest. If they are,'in the
 words of the Prosecutor General, 'reformable,* they may be
 lectured and released. If considered defiant, they may go to
 jail.
 The schools are apparently used by the regime to assure that
 families of students behave in an "acceptable, Islamic
 manner.' Emigres report that children are asked about the
 habits of their parents, and un-Islamic behavior is reported
 to Revolutionary Guard units.
 Neighborhood Komitehs, which originally acted as 'block
 wardens,' checking on the activities of residents, seem to be
 less active now. There have been efforts to disband them and
 many may have in fact disappeared.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution states that "publications and the press may
 express ideas freely, except when they are contrary to Islamic
 principles, or are detrimental to public rights." In
 practice, most publications are controlled by the Government
 or by the Islamic Republican Party, and the remaining
 independent publishers run the risk not only of shutdowns of
 their presses but of arrest and summary punishment if they are
 overly critical of the regime. Examples of such punishments
 were sufficiently numerous during the first years of the
 regime to retain a severe chilling effect in 1984, although no
 further examples were reported. Nevertheless, some
 independent publishers continued to survive, and both books
 and articles critical of the regime were published without
 reprisal. All broadcasting facilities are government-owned.
 Academic freedom has increased in the last two years, with
 universities not only reopening but also under looser
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 79
 
 
 1240
 IRAN
 constraints. The regime remains committed, however, to the
 elimination of all lun-Islamic' influences, and textbooks are
 reviewed to determine their acceptability. Foreign books,
 newspapecs, and magazines are either not permitted, or may be
 imported only after review.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 Although the Constitution permits unarmed assemblies and
 marches 'provided they do not violate the principles of
 Islam,* the only assemblies and marches permitted in practice
 are those sponsored by the Government such as Friday prayers
 and sermons and parades on official occasions. There were
 numerous cases during 1984 of spontaneous gatherings or
 marches to protest shortages or regime actions, but these were
 forcibly dispersed. The suppression of a large demonstration
 in Mashhad in September apparently resulted in some deaths.
 The Constitution permits parties, groups, professional
 associations, and both Islamic and minority religious
 associations, but most independent organizations have either
 been banned or are moribund. Although the outgoing Majles had
 included opposition party representatives, restrictions on
 freedom of speech and assembly discouraged the participation,
 in the 1984 elections of any party other than the semiofficial
 Islamic Republican Party.
 There are no labor unions. It is believed that there are
 Islamic workers councils' in some factories. These, however,
 are more instruments of government control than bodies that
 represent workers' interests. Several short-lived strikes in
 1984 were dealt with severely. The leaders of a soft-drink
 plant workers' strike were reportedly arrested and executed.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iran terms itelf an Islamic republic, and religion is closely
 intertwined with government. 'His Eminence and Supreme
 Holiness the Ayatollah Imam Khomeini' (as he is referred to in
 the Constitution) is recognized as the supreme leader, and
 this position is viewed as holding something akin to divine
 sanction. The President and many other top officials are
 mullahs (religious leaders), as are the Speaker of the Majles,
 and roughly half of the Majles deputies. Ninety-two percent
 of Iranians are Shi'a, and seven percent are Sunni Muslims,
 but the Sunnis tend to be located in tribal areas remote from
 Tehran. Their political influence is nearly nil. The
 Constitution declares that "the official religion of Iran is
 Islam and the sect followed is Ja'fari Shi'ism," but it also
 states that 'other Islamic denominations shall enjoy complete
 respect.' Although Sunnis have encountered religious
 discrimination on the local level, and in many cases
 persecution based on ethnic origin, the regime has made
 efforts to reduce Shi'a-Sunni antagonism.
 Tests of Islamic knowledge and orthodoxy, required in the
 early postrevolutionary years for public or semipublic
 employment and enrollment in higher education, have been
 dropped in the past two years on the grounds that they
 conflict with the constitutional provision that 'the
 interrogation of people regarding their beliefs is
 forbidden.' This provision is ignored, however, in the
 tfreatment of members of the Baha'i faith.
 The Baha'i religion is not recognized in Iran and Baha'is have
 suffered severe persecution since the revolution. This is
 
 
 1241
 IRAN
 mainly government-directed and aimed at the religious
 leadership, although there were some instances earlier of mob
 action against Baha'is. Baha'i property has been confiscated,
 shrines demolished, businesses disbanded or confiscated, and
 known Baha'is denied employment by the Government. These
 measures effectively deny employment to most urban Baha'is.
 Much of the Baha'i religious leadership has been arrested, as
 have many ordinary Baha'is. Charges are vague; "crimes
 against God," "corruption on earth," "warring against God,"
 and *Zionism" are among the most frequent. The real reason
 for the arrests seems to be advocacy of Baha'ism. A minimum
 of 750 Baha'is are in jail. At least 194 have been executed
 or have died following torture since the beginning of the
 revolutionary period, at least 29 during 1984.
 In August 1983, the Prosecutor General issued an order that
 effectively bans all Baha'i religious activity, and provides
 the legal foundation on which virtually all members of the
 faith could be charged with crimes: participation in social
 welfare organizations is forbidden, as are the business
 corporations the Baha'i operated; and teaching of the faith,
 even by parents to children in the home, is not permitted.
 There is concern that these actions may mark the beginning of
 even more severe measures. Although the Baha'i national
 leaders dissolved the community's organizations in obedience
 to the Prosecutor General's edict, they were subsequently
 arrested, and at least some were executed.
 There are small Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian (the
 pre-Islamic religion of Iran) populations, concentrated mainly
 in urban areas. These religions are recognized by the
 Constitution, and they elect representatives to seats reserved
 for them in the Majles. They are permitted to practice their
 religions, to instruct their children, and in some cases to
 maintain schools. There have been reports of religious
 persecution of these minorities, particularly in the early
 stages of the revolution. They continue to have problems with
 the regime over religious practice, and some members of all
 three groups suffer officially sanctioned job discrimination.
 An article that appeared in 1983 in an Armenian-language
 publication complained about the regime's interference in
 Armenian schools, and the fact that the regime insisted that
 Armenian girls wear Islamic clothing. Although the article
 cited abuses, it is significant that it appeared at all. The
 Constitution states that recognized religious minorities shall
 be free in matters related to teaching and that the teaching
 of ethnic-language literature is permitted. Nevertheless, all
 Armenian schools were closed during much of 1984 due to the
 Government's insistence that no courses could be taught in the
 Armenian language, that Armenian schools could not use
 Armenian-language bibles to teach classes on Christianity, and
 that the Armenian schools would have to teach Christianity on
 the basis of Farsi texts provided by the Government. Armenian
 schools reopened in October after an informal compromise was
 reached, but their status remains precarious.
 Jewish groups report fewer such problems because the language
 spoken in Jewish homes and informally among Jews is Farsi. In
 parts of Iran, Zoroastrians reportedly are considered
 .unclean" and are required to warn barbers, launderers, and
 restaurant owners that their service will be for "unclean"
 people, so that they can decide whether to serve such clients.
 
 
 1242
 IRAN
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iranians may travel temporarily to any part of Iran, except
 perhaps for the war zone on the border with Iraq, and, in
 times of heavy fighting, some Kurdish areas. Such limitations
 as exist are for purposes of military security. Persons may
 also change their place of residence without obtaining
 official permission.
 Travel outside Iran is considerably easier than before the
 spring of 1983. Khomeini's decree of December 1982 included
 the right to travel abroad. Prior to that time passports and
 exit visas had been difficult to obtain. Males of draft age
 are not issued exit visas except for approved courses of
 study, and Iranians who are politically suspect, such as some
 retired military officers and high level public officials
 under the former regime, may not be able to leave. Also
 denied exit visas are individuals who still owe loans obtained
 from development banks under the old regime. Reportedly some
 Iranians, particularly those with skills in short supply, and
 who were educated at government expense, are required to post
 bonds to obtain exit visas.
 With the exception of those with close ties to the former
 regime, Iranians are generally able to return after long
 periods abroad without reprisal. Not all citizens who leave,
 however, are guaranteed the right to return. Iranians
 suspected of close association with the old regime have
 encountered problems obtaining new passports, and a few have
 been arrested on their return. However, numerous other
 immediate relatives of persons wanted by the regime seem able
 to live in Iran, travel outside, and return without undue
 difficulty.
 Iranian passports have always been stamped *not valid for
 emigration,* but the Government does not make a clear
 distinction between legal residence in another country and
 emigration. According to the regulations, Iranians with a
 legal residence outside Iran may be issued passports and
 advance exit visas by the Iranian embassy, consulate, or
 interests section in their country of residence. Iranians who
 have acquired U.S. citizenship are considered Iranian (in
 effect dual nationals) unless they have formally renounced
 their Iranian citizenship. Dual nationals have complained
 that the Iranian Interests Section in Washington, D.C., will
 neither give them visas in their U.S. passports nor issue them
 Iranian passports and exit visas on the grounds that their
 residence in the U.S. is not legal because, according to
 Iranian law, they emigrated illegally. Although such services
 may be denied, there are no known instances of the denial of
 Iranian citizenship to Iranians who left Iran, or to those who
 have remained there.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders and their lay
 associates. All leaders share belief in Ayatollah Khomeini as
 the supreme leader of the revolution and in the legitimacy and
 desirability of a theocratic state based on his interpretation
 of Shi'a Islam. Of Iran's political parties, only the Islamic
 Republican Party is represented in the Government, and most
 high level government officials belong to it. The party has
 no unified stand on economic and social issues and represents
 conflicting viewpoints on them. Although the party's founders
 
 
 1243
 IRAN
 may have envisioned a single-party state structure, many of
 them were killed in mid-1981, and the party now has no
 discernible political significance, although roughly half the
 winning candidates in the 1984 Majles elections were members.
 Beginning a year after the Shan's departure, the revolutionary
 regime has held elections at fairly regular intervals for
 President, Majles deputies, members of the Council of Experts
 (responsiole for choosing Khomeini's successor), and members
 of local government councils. All elections have been hard
 fought, generally with several candidates for every position.
 All candidates must be approved by the Interior Ministry,
 however, and only those meeting with the approval of the
 Government may run. In practice, only supporters of the
 theocratic state are accepted. There has, however, been
 considerable diversity of opinion among candidates on economic
 and social questions.
 Elections for the Majles were held in April, with run-off
 elections in May for the sizable number of races in which no
 candidate received a majority in the first round. The Iran
 Freedom Movement, which had been represented in the outgoing
 Majles, declined to enter candidates on the grounds that a
 fair campaign was not possible under prevailing political
 conditions, and only the Islamic Republican Party and
 nonpartisan candidates participated in the elections.
 Competition for the seats was nevertheless keen, and voting
 had to be repeated in 16 constituencies where the results were
 disputed.
 The Majles holds genuine debates, normally broadcast live on
 radio, on a wide variety of issues. In some cases, laws
 proposed by the Government have been voted down. Five Cabinet
 ministers lost their posts in August when, following heated
 debate on the performance of the Cabinet, they failed to win
 votes of confidence, and on several occasions during the year
 the Prime Minister's nominees to fill ministerial vacancies
 were rejected. Rejection of bills and officials by the Majles
 is accepted by the executive branch.
 Iran's Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians
 composed of 12 members, 6 clerics unilaterally appointed by
 Khomeini and 6 lay members who are well grounded in Islamic
 law and who are nominated by the head of the Judicial Council
 subject to the approval of the Majles. The Council of
 Guardians must certify all bills passed by the Majles as being
 in accordance with Islamic law and the Constitution. If bills
 fail to be certified, they are sent back to the Majles for
 revision. They cannot become law until the Council has
 certified them. The Council of Guardians has rejected various
 important bills and portions of bills passed by the Majles,
 including legislation on land reform, nationalization of
 foreign trade, and reform of Iran's civil code.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The regime in Iran is disdainful of foreign human rights
 groups, government-sponsored or independent. The Iranian
 ambassador to the United Nations declared on December 7 that
 Iran would not hesitate to violate any provisions of the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights which it considered
 inconsistent with Islam. There have been no visits by any
 humanitarian group with the exception of the International
 
 
 1244
 IRAN
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has visited Iraqi
 prisoners of war (POW's). During the August visit of the
 Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, however,
 the regime agreed to a future bilateral colloquium to discuss
 human rights in Iran. There are no internal human rights
 groups. At its 1984 session, the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission voted to appoint a special rapporteur on the human
 rights situation in Iran. The Government of Iran has refused
 to allow him entry to prepare his report.
 Iran was the subject of a critical paragraph in the 1984
 report of the International Labor Organization's Committee on
 the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. Focusing
 on the treatment of Baha'is and others, the committee
 expressed its "profound concern' over the Government's failure
 to comply with the Convention on Discrimination in Occupation
 and appealed to the Government to reexamine its position.
 Amnesty International has written to Iranian officials,
 including Khomeini, protesting violations of human rights in
 Iran, but has received no reply. The 1984 report from Amnesty
 International expressed concern over the large number of
 executions, numerous allegations of torture and other forms of
 ill-treatment of prisoners, the imprisonment of prisoners of
 conscience, denial of fair trial to political prisoners, and
 religious persecution, particularly of Baha'is. Freedom House
 rates Iran "partly free* and explains this upgrading of its
 previous rating in terms of improvement in the electoral and
 parliamentary processes and in the right to privacy.
 The ICRC has had access to some POW's, but not to all of those
 believed held in Iran. In a special appeal to the Permanent
 Representatives to the U.N. in Geneva on November 23,
 President Hay of the ICRC stated that I.. .the repeated and
 systematic nature of the Iranian violations of the Third
 Geneva Convention is so serious that the ICRC feels that if it
 did not have recourse to this exceptional measure, it would
 jeopardize by its silence not only the lives of tens of
 thousands of men, but also the very future of humanitarian
 law.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 There are no reliable statistics for the postrevolutionary
 period. The following World Bank economic and social
 indicators should be taken as rough estimates based in large
 part on statistics from the mid-1970's. In 1984, the
 population was about 43.8 million with a population growth
 rate of 3.1 percent. Life expectancy at birth is 60.3 years,
 and the infant death rate is 112 per 1,000 live births. The
 adult literacy rate was 36.2 percent in 1976. The primary
 school enrollment ratio in 1981 was 77.4 percent (90.5 per
 cent for boys but only 63.5 percent for girls). Universities
 were. closed in 1980-81 but have reopened.
 The gross national product (GNP) in 1982 was estimated at
 $66.5 billion, $1,620 per capita. This represents a sharp
 drop from the 1977 GNP of $77.8 billion and per capita GNP of
 $2,160, particularly when inflation is taken into account.
 The economy improved modestly in 1983 but was at best static
 in 1984.
 Nearly all export income comes from petroleum. Oil exports
 averaged about 1.6 million barrels per day for most of 1984,
 significantly below the average of 1.9 million barrels per day

 in 1983. This level was sufficient, in combination with a
 major drawdown of foreign currency reserves, to permit the
 import of essential civilian items and of enough war materiel
 to maintain the war against Iraq. Luxury items are still
 difficult to find, and there are still shortages of essential
 items, but these shortages are less severe than during the
 first two years of the revolution. Support for the regime
 comes mainly from the urban lower classes, and the Government
 has taken care to see that the basic needs of this group are
 met. Economic problems have been far more severe for the
 middle- and upper-income groups who formerly enjoyed lives of
 comparative luxury.
 Ultraconservative dress, entirely hiding the hair and all of
 the body except the face and hands, is now an absolute
 requirement for all women, regardless of their religion,
 national origin, citizenship, or diplomatic status. Women are
 harassed, detained, or physically attacked if they appear in
 public in clothing which official or self-appointed guardians
 of public morality deem insufficiently modest. There were
 also incidents in July in which men were attacked on the
 streets of Tehran for dressing in 'un-Islamic" fashion, such
 as wearing short-sleeved shirts or failing to button all their
 shirt buttons. Employment opportunities for women are more
 restricted than was the case under the Shah. Women are
 legally barred from being judges. Although there are cultural
 barriers making employment in professional level positions
 difficult to obtain and maintain, women do work as lawyers,
 physicians, and statisticians, and in other professions in
 both the public and private sectors. Several women serve as
 deputies in the Majles.
 The Family Protection Act, passed under the Shah, was revoked
 by the Islamic government, and replaced by a civil code
 reflecting Islamic law. A bill passed in mid-1983 did,
 however, give women the right to divorce their husbands, and
 regulations announced in 1984 substantially broadened, to 12,
 the number of grounds for which a woman may seek divorce. A
 husband may still obtain a divorce without having to state a
 reason or go to court. The new marriage regulations provide
 for improved financial settlements for wives whose husbands
 divorce them.
