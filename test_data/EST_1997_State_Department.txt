 ESTONIA
 Estonia is a parliamentary democracy. With its statehood widely recognized as
 continuous for more than 70 years, Estonia regained its independence in 1991 after
 50 years of Soviet occupation. The Constitution, adopted by referendum in 1992, es-
 tablished a 101-member unicameral legislature (State Assembly), a prime minister
 as Head of Government, and a president as Head of State. A cabinet reshuffle in
 March led to the departure of Prime Minister Tiit Vahi and the appointment of
 Mart Siimann as his successor. The judiciary is independent.
 The official conversion of the Soviet militia into the Estonian police preceded the
 reestablishment of the country's independence by about 6 months. Its conversion
 into a Western-type police force committed to procedures and safeguards appro-
 priate to a democratic society is proceeding, with police leadership actively working
 to professionalize the force. The police, who are ethnically mixed, are subordinate
 to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Corrections personnel are subordinate to the
 Ministry of Justice. The security service, called Security Police, is subordinate to the
 Interior Ministry but also reports to the Prime Minister. Police and corrections per-
 sonnel continued to commit human rights abuses.
 Estonia has a market economy. Reflecting the extent of post-1992 reforms, Esto-
 nia has been selected to start accession negotiations with the European Union. Serv-

 ices, especially financial and tourism, are growing in importance compared to his-
 torically more prominent light industry and food production. Privatization of small
 and medium firms is virtually complete, and privatization of large-scale enterprises
 is underway. The economy continues to grow steadily, with gross domestic product
 (GDP) estimated to increase by about 7 to 8 percent in 1997. Although prices con-
 tinue to rise, incomes are rising faster than the rate of inflation. Per capita GDP
 is about $2,530 per year. Two-thirds of Estonian exports (textiles, food products,
 wood and timber ppducts) are now directed to Western markets. Unemployment re-
 mained fairly low overall (unofficially about 8 percent) but was significantly higher
 in rural areas.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens and the
 large noncitizen community, but problems remained in some areas. The major
 human rights abuses continued to be mistreatment of prisoners and detainees, and
 the use of excessive force by the police. Prison conditions are poor. The deadline for
 noncitizens to file for permanent residency expired in 1996, after being extended
 twice. An undetermined number of noncitizens have still not filed for residency.
 Problems remain in processing the applications for permanent residency of some
 19,000 Russian military retirees and family members. Processing of applications for
 alien passports continued. By late 1997, most applicants for alien passports had re-
 ceived them. The Government continued to issue temporary travel documents and
 to accept officially invalid former Soviet internal passports for identification in
 emergency situations, such as registering births and deaths. In January the Council
 of Europe closed its human rights monitoring mission in Estonia.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such practices are prohibited by law. However, there continued to be credible re-
 ports that police used excessive force and verbal abuse during the arrest and ques-
 tioning of suspects. Punishment cells ("kartsers ") continued to be used, in con-
 travention of international standards. Most of the top leadership of one prefecture
 was dismissed for abuse of power.
 Four cases of hazing in the military were reported; one was formally investigated
 and the charges were dropped. There were reports of more instances of recruit mis-
 treatment, one of which resulted in a 24-hour unauthorized absence by an entire
 platoon. A training tragedy that took the lives of 14 soldiers in September focused
 public attention on safety and discipline in the military.
 Prison conditions remained poor. Overcrowding continued in the Tallinn Central
 Prison built in 1765, although the opening of a new wing, which meets European
 standards, reduced the overcrowding. The Government continued measures to ad-
 dress poor prison conditions and to make prison staff more professional. By mid-Oc-
 tber, one prisoner had been "klled by other prisoners, compared with four in 1996.
 Opportunities to study or work in prison were limited.
 The Government has drafted a multiyearp lan to refurbish and restracture all the
 ountry'ss p       and to close the Talinn Central Prison, but it had not yet been
 implemented by year's end. Some suggestions to improve prison conditions made by
 Council of Europe (COE) representatives in 1993 have been implemented, hut fulfill-
 ment of others is still hampered by lack of resources and high turnover among pris-
 on staff.
 The Government permits human rights monitors to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and laws forbid arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government generally observes this prohi-
 bition. Under the Constitution, warrants issued by a court are required to make ar-
 rests. Detainees must be informed promptly of the grounds for the arrest and given
 immediate access to legal counsel. :If a person cannot afford counsel, the State will
 provide one. A person may be held for 48 hours without formally being charged; fur-
 ther detention requires a court order. A person may be held in pretrial detention
 for 2 months; this may be extended up to a total of 12 months by court order. Police
 rarely violate these limits. As of July, 1,613 of the 4,785 persons held in prisons
 were awaiting trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution establishes an independent judi-
 cial branch and the judiciary is independent in practice. The judiciary operates
 through a three-tier court system: rural and city courts; district courts; and the
 State Court (which functions as a supreme court). The district and state courts are
 
 
 1069
 also courts for "constitutional supervision." At the rural and city levels, court deci-
 sions are made by a majority vote with a judge and two lay members sitting in judg-
 ment. All judges and lay judges must be citizens. The President nominates and the
 State Assembly coirms the Chief Justice of the State Court. The Chief Justice
 nominates State Court judges who are subject to confirmation by the State Assem-
 bly. He also nominates the district, city, and rural court judges who are then ap-
 pointed by the President. Judges are appointed for life.
 The Constitution provides that court proceedings shall be public. Closed sessions
 may be held only for specific reasons, such as protection of state or business secrets,
 and in cases concerning minors. The Constitution further provides that defendants
 may present witnesses and evidence as well as confront and cross-examine prosecu-
 tion witnesses. Defendants have access to prosecution evidence and enjoy a pre-
 sumption of innocence.
 Estonia continued to overhaul its criminal and civil procedural codes. An interim
 Criminal Code that went into effect in June 1992 basically revised the Soviet Crimi-
 nal Code by eliminating, for example, political and economic crimes. The Code of
 Criminal Procedure was adopted in 1994. New codes in a variety of fields were
 being drafted at year's end. A multiyear plan is being compiled to replace present
 criminal codes with new penal codes that fully meet European standards.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. In September 1996 former dissident
 Tilt Madisson was sentenced to 26 months in prison for attempting to organize an
 armed overthrow of the Government. The sentence was appealed through all levels
 of the legal system and upheld; however, in December the Government granted
 Madisson amnesty.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires a search warrant for search and seizure of property. During the investiga-
 tive stage, warrants are issued by the prosecutor upon a showing of probable cause.
 Once a case has gone to court, warrants are issued by the court. The Constitution
 provides for secrecy of the mail, telegrams, telephones, and other means of commu-
 nication. Police must obtain a court order to intercept a person's communications.
 Illegally obtained evidence is not admissible in court. At year's end, security police
 and parliamentary investigations were continuing into the 1995 case involving then
 Interior Minister Savisaar who was implicated in making unauthorized recordings
 of conversations.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government respects constitutional provi-
 sions providing for freedom of speech and the press. The media routinely do probing
 and thorough investigative reporting. Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely
 available. All newsprint, printing, and distribution facilities are now private compa-
 nies. There are four major national Estonian language and three Russian language
 dailies, in addition to important weeklies. In a widely reported case, a well-known
 journalist was tried and convicted for insulting the spouse of a prominent politician
 in a newspaper interview and received a fine. The sentence was upheld by all levels
 of the judiciary.
 State broadcast media, including one nationwide television channel, continue to
 receive large subsidies, and the State has assured that these subsidies will continue.
 There are several major independent television and radio stations. Several Russian
 language programs, mostly Estonian produced, are broadcast over state and private
 television channels. Russian state television and Ostankino programs are widely
 available via cable.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble freely, but noncitizens are prohibited from joining political
 parties, although they may form social groups. Permits for all public gatherings
 must be obtained 3 weeks prior to the date of the gathering. The authorities have
 wide discretion to prohibit such gatherings on public safety grounds but seldom ex-
 ercise it. There were no reports of government interference in mass gatherings or
 political rallies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 The 1993 Law on Churches and Religious Organizations requires all religious or-
 ganizations to have at least 12 members and to be registered with the Interior Min-
 istry and the Board of Religion. Leaders of religious organizations must be citizens
 with at least 5 years' residence in Estonia.
 The majority of Estonians are nominally Lutheran, but following deep-seated tra-
 dition there is wide tolerance of other denominations and religions. People of vary-
 ing ethnic backgrounds profess Orthodoxy, including communities of Russian Old
 
 
 1070
 Believers who found refuge in Estonia in the 17th century. The Estonian Apostolic
 Orthodox Church (EAOC), independent since 1919, subordinate to Constantinople
 since 1923, and exiled under the Soviet occupation, reregistered under its 1935 stat-
 ute in August 1993. Since then, a group of ethnic Estonian and Russian parishes
 preferring to remain under the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church structure
 imposed during the Soviet occupation has insisted that it should have claim to the
 EAOC name but has been unable to register under the same name. Representatives
 of the Moscow and Constantinople Patriarchates continued consultations to resolve
 the question, which centers on property issues. The Government and some promi-
 nent businessmen were facilitating the discussions. By year's end a compromise so-
 lution was under consideration, according to which the congregations affiliated with
 Moscow would register under a slightly different name and receive the property cur-
 rently in their possession for long-term use. Throughout the dispute, free worship
 has occurred in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law permits free movement within the country, and it is honored
 in practice. It also provides for the right of foreign travel, emigration, and repatri-
 ation for citizens. There are no exit visas.
 In July 1993, Parliament enacted a Law on Aliens that defines an alien as a per-
 son who is not a citizen of Estonia, i.e., a citizen of another country or a stateless
 person. The majority of noncitizens are ethnic Russians. The law provided a 1-year
 period during which noncitizens who came to Estonia prior to July 1, 1990, and
 were permanent residents of the former Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, could
 apply for temporary residence permits. They could also apply for permanent resi-
 dence at the same time. Following delays and confusion in implementation as well
 as criticism by international human rights observers, the application deadline was
 extended by a year, until July 12, 1995. By that date the vast majority of aliens-
 327,737 of the estimated 370,000-had filed applications. The Government extended
 the registration period until April 30, 1996. An indeterminate number of nonciti-
 zens-estimates range from 20,000 to 50,000-still have not registered. In mid-year,
 the Government began a campaign to register this group of unregistered aliens,
 pledging not to take any measures against them. By October some 1500 had come
 rwa  . In September the Government proposed and Parliament approved an
 amendment to the aliens law that allowed those who had applied for residence by
 July 12, 1995, to change temporary residence permits to permanent ones, beginning
 in 1998, 2 years earlier than the original act envisioned.
 There were complaints about the slow pace with which the Government was proc-
 essing residence applications for some 19,000 Russian military pensioners. The proc-
 ess was complicatedby the lack of Russian-provided passports in which to affix the
 permits. An estimated 35 percent of the first group of military pensioners missed
 the deadline to present their passports for residence permits. Technically, the Citi-
 zenship and Migration Board could move to have them deported. In fact, however,
 the Government is moving on a case-by-case basis to solve the outstanding issues.
 The Government refused residence to eight former members of the Soviet military.
 After one case involving an individual married to an Estonian citizen with children
 in Estonia attracted wide attention, the Government reviewed the cases and granted
 residence permits to six individuals. Another ex-serviceman, Evgeni Zobnin, was de-
 ported; however, following considerable critical publicity, the authorities issued a
 visa and allowed him to return, pending resolution of his case. The Government con-
 tinued to issue alien passports to those former servicemen who could not or did not
 want to take out Russian citizenship.
 No restrictions are placed on the right of noncitizens to foreign travel, emigration,
 or repatriation, although some noncitizens complain of delays in obtaining travel
 documents. The Government began issuing temporary travel documents valid for a
 single departure and reentry into the country to resident aliens in 1994. To accom-
 modate entry visa requirements of other countries, the validity period of the docu-
 ment was extended in August 1994 from 6 months to 2 years. In late 1994, the Gov-
 ernment began issuing alien passports. These are issued to resident aliens not in
 possession of any other valid travel document. Such aliens included: (1) persons who
 are designated as stateless; (2) foreign citizens who lack the opportunity to obtain
 travel documents of their country of origin or of another state; (3) persons who file
 for Estonian citizenship and pass the language examination if required; and (4)
 aliens who are permanently departing Estonia. The Government plans to expand
 the classes of noncitizens eligible for alien passports. It has already approved their
 issuance to noncitizens intending to study abroad and has agreed to issue them to
 former military personnel -who cannot or do not want to take out Russian citizen-
 ship. By September 160,112 persons had applied for alien passports, and some
 157,000 passports had been issued.
 
 
 1071
 The Government has deported a relatively small number of illegal aliens, usually
 those caught in criminal acts. By late July, 45 illegal aliens were held as internees
 pending deportation or a court order granting them residence. Internees are held
 in a wing of a regular prison.
 In February Parliament passed a refugee law that brought Estonia into conform-
 ity with the 1951 United Nations (U.N.) Convention Relating to the Status of Refu-
 gees and its 1967 Protocol, and in October amended several social security acts to
 provide refugees social guarantees identical to those of citizens. Implementing regu-
 lations have not yet been issued. The Government has selected a site for a refugee
 processing center but construction has not begun. Late in the year, one refugee ap-
 plication was pending. There were no reports of refugees returned to areas where
 they would face persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their Government. In March 1995, free and fair
 elections to the second post-Soviet Parliament were held. Among the deputies are
 six ethnic Russians. Indirect presidential elections were held in 1996. When the Par-
 liament failed to muster the required two-thirds majority to elect the President, an
 Electoral Assembly consisting of parliament members and representatives of local
 governments convened and reelected the incumbent, Lennart Meri.
 Local elections were held in late October 1996. According to legislation, resident
 noncitizens can vote but not run for office. The local elections were free and fair.
 All candidates had certified that they knew Estonian sufficiently to be able to func-
 tion in local government. However, after the elections, there were complaints that
 some candidates did not know sufficient Estonian. In October the Government
 brought court charges against a former chairman of the Sillamae town council for
 having filed a fraudulent certificate. Depending on the outcome of the case, charges
 may be filed in other cases.
 The Citizenship Law enacted in February 1992 readopted the 1938 Citizenship
 Law. According to that law, anyone born after 1940 to a citizen parent is a citizen
 by birth. The parent does not have to be an ethnic Estonian. The Government esti-
 mates that under this provision some 80,000 persons not ethnically Estonian have
 obtained citizenship. The law included requirements for naturalization, such as a 2-
 year residency requirement, to be followed by a 1-year waiting period, as well as
 knowledge of the Estonian language. According to Max van der Stael, the Organiza-
 tion for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) High Commissioner on Na-
 tional Minorities, over 200,000 persons experienced a reduction in status to that of
 resident alien. Automatic citizenship is provided to those who were citizens in 1940
 and their descendants, not to those who moved there during occupation (resident
 aliens). The law establishes a naturalization mechanism.
 In January 1995, Parliament adopted a new Citizenship Law, revising the 1992
 law and combining into one statute provisions regarding citizenship that were scat-
 tered among several pieces of legislation. This lawv became effective in April 1995.
 It extended the residency requirement for naturalization from 2 to 5 years and
 added a requirement for knowledge of the Constitution and the Citizenship Law.
 Persons who had taken up legal residence in Estonia prior to July 1, 1990, are ex-
 empt from the 5-year legal residence and 1-year waiting period requirements. The
 law allows the Government to waive the language requirement but not the civic
 knowledge requirement for applicants who have Estonian language elementary or
 higher education, or who have performed valuable service to Estonia. In an effort
 to fulfill the remaining 2 (of 30) recommendations of the OSCE High Commissioner
 for National Minorities, the Government simplified the civic know edge test and on
 December 9 approved draft legislation that would amend the citizenship law to
 grant automatic citizenship to stateless children bern after February 26, 1992, to
 legally resident stateless parents upon the parents' or guardians' application.
 Based on current law, the followin  classes of persons are ineligible for natu-
 ralization: those filing on the basis of lse data or documents; those not abiding by
 the constitutional system or not fullling the laws; those who have acted against
 the State and its security; those who have committed crimes and been punished
 with a sentence of more than 1 year or who have been repeatedly brought to justice
 for felonies; those who work or have worked in the intelligence or security services
 of a foreign state; or those who have served as care ser sos in the armed forces
 of a foreign state, including those discharged into the reserves or retired. (The latter
 includes spouses who have come to Estonia in connection with the service member's
 assignment to a posting, the reserves, or retirement.) A provision of the law allows
 for the granting of citizenship to a foreign military retiree who has been married
 to a native citizen for 5 years.
 
 
 1072
 Between 1992 and late August, 92,890 persons had received citizenship through
 naturalization. The Russian embassy reported that some 120,000 persons had ob-
 tained Russian citizenship, however, the Embassy declined to supply the Govern-
 ment with a list. The actual number of Russian citizens may be lower since the Em-
 bassy apparently does not keep records of those who die or depart Estonia. The Gov-
 ernment reported that it had issued almost 97,000 residence permits to foreign na-
 tionals.
 While some officials in the Russian Government and in the local Russian commu-
 nity continued to criticize the citizenship law as discriminatory, numerous inter-
 national fact-finding organizations, including the Finnish Helsinki Committee and
 the OSCE, confirm that the Citizenship Law conforms to international standards.
 Bureaucratic delays and the Estonian language requirement are also cited as dis-
 incentives for securing citizenship. The Government has established language train-
 ing centers, but there is a lack of qualified teachers, financial resources, and train-
 ing materials. Some allege that the examination process, which 75 to 90 percent
 pass, is arbitrary.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or poli-
 tics. However, women are underrepresented in government and politics. There are
 11 women among the 101 members of Parliament. One of the presidential can-
 didates was also a woman. The two female ministers continued in office after the
 March cabinet reshuffle. There are six ethnic Russian deputies in Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not restrict the formation or functioning of human rights
 organizations. In response to allegations of poor treatment of ethnic minorities, the
 President established a Human Rights Institute, which first convened in 1992. The
 purpose of the Institute is to monitor human rights in Estonia and to provide infor-
 mation to the international community. It investigates reports of human rights vio-
 lations, such as allegations of police abuse and inhuman treatment of detainees. In
 September the Institute established an information center in the heavily ethnic Rus-
 sian town of Kohtla-Jarve. In addition because of tensions surrounding the adoption
 of the Elections Law and the Aliens Law in 1993, the President established a round
 table composed of representatives of Parliament, the Union of Estonian Nationali-
 ties, and the Russian speaking population's Representative Assembly. An analogous
 but independent round table meets in the county of East Virumaa. In addition with
 initial funding from the Danish government, a nongovernmental legal information
 center in Tallinn provides free legal assistance to individuals-citizen and nonciti-
 zen alike-seeking advice on human rights-related issues.
 In the context of repeated Russian allegations of human rights violations among
 the noncitizen population, both the OSCE mission in Estonia and the OSCE High
 Commissioner on National Minorities have declared that they could not find a pat-
 tern of human rights violations or abuses in Estonia. The Government moved to
 meet the last two of the 30 recommendations of the OSCE High Commissioner on
 National Minorities, 'by simplifying the civic knowledge portion of the naturalization
 process and approving draft legislation to grant automatic citizenship to children
 born to resident stateless persons (see Section 3.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, social status or for any other reason. The Government reports that no
 court cases charging discrimination have been filed.
 Women.-Violence against women, including spousal abuse, was the subject of in-
 creasing discussion and media coverage. According to women's groups and law en-
 forcement officials, family violence is not pervasive. Rape and attempted rape occur
 relatively infrequently. In the first 9 months, there were 76 reported rapes and at-
 tempted rapes, compared with 94 for all of 1996. However, studies show that 40 per-"
 cent of crime in Estonia goes unreported, including domestic violence. Even when
 the police are called, the abused spouse often declines to press charges.
 Discussion of the role and situation of women has been extensive, especially in
 the wake of the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995, as well
 as former Social Affairs Minister Siiri Oviir's run for the presidency. Women possess
 the same legal rights as men and are legally entitled to equal pay for equal work.
 Nevertheless, although women's average educational level was higher than men's,
 their average pay was lower, and the trend did not seem to be improving. There
 continue to be female- and male-dominated professions. Most women carry major
 
 
 1073
 
 household responsibilities in addition to comprising slightly more than one-half of
 the work force.
 Children.-The Government's strong commitment to education is evidenced by the
 high priority it gives to building and refurbishing schools. The Government provides
 free medical care for children and subsidizes school meals. In 1992 the Government
 adopted a Law on Child Protection patterned after the U.N. Convention on the
 Ri hts of the Child.
 There is no societal pattern of child abuse, but a 1995 research project conducted
 by the nongovernmental Estonian Union for Child Welfare on children and violence
 at home found that a significant proportion of children had experienced at least oc-
 casional violence at home, in schools or in youth gangs. A 1996 poll reports that
 3 percent of surveyed children had been sexually molested, while the police reg-
 istered 70 cases of sexual abuse for 1996. At an April conference the chief of juvenile
 police reported that only 20 to 30 percent of cases involving sexual abuse of children
 are reported. There continue to be reports of underage prostitution.
 People With Disabilities.-While the Constitution contains provisions to protect
 disabled persons against discrimination, and both the State and some private orga-
 nizations provide them with financial assistance, little has been done to enable dis-
 abled people to participate normally in public life. There is no public access law, but
 some effort to accommodate the disabled is evident in the inclusion of ramps at
 curbs on new urban sidewalk construction. Public transportation firms have ac-
 quired some vehicles that are accessible to the disabled, as have some taxi compa-
 nies.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The OSCE mission in Estonia, established
 in 1993, continued to promote stability, dialog, and understanding among commu-
 nities in Estonia. In addition the President's Round Table, also established in 1993,
 which is composed of members of Parliament, representatives of the Union of Esto-
 nian Nationalities, and the Representative Assembly of the Russian Community,
 continued to work toward finding practical solutions to problems of noncitizens, as
 did the analogous but independent round table that met in the northeastern part
 of the country (see Section 4).
 The Law on Cultural Autonomy for citizens belonging to minority groups was
 adopted by Parliament and went into effect in 1993. There is a tradition of protec-
 tion for cultural autonomy going back to a 1925 law. Some noncitizens termed the
 law discriminatory, since it restricts cultural autonomy only to citizens. The Govern-
 ment replied that noncitizens can fully participate in ethnic organizations and that
 the law includes subsidies for cultural organizations.
 Ethnic Russians total approximately 29 percent, and nonethnic Estonians as a
 whole some 37 percent, of the population of slightly less than 1.5 million. During
 the years of Estonia's forced annexation by the Soviet Union, large numbers of non-
 Estonians, predominantly ethnic Russians, were encouraged to migrate to Estonia
 to work as laborers and administrators. They and their descendants now make up
 approximately one-third of the total population; about 40 percent of them were born
 in Estonia. About 8 percent of the population of the pre-1940 Republic was ethnic
 Russian.
 Some noncitizens, especially Russians, continued to allege job, salary, and housing
 discrimination because of Estonian language requirements. Russian government of-
 ficials and parliamentarians echoed these charges in a variety of forums. The Gov-
 ernment accepted a Russian Government proposal to establish a high-level commis-
 sion to examine all aspects of bilateral relations. One of the sub-groups of the com-
 mission would examine the humanitarian aspects of the situation of the Russian mi-
 nority in Estonia and possibly of the Estonian minority in Russia. The law makes
 no distinction on the basis of lack of citizenship concerning business or property
 ownership other than for land. A 1996 law on land ownership further liberalized
 land ownership by foreigners; such ownership is now restricted only in certain stra-
 tegic areas. All legal residents of Estonia may participate equally in the privatiza-
 tion of state-owned housing.
 Estonian language requirements for those employed in the civil service went into
 effect in 1993. The new Law on Public Service as originally passed required state
 employees to be proficient in Estonian by the end of 1995. In December 1995, Par-
 liament amended the Law on Public Service to allow noncitizen local and national
 government employees without adequate Estonian to continue working until Feb-
 ruary 1, 1997. No noncitizens were to be hired after January 1, 1996. This amend-
 ment reflected the Government's awareness that in some sectors, the number of em-
 ployees with inadequate Estonian remained high. In May, 3 policemen were dis-
 missed for not knowing sufficient Estonian; earlier in the year, 11 policemen were
 dismissed for not filing for Estonian citizenship by the established deadline. Five
 prosecutors and two judges were dismissed for presenting forged certificates regard-
 
 
 1074
 ing their knowledge of Estonian; two have been restored to their positions; criminal
 charges against one judge were dropped. Three of the prosecutors found employment
 aspolice inspectors.
 The language office liberally grants extensions to persons who can explain their
 failure to meet their requisite competence level in 4 years. Estonian language train-
 ing is available but, some claim, too costly. Some Russian representatives have
 asked for free language training. They also charge that the language requirement
 for citizenship is too difficult, and there has been talk of making the language re-
 quirement less rigorous. The examination fee for either language test-for employ-
 ment or citizenship-is 15 percent of the monthly minimum wage, although it is
 waived for the unemployed.
 Legislation and a government decision provide that in districts where more than
 one-half of the population speak a language other than Estonian, the inhabitants
 are entitled to receive official information in that language. Moreover, the local gov-
 ernment may conduct business in that language. In practice city governments of
 redominantly Russian speaking communities conduct most internal business in
 All residents, whether or not they are citizens, can complain directly to the State
 Court about alleged violations of human or constitutional rights. The State Court
 justices review each case and have decided in favor of complainants. All decisions
 are in Estonian but if a complaint is received in a language other than Estonian
 (usually Russian) the court provides a complimentary translation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to form and
 join a union or employee association. The Central Organization of Estonian Trade
 Unions (EAKL) came into being as a wholly voluntary and purely Estonian organi-
 zation in 1990 to replace the Estonian branch of the official Soviet labor confed-
 eration, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTU). The EAKL has
 75,345 members. The reduced membership levels is due to the move from the large-
 scale industrialized units into smaller production units and the services sector
 which diminished the traditional union base even while white-collar unions gained
 influence. Another trade union, The Organization of Employee Unions (TALO), split
 from the EAKL in 1993 and has 55,000 members. A central union of food processing
 and rural workers was established in June. About one-third of the country's labor
 force belongs to one of the three labor federations.
 The right to strike is legal, and unions are independent of the Government and
 political parties. The Constitution and statutes prohibit retribution against strikers.
 There was a 1-day teachers' strike in May to support demands for higher wages.
 Approximately 2,000 teachers from 70 schools participated.
 Unions may join federations freely and affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While Estonian workers now
 have the legally acquired right to bargain collectively, collective bargaining is still
 in its infancy. According to EAKL leaders, few collective bargaining agreements
 have been concluded between management and workers of a specific enterprise. The
 EAKL has, however, concluded framework agreements with producer associations,
 which provide the basis for specific labor agreements, including the setting of the
 minimum wage. The EAKL was also involved with developing Estonia's new Labor
 Code covering employment contracts, vacation, and occupational safety. The Labor
 Code rohibits antiunion discrimination, and employees have the right to go to court
 to enforce their rights. In 1993 laws covering collective bargaining, collective dispute
 resolution, and shop stewards were enacted.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor although it does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded
 labor by children (see Section 6.d.). The Labor Inspections Office effectively enforces
 this prohibition.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution forbids forced labor for anyone. There were no rep or forced or bonded
 labor by children in enterprises; however, there were instances of families forcing
 their children to en a e in  dding or beggig The Government ratified the U.N.
 Convention on the Rights of the Child whic     orced child labor. The statutory
 minimum for employment is 16 years of age. Minors 13 to 15 years of age may work
 with written permission of a parent or guardian and the local labor inspector, if
 working is not dangerous to the minor's health or considered immoral, does not
 interfere with studies, and if the type of work is included on a government-prepared
 list. Government authorities effectively enforce minimum age laws through inspec-
 tions.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government, after consultations with the
 EAKL and the Central Producers Union, sets the minimum wage. The monthly min-
 imum wage is $60 (845 Estonian crowns). The minimum wage is not sufficient to
 provide a worker and family with a decent standard of living. About 3 percent of
 the work force receive the minimum wage. The average monthly wage in the second
 quarter was about $253.
 The standard workweek is 40 hours, and there is a mandatory 24-hour rest pe-
 riod. According to EAKL sources, legal occupational health and safety standards are
 satisfactory, but they are extremely difficult to achieve in practice. The National
 Labor Inspection Board is responsible for enforcement of these standards, but it has
 not been very effective to date. In addition the labor unions have occupational
 health and safety experts who assist workers into bringing employers in compliance
 with legal standards. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous
 work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
