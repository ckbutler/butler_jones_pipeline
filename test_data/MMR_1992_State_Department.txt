BURMA
 Burma is a military dictatorship and major human rights violator. It is ruled by
 the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which seized power in Sep-
 tember 1988 after suppressing massive prodemocracy demonstrations. These had led
 to the formal departure from power of longtime ruler General Ne Win, whose poli-
 cies had isolated Burma and engendered economic decline. The SLORC is headed
 by the armed forces commander and its members are senior officers who served
 under Ne Win. Although the military permitted a relatively free election in 1990,
 it did not transfer power to the victorious party headed by prodemocracy movement
 leaders. The military attacked the winning political parties through arrests and
 other forms of intimidation. Following the replacement of General Saw Maung by
 General Than Shwe as Chief of State in April, the SLORC opened a limited dialogue
 with some elected politicians nd announced a timetable for steps that could eventu-
 ally lead to adoption of a constitution. Nonetheless, the SLOR reaffirmed its inten-
 tion to rule until a constitution and a civilian government acceptable to the SLORC
 are in p lace.
 The Government enforces its rule by diverse means including a pervasive security
 apparatus led by the Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence (DDSI) and police
 intelligence agencies under the Home Ministry. Control is buttressed by restrictions
 on contact with foreigners; surveillance of government employees and private citi-
 zens; arrests, harassment, and mistreatment of political activists; and repeated de-
 nunciations of supposed agitators linked to foreign interference. The Government
 justifies its security measures as necessary to maintain order and combat
 
 
 523
 insurgencies, though in recent years these have posed little threat to major popu-
 lation centers.
 Burma is primarily an agricultural country, although it has substantial mineral
 resources. It has a centrally directed economy. After Ne Win's 26-year rule reduced
 Southeast Asia's richest land to a United Nations-designated "least developed coun-
 try,", the SLORC abandoned the "Burmese Way to Socialism" in 1988, opening up
 the economy to permit modest private sector expansion and attract investment as
 well as badly needed foreign exchange. It has failed, however, to address fundamen-
 tal problems: overcentralized decision making; restrictions on private commerce; a
 grossly overvalued currency rapid  netar e.xpansion; a bloated bureaucracy; poor
 civilian infrastructure; and disprportionate military spending.
 While the Governme'nt took some positive human right steps in 1992, the deplor-
 able human rights situation remained fundamentally unchanged. Politically moti-
 hGoverment                                  an  ed         that it would re-
 lease all political prisoners not threatening 'state security. The Government freed
 over 1,200 political prisoners and allowed relatives of detained Nobel Laureate Aung
 San Suu   i to visit for the first time since 1989. In September it abolished sum-
 mary martial law tribunals and lifted a nationwide curfew. However, over 270,000
 Rohngya Muslims fled to Bangladesh from Burma's Arakan state, alleging persecu-
 tion, forced labor, and rape by government forces. Political arrests continued, albeit
 at a reduced level, and an estimated 1,000 political prisoners remained in custody.
 Arbitrary detentions and compulsory labor persisted, as did harsh treatment and
 torture of detainees. Freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and association re-
 mained nonexistent.
 The military continued to negate the people's right to change their government
 by failing to implement the 1990 election, in which the opposition National League
 for Democracy (NLD) won over 80 percent of the seats. The 485 elected Members
 of Parliament (M.P.'s) never met as a constituent assembly or Parliament. By year's
 end, well over 100 of them, over 25 percent of the NLD winners, had either resigned
 under pressure, fled into exile, been disqualified after conviction on political
 charges, or died.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Exitrajudicial Killing.-There were a few allegations of gov-
 ernment-directed killing that appeared plausible but could not be confirmed. For ex-
 ample, Muslim refugees from Arekan State and ethnic Karen refugees from eastern
 Burma reported several instances of extrajudicial killings in 1992 which could not
 be investigated independently because the Government restricts access to these re-
 mote areas. Multiple sources confirm that NLD activist Mohamed lyas died under
 detention in Maungdaw township of Arakan State in June. It appears likely that
 his death was related to beatings by security personnel. As in previous years, there
 were also credible reports that up to several hundred prisoners-mainly common
 criminals--died while performing forced labor under inhuman conditions.
 While there was no irrefutable evidence that summary executions were carried
 out against civilians in 1992, some knowledgeable observers believe that secret
 extrajudicial killings occur occasionally. A number of prisoners remained under
 death sentences after trials (in previous years) which fell far short of international
 standards. However, well-placed observers believe that no death sentences were ac-
 tually carried out.
 b. Disappearance.-The number of disappearances in 1992 was probably relatively
 low and little changed from the previous year, but accurate estimates are impos-
 sible. Family and friends assume that those who have disappeared are under deten-
 tion or have died in jail. Some who disappeared were later reported as arrested.
 Others may have dropped out of sight or quietly attempted to leave the country for
 fear of arrest. A handful of youths continued to join student insurgent groups fight-
 ing the regime while many others were impressed as army porters.
 Authorities rarely responded to inquiries from embassies or from families concern-
 ing the whereabouts and welfare of disappeared or jailed people. The few replies
 routinely consisted of only general statements that such people were arrested for
 violations of existing laws.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Substantial evidence documents that beatings and mistreatment of political detain-
 ees continued to take place in Burmese prisons and detention centers operated by
 the DDSI. The number of new reports declined somewhat in 1992, primarily due to
 the decrease in politically motivated arrests. Detainees are held incommunicado
 
 
 524
 during the early phases of interrogation, when the most serious abuses generally
 take place.
 Family members are not allowed to meet detainees during the pretrial period
 which at times lasts several months or even years. Common forms of maltreatment
 include: sleep and food deprivation; beatings of prisoners severe enough to cause
 permanent injury and forcing prisoners to squat or assume unnatural positions for
 lengthy periods. Techniques designed to intimidate and disorient prisoners prior to
 interrogation are also routine. Such practices as electrical shocks to the genitals,
 suffocation, and cigarette burns have also been reported in recent years and prob-
 ably continued in 1992.
 Guards and prison physicians also have prevented political prisoners from receiv-
 ing needed medical treatment. Imprisoned activists have received beatings after re-
 questing medical attention, according to several credible reports. At least two credi-
 ble sources also reported sexual abuse of female prisoners, although there is no evi-
 dence that such abuse occurs regularly. Despite repeated expressions of concern by
 foreign governments and international human rights organizations, the authorities
 made no effort to investigate charges of torture or to punish members of the security
 forces involved. The Government routinely denied that it engaged in torture or con-
 doned the practice.
 The Government reportedly gave inadequate food, water, medical care, and pro-
 tection from the elements to prisoners assigned to forced labor, such as harvesting
 and road construction in remote areas.
 Despite repeated requests and an explicit recommendation of the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission (UNHCR), the Government did not allow prison visits by the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The regime arbitrarily detained or ar-
 rested at least a few hundred people during 1992. Exact figures are not available
 since the SLORC frequently does not announce arrests or detentions and deflects
 most inqu iries on detentions. The rate of arbitrary detentions dropped after April
 1992 and the number of persons held without trial probably declined substantially
 from 1991.
 The Government held most detainees only a short time and released them after
 interrogation, but subsequently rearrested some. Political detainees were commonly
 accused of violating statutes outlawing treason or vaguely defined antigovernment
 activities; some were charged with common crimes or simply held without charges.
 Detention and interrogation of political party officials occurred regularly in the early
 part of 1992 either as harassment or reprisals for antigovernment statements or
 actions. While most detainees were members of political parties or people involved
 in distributing antigovernment literature, businessmen and other private citizens
 were also subject to arbitrary detention. Though such detentions were much less fre-
 quent after April 1992, they remained sufficiently common to instill fear among the
 population.
 he military, without public announcement, again extended the house arrest of
 NLD General Secretary and 1991 Nobel Peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. The
 decision was taken under the provisions of the "Law to Safeguard the State From
 the Dangers of Subversive Elements"-also the basis for her initial year of house
 arrest which began in 1989. As amended in August 1991, this law authorizes 1-year
 extensions of arbitrary detention without charge or trial for up to 5 years. Aung San
 Suu Kyi has never been formally charged. The military Government allowed her
 husband and two sons to visit her in 1992, the first such visits permitted since 1989.
 Former Prime Minister U Nu and several close associates, who had been held
 under house arrest since December 1989, were among the first to benefit from the
 military's political prisoner release program in April 1992.
 There is no provision in Burmese law for judicial determination of the legality of
 detention. Bail may be granted by civilian courts in some circumstances. The num-
 ber of political detainees not sentenced by year's end is impossible to determine ac-
 curately but was probably at most a few hundred. Most persons held for political
 reasons were sentenced prior to the abolition of milita% tribunals in September.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-Throughout 1992 the Government continued to
 rule by decree and was not bound by any constitutional provisions guaranteeing fair
 public trials or any other rights. Until abolished in September military tribunals
 exercised jurisdiction over all cases involving defiance of orAers issued by the
 SLORC or local commanders. These tribunals could mete out the death penalty, a
 life sentence, or a minimum of 3-years' imprisonment with hard labor irrespective
 of existin laws.
 The tri unals were free to summon or reject witnesses, and to consider or ignore
 evidence. The accused were not presumed innocent and had no right to a defense
 attorney. When allowed to participate, a defense attorney's role was severely him-
 
 
 525
 ited. Subject to certain conditions, those convicted by military tribunals could file
 appeals or requests for clemency. Significantly, among hundreds of cases known to
 be tried by such tribunals, there were no reports of acquittals or convictions over-
 turned on appeal.
 In early 1992, the military courts continued to hand out heavy sentences to politi-
 cal prisoners, ranging upto 15 years' imprisonment for peaceful opposition activity.
 Among those receiving long prison sentences were over 200 students who partici-
 pated In nonviolent December 1991 demonstrations at Rangoon University to mark
 the granting of the Nobel Peace Prize to Aung San Suu Kyi. It remains impossible
 to determine accurately the number of political prisoners in Burma, but credible
 sources suggest roughly 1,000 may be in jail. After denying for years that it held
 any political prisoners, maintaining that all those jailed are common lawbreakers
 and insurgent terrorists," the Government in 1992 announced its intention to free
 those persons 'detained politically who did not represent a threat to state security.
 It subsequently announced the release of over 1,200 persons, although fewer than
 200 were publicly identified by name. It also implicitly acknowledged that political
 prisoners had been held not only in Rangoon's Insein prison but also in over 20
 upcountry locations-many of which were still believed to hold some political pris-
 oners at year's end. Remaining political prisoners included former Generals Tin Oo
 and Kyi Maung, beth of whom had served as Chairmen of the NLD, comedian
 Zargana, and lawyer U Nay Min.
 Prior to September 1992, military courts handled most political cases. Civil suits
 and common crimes of no interest to the State were left to civilian courts. Though
 corruption remains widespread and judges vulnerable to pressure from the military,
 informed sources report that these civiian courts have become somewhat more pro-
 fessional and fair in handling nonpolitical cases since 1988. Some basic due process
 rights, including the right to a public trial and to be represented by a defense attor-
 ney, are generally respected by civilian judges.
 f.Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family. Home, or Correspondence.-The
 State continued to intrude extensively into the lives of private citizens during 1992.
 Forced entry and warrantless, unannounced searches of private homes were often
 conducted. The Government strictly monitored the travel, whereabouts, and activi-
 ties of many Burmese, including political leaders elected in 1990. A ubiquitous sys-
 tem of neighborhood informers reported on dissidents and critics of the regime. Se-
 curity personnel selectively monitored private correspondence and telephone calls.
 Contacts or communications involving foreigners were subject to especially intense
 scrutiny and government employees were generally required to obtain advance per-
 mission before meeting with foreigners.
 Government propaganda repeatedly denounced various foreign news organizations
 for interference in Burma's affairs and private citizens were generally unable to sub-
 scnbe directly to foreign ublications. Two international news magazines are dis-
 tributed through officia hannels but censors occasionally banned issues or deleted
 articles criticizing local conditions or reporting opposition activities. While the Gov-
 ernment continued to discourage listening to foreign radio broadcasts, these re-
 mained a prime source of information for the Burmese people and even the military.
 Foreign journalists including television crews were granted much greater access to
 the country after April 1992, though their movements and contacts were closely
 monitored.
 The Government continued a program of forced resettlement, involving an esti-
 mated half-million people throughout Burma since 1989. While all those forced to
 move were described as "squatters," some people had been living and paying rent
 on these properties for many years and had constructed permanent houses. The
 Government has resettled people, almost totally at their own expense, to "new
 towns" which are far from their previous residences. Occupants often live on former
 rice paddy land, subject to flooding in the rainy season, without adequate transpor-
 tation, medical facilities, shelter, or sanitation. However, conditions at some reset-
 tlement sites were continuing to improve in 1992, and some outside experts accept
 the Government's explanation that the resettlement program serves legitimate long-
 term urban planning objectives. They do not, however, endorse the forceful methods
 often used to move people.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The Burmese army has battled insurgencies for more than four decades in
 conflicts that have resulted in widespread human rights violations, including mis-
 treatment and killing of prisoners, neglect of sick and wounded, impressment of ci-
 vilians for porter duty, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians. While the Govern-
 ment was responsible for the bulk of these abuses, insurgent groups also ignored
 humanitarian principles.
 
 
 526
 Insurgent groups engage in small-scale fighting, mostly in remote areas, to gain
 greater autonomy from the dominant ethnic Burman mority. Some of these groups
 receive outside support from international religious and humanitarian organizations
 while others are financed at least partially through trafficking and/or producing nar-
 cotics, as are several former insurgent groups with which the Government now has
 cease-fire accommodations. The SLORC announced a halt to offensive operations
 against ethnic Karen insurgents in April 1992 and subsequently stated that this de-
 cision applied to counterinsurgency operations elsewhere, but fighting continued and
 most rebel groups rejected the Government's call to 'rejoin the legal fold."
 In 1992 there were confirmed reports of deaths of impressed Burmese army por-
 ters. The Burmese military continues to use civilian corvee labor and prison labor
 in combat areas. There were reliable reports, for example, that at least 1,000 pris-
 oners from jails in Rangoon, Mandalay, and other cities were sent to work as porters
 during the military's dry season offensive against the headquarters of the Karen
 National Union and the opposition's "National Coalition Government of the Union
 of Burma" at Mannerplaw on the Thai/Burma border.
 Credible reports from multiple sources indicated that porters carry ammunition,
 supplies, and wounded under the harshest conditions. Other well-placed sources also
 note that they were subject to hostile fire as well as maltreatment at the hands of
 Burmese soldiers. At times, they were placed at the head of columns to detonate
 mines and booby traps and to spring ambushes. When porters were wounded, ill,
 or unable to continue their work, they were left unattended to die. At the end of
 their service, survivors often had to find their own means to return home.
 According to several credible reports, in 1992 the Government frequently engaged
 in forcible relocation of rural populations as part of its counterinsurgency cam-
 paigns. Over 10,000 predominantly Catholic villagers were relocated from villages
 in southern Shan state and Kayah state in March 1992, according to multiple
 sources. Thousands of refugees reaching Thailand reportedly fled similar operations
 in Karen and Kayah states.
 Insurgent groups were also responsible for violence causing civilian and military
 deaths, including reported killings of civilians during attacks on villages and am-
 bushes or mining of transportation routes. Some insurgent groups also routinely en-
 gaged in conscription of children into their armed forces. In Februa  the Northern
 Branch (NB) of the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) acknowledged
 executing at least 15 people in Kachin state on charges of spying for the military
 Government. ABSDF (NB) leaders tortured and abused several dozen other accused
 "spies."
 As in the past, Burmese authorities denied impartial observers permission to
 travel to areas of heavy insurgent activity for security reasons. Although some jour-
 nalists were able to enter border areas from neighboring countries with the assist-
 ance of insurgent groups, information about human rights abuses by either side in
 those areas is extremely difficult to verify.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.--Severe restrictions on freedom of speech and the
 press persisted throughout 1992, with only marginal improvement over the previous
 year. Though the degree of enforcement varied, the Government did not tolerate op-
 posing views or criticism. Private citizens remained reluctant to express opinions for
 Iear of government informers. The Government continued to ban publications which
 criticized its programs and policies.
 The Government continued to operate the mass media, including television, radio,
 and the only newspapers-two national dailies in Burmese and one in English as
 well as daily papers published by the Rangoon city government and the Central
 (Mandalay area) Military Command. Military officials appoint newspaper editors
 and approve editorials in advance. Especially for domestic news, journalists must
 hew to strict publishing and broadcast guidelines. The Government receives the
 product of international wire, services, but selects and edits world news before publi-
 cation or broadcast. All forms of communication--domestic and imported books and
 periodicals, stage plays, motion pictures and musical recordings-are officially con-
 trolled and censored. Criticism of the Government, its officials, or sectors of the
 economy it controls has generally not been permitted. In 1992, however, the official
 press broadened its coverage of such previously taboo topics as man-made and natu-
 ral disasters in Burma. It also published some limited criticism and satire directed
 at economic failings and corruption by lesser officials. In 1992 the official media con-
 tinued the Government's propaganda campaign against "decadent" Western culture.
 Although the authorities sometimes sponsored Western-style concerts to raise funds,
 Burmese were generally discouraged from adopting Western styles of music, dance,
 
 
 527
 and dress. Nevertheless, foreign audio and video recordings, as well as modem
 Western clothing, remained widely available and extremely popular in Burma.
 University teachers and professors are subject to the same restrictions on freedom
 of speech, political activities, and publications as other government employees.
 These inclue frequent warnings against criticism of the Government; repeated in-
 structions not to discuss politics while at work; and strictures against joining or sup-
 porting political parties, engaging in political activity, and meeting foreign officials.
 In early 1992 the Government continued a purge begun in 1991 against civil serv-
 ants and teachers accused of political disloyalty and 'deceptive practices." At least
 several hundred were fired from their jobs.
 Virtually the entire Burmese university system was closed from the time of the
 1988 disturbances until August 1992, except for a brief period in the summer and
 fall of 1991 which ended when Rangoon and Mandalay University students staged
 prodemocracy demonstrations in December 1991. Prior to the opening of the new
 academic year in August 1992, all educators were required to attend a month-long
 refresher course" designed to reinforce discipline and "people management* skills.
 A similar political indoctrination and reeducation course was given to all doctors as
 well.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government does not re-
 spect the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. A prohibition on outdoor assemblies
 of more than five people was unevenly enforced, but political demonstrations were
 strictly banned.
 Political parties were required to request permission from the authorities even to
 hold internal meetings of their own membership. The military's intimidation gen-
 erally served to discourage public expressions of antigovernment sentiments. In the
 few reported instances of opposition political activity, security forces intervened
 swiftly to arrest participants in unauthorized meetings and to halt distribution of
 antigovernment leaflets.
 The right of association exists only for those organizations permitted by law and
 duly registered with the Government. Moreover, the Government severely restricts
 the activities of even these organizations. Ten political parties remained formally
 legal at the end of 1992-down from 75 at the beginning of the year-but they were
 effectively paralyzed through arrests, intimidation, and constant surveillance. Under
 government pressure, the leading opposition NLD dropped former Chairman Tin Oo
 and other detained leaders from the party. Trade associations and professional bod-
 ies, like other organizations, are permitted only if sanctioned by the Government,
 which strictly monitors their activities. Members are not free to discuss politics or
 criticize the regime.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in law and, despite
 human rights abuses against some believers, is widely observed in practice. Mid-
 dhist pagodas, Moslem mosques, and Christian churches operate openly with mini-
 mal interference, at least in those areas of central Burma accessible to independent
 observers. The great majority of Burmese are Buddhist, and the military Govern-
 ment frequently proclaims its commitment to Buddhism in seeking to establish its
 own legitimacy. Buddhists occupy most key positions in the military Government
 and civilian bureaucracy. Sizable numbers of Christians, Muslims, and animists
 exist, particularly among various minority ethnic groups. While generally allowing
 these groups to practice freely, security services monitor the activities of some reli-
 gious communities. The Government requires all religious organizations to register
 and subjects religious publications to the same control and censorship imposed on
 secular ones. While few if any monks were reportedly arrested in 1992, little infor-
 mation emerged on the whereabouts or fate of those monks detained after passive
 prtest activity in 1990. Restrictions on unauthorized religious groups remained in
 orce and the military continued to monitor activities in and around Buddhist mon-
 asteries and pagodas.
 Religious groups can and did establish links with coreligionists in other countries,
 although such links were reportedly monitored by the Government. The Catholic
 Church, for example, maintained ties to the Vatican. While foreign religious rep-
 resentatives were usually allowed only to obtain visas for short stays, in some cases
 they were permitted to preach to Burmese congregations. Though permanent mis-
 sionary establishments have not been permitted since the 1960's, a few foreign
 Catholic nuns and at least one priest continued to reside upcountry.
 As part of its large-scale "urban development" program in recent years the Gov-
 ernment has taken control of several Christian and Muslim properties tiroughout
 Burma.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -Although Burmese citizens have the legal right to live anywhere in the
 country, an estimated 500,000 poor urban residents have been forcibly relocated to
 
 
 rural areas since 1989. Rural populations were also subject to forced resettlement
 in connection with counterinsurgency operations. Except for limitations in areas of
 insurgent activity, Burmese citizens could travel freely within the country but had
 to inform local authorities of their temporary place of residence. People who failed
 to report either guests or intentions to stay overnight to the authorities were subject
 to a jail term, and arrests were occasionally made. From September 1988 until Sep-
 tember 1992, the Government enforced a nationwide nighttime curfew. Citing an
 improved security situation, the Government then lifted the curfew.
 Burmese authorities continued to restrict the right of everyone to leave the coun-
 try. Passort applicants had to justif4 the reason for each trip abroad, generally
 supported by an employment offer or similar document. Legal requirements, bureau-
 cratic procedures, and corruption caused long delays in obtaining passports. Emi-
 grants were required to reimburse the Government for "educational expenses" be-
 fore receiving exit permission and were severely limited in what they could take
 with them. Those who left Burma illegally were able to return but had to go through
 judicial proceedings.
 Burmese citizens who left legally were generally allowed to return to visit rel-
 atives. The law does not recognize dual citizenship, however, and acuing citizen-
 ship in another country results in loss of Burmese nationality. While those who took
 citizenship in another country continued to be legally banned from returning, the
 Government has shown flexibility within recent years in permitting some former
 Burmese to visit and to engage in business. Emigrants wishing to return perma-
 nently were required to reapply for Burmese citizenship, and approval was not guar-
 anteed. Noncitizen residents, including ethnic Indians and Chinese born in Burma
 who hold foreigners' registration cards, must obtain permission to travel.
 Early in the year, upwards of 270,000 Muslims refugees fled from Arakan State
 to Bangladesh. The Government has denied allegations of abuse, initially depicting
 the refugees as illegal aliens fleeing to avoid routine immigration checks. However,
 on April 28, the Burmese Foreign Minister signed an agreement with his
 Bangladeshi counterpart for the safe and voluntary return within 6 months of all
 those who could prove prior residence in Burma. By year's end only a very small
 percentage of the refugees had returned to Burma, with others citing continuing
 fear of persecution unless Burma allowed independent international monitoring of
 conditions in Arakan State. The Burmese Government steadfastly refused to allow
 representatives of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees or any other inter-
 national agency to perform such a monitoring role. In addition to the Rohingyas, ap-
 proximately 70,000 other Burmese have fled to Thailand.
 Foreign refugees or displaced people may not resettle or seek safe haven in
 Burma. The Government treats people claiming to be refugees as illegal immigrants
 and expels or imprisons them.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Burma is governed solely by the military, and the Burmese people do not have
 the right or the ability peacefully to change their government. Active duty military
 officers replaced civilians in important positions throughout all levels of the bu-
 reaucracy, particularly the policy ranks, over the past 4 years. Military or recently
 retired military officers occupied most Cabinet-level positions, numerous director
 eneral and subordinate posts, and key positions previously held by technocrats in
 e economic ministries. This trend ontinued in 1992 despite appointment of a few
 civilian cabinet ministers. In May 1990, the Government held Burma's first national
 election involving multiple parties in 30 years. While the election campaign was se-
 verely restricted and several leading opposition figures were barred from participa-
 tion, election day procedures were notably free and fair.
 In the election, the NLD got nearly 60 percent of valid votes cast and won over
 80 percent of the seats. Ethnic-based parties allied to the NLD won many of the
 other seats, with the progoyernment National Unity Party (NUP) gaining only about
 10 percent of the vote and 2 percent of the seats. By the end of 1992, however, the
 military Government still had not empowered the elected members of Parliament
 as either a constituent assembly or a legislative body. Meanwhile, it arrested most
 of the NLD leadership. By April 1992, over 100 elected opposition politicians had
 either resigned under pressure, gone into exile, been detained, or died. At least 70
 had been arrested on political charges, over 20 fled the country, more than a dozen
 resigned, and one died in custody. Though at least 40 elected members were subse-
 quently released from jail, all had been legally disqualified from their mandates and
 in most cases expelled from their political parties as a result of strong government
 pressure.
 
 
 529
 In 1992 the Government held three "coordination meetinP" with officials of the
 remaining political parties to discuss participation in a national convention sched-
 uled to open on January 9, 1993. However, the sessions provided limited opportuni-
 ties for dialog with legitimate opposition leaders, and the SLORC continued to insist
 that transfer of power to a civilian government can occur only after completion of
 a protracted constitution-drafting process under its control The conditions it has
 imposed effectively negate the election results and ensure indefinite military rule.
 Indigenonus and tribal populations in outlying regions of Burma are generally ex-
 cluded from ranking positions in the military and civil service, which are dominated
 by the ethnic Burman majority. Like other citizens of Burma, they are denied the
 right to change their government or participate meaningfully in the national politi-
 cal process. In some regions where government forces exercise limited or no control,
 however, indigenous populations have considerable autonomy in running their own
 political and economic affairs. Even in government-controlled areas, they generally
 retain their social and cultural institutions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No internal human rights organizations were allowed to exist. The Government
 continued to resent outside scrutiny of its human rights record and was only selec-
 tively willing to discuss human rights problems with foreign governments or non-
 governmental organizations concerned with human rights. The military consistently
 denied charges of abuses and criticized other governments and independent organi-
 zations for interfering in its affairs.
 The UNHRC appointed "independent experts' who visited Burma in 1990 and
 1991 to examine Burma's human rights situation and subsequently presented con-
 fidential reports to the UNHRC's 1991 and 1992 sessions. In November 1991 and
 1992, the U.N. General Assembly adopted increasingly strong resolutions urging
 Burma's Government to establish a democratic state and to allow all citizens to par-
 ticipate freely in the democratic process. The 1992 resolution called on the Govern.
 ment to release Aung San Suu Kyi and other detained political leaders and to re-
 store democracy by respecting the will of the Burmese people as expressed in the
 1990 elections.
 In March the UNHRC decided to appoint a Special Rapporteur to continue study-
 ing the human rights situation and submit published reports to the U.N. General
 Assembly and the UNHRC. The Special Rapporteur, Professor Yazo Yokota, pre-
 sented an interim report to the General Assembly which included detailed allega-
 tions as well as the Government's denials of serious human rights abuses. Professor
 Yokota subsequently visited Burma as well as neighboring countries to investigate
 Burma's human rights situation. Though visits to Insein prison and the Bngdesh
 border were arranged by the Government, it denied his requests to meet with Aung
 San Suu Kyi and other prominent political detainees. Burmese military intelligence
 also used heavy surveillance and intimidation to dissuade other persons from meet-

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Burma's numerous ethnic minorities have been underrepresented in the Govern-
 ment and largely excluded from the military leadership. These minorities have their
 own distinct cultures and languages. Despite recently increased government atten-
 tion economic development among minorities continued to lag and many still live
 at the subsistence level. This is due in large part to government economic policies
 and geographic constraints on economic development in the rugged, isolated, border
 areas populated by minorities. People not of ethnic Burmese ancestry, primarily In-
 dians and Chinese continued to be denied full citizenship and excluded from gov-
 ernment positions. No matter how strong their academic credentials, such minonties
 are barred from prestigious university programs in medicine and technological
 fields. In addition, some have been demed national identity cards, especially in
 Arakan State. Indian and Chinese minorities continued to play an important role
 in the economy-a situation resented by many Burmans. Social prejudice against
 the country's Muslim community has in the past erupted into violence and prompted
 official actions infringing on the practice of Islam. Multiple, reliable sources indi-
 cated that the military occasionally required minority populations to provide with-
 out compensation vehicles, equipment, and lodging for soldiers.
 In 1992 there were numerous reports which were highly consistent but difficult
 to verify that Government troops committed abuses against Muslims in Arakan
 state, including widespread use of forced labor, destruction of mosques and Muslim
 cemeteries, and large-scale arrests, beatings, and rapes. Some refugees have claimed

 that the army forcibly uprooted civilian populations to facilitate use of their land
 by Buddhists from elsewhere in Arakan state.
 Women in Burma have long ejoyed a vrhigh status, exercising most of the
 same basic rights as men and aing an active role in business. They keep their
 own names afier marriage and often control family finances. However, participation
 of women remained low in the minuscule industrial sector and in the bureaucracy
 and there are also a few professions such as forestry and geology which are bar
 to women. There continued to be no women's rights organizations in Burma.
 There was no nationwide pattern of violence directed specifically against women.
 Multiple, reliable reports emerging in 1992 made it clear, however, that many Bur-
 mese women and children were forced or lured into serving as prostitutes in Thai-
 land. Recruitment of these women generally occurred in remote areas where Bur-
 mese officials exercised at best nominal control. In 1992 foreign media accounts al-
 leged that Burmese officials had used cyanide injections to execute prostitutes re-
 turning from Thailand who were found to be human immuno virus positive. How-
 ever, two well-placed sources provided evidence indicating that these charges were
 implausible and possibly disinformation. Although Burmese culturally view raps
 with great abhorrence, there were widespread unverifiable reports of rapes commit-
 ted in 1992 by Burmese soldiers against Muslim women in Arakan State and
 against ethnic minority women elsewhere in the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Since 1988 the Government has banned the workers'
 and peasants' organizations set up by the previous government. Several political
 parties established workers' organizations or committees to consider labor issues,
 but there continued to be no trade unions and no independent labor movement in
 Burma. Workers were not free to form or join trade unions of their own choosing,
 and leaders of unofficial labor associations were subject to arrest. Workers do not
 have the right to strike and none did so in 1992.
 In Anril 1989, the United States suspended Burma's eligibility for trade conces-
 sions under the Generalized System of Preferences Program pending steps to afford
 its labor force internationally recognized worker rights. In 1  a  S. interagency
 government committee declined a formal request to reconsider the suspension.
 In June 1992, the International Labor Organization (ILO) called on Burma *to lift
 restrictions on the freedom of workers and employers to establish occupational orga-
 nizations of their own and to make trade union pluralism possible."
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers continued to have
 no right to organize and bargain collectively and military authorities remained the
 sole arbiter of workers' issues. The Government abolished labor arbitration boards
 in 1988 which, while government-controlled, at least theoretically provided means
 for airing labor disputes.
 No special exprtprocessing zones exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Burma's Legal Code does not pro-
 hibit forced labor. The military routinely employed corvee labor on its myriad build-
 ing projects and, according to credible reports, officials at times accepted bribes to
 excuse people from work. A major reason for the exodus of over 270 000 Muslims
 from Arakan state, according to multiple sources, was the policy of conscripting
 forced labor. As documented in detailed submissions by the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions (ICFIU) to the ILO, the Burmese army has for dec-
 ades conscripted civilian males to serve as porters. According to numerous eye-
 witness reports this past year, the army continued to take youths off the streets not
 only in minority areas but also in several cities and towns of central Burma. Women
 were also impressed as cooks and launderers for soldiers in frontline areas, accord-
 ing to credible reports. Military authorities commonly permitted conscripts and their
 families to pay money in lieu of porter duty.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Children aged 13 to 15 may work
 4 hours a day. The penalty for employers who disregard this regulation, 2 years in
 rison, generally was not enforced. In cities working children were highly visible.
 Many spent their nights on the street, according to numerous reliable sources. They
 were hired at lower rates than adults for the same kind of work, and economic pres-
 sure forced them to work not only for their survival but also to support their fami-
 lies.
 Burmese law requires children to attend school through the fourth standard, usu-
 ally reached between the ages of 12 and 15. The Department of Basic Education es-
 timated, however, that 38 percent of children aged 5 to 9 never enroll in school. Of
 those who do, less than 30 percent complete the fourth grade. Two-thirds of Burma's
 primary school children, principally in rural areas, leave school for economic rea-
 sons. In the higher grades, the dropout rate for girls is double that of boys.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a legally prescribed 5-day 35-hour
 workweek for employees in the public sector and a 6-day, 44-hour workweek for pri-
 vate and parastatal sector employees, with overtime paid for additional work. Work-
 ers have 21 paid holidays a year. While there is a government-mandated minimum
 wage, it remained insufficient to provide a decent standard of living. The actual av-
 erage wage rate for casual laborers in Rangoon was about twice the official mini-
 mum. Wages continued to lag far behind inflation. There continued to be numerous
 provisions to protect health and safety at work places pertaining to room size, ven-
 tilation, fire hazards, and the availability of latrines and drinking water. In practice,
 these were seldom enforced, particularly in the private sector.
