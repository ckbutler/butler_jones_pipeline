 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, the former New Hebrides, is a South Pacific Island
 nation with an estimated population of 140,000. One of three
 countries comprising Melanesia, Vanuatu became independent in
 1980, following more than 70 years of joint British-French
 rule. It has a parliamentary system of government with a
 prime minister and a 46-member parliament. Independence was
 accompanied by temporary political tdrbulence, including an
 attempt at secession, which left a legacy of suspicion towards
 outside interference. Most of the internal strains from the
 1980 secessionist rebellion have now subsided.
 Political legitimacy in Vanuatu is based on majority rule,
 supported by both Melanesian and Western tradition. The first
 general election since independence, held in November 1983,
 was vigQrously contested and democratically conducted. A
 second parliamentary election, also vigorously and
 democratically contested, took place in November 1987. The
 courts are independent and solicitous of individual rights.
 The police and military are under civilian control.
 The Vanuatu economy resembles that of other Pacific isl~nd
 states in its dependence on international trade and its
 vulnerability to shifts in world market prices. In the past,
 tourism earned more foreign exchange than all exports combined.
 Recently, however, the tourist industry has been depressed, and
 foreign investment has declined.
 The human rights situation in Vanuatu remained favorable in
 1987.

 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.

 or degrading treatment are observed in practice and enforced
 by the courts. Prisoners also have recourse to an Ombudsman.

 a speedy hearing before a judge is observed. The use of
 forced or compulsory labor is not permitted and there have
 been no reports of either practice.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a fair public
 trial, presumption of innocence until proof of guilt,
 prohibition against double jeopardy, the right of habeas
 corpus, and appeal to the Supreme Court. The courts are
 independent of military or executive interference. There were
 no reports of arbitrary or unfair exercise of judicial
 authority in 1987.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Sanctity of the home and family and privacy of correspondence
 are obderved.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedom of expression is provided for in the
 Constitution, the Government publishes and controls the
 country's only national newspaper and manages the national
 radio station. There is no independent newspaper or radio.
 b. Freedom of-Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political
 parties or trade unions in Vanuatu. There are two main
 political parties and several smaller ones. To an extent
 unusual among Pacific island states, the ruling Vanua'aku Pati
 is the primary policy-making body; its decisions are
 implemented by the Government. Vanuatu has a small but active
 trade union movement with the right to organize, strike, and
 bargain collectively. The right to strike was exercised most
 recently in 1985 when the teachers' and health workers' unions
 staged strikes. In 1986 there were 23 registered trade unions
 and 6 employer associations. The Vanuatu Trade Union Congress
 is a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is protected by law and respected in
 practice. Missionaries of various Christian denominations
 work without restriction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 . Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Vanuatu citizens are free to travel internally and
 externally. There are no restrictions on returning home from
 abroad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 "to Change Their Government
 Vanuatu is a multiparty democracy. Numerous candidates
 competed in the parliamentary elections in 1983 and 1987; both
 the campaign and voting were considered by outside observers
 to have been fair. Elections to provincial and local councils
 have also been contested and fair. However, the Vanualaku
 Party in the past has been known to use government power to
 restrict opposition political activity, for example, by
 denying other parties the use of the government-owned radio

 and press. Also, there have been reports, in the aftermath of
 the November 1987 elections, of instances of harassment
 against individual communities suspected of having supported
 opposition candidates.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no charges of human rights violations in 1987.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most of the population is comprised of Melanesians whose
 ancestors migrated from New Guinea. There are small
 minorities of Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese, Tongans, and
 others; most minority groups are concentrated in the two towns
 and on a few plantations. There is no discrimination against
 these minorities. Although there have been rumors of corrupt
 practices by members of the ruling Vanua'aku Party, there is
 no evidence to suggest a pattern of discrimination in the
 Government provision of basic services.
 While women have equal rights under the law, they are only
 slowly emerging from a traditional culture characterized by
 male dominance, a general reluctance to educate women, and a
 widespread belief that women should devote themselves primarily
 to child rearing. Nevertheless, an increasing number of women
 are finding work in the unskilled, semiskilled, and social
 occupations. Several women hold senior positions in the
 Government, but otherwise women have not found their way into
 positions of leadership.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Vanuatu has a minimum wage law. There is also legislation
 regulating conditions of work, including hours, and child
 labor. No information is available on occupational safety and
 health legislation. A large proportion of the population is
 still engaged in subsistence agriculture or fishing.
