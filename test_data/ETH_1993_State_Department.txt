 ETHIOPIA
 The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) took power in
 1991 at the conclusion of a lengthy civil war with the dictatorial regime of Mengistu
 Haile Mariam and established the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE). The
 EPRDF also organized a National Conference which approved a National Charter
 to function as the Constitution during the transitional period. The TGE, headed by
 President Meles Zenawi, pledged to oversee the establishment of Ethiopia's first
 multiparty democracy, based on a constitution still being drafted in 1993. The TGE
 projects elections in 1994 for a constituent assembly and a new national govern-
 ment.
 The Council of Representatives, comprising 65 members, is dominated by the four
 constituent parties of the EPRDF and serves as a quasi-legislature. The EPRDF
 and, by extension, the TGE are dominated by the Tigray People's Liberation Front
 (TPLF), whose members include the President and most key officials dealing with
 national security. The accession of Tigrayans and a policy promoting ethnic identity
 and regionalism have engendered animosity from Amharas who have traditionally
 held centralized power in Ethiopia. In 1993 the TGE continued to implement its
 planned devolution of authority to regional governments and its planned establish-
 ment of an independent judiciary comprising regional and central courts. The TGE
 has developed warm relations with Eritrea, which formally became independent of
 Ethiopia on May 24, 1993.
 The EPRDF domination of the Government and the Council of Representatives in-
 creased following the departure of the major non-EPRDF partner in the TGE, the
 Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), in June 1992. The OLF withdrew over the Govern-
 ment's handling of the regional elections--which were flawed by numerous irreg-
 ularities, including fraud, harassment, intimidation, and political assassination-
 and the OLF forces took up arms against the Government. In subsequent clashes,
 the EPRDF forces defeated the OL units and, at the beginning of 1993, the TGE
 held more than 20,000 OLF prisoners in several camps (see Section I.d.). During
 1993 most of these detainees were released; the remaining 1,200 are to face criminal
 charges. The OLF remains outside the Government; much of its senior leadership
 is abroad.
 The EPRDF military wing serves as both the national armed forces and an inter-
 nal security force during the transitional period, although the Government is slowly
 reconstituting police forces to assume internal security responsibilities. Progress
 was made in improving the professionalism and effectiveness of the regional police
 forces, although not all regions benefited equally. In 1993 there were credible re-
 ports that EPRDF security personnel-often from the Oromo People's Democratic
 
 
 Organization (OPDO)---were implicated in beatings of detainees and arrests alleged
 to be of a political nature.
 The Ethiopian economy is based on agriculture, with more than 85 percent of the
 population living in rural areas in very poor conditions. Coffee accounts for 60 per-
 cent of Ethiopia s export revenue. The TGE is implementing an internationally sup-
 ported economic reform program designed to undo 17 years of Marxist rule. This
 program includes an important role for the private sector, which in 1992-1993
 helped stimulate positive economic growth for the first time in many years.
 In contrast to the Mengistu years, the human rights situation in Ethiopia has im-
 proved. The TGE's actions did not match, however, its announced respect for human
 rights. In the face of opposition, it showed increasing intolerance of political dissent.
 Following the departure of the OLF in 1992, the TGE expelled in 1993 four non-
 EPRDF parties from the Council of Representatives. Oppsition political parties
 made credible allegations that they had been intimidated by the authorities, for ex-
 ample, by having their ofices closed and their staffs harassed. Further, the TUE
 circumvented the 1992 press law by invoking the Criminal Code to harass and in-
 timidate the independent press; interfered with peaceful assembly; detained briefly
 officials of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHiRC); and infringed academic
 freedom with the firing of 42 university professors.
 The TGE also continued to deny fair public trial to hundreds of detainees. How-
 ever, in the course of 1993, the Special Prosecutor's Office (SPO) released on bail
 about 1,300 of the 2,400 detainees held for crimes committed under the previous
 government. Although the cases are subject to judicial -review, none had come to
 trial by year's end.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of officially
 sanctioned political or other extrajudicial killings by TGE security forces or by oppo-
 sition groups during 1993. However, there were many unconfirmed reports of sjo-
 radic, low-level fighting between EPRDF forces and various opposition groups in the
 countryside. There was no indication of the number of casualties, civilian or mili-
 tary, but reports confirmed that government forces took prisoners during those ex-
 changes.
 There were also reports of killings, some of which involved errant members of the
 security forces in unclear circumstances. For example, in April TGE troops killed
 Tesfaye Meja, the brother of a leading member of an opposition party, and placed
 his body on public display in the town of Sdo. According to the TGE and local
 sources, Tesfaye was a bandit who had recently escaped from prison. According to
 the TUE and the EHRC, there was no official investigation into the circumstances
 of Tesfaye's death.
 Security forces used excessive force on several occasions in 1993. The TGE over-
 reacted in containing a demonstration for which the students had not given prior
 notification, as required by Ethiopian law. TGE troops encountered the students as
 they emerged from the university grounds, and, in the ensuing melee, at least one
 student was killed. Unofficial accounts by university students, supported by an
 international human rights organization, put the number at about seven. The Ethio-
 pian Human Rights Council confirms one death but believes other deaths may have
 occurred. A commission to investigate this incident was created in March, and, al-
 though mandated to report its findings within 3 months, the TGE had not made
 public the commission's findings by the end of the year.
 In September TGE security personnel used excessive force to quell a disturbance
 at the Gondar municipality, resulting in 13 confirmed deaths (see Section 2.c.). The
 protagonist in the incident, Amha Yesus, was subsequently arrested in Addis Ababa.
 The Gondar police Department was conducting an investigation into the matter; the
 results of this investigation were pending at year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-Since the TUE came to power in 1991, its constituent political
 parties have traded charges and countercharges regarding politically motivated vio-
 lence and disappearances throughout the country. An Ethiopian human rights orga-
 nization alleges that dozens of people arrested when the TGE took power are still
 unaccounted for. According to tWeTUE, these arrestees were included among the
 thousands of war prisoners taken by the EPRDF, most of whom were released after
 rehabilitation. Those still held are under investigation and awaiting trial accused
 of crimes committed against the civilian population.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The National Charter prohibits torture and mistreatment, and in July the Council
 of Representatives ratified the U.N. Convention Against Torture. Under the TGE,
 
 
 93
 there have been no allegations of systematic torture of EPRDF opponents. Neverthe-
 less, there were credible reports that in some instances security forces, often OPDO,
 beat suspects believed to be associated with the OLF while they were detained at
 local administrative buildings. As far as is known, no members of the security forces
 had been punished for these offenses by year's end. There was no evidence of beat-
 ings or torture at the detention camps where OLF forces and supporters are de-
 tained.
 In the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, the TGE detained large numbers of
 Oromo militants and former Mengistu officials in special centers (see Sections 1.d.
 and I.e.). According to firsthand reports, a small number of persons incarcerated in
 these centers-notably the OLF centers--died of endemic diseases. International in-
 spection of the Didessa and Hurso centers in October indicated that conditions were
 not inferior to the living conditions of the local population. However, conditions at
 the Korea camp near Didessa and at some local prisons were poor. The detention
 centers were also used for the political reeducation of opponents. The curriculum fo-
 cused on the mechanics of the transition, the merits of the National Charter, and
 the virtues of the EPRDF.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The National Charter and both the
 Criminal and Civil Codes prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention as well as exile.
 Nevertheless, there were credible reports of persons being detained for expressing
 anti-TGE views. In particular, there were many reports of harassment and deten-
 tion of political activists in the rural areas. There were no confirmed reports of de-
 tentions for political reasons.
 At the beginning of 1993, the TGE held approximately 20,000 OLF soldiers and
 about 2,400 former officials of the Mengistu regime (see Section i.e.) in several de-
 tention camps around the country. For the most part, the OLF soldiers and support-
 ers had been arrested in 1992 after takingup arms against the TGE. In the spring,
 the TGE released most of these soldiers but subsequently rearrested about 4,000,
 ostensibly for resuming military activity.
 At the end of 1993, according to the TGE, the detention camp at Hurso contained
 about 2,000 people, most of whom were members of the OLF. Of this number, some
 800 were accused of serious crimes against civilians, while the remainder, many of
 whom were former 01 detainees at Hurso, were accused of possessing weapons.
 The 1,600 detainess at Didessa were released in October and November. There re-
 main about 400 detainees awaiting trial at the nearby Korea camp who are sus-
 pected of having committed serious crimes while serving in the OLF military.
 The Government does not practice political exile. It continued to welcome back to
 Ethiopia exiles from the Mengistu years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The TGE is currently restructuring its judicial
 system along decentralized lines. Each of Ethiopia's regions will administer local
 (Woreda), district, and regional courts. Each will also have a Supreme Court which
 can hear both original cases and appeals. A federal high and Supreme Court system
 has also been created to hear cases involving federal law, transregional issues, or
 national security. The lack of trained personnel in many regions (some have no
 trained attorneys or judges), the serious financial constraints, and the absence of
 a clear demarcation between federal and regional jurisdiction have delayed effective
 implementation of this system.
 Under the Criminal Procedure Code, any person being held for trial is to be ap-
 propriately charged and informed of the charges against him within 48 hours and
 be offered release on bail. Those believed to have committed capital offenses, such
 as murder and treason, may be detained for 4 weeks while the police conduct an
 investigation and for 15 days while the prosecutor prepares and brings charges
 against the suspect. Trials are public, anddefendants have the right to a defense
 attorney. Ethiopian law does not grant the defense access to accusatory material be.
 fore trial. Until regional legislatures are established to pass laws particular to their
 region, the Criminal Code will remain the same at both the regional and federal
 levels.
 Ethiopia also has Shari'a (Islamic) courts which hear religious and family cases
 involving Muslims. Some traditional courts still function in remote 'reas but are not
 sanctioned by law.
 In 1992 the Council of Representatives issued a proclamation declaring the inde-
 pendence of the judiciary from the executive branch. In 1993 Ethiopia's Supreme
 ourt appeared to enjoy judicial independence, as evidenced by its reversal of a high
 court decision in a labor case. The judge who presided over the initial case had close
 associations with the TGE. There were no known cases in 1993 of judges being dis-
 missed or transferred for political reasons. However, there were credible reports
 that Ethiopian courts, particularly in the regions, were subject to executive branch
 political interference, especially when EPRIDF members were on trial in lower
 
 
 courts. In one region, the administrator convoked high court judges and instructed
 them to be lenient towards EPRDF members who might stand trial in their court.
 In August 1992, the Government established the Special Prosecutor's Office (SPO)
 to create a historical record of the abuses of the Mengistu regime and to bring those
 criminally responsible for human rights violations and corruption to justice. The
 SPO is investigating the cases of about 2,400 persons detainedon suspicion of hav-
 ing committed serious crimes during the previous government's campaigns, includ-
 ing the "red terror" campaign and forced resettlement and villagization. In February
 the Government lifted the suspension of the right of habeas corpus, which had been
 in effect since the change of government, and, as a result, all these cases became
 subject to judicial review. The authorities released about 1,300 of the detainees, ei-
 ther on bail or on condition that they not leave the country. None of the 2,400 had
 been formally charged or brought to trial by year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Judicial
 search warrants are required by law, but they are rarely utilized. There have been
 credible reports of people being summarily, and illegafly, evicted from their resi-
 dence by security forces who possess neither a court order nor the consent of the
 housing authority. Many ethnic Oromos believe that they have been under surveil-
 lance. The TGE admits that it monitors the movements of some people suspected
 of breaking the law. Since the arrival of the TGE to power, forced political member-
 ship and forced resettlement have been terminated. As in 1992, the TGE continues
 to search private and commercial vehicles, as well as private homes, for unlicensed
 firearms and weapons.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although by May as many as 65 private publi-
 cations (weekly tabloids and monthly magazines) were being sold on the streets of
 Addis Ababa and to a lesser extent elsewhere, the TGE sometimes used the con-
 troversial Press Law (Proclamation 34/1992) to curtail press freedom. The Law
 purports to support press freedom, stating, inter alia, that "censorship ("prior inves-
 tigation" in Amharic) and restrictions . . . are hereby prohibited. However, the
 Press Law also gives the Government strong prosecutorial powers to ensure that
 any printed material is free from "any criminal offense against the safety of the
 State .. . any defamation or false accusation against any individual nation/nation-
 ality, people, or organization; any criminal instigation of one nationality against an-
 other or incitement of conflict between peoples; and any agitation for war."
 Against this background, the TGE undertook a number of actions that had the
 effect of curtailing press freedom. In May the police called in the editors of six lead-
 ingpolitically oriented magazines to discuss the sources of much of their material.
 In June the authorities seized and destroyed selected magazines. At midyear the
 Ministry of Information prohibited the managements of private publications from
 advertising in the official media, the principal source of public information. In Au-
 gust and September, the police again summoned editors for questioning, presumably
 about articles critical of the Government. In some of these cases, the Government
 did not bring formal charges but warned press officials against undertaking "activi-
 ties against the Press Law."
 Invoking the CM-iminal Code, the TGE launched prosecutions in August against
 publishers of what it deemed "pornographic" magazines. Late in the year, the au-
 thorities confirmed that legal proceedings had been instituted against 19 people af-
 filiated with 11 publications for violations of the Criminal Code. In some cases, the
 courts required editors or publishers to post bail equivalent to 3 years' salary. Such
 harassment and intimidation of the private press led to a considerable degree of
 self-censorship by press officials.
 Radio, the most influential medium in reaching the rural population, and the sole
 television station are government owned and operated and reflect TGE policies in
 their programming. The official media devote little coverage to the activities of oppo-
 sition groups and, when given, coverage is either negative or neutral, such as re-
 porting on party conferences.
 The TGE9also acted to restrict academic freedom. In April it discharged 42 profes-
 sors from their positions at Addis Ababa University, informing them that their serv-
 ices were no longer needed due to reorganization. Another 38 professors were placed
 on probation. The Government dismissed the professors without an investigation b
 relevant university departments or the administration as dictated by custom and
 in the case of tenured professors, by law. The professors were also denied severance
 pay, and some may lose their pensions. Credible reports indicated that some of the
 professors were fired for expressing antigovernment views. TGE officials admitted
 as much by stating that some professors were dismissed for inappropriately using
 their classrooms for political purposes. The manner of the dismissals has raised
 
 
 95
 questions of procedural fairness and academic freedom and has had a chilling effect
 on campus debate.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The National Charter endorses
 peaceful assembly, freedom of association, and the right to engage in unrestricted
 political activity, including the right to organize political parties. There are allega-
 tions, however, that the TGE and regional governments have employed social and
 economic pressures and existing provisions of law to make it more difficult for oppo-
 sition parties to organize.
 The TGE Proclamation of August 12, 1991, requires organizers to inform authori..
 ties of peaceful demonstrations or public political meetings 48 hours in advance. The
 authorities may, and on occasion do, require that the demonstration or meeting be
 held at another location or time for reasons of ensuring public order. Failure to seek
 authorization was the reason given by the TGE for declaring a demonstration by
 university students against the Eritrean referendum in January to be illegal.
 The authorities from region 14 (Addis Ababa) withheld permission for the All-Am-
 hara People's Organization (AAPO) to demonstrate in Meskal Square in July on the
 grounds that such a rally would interfere with traffic and another scheduled dem-
 onstration (a hunger strike by laid-off maritime authority workers demonstrating
 against the Government). The AAPO0 rejected as unsatisfactory the alternative sites
 proposed by regional authorities, including the nearby stadium, and ultimately de-
 cided not to hold the demonstration.
 In December local authorities in Region 14 issued a permit for an opposition-spon-
 sored gathering called the "Peace and Reconciliation Conference" to meet at the gov-
 ernment-owned Ghion Hotel in Addis Ababa. About 165 persons assembled for the
 conference, whose conclusions and press conferences presented criticisms of the
 TOE. Eight conference attendees or supprters were arrested by TGE officials after
 arriving in Addis Ababa from abroad. Te arrestees were charged with supporting
 violence against the Ethiopian Government, based on their status as lea ers o
 ups allegedly advocating or participating in political violence. The TGE soon re-
 esed three arrestees, two of whom had issued personal statements disavowing vio-
 lence; five arrestees were still detained at year's end.
 The TOE permits the existence of independent organizations but requires associa-
 tions to have government-issued permits. The Ethiopian Human Rights Council
 (EHRC) did not receive a permit, and the Ethiopian Teachers Association had its
 permit revoked.
 Credible reports from many sources indicated that harassment of opposition pliti-
 cal parties took place during 1993. These reports indicated that government officials
 closed some of the regional and local offices of opposition groups, often monitoring
 their activities or arresting local members. Opposition political groups have encoun-
 tered many difficulties, including fear of government intimidation, in propagating
 their policies anywhere in Ethiopia, especially in the countryside where 85 percent
 of the population lives. Much of this fear stems from the June 1992 elections, which
 were marked by irregularities, harassment, intimidation, and political assassination
 by both government and opposition parties. Even in the larger cities, including
 Addis Ababa, political activity by opposition parties is minimal, although this re-
 flects the inexperience and disorganization of opposition parties as much as govern-
 ment efforts to curtail opposition political activity.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The National Charter provides for freedom of religion, in-
 cluding the right of conversion, and TGE officials have advocated complete freedom
 of worship. There is no state religion. Roughly one-half of the population claims to
 belong to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (EOC). Most of the remainder are Mus-
 lims who, for the first time in Ethiopia's history, have been able to participate fully
 in Ethiopia's political, economic, antsocial life. The TGE recognizes both Christian
 and Muslim holidays.
 In 1993 the Orthodox Church enjoyed geater autonomy of decisionmaking since
 it no longer had any state-sanctioned role. However, the installation in 1992 of a
 new Patriarch from the same ethnic group as the President has generated much in-
 ternal controversy within the EOC along ethnic lines. This controversy was reflected
 in physical harassment-including attacks with rocks and other missiles and disrup-
 tion of church services-of the Patriarch, Abune Paulos, by Amharic-speaking dis-
 sidents during his trip to the United States in late 1993.
 There were no reports of official discrimination against Muslims, non-Orthodox
 Christians, or Jews. Nevertheless, tensions mounted in 1993 between Muslims and
 Protestants on the one hand, and the Orthodox community on the other. A hermit
 (an Orthodox prophesier unsanctioned by the EOC) drew a large following in
 Gondar in September by protesting incursions by Protestants and Muslims into this
 traditionally overwhelmingly Orthodox region. His followers ultimately clashed with
 security forces, resulting in deaths and casualties on both sides (see Section l.a.).
 
 
 The hermit was subsequently arrested and at year's end awaited trial in Gondar.
 The authorities arrested another hermit, Bahatawi Gebre Meskel, twice in March,
 ostensibly for unlawfully entering the grounds of St. George's Church. Unofficial ob-
 servers have suggested he was arrested for preaching against the EPRDF and
 against Eritrean secession.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The National Charter recognizes freedom of movement, including the
 right to foreign travel and emigration. Nevertheless, Ethiopian citizens and resi-
 dents of Ethiopia are required to obtain an exit visa before departing, which is is-
 sued in most cases. There are exceptions in the cases of persons with pending court
 cases and persons with debts; there are no reports of denial of exit visas for political
 reasons. Travel within Ethiopia is unregulated. Citizens may freely change their
 residence or workplace. There are no restrictions on travel for women or minority
 groups.
 Virtually all remaining Ethiopian Jews (Falashas) who wished to emigrate from
 Ethiopia did so during 1993. Almost all of them went to Israel. Some Falash Mora,
 a group of Ethiopians who claim Jewish heritage but have not been accepted as
 Jews by the Israeli Rabbinate, have begun emigrating to Israel under family reunifi-
 cation provisions of Israeli law.
 In July the TGE deported from Ethiopia a lay group of eight Americans and one
 Israeli for violations of Ethiopian immigration law. They had been operating with-
 out a permit, educating the Falash Mora in the tenets of Judaism and teaching
 them Hebrew. The TGE maintained that this conformance with Ethiopian law rath-
 er than a restriction on religious observance. In November the group was again di-
 rected to leave Ethiopia, after their application to register as a nongovernmental or-
 ganization was denied because of TGE concerns that the rup was engaged in sec-
 tarian activities (i.e., trying to recruit Ethiopians to goto Israe).
 Citizens who have left the country are guaranteed the right of return. According
 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and foreign diplomatic offi-
 cials, the TGE is fair in its treatment of asylum seekers and cooperative on issues
 concerning the repatriation of Ethiopian refugees. However, the TGE has refused to
 issue valid travel documents to Ethiopian citizens living abroad who are facing de-
 portation proceedings in their countries of residence. No problems were reported
 with treatment of refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change their government has yet to be exercised in Ethio-
 pia. The TGE is preparing for a transition to multiparty democracy in 1994, but the
 Constitutional Commission charged with drawing up a draft constitution was far be-
 hind schedule at year's end. The new constitution will be subject to ratification in
 1994 by an elected constituent assembly.
 Former members of the Workers' Party of Ethiopia wili not be allowed to vote in
 the constituent assembly elections, but it is expected that they will be enfranchised
 thereafter. An election to choose a new national government is planned for late
 1994. Voting is expected to be by secret ballot.
 The EPRDF, which is actually a coalition of four parties, dominates the TGE. The
 EPRDF itself is dominated by the TPLF, whose members include the President; sen-
 ior officials in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Internal Affairs; and
 virtually the entire leadership of the armed forces.
 The TGE quasi-legislative Council of Representatives comprises 65 members rep-
 resenting 25 parties and ethnic groups. In April the TGE expelled five parties be-
 longing to the southern coalition from the Council; one was later readmitted. The
 TGE claimed that these parties had violated the National Charter by signing and
 not repudiating the Paris communique which claimed, inter alia, that "at present
 there is not (a) legitimate government in Ethiopia." The EPRDF, which controls 32
 seats in the Council of Representatives and has strong ties with a number of other
 parties, completely dominates Council debate. No other political party has more
 than three seats.
 The TGE is establishing stronger regional political and administrative organs of
 government. This devolution of power, if comp leted successfully, would be a radical
 departure from the tradition of strong central government led by an authoritarian
 ruler, usually an Amhara. The TGE claims that regionalization will give people
 more direct responsibility for the decisions affecting their lives. The regions will be
 responsible for devising and maintaining numerous public services, including the ju-
 diciary, primary education, and the police. These functions will operate in the lan-
 guage chosen by that region, not necessarily Amharic as in the past. While the re-
 gionalization policy appears to have widespread support, the delimitation of regional
 
 
 boundaries along ethnic lines has aroused concern among many people, particularly
 the Amharas, that ethnic tensions will be aggravated (see Section 5).
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on the participation of women or mi-
 norities in politics. Women hold 3 of the 20 Cabinet seats; 3 additional women hold
 ministerial rank.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are two active human rights monitorin groups in Ethiopia: The Ethiopian
 Human Rights Council (EHRC) and GADADO, Ormo Ex-Prisoners For Human
 Rights. Both are independent of the Government. The EHRC has criticized the TGE
 on a number of issues and operates relatively freely. However, the TGE claimed the
 EHIRC is politically biased against the EPRDF, refused to grant the EHRC a permit,
 and arrested the EHRC Secretary General in May on unspecified charges. Subse-
 quently, the TGE released the Secretary General upon presentation of a guarantor
 and, at year's end, had not brought charges against him. According to the EHRC
 Secretary General, the TGE arrested two other members of the EHRC in 1993: one
 was released on bail, the other remained in prison, yet neither had been formally
 charged.
 The Ethiopian Human Rights and Peace Center (EHRPC) was established as an
 autonomous and neutral body at Addis Ababa University in 1993. It is affiliated
 with the law faculty. The EHRPC's goals are to educate the public about human
 rights and to be a research and documentation center. The Ethiopian Congress for
 Democracy, Forum-84, and the InterAfrica group conduct civic education programs
 on human rights subjects.
 The TGE was willing-to discuss human rights concerns with diplomatic missions,
 international, and nongovernmental organizations. The EHRC received an official
 reply from the Government to its fifth report on human rights. The AlI-Amharic
 People's Organization received a reply from the Addis Ababa police commission to
 accusations in a press release. International human rights groups are welcomed by
 the TGE and enjoy good relations, access, and freedom to travel where they wish.
 Amnesty International was granted access to prisoners during its visit in 1993. The
 SPO actively courts and accepts assistance from foreign governments and legal and
 forensic experts.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The National Charter does not explicitly address discrimination on the basis of
 race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status. The Charter does, however,
 incorporate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations.
 Women.-The TGE took a number of steps to improve the position of women. In
 September it launched a national policy to promote through legislation the equality
 of women and the inclusion of women's concerns in the Government's development
 planning. The TGE also established a national committee on traditional practices
 considered harmful to women, including female genital mutilation, tattooing, and
 child marriage. The national committee, composed of representatives of various min-
 istries and NGO's, is Ethiopia's liaison to the Inter-African Committee on Tradi-
 tional Practices, which is composed of representatives from 28 African countries. It
 has developed a program whereby employees of rural-oriented institutions are
 trained to educate rural populations on the harmful effects of some traditional prac-
 tices. The Ethiopian Government established a women's rights section in the Min-
 istry of Justice in 1992; however, this office still was not organized by the end of
 1993. Women played a prominent role, including in combat, during the rebellion by
 the TPLF which ended when it and its allies in the EPRDF took power in 1991.
 Nevertheless, women do not enjoy equal status with men. Since men are consid-
 ered head of the household and representative of the family, rights of land tenure
 and ownership of property are registered in their names. In the rural areas, where
 85 percent of the population lives, women work over 13 hours a day fulfilling house-
 hold and farming responsibilities. In urban areas, women have fewer employment
 opportunities than men and are considerably less well remunerated.
 Domestic violence, including wife beating, remains pervasive. While women in
 theory have recourse to police protection and official prosecution in cases of domestic
 violence, societal norms inhibit many women from seeking legal redress. The media
 do not cover rape because of the stigma attached to the crime. There has been
 media coverage of domestic violence but not on a routine basis.
 Children.-Governmental expenditures on children's welfare are minimal. In 1993
 the TGE shifted increased resources from the military to social services which
 should benefit children. The 1993-94 allocation for education will exceed the mili-
 
 
 tary budget for the first time in many years. Many of the few social services that
 exist are operated by private organizations, but their resources are limited, and an
 increasing number of children are seen selling goods and begging in urban areas.
 The vast majority of Ethiopian women have undergone some form of female geni-
 tal mutilation, which is usually performed at an early age. According to an inde-
 pendent expert in the field, the percentage of Ethiopian females who have under-
 gone genital mutilation may be as high as 90 percent.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethiopia comprises more than 80 different
 ethnic groups. At various times in the past, one or another (usually the highlanders)
 of these grups has predominated in the political, cultural, and economic life of the
 country. Some ethnic groups, such as the Oromos, claim to have been dominated for
 centuries by the highlanders. The declared aim of the TGE is to promote the inter-
 ests of all ethnic groups through a decentralized, federal system of government. The
 TGE delimited regional boundaries in 1992 to encompass an entire ethnic group or
 a multitude of ethnic groups more completely. Regions are now free to use their
 local language in public services. As implementation of this plan proceeds, it has
 aroused opposition from some groups, notably the Amharas, who warn against the
 disintegration or Balkanization of Ethiopia.
 The plan has also raised difficulties for people who do not know the newly se-
 lected language of the region. For example, many teachers and judges, including
 some ethnic Oromos, in region 4 (Oromia) do not speak Orominya. Many people fear
 being expelled from the region in which they currently reside and the possibility of
 not being able to practice their profession. While some overt discrimination of this
 sort occurred in 1993, the TGE tried to combat it.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no officially condoned or legally sanctioned dis-
 crimination against people with disabilities. Nevertheless, cultural attitudes towards
 the disabled are often negative. The TGE, with international support, established
 a commission for rehabilitation to provide ex-servicemen and civilians injured in the
 civil war with vocational training, assist them in finding employment, and provide
 them with physical rehabilitation. An official at the rehabilitation agency, a semi-
 autonomous institution under the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, estimates
 that there are 5.3 million disabled persons in Ethiopia out of a population of 53 mil-
 lion. Limited resources restrict assistance to an estimated 20,000 beneficiaries. Ethi-
 opia has no legislation mandating access for the disabled. Legislation addressing
 other problems of the disabled was under consideration at the end of 1993. As in
 many other areas, Ethiopia's extreme poverty is both a cause of the problem and
 an obstacle to its solution.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Only a small percentage of Ethiopia's 53 million peo-
 ple is involved in wage labor employment, which is largely concentrated in the cap-
 ital. Some 80 to 85 percent of the work force lives in the countryside, working as
 subsistence farmers.
 Under the National Charter and the Labor Law promulgated in January, most
 workers are free to form and join unions.
 Employees of the civil and security services, judges, and prosecutors are not al-
 lowed to form unions. Workers who provide an "essential service" are not allowed
 to strike. Essential services include air transport and railways, city cleaning and
 sanitation, urban and interurban bus services, gas stations, electricity generating
 plants, police and fire services, post and telecommunications, banks, pharmacies,
 and water supply.
 Unions are not affiliated with the Government or political parties. Workers are
 free to form as many federations and confederations as they wish. The Confed-
 eration of Ethiopian Trade Unions (CETU) was established in November 1993.
 CETU is organized by industrial and service sector rather than by region. The elect-
 ed leadership will take over and transform the existing Ethiopian trade union,
 whose senior level management is expected to be released. The TGE did not inter-
 fere in the process. The Ethiopian Teachers Association (ETA), which is not affili-
 ated with the National Confederation, claims it was subject to governmental inter-
 ference in 1993. ETA alleged that the TGE closed 133 of ETA's 137 branch offices,
 blocked its bank accounts, and fired 22 of its officers.
 The 1993 Labor Law explicitly gives the workers the right to strike to protect
 their interests. Many restrictions on the right to strike apply equally to an employ-
 er's right to lockout. Both must make efforts at conciliation, provide at least 10 days'
 notice, and provide the reasons for the action. In cases already before a court or
 labor board, the party must provide at least 30 days' warning. Strikes must be sup-
 ported by a majority of the workers affected by the decision. It is unlawful to strike
 
 
 99
 against an order from the Labor Relations Board (LRB). The Labor Law prohibits
 retribution against strikers.
 If an agreement between unions and management cannot be reached the case
 may be arbitrated by a Labor Relations Board (LRB). One or more LRl's will be
 created in each region and at the national level. The Minister of Labor and Social
 Affairs will appoint each chairman. The Board's four members are composed of two
 each from trade unions and employers associations and serve 3-year terms. Where
 more than one union or employers association exists, the organization with the most
 representative membership will appoint the member to the LRB.
 There were no strikes organized by unions in 1993. There were, however, numer-
 ous actions taken by former employees of state agencies who had been laid off in
 the process of economic restructuring or had lost their jobs in May when Eritrea
 gained its independence from Ethiopia. In most cases, the TGE offered the employ-
 ees a severance package, but this was not always accepted by the affected employ-
 ees. Some former employees of the Ethiopian Maritime Transport Authority con-
 ducted a hunger strike for several months in the central square of Addis Ababa to
 protest what they believed to be inadequate compensation.
 Independent unions and those belonging to the National Confederation are free
 to affiliate with and participate in internati"onal labor bodies.
 The International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts noted with
 satisfaction the issuance of Labor Proclamation No 42/1993 repealing the imposition
 of a single, official trade union system and recognizing the right of workers and em-
 ployers to establish and join trade unions and employers' associations respectively,
 in order to represent their members in collective bargaining.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-tUnder the Mengistu regime,
 employees were guaranteed total job security regardless of performance or produc-
 tivity; no worker could be fired, and no manager was ever discharged because of low
 produtiity. Collective bargaining had no place in this scheme because the govern-
 ment dictated the terms. The result of these and other measures was a labor fore
 with little or no motivation to perform on the job.
 The TGE undertook to create a new labor culture. Collective bargaining is now
 prtected under the Labor Law and is practiced freely throughout the country. Col-
 lctive bargaining agrements concluded between 1975 and January 1993 are cov-
 ered under the 1975 Labor Code and remain in force. During 1993 many unions
 throughout Ethiopia reorganized themselves in accordance with the new guidelines
 and registered with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. Both the Vice Minister
 of Labor and the Representative of the African-American Labor Congress stated un-
 equivocally that a considerable amount of collective bargaining occurred in Ethiopia
 during 1993. Such activities did not occur exclusively in Addis Ababa. For instance,
 workers at the Wonji Sugar Plantation near Nazret negotiated an 11-percent wage
 increase in September. Labor experts estimate that as many as 90 percent of union-
 ized workers in Ethiopia are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Wages are
 now being bargained at the plant level.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination. Grievance procedures are in place to
 hear allegations of discrimination brought by individuals or unions. Employers
 found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for
 union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Slavery was officially abolished in
 Ethiopia in 1942. The TGE's National Charter proscribes slavery and involuntary
 servitude. Activity which inhibits a person's freedom of contract or is deemed a re-
 straint of liberty is illegal. Forced or compulsory labor is virtually nonexistent in
 the modern wage sector and in those areas affected by the modern sector. The
 Criminal Code specifically prohibits forced labor unless instituted by court order as
 a punitive measure.
 Lcal TGE officials outside of Addis Ababa continue to call on residents to "volun-
 teer" for uncompensated community work projects, such as road building and emer-
 gency road repair. In 1993 industries were operating at less than half capacity; in
 those state-owned factories still functioning, workers were still sometimes compelled
 by factory managers to "volunteer" labor in order to meet quotas, which may result
 in cash bonuses.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the new Labor Law, the
 minimum age for wage or salary employment is 14. Children between the ages of
 14 and 18 are covered by special provisions in the Labor Law. Workers in this cat-
 egory may not work more than 7 ours per day, work between the hours of 11 p.m.
 and 6 a.m. or on public holidays, or perform overtime. The Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs, which is charged with enforcement, may proscribe children from
 working in dangerous vocations such as transport, electric power generation, mines,
 
 
 100
 sewers, and digging tunnels. Large numbers of children perform agricultural work
 in the countrside and work as street peddlers in the cities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Ethiopia has no statutory minimum wage.
 However, since 1985 a minimum wage has een set and paid to public sector em-
 ployees, who are by far the single largest group of wage earners. This public sector
 minimum wage is $19.40 per month (105 birr) effective as of November 1993. Al-
 though studies have not been done, the private sector usually pays at least as much
 as the Government.
 According to the Office for the Study of Wages and Other Remunerations, which
 calculates the annual minimum consumption basket, a family of five requires a
 monthly income of $79.48 (430 birr) to maintain a bare minimum standard of living.
 Thus, even with two family members earning the public sector minimum wage, the
 family receives only about 50 percent of that needed for healthful subsistence. Many
 workers earn less than the minimum wage.
 The legal workweek is 48 hours, 6 days of 8 hours each, with a 24-hour rest pe-
 riod. The 48-hour workweek is widely respected.
 The TGE, private industry, and unions negotiate to set occupational health and
 safety standards. These are enforced by the Inspection Department of the Ministry
 of Labor and Social Affairs. However, a lack of human and financial resources pre-
 vents this office from effectively monitoring or enforcing health and safety stand-
 ards. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous situations with-
 out jeopardy to continued employment.
