 REPUBLIC OF CONGO *
 The Republic of Congo continued to be ruled by a transitional government that
 came to power by force of arms in October 1997. President Denis Sassou-Nguesso
 wields executive power without meaningful legislative or judicial constraints. Forces
 supporting Sassou-Nguesso, a northerner, defeated those of former president Pascal
 Lissouba, a southerner, with the help of Angolan troops in the 1997 civil war.
 Lissouba had been elected democratically in 1992 after 28 years of one-party rule,
 including a lengthy period (1979-91) during which Sassou-Nguesso served as Presi-
 dent. Lissouba's administration was characterized by severe mismanagement and by
 recurring clashes among militia forces loyal to Congo's major political leaders. The
 civil war began when Lissouba's forces surrounded Sassou-Nguesso's home in June
 1997, in an apparent attempt to eliminate his political-military faction. Sassou-
 Nguesso's principal base of support lay in the sparsely populated northern region
 of the country, northerners and in particular members of his minority Mbochi ethnic
 group dominated the Government. After August 1998 there was again civil unrest
 * The United States Embassy evacuated its facilities in the country during the 1997 civil war
 and has subsequently operated out of the American Embassy in the Democratic Republic of
 Congo, which in turn was evacuated temporarily in August. Since August, fighting in both coun-
 tries has further impeded efforts to collect information.
 
 
 and armed resistance to the Government in the populous southern part of the coun-
 try and in neighborhoods of Brazzaville, the capital, which were inhabited chiefly
 by members of southern ethnic groups. By year's end, the Government reportedly
 had lost effective control of some areas in the southern part of the country. Soon
 after taking power, President Sassou-Nguesso's Government replaced Congo's 1992
 constitution with a new Fundamental Act. This act is to remain in effect until a
 new constitution is drafted and adopted by referendum. The Fundamental Act es-
 tablishes a strong and highly centralized presidential system of government. The
 President appoints all members of the Government and military and all subnational
 government officials, serves as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and is man-
 dated specifically to direct the general policy of the Government and exercise regu-
 latory powers. Legislative authority is vested in the 120-member National Transi-
 tion Council. This body was elected at the National Reconciliation Forum convoked
 by the Government in January. Although the forum included some representatives
 of opposition political parties and nongovernmental actors, the event was orches-
 trated by the executive and did not constitute a sufficiently broad-based forum from
 which to elect a genuinely representative legislature. During the forum, the Govern-
 ment announced its intention to create a new Constitution and hold elections within
 a flexible 3-year timetable. The judiciary is overburdened and subject to political in-
 terference and corruption.
 The security forces include the police, the gendarmerie and the armed forces; the
 functional distinction between these forces is not clear. In theory the police should
 be the first to respond to security incidents, with gendarmes and army units inter-
 vening later if necessary; in practice joint operations are common. Many new re-
 cruits who have joined the security forces since the war are former members of non-
 governmental militias. Units of the Angolan armed forces and, reportedly, some
 members of the Chadian armed forces, and possibly other national armies, operated
 inside the country in support of the Government. Rwandan Hutu militiamen, for-
 merly in refugee camps in the country, also participated in government military op-
 erations. Members of the security forces committed numerous, serious human rights
 abuses.
 The economy suffered serious losses during the 1997 civil war, particularly in
 Brazzaville, in which more than one-third of the country's population of roughly 2.5
 million normally resides. However, the war did not significantly affect the oil indus-
 try, which operates offshore; oil exports and external assistance remained the coun-
 try's main sources of foreign exchange. Although per capita Gross Domestic Product
 for 1997 was estimated at more than $600 per year, this figure includes substantial
 oil exports, the benefits of which are not widely distributed throughout the popu-
 lation. Lack of transparency in government and high levels of defense and security
 spending continued to impede growth. Widespread civil conflict, including the de-
 struction of the Bacongo and Makalekele neighborhoods of Brazzaville and of much
 of the town of Nkayi in Bouenza during December fighting that displaced more than
 200,000 civilians further dimmed prospects for economic recovery. Clashes in south-
 west Pool also disrupted the railway that serves at the vital economic link between
 Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, the main port.
 The Government's human rights record was characterized by numerous serious
 abuses. Security forces, which included many undisciplined and poorly trained
 former members of nongovernmental militias, were responsible for extrajudicial
 killings including summary executions, disappearances, rapes, beatings and physical
 abuse of detainees and the civilian population, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and
 arbitrary searches and widespread looting of private homes. Such incidents were
 particularly numerous after August, in connection with military operations to quell
 unrest in the Pool and Bouenza regions and in December fighting in Brazzaville.
 Prison conditions remained life threatening. The judiciary was overburdened, under-
 financed, and subject to corruption and political influence. It was unable to ensure
 fair and expeditious trials. The Government infringed on citizens' privacy rights.
 The Government continued to monopolize domestic broadcast media, although pri-
 vate newspapers circulated freely and were sometimes critical of the authorities. Se-
 curity forces restricted freedom of movement within the country. Citizens did not
 have the right to change their government peacefully. However, the Government
 permitted opposition political parties and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's),
 including human rights organizations, to function, and there was a relatively open
 dialog on public policy issues. Nevertheless, in a move that could exclude some
 groups from participation in the political process, the Government stated its inten-
 tion to try former president Lissouba and members of his government on charges
 of war crimes, including genocide. In August the National Transition Council adopt-
 ed a law on genocide and war crimes to permit such cases to be brought before the
 courts. Societal discrimination and violence against women are serious problems.
 
 
 Minority indigenous Pygmies face severe exploitation and are inherited by Bantu
 patrons. Societal discrimination on the basis of ethnicity remained widespread; the
 Government was dominated by members of the Mbochi ethnic minority and other
 members of the northern regional minority, and ethnic and regional tensions contin-
 ued to contribute to large-scale organized civil violence. Child labor, reportedly in-
 cluding forced labor, persists. Beginning in August, bands of opposition militiamen
 carried out attacks on government installations, killing government officials. Citi-
 zens sometimes resorted to vigilante justice, killing those presumed to be criminals.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Security forces committed many
 extrajudicial killings. During the first half of the year, security forces frequently re-
 sorted to summary executions in order to stop heavily armed former militiamen who
 committed banditry following the war.
 In responding to antigovernment violence in the Pool and Bouenza regions and
 in Brazzaville during the last 4 months of the year, the Government often deployed
 undisciplined troops, including some recently recruited from President Sassou-
 Nguesso's former Cobra militia. These government forces were responsible for sum-
 mary executions as well as rape, looting, and other violent acts. There were numer-
 ous reports that Cobras or other government forces summarily executed young male
 civilians during and after the December 16-20 fighting in the Bacongo and
 Makelekele neighborhoods of Brazzaville, inhabited chiefly by -southerners, and that
 government forces singled out for such killings young men from the Lari ethnic
 group of former prime minister Bernard Kolelas. Members of this group formed the
 militia forces that conducted antigovernment attacks in the southern Pool region
 during the final 4 months of the year. Press reports indicated that the survivors of
 the fighting in Bacongo and Makelekele who fled to other parts of the capital were
 disproportionately women, children, and old men, with few young men among them.
 However, those who fled across the border to the Democratic Republic of Congo in-
 cluded a disproportionate number of young men. Government security forces report-
 edly used artillery in and around the southern neighborhoods of Brazzaville and the
 town of Nkayi during fightin against rebel forces in December.
 The origin and nature of the December 16-20 fighting in the Bacongo and
 Makelekele neighborhoods of Brazzaville remains uncertain. There were reports of
 infiltration by members of antigoverment Ninja militiamen, of fighting between
 former Cobras and other government security forces, and of summary executions of
 civilians by government forces, and of extensive use of mortars and artillery by gov-
 ernment or Angolan forces; the sequence in which these events may have occurred
 remains uncertain. However, several facts seemed fairly well-established: no more
 than 300 Ninjas were involved in the fighting; at least 1,000 persons died, perhaps
 many more; the Bacongo and Makelekele neighborhoods were damaged severely and
 abandoned by their roughly 200,000 inhabitants, most of them southerners; and
 government forces, chiefly Sassou's former militiamen, extensively looted these
 neighborhoods with impunity for days after they were abandoned (see Section 1.f.).
 Bacongo and Makelekele were among the neighborhoods least damaged during the
 1997 civil war, and hence may have been relatively rich targets for looting.
 The Government repeatedly has announced its intention to bring to trial members
 of the former government on charges of war crimes, genocide, or other criminal acts
 (see Section 3).
 There continued to be deaths due to mob violence, as civilians took vigilante ac-
 tion against presumed criminals, although police sometimes intervened to stop such
 action. Attacks against presumed "sorcerers," which had been reported during pre-
 vious years, were not reported during the year.
 In April armed bands reportedly linked to former president Lissouba's Cocoye mi-
 litiamen killed several government workers, seized the Moukoukoulou hydroelectric
 dam in Bouenza, region and cut off electricity to the population of Point-Noire for
 several weeks until their surrender could be negotiated. During December 18-21,
 while in control of the town of Nkayi in Bouenza, Cocoyes reportedly targeted gov-
 ernment officials and others from northern ethnic groups for summary execution.
 In the Pool region from late August through year's end, armed bands whose mem-
 bers were drawn principally from former Ninja militiamen once loyal to Bernard
 Kolelas, who served as prime minister during the final months of Lissouba's govern-
 ment, targeted government officials in numerous acts of violence. On August 29,
 these groups killed the police commissioner in Mindouli. They also killed the deputy
 prefect of Goma Tse Tse on September 26, and burned the police station and prefec-
 ture offices in Kinkala on October 9. They also reportedly killed 6 members of a
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 church-led mediation committee and as many as 35 other civilians on November 14
 in an attack in Mindouli, despite a heavy government security contingent to protect
 committee members.
 b. Disappearance.-According to credible reports, on December 23 in northern
 Brazzaville members of government security forces entered centers for persons dis-
 placed by the fighting in the Bacongo and Makelekele neighborhoods of southern
 Brazzaville, singled out young male displaced persons, and took them away. They
 removed 20 young men from the Evangelical Church in the neighborhood of Plateau
 15 Ans and 4 young men from the Church of Jesus Resurrected. At year's end, the
 whereabouts of these young men remained unknown. According to some human
 rights groups, some of these young men were used by the authorities to clean up
 bodies in Bacongo and Makelekele.
 Given the incomplete figures on those killed in the 1997 war and the displacement
 of civilian populations as a result of the fighting, disappearances may have occurred
 during and after that war that have not been reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Fundamental Act prohibits torture; however, in practice, security forces some-
 times used beatings to extract confessions or merely to punish detainees.
 Security forces generally operated with impunity in committing such acts. Accord-
 ing to a report issued jointly by a local and an international human rights group
 in April, security forces sometimes suspended suspects from the ceiling by a wire
 during beatings to increase their suffering (see Section 4). Members of the security
 forces looted citizens' homes (see Section 1.f.), and security forces extorted money
 from travelers at checkpoints (see Section 2.d.). Members of the security forces oper-
 ating in the south from August through December reportedly committed rape and
 other acts of violence against women. In the aftermath of the 1997 civil war, such
 acts were commonly committed by all militia groups.
 Prison conditions remained life threatening, as they have been for years. Condi-
 tions deteriorated further following the civil war as a result of damage to already
 overcrowded facilities and scarcity of resources to provide food or health care to the
 inmates. The Brazzaville prison (Maison d'Arret) was vacated by all inmates (both
 pretrial detainees and those convicted) due to heavy fighting during the civil war.
 At year's end, the facility was not yet operational, although the Pointe Noire prison
 continued to function. Due to the shortage of prison facilities, many prisoners and
 detainees reportedly were held in police stations. In a report issued in October, Am-
 nesty International stated that conditions in these police stations often amount to
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.
 Human right groups sometimes encountered difficulty in gaining access to pris-
 ons. However, a local human rights group made two visits to the Pointe Noire prison
 during the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Fundamental Act prohibits arbitrary
 arrest and detention; however, in practice security forces frequently commit such
 acts. The Code of Penal Procedure, which remains in force, requires that a person
 be apprehended openly and that a lawyer be present during initial questioning. The
 code further stipulates that warrants be issued before arrests are made and that
 detainees be brought before a judge within 3 days and either charged or released
 within 4 months. In practice the Government often violates these legal provisions.
 A report jointly prepared in Ap ril by a local human rights group and an inter-
 national human rights group identified 16 cases of arbitrary arrest and detention
 since the start of the year (see Section 4).
 Detainees usually were informed of the charges levied against them, and lawyers
 and family members usually had free access to them.
 There were political detainees at year's end. Precise figures are unknown, but
 international human rights organizations operating in the country estimated the
 total to be fewer than 100. Approximately 20 senior military officers of the former
 government were held at the military academy in Brazzaville. Former armed forces
 chief of staff General Claude Emmanuel Eta Onka was released from this center
 in March, after approximately 5 months in detention. According to press reports,
 other reported political detainees included former presidency counselor Henri
 Marcellin Ozoumangelet and former Cuvette region prefect Jean-Michel Ebekaa,
 who have been held at the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire in Pointe Noire
 since the end of the war. Both were political allies of former president Lissouba.
 Two other Lissouba supporters, Paul Omoye and Paul Sobis reportedly were held
 at a Pointe Noire military base. Ambroise Herve Malonga and Nestor Makounzi
 Wolo were detained on November 21 in connection with their previous service on
 former president Lissouba's Constitutional Court. All remained in detention at
 year's end.
 
 
 The Fundamental Act does not address forced exile, and the Government does not
 practice it formally. However, many officials of the predecessor government includ-
 ing former president Lissouba and former Prime Minister Kolelas remained outside
 the country, and in practice the threat of trial for war crimes in Congo precluded
 their return.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Fundamental Act mandates the President to
 ensure the independence of the judiciary through the Higher Council of Magistrates;
 in practice, however, the judiciary continued to be overburdened, underfinanced, and
 subject to corruption and political influence. Resource problems increased as a result
 of destruction and looting sustained by judicial facilities during the 1997 civil war.
 The judicial system consists of local courts, courts of appeal, the Supreme Court,
 and traditional courts. In rural areas, traditional courts continued to handle many
 local disputes, especially property and probate cases, and domestic conflicts that
 could not be resolved within the extended family.
 In general defendants are tried in a public court of law presided over by a state-
 appointed magistrate. The defense has access to prosecution evidence and testimony
 and the right to counter it. In formal courts defendants are presumed innocent and
 have the right of appeal. However, the legal caseload far exceeded the capacity of
 the judiciary to ensure fair and timely trials. Some cases never reach the court sys-
 tem. No military courts exercise jurisdiction over civilians.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Fundamental Act provides for the inviolability of the home, and for privacy of let-
 ters, correspondence, telecommunications, and other forms of communication, except
 as may be provided by law; however, in practice government security forces often
 illegally entered, searched, and looted private homes. Such incidents were reported
 frequently in the Pool region after August, when deployment of government forces
 there increased.
 In late December, members of Government security forces conspicuously looted
 the neighborhoods of Bacongo and Makelekele, the inhabitants of which had fled
 during the fighting there on December 16-20. Members of the security forces drove
 trucks and wheeled push-carts piled high with looted goods from these neighbor-
 hoods to markets in unharmed, northern neighborhoods of the capital. Some mem-
 bers of the security forces burned cars found in the northern neighborhoods that
 they believed to have been acquired by looting, but otherwise the Government made
 no evident effort to stop the looting, which continued through the end of the year,
 while the security forces kept the abandoned neighborhoods off limits to all but
 themselves. During this period, members of the security forces targeted and burned
 the homes of prominent members of the largely southern ethnic communities of
 those neighborhoods.
 Th  Government was widely believed to monitor private mail and telephone com-
 munications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Fundamental Act provides for freedom of
 speec h and of the press, and in practice the Government generally respected this
 right, although it continued to monopolize broadcast media. The 1996 Press Law,
 which sharply increased criminal penalties for libel, remained in effect.
 There is no state-owned newspaper. Approximately 10 private newspapers appear
 weekly in Brazzaville. Some of these newspapers take editorial positions critical of
 the Government and print articles unflattering to the authorities. Newspapers on
 occasion published open letters written by opponents of the current Government
 who are in detention or living abroad. On September 5, unknown persons ransacked
 the offices of the newspaper La Rue Meurt, but the newspaper quickly resumed pub-
 lication and continued to maintain an independent and often critical editorial posi-
 tion towards the Government. Print media do not circulate widely beyond a small
 elite in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire.
 Most citizens obtained their news from the broadcast media. Domestic broadcast
 media remained a government monopoly. Radio Congo is on the air approximately
 18 hours a day; Television Congo broadcasts for even fewer hours. However, Radio
 France Internationale is rebroadcast on a local FM station, and radio and television
 broadcasts from neighboring Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 (DRO C), can be received in Brazzaville. Radio Libertd, established by President
 Sassou-Nguesso's forces during the civil war, continued to broadcast.
 No Internet service providers operated in the country.
 The news coverage and the editorial lines of the state-owned media reflected gov-
 ernment priorities and views. Government broadcast media focused its attention on
 
 
 the activities of the ruling party and its allies; there was no meaningful airing of
 alternative political views.
 There were no known abridgements of academic freedom. Access to the University
 was blocked in late December due to unrest in the Bacongo neighborhood of
 Brazzaville.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Fundamental Act provides
 for freedom of assembly and protest, and the Government generally respected this
 right in practice. Political parties and civic associations held numerous meetings
 during the year. Public demonstrations were less common; there were no known
 public protests. Groups wishing to hold public assemblies were required to inform
 the Ministry of Interior, which could withhold authorization for meetings that
 threatened public order. However, there were no known instances in which the au-
 thorities withheld requests for authorizations to meet.
 The Fundamental Act provides for freedom of association, ind the Government
 larely respected this right in practice. The act permits associations, political parties
 and other groups to form freely, provided that they respect principles of Congolese
 sovereignty, territorial integrity, national unity, and democracy. No political parties
 were banned or suspended. The parties of some prominent leaders of the former gov-
 ernment continued to operate, but under the leadership of political figures willing
 to cooperate with the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Fundamental Act provides for freedom of religion
 and the Government respected this right in practice. There is no official state reli-
 gion. About half the population is Christian; most of the rest practices either tradi-
 tional indigenous religions or no religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the County, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Fundamental Act provides for freedom of movement; however, the
 Government restricted this right in practice. Military checkpoints sometimes inter-
 fered with the movement of civilians. Members of the security forces manning these
 checkpoints commonly extorted bribes from travelers. The number of checkpoints in-
 creased late at night and in areas of insecurity such as in Pool region after August
 and the Bouenza region and Brazzaville in December. During late December secu-
 rity forces continued to restrict movement into the Bacongo and Makelekele neigh-
 borhoods of the capital long after fighting there had ceased (see Section 1.f.). From
 late August through December, unrest in Pool disrupted vital rail transportation be-
 tween Brazzaville and Pointe Noire.
 The Fundamental Act provides for the right of asylum. The Government reiter-
 ated its commitment to respect applicable intern'ational refugee law, but it per-
 mitted Hutu militiamen from refugee camps to join in military operations with gov-
 ernment forces. The country was host to approximately 12,000 Rwandans, largely
 members of the Hutu ethnic group, who fled camps in eastern Zaire (now the
 DROC) in 1996 and arrived in Congo in May and June 1997. The Government also
 sought to work with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner foi. Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) and other interested agencies to find a durable solution for those
 Rwandans in Congo. However, in early November, as many as 5,000 of the inhab-
 itants of the camps were believed to have crossed to the DROC to fight on the side
 of the DROC Government in the civil war in that country.
 There are also approximately 6,000 Angolan refugees who fled the Angolan prov-
 ince of Cabinda in 1992 and continue to receive UNHCR assistance in camps near
 Pointe Noire.
 The Government granted first asylum to refugees from other countries. Approxi-
 mately 150 combatants in the DROC civil war fled to Congo during fighting in the
 DROC province of Bas-Congo in August. These combatants included both rebels and
 supporters of the DROC government. The Government accepted them temporarily,
 pending conclusion of arrangements for their safe return to the DROC. These nego-
 tiations continued, and they remained in the country at year's end.
 At least 8,500 Congolese, chiefly of southern ethnic groups, reportedly'fled the
 country to the DROC between October and December, during the fighting in
 Brazzaville, Pool, and Bouenza. On December 31, the Governments of Congo and
 the DROC signed a non-aggression pact obligating each government to prevent non-
 governmental armed groups from using its territory to launch operations against the
 other government. There were no reports of forced return of persons to countries
 where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government peacefully. The current
 Government came to power by force of arms in 1997 with the help of units of the
 armed forces of Angola. During the National Reconciliation Forum that it convened
 
 
 104
 in January and February, the Government announced its intention to create a new
 constitution and hold elections within 3 years. In October President Sassou-Nguesso
 announced publicly that a new constitution would be enacted during 1999. Accord-
 ing to the scenario agreed upon at the National Reconciliation Forum in February,
 the constitution first must be passed by the National Transition Council, then
 adopted by popular referendum. The Government also announced plans for an ad-
 ministrative census as a precursor to voter registration; however, as of year's end
 little progress had been made in beginning the census.
 The executive branch dominates the current system of government. Under the
 Fundamental Act, the President is mandated to direct the general policy of the Gov-
 ernment and to exercise regulatory powers. He appoints all significant military, ex-
 ecutive, and judicial officials. The President convenes the interim national legisla-
 ture, called the National Transition Council (CNT). The CNT was elected at the Na-
 tional Reconciliation Forum called by the Government in January. Although the
 forum included some representatives of opposition political parties and nongovern-
 mental actors, the event was orchestrated by the executive and did not constitute
 a sufficiently broad-based forum from which to elect a genuinely representative leg-
 islature. Although the CNT debates issues freely and has summoned cabinet min-
 isters to answer questions about their portfolios, this body was dominated by sup-
 porters of the President and did not serve as a meaningful check on executive au-
 thority.
 Major political 'parties included the ruling Congolese Workers's Party, former
 president Lissouba's Panafrican Union for Social Democracy, former prime minister
 Bernard Kolelas' Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integrated Development,
 former prime minister Andre Milongo's Union for Democracy and the Republic
 (UDR), and former Pointe Noire mayor Jean-Pierre Thystere-Tchicaya's Rally for
 Democracy and Social Progress. There was also a host of smaller parties. In some
 cases, party leaders remained in exile while other party officials willing to cooperate
 with the Government remained in the country. In the absence of electoral politics
 or a constitutional framework for such politics, party leaders held meetings and
 party congresses, commented-to the media on the current political environment, and
 raised questions in the National Transition Council. The National Transition Coun-
 cil included representatives of a range of political parties but was dominated by al-
 lies of the Government.
 The State is highly centralized. Since the 1997 civil war, key regional and local
 leaders have been appointed by the central Government. Subnational government
 entities lack an independent revenue base and do not represent a significant check
 on central authority.
 The Government has announced repeatedly its intention to bring to trial members
 of the former government on charges of war crimes, genocide, or other criminal acts.
 In August the CNT passed a law on genocide, war crimes, and crimes against hu-
 manity that permits the exclusion of those found guilty of such crimes from holding
 public office. This law could be used to exclude opponents from the political process,
 and the mere threat of charges under this law may dissuade political figures who
 are in exile from returning to the country, including former president Lissouba and
 former prime minister Kolelas.
 There are no legal restrictions on representation by women or minority popu-
 lations. However, women were underrepresented in government and politics. Three
 of 33 cabinet ministers were female, and women held 2 of 7 leadership positions in
 the CNT. Pygmies continued to be effectively excluded from the political process.
 The cabinet included members of many ethnic groups throughout the country. Al-
 though many key posts were held by northerners, including members of the Presi-
 dent's Mbochi ethnic group, there was no consistent pattern of clear overrepresenta-
 tion of any ethnic or regional group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several domestic human rights organizations operated with minimal government
 restriction and investigated and published their findings on human rights problems.
 While some human rights leaders maintained that they sometimes were subjected
 to subtle forms of intimidation, they continued topublish reports that were highly
 critical of the Government with no apparent reprisal.
 A team from the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH)
 based in France visited the country in March and collaborated with a local human
 rights NGO, the Congolese Observer for Human Rights (OCOH), to prepare a report
 published in April (see Sections 1.c. and 1.d.). In July a team from Amnesty. Inter-
 national visited the country and reported its findings as part of an Africa-wide up-
 date issued in October. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) main-
 
 
 tained an office in Brazzaville and, among other activities, began a program of
 human rights training for units of the armed forces. Fighting in the Pool region be-
 tween late August and year's end prevented U.N. agencies and NGO's from assess-
 ing humanitarian needs in the region.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Fundamental Act specifically prohibits such discrimination; however, societal
 discrimination persisted in practice, particularly against women and Pygmies. Eth-
 nic and regional differences, especially between northern and southern ethnic
 groups, continued to contribute to large-scale organized civil violence. Members of
 northern ethnic groups dominated the Government, which after August increasingly
 was resisted by nongovernmental armed groups recruited largely from southern eth-
 nic groups.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, including rape and beatings, is wide-
 spread but reported rarely. The problem is handled within the extended family and
 only in the most extreme incidents is the matter brought to the police. There are
 no provisions under the law for spousal battery. There are no crisis centers or hot
 lines. The general population and the media largely ignore the problem of violence
 against women, although some nongovernmental groups continue to try to raise
 awareness of the problem.
 The Fundamental Act provides for equality of all citizens, prohibits discrimination
 based on sex, and stipulates that women have the right to equal pay for equal work.
 In practice women are underrepresented in the formal sector. Most women work in
 the informal sector and thus have little or no access to employment benefits. Women
 in rural areas are especially disadvantaged in terms of education and wage employ-
 ment and are confined largely to family farm, petty commerce, and childrearing re-
 sponsibilities. In 1984, 71 percent of men but only 49 percent of women were esti-
 mated to be literate.
 Marriage and family laws overtly discriminate against women. For example, adul-
 tery is illegal for women but not for men. Polygyny is legal; polyandry is not. While
 the Legal Code provides that 30 percent of the husband's estate goes to the wife,
 in practice the wife often loses all rights of inheritance. The symbolic nature of the
 brideprice set in the Family Code often is not respected, and men are forced to pay
 excessive amounts to the woman's family. As a result, the right to divorce is cir-
 cumscribed for some women because they lack the financial means to reimburse the
 brideprice to the husband and his family. This problem is more prevalent in rural
 areas than in urban centers.
 There are approximately 10 NGO's that work on women's problems. However,
 their effectiveness varies widely, and none is physically located in rural areas. A
 Ministry for the Integration of Women into Development, worked to reform certain
 laws and to educate women about their rights.
 Children.-The Fundamental Act affords children equal protection under law.
 Child labor is illegal and education is compulsory until the age of 16. In practice,
 these laws generally are not enforced, particularly in rural areas. There are indigent
 street children in Brazzaville.
 People With Disabilities.-The Fundamental Act prohibits discrimination based on
 physical condition. In practice, this prohibition was not generally enforced, as the
 ministry charged with implementation faced severe financial constraints. There was
 no overt discrimination against the disabled in employment and education. There
 were no laws mandating access for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-The Fundamental Act prohibits discrimination based on eth-
 nicity. In practice the indigenous Pygmy people, who number in the tens of thou-
 sands and live primarily in the northern forest regions, do not enjoy equal treat-
 ment in the predominantly Bantu society. Pygmies were severely marginalized in
 the areas of employment, health, and education. They usually are considered social
 inferiors and have no political voice. Many have never heard of the concept of voting
 and have minimal ability to affect government decisions affecting their interests.
 Many Pygmies have a Bantu patron to whom they are obligated in perpetuity. Pyg-
 mies are inherited by their patron's eldest son, an arrangement rooted in the ances-
 tral tradition of Pygmy slavery. Pygmies, possibly including children, continued to
 be exploited by Bantus.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Fundamental Act prohibits discrimina-
 tion based on ethnicity; in practice, however, the Government did not enforce this
 prohibition effectively, and there were credible reports that the Government and its
 security forces discriminated against members of southern ethnic groups, and often
 used violence against them.

 Four major ethnic groups make up about 95 percent of the country's population;
 these groups speak distinct primary languages, and are concentrated regionally out-
 side of urban areas. The largest ethnic group is the Kongo, who constitute the main
 ethnic rup in the southern part of the country and about half the country's popu-
 lation. Within the Kongo group are various subgroups, including the Lari and the
 Vili. Other major ethnic groups include the Teke of the central region, with about
 13 percent of the population, and the Mbochi of the northern region, with about 12
 percent of the population.
 Societal ethnic discrimination is widely practiced among virtually all ethnic
 groups, and is evident in private sector hiring and buying patterns and de facto seg-
 regation of urban neighborhoods. The greatest interethnic tension is between the
 Kongo and other ethnic groups of the more prosperous and commercial south, near
 the Atlantic coast, and the ethnic groups of the less developed and more sparsely
 populated northern region, which lies deep in the interior, at the heart of Africa's
 equatorial rain forest. Because southerners are more numerous and tend to be more.
 commercially oriented than northerners, both political and economic liberalization
 are widely perceived as likely to advance southern interests and jeopardize northern
 interests.
 There were ethnic overtones to both the 1997 civil war and the recent violence
 in Brazzaville and other areas in the southern part of the country. These conflicts
 have sometimes been characterized as pitting northerners, who support President
 Sassou against southerners, who support former president Lissouba and former
 prime minister Kolelas. There does tend to be heavy representation from each lead-
 er's ethnic group in his immediate entourage: Mbochi for Sassou, Nibolek for
 Lissouba, and Lari for Kolelas. However, the correspondence between ethnic-re-
 gional and political cleavages is only approximate, and supporters of the current and
 recent governments have included persons from a broad range of ethnic and regional
 backgrounds.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Fundamental Act provides workers with the
 right to form unions, and the Government respects this right in practice. Any work-
 er is free to join a union of his choice. The Labor Code affirms the right to associate
 freely and prohibits restrictions on the formation of trade unions. The Confederation
 of Congolese Unions held a general assembly on August 21-the first since the war.
 Most workers in the formal (wage) sector are union members, and unions have
 made efforts to organize informal sectors such as agriculture and retail trade.
 The Fundamental Act also affirms workers' right to strike, subject to conditions
 established by Law. Unions are free to strike after filing a letter of intent with the
 Ministry of Labor, thereby starting a process of nonbinding arbitration under the
 auspices of a regional labor inspector from the Labor Ministry. The letter of intent
 must include the strike date, at which time the strike legally may begin, even if
 arbitration is not complete. Employers have the right to fire workers if they do not
 give advance notice of a strike. On several occasions during the year, groups of pub-
 lic servants went on strike to protest delays in salary payment. In some cases, the
 relevant ministries offered partial payment to assuage these workers and persuade
 them to return to their jobs.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade unions and they maintain co-
 operative accords with foreign trade union organizations. .
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code allows for
 collective bargaining, which is practiced freely. The Government sets industry-spe-
 cific minimum wage scales, but unions usually are able to negotiate higher wages
 for their members.
 Employers are prohibited from discriminating against employees who join a
 union. There were no reported firings for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including that performed by children, but such practices reportedly
 occur. Pygmies, possibly including children, are exploited by Bantus, who inherit
 Pygmies and to whom Pygmies are obligated in perpetuity (see Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Min-
 istry of Labor, which is responsible for enforcing child labor laws, concentrates its
 efforts only on the formal wage sector. Children continue to work in rural areas and
 in the informal sector in cities without government intervention. The law prohibits
 forced labor by children; however, there have been allegations of exploitation of
 Pygmy children (see Sections 5 and 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Fundamental Law provides that each citi-
 zen has the right to remuneration according to his work and merit. The Labor Code
 
 
 107
 stipulates that overtime must be paid for all work in excess of 40 hours per week,
 and that regular days of leisure must be granted by employers. However, the mini-
 mum wage is not sufficient to provide a worker and family with a decent standard
 of living. High urban prices and dependent extended families oblige many workers
 to seek opportunities beyond their principal employment. Although health and safe-
 ty regulations call for twice-yearly visits by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor,
 in practice such visits occur less regularly. While unions generally are vigilant in
 calling attention to dangerous working conditions, the observance of safety stand-
 ards is often lax. Workers have no specific right to remove themselves from dan-
 gerous working conditions.
