 BOLIVIA
 A constitutional, multiparty democracy with an elected president and bicameral
 legislature, Bolivia has separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches with an
 attorney general independent of all three. The judiciary, while independent, is cor-
 rupt and inefficient. The executive and legislative branches share these defects to
 some extent. Implementation of the 1994 constitutional amendments to reform the
 political and judicial systems continued and was partially completed by the end of
 1997.
 The National Police have primary responsibility for internal security, but military
 forces can be called upon for help in critical situations. A special antinarcotics force
 (FELCN), including the Mobile Rural Patrol Unit (UMOPAR), is dedicated to
 antinarcotics enforcement. Civilian authorities maintain effective control of the se-
 curity forces, but some members of these forces committed human rights abuses.
 Bolivia has extensive poverty, and many citizens lack access to such basic services
 as potable water, sewage, electricity and primary health care. Per capita gross do-
 mestic product (GDP) is about $930. The country is rich in minerals and hydro-
 carbons, and extensive investments in petroleum deposits in the eastern part of the
 country are expected to form a basis for strong GDP growth in the future. Most
 workers engage in traditional agriculture, however, and many citizens will remain
 barely linked to the cash economy.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 legal and institutional deficiencies prevented their full protection. The most perva-
 sive human rights abuse continued to be prolonged incarceration of detainees due
 to antiquated procedures, and inefficiency and corruption in the judicial system.
 There were credible reports of abuses by police, including use of excessive force,
 petty theft, extortion, and improper arrests. Human rights groups criticized -the
 FELCN and the UMOPAR for alleged abuses against coca growers and peasants in
 the Chapare region. An investigation by the Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights found that security forces committed excesses resulting in the deaths of nine
 civilians in December 1996 and that the Government did not act to identify and
 punish those responsible. Investigations of alleged official abuses were slow. Other
 problems include harsh prison conditions, discrimination against and abuse of
 women and indigenous people, abuse of children, and inhuman working conditions
 in the mining industry.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. However, 14 civilians were killed in the course of law enforce-
 ment operations that encountered armed resistance. The precise 'causes and cir-
 cumstances of these deaths have not been officially determined, but it appeared that
 some resulted from the use of excessive force by authorities. Four police officers
 were killed by gunfire and one by beating in these operations.
 In December 1996, police and military forces were ordered to the Amayapampa
 area in Potosi department to dislodge miners who had seized a privately owned
 mine in a dispute with the mine's management. The miners had disarmed police
 units that tried earlier to recapture another mine seized from the same manage-
 ment. In the Amayapampa confrontations, nine civilians and one police officer were
 killed. The Government requested an investigation by the Inter-American Commis-
 sion on Human Rights (IACHR). In its July report, the IACHR found that on De-
 cember 19, 1996, four civilians were killed when police with riot gear and military
 troops with rifles fought civilians armed with rocks and dynamite. On December 20,
 1996, a police colonel was killed by rifle fire from ambush; 27 other security officials
 and a civilian doctor were wounded. There were no civilian casualties in this en-
 counter. Later that day, two civilians were killed when security forces using rifles
 occupied a village barricaded by civilians armed with rocks and dynamite. On De-
 cember 21, a civilian nurse helping the insurgent miners bled to death from an un-
 treated bullet wound in the leg. Four other civilians and three soldiers were wound-
 ed in the December 21 attack. The circumstances of the two additional confirmed
 civilian deaths have not been clarified. The IACHR concluded that some of the civil-
 ians killed were not active in the conflict.
 Military authorities who took control of the area did not permit some autopsies,
 ballistics tests, or other normal investigative measures, although the Ministry of
 Justice requested them. The IACHR found that the Government was responsible for
 the undisciplined actions of its security forces, although they exceeded their orders,
 and that the Government was also responsible for not fully investigating the violent
 events and punishing those who caused the civilian and official casualties. After the
 inauguration of the new Government on August 6, the Minister of Justice and the
 Attorney General ordered a complete investigation of the Amayapampa incidents,
 which was still under way at year's end.
 Violence increased in the Chapare region as the Government intensified its efforts
 to eradicate illegal coca in the first months of the year. Beginning on April 17, a
 series of clashes between coca growers and eradication forces led to the deaths of
 five civilians and one policeman. Three of the five civilians and the policeman died
 of gunshot wounds. Justice Ministry human rights investigators found that the,
 fourth civilian death, which had initially been attributed to gunfire, was caused by
 falling from a roof. The fifth civilian death, that of an infant allegedly overcome by
 tear gas fumes, occurred after human rights personnel took the child to a hospital
 He was suffering from a severe infection, undernourishment, and dehydration. Fam-
 ily members withheld the bodies of the infant and the fourth adult civilian casualty
 from the authorities and buried them without an autopsy. In the course of the April
 encounters, 15 civilians and 3 police officers were wounded by gunfire. Another 27
 civilians and 3 police officers suffered injuries unrelated to gunfire. An office of
 SDIRECO, the coca eradication agency, and vehicles were burned, and three police
 officials were briefly taken hostage.
 Police and DIRECO employees were ambushed on May 7 when returning to their
 bases. One policeman was killed and four other police and DIRECO personnel were
 wounded by gunfire. Despite extensive searches and claims to the contrary by coca
 growers, no evidence of civilian casualties was found. In August a policeman died
 from internal injuries caused by a blunt object, presumably a sling-fired stone, in
 the May 7 confrontation.
 One policeman was killed and another wounded by gunfire in an ambush on July
 2. One coca grower was wounded by shotgun pellets. Medical examination proved
 these to be lead pellets, not the rubber pellets used by police, indicating that he
 was, in fact, shot by his fellow coca growers. The police arrested eight coca growers
 in connection with this incident, but the case was not resolved.
 The police temporarily arrested large numbers of civilians in connection with
 these confrontations but none were prosecuted. There were credible allegations that
 police used undue force in making some arrests. There were also credible complaints
 that UMOPAR members often did not wear name tags on their uniforms as re-
 quired, making it impossible to identify individuals who allegedly committed abuses.
 
 
 Final results of investigations of these events, the two law enforcement-related
 deaths reported in 1996, and the five deaths in the Chapare in 1995, have not been
 released. No action is known to have been taken against any officials involved. The
 police officer accused in 1994 of murdering coca worker Felipe Perez Ortiz, who es-
 caped from custody in September of that year, has not been recaptured. The Govern-
 ment's failure to complete effective investigations and identify and punish those re-
 sponsible for either civilian or police deaths within a reasonable time creates an at-
 mosphere of impunity and a condition that almost amounts to lawlessness.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government honors the constitutional prohibition against torture. However,
 there were reports that police used undue force in detaining coca workers during
 antinarcotics operations. Although many such allegations clearly were politically
 motivated exaggerations, the similarity and volume of such claims suggest that they
 had some basis in truth. For example, during incidents in April, May, and July, po-
 lice used excessive force in making some arrests (see Section L.a.). However, no se-
 curity personnel were charged or tried. In January police arbitrarily arrested and
 beat an official of a human rights organization (see Section 1.d.).
 Several police officers were fired and charged for off-duty crimes including theft
 and rape. In general, however, police and prosecutors were reluctant to prosecute
 security officials for offenses committed while on duty. The Congress has yet to take
 action on the 1995 report of its Human Rights Commission resurrecting allegations
 that police officials had in past years tortured captured terrorists and recommend-
 ing that criminal proceedings be opened against a number of named officers,
 rson conditions are harsh. Prisons are overcrowded, and conditions can be life-
 threatening for inmates without money. Ability to pay can determine cell size, visit-
 ing privileges, day- pass eligibility, and plae or even length of confinement. Cell
 prices range from $20 to $5,000, paid to prior occupants or to prisoners who control
 cell blocks. In the poorest parts of La Paz' San Pedro prison, for example, inmates
 occupy tiny cells (3 by 4 by 6 feet) with no ventilation, lighting, or beds. Crowding
 in some "ow-rent" sections obliges inmates to sleep sitting up. Children up to 6
 years old may live with an incarcerated parent; more than 1,200 children do so, ac-
 cording to a February government report. The authorities worked to get such chil-
 dren out of prisons, but many have nowhere else to go, and the Government consid-
 ers it more humane to support them in prison than leave them homeless in the
 streets. The standard prison diet, according to a 1995 study, can cause anemia; the
 diet has not been improved since then. Drugs and alcohol are readily available for
 those inmates who can pay. There is no adequate health care within the prisons,
 and it is very difficult for prisoners to get permission for medical treatment outside.
 Affluent prisoners, however, can obtain transfers to preferred prisons or even to out-
 side private institutional care for "medical" reasons.
 SConvited juvenile prisoners are not segregated from adult prisoners in jails. Re-
 habilitation programs for juveniles or other prisoners are scarce to nonexistent. The
  Government has acknowledged these problems but does not have sufficient re-
 r sources to correct them quickly.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors and news media
 representatives. A high-level delegation from the International Committee of the
 Red Cross visited prisons and talked with all inmates accused of terrorism, in con-
 nection with the Tupac Amaru (MRTA) terrorist takeover of the Japanese Ambas-
 sador's residence in Lima, Peru.
 The incidence of violence in the Chapare coca-growing region increased over 1996,
 as some growers formed armed "self-defense groups" to oppose the eradication of il-
 legal coca. There were credible reports that coca growers unions used physical coer-
 cion and intimidation to prevent farm workers from cooperating with the Govern-
 ment in coca eradication. In February a large group of protesters destroyed a
 DIRECO office and kidnaped an employee; security forces found and freed him after
 24 hours. Indigenous groups complained that armed coca growers continued to in-
 vade their lands by force and coerce or bribe their members to cultivate illegal coca.
 Indigenous communities in areas with little or no central government presence
 impose punishment reliably reported to include the death penalty on members who
 violate traditional laws or rules, although such punishment is forbidden by the Con-
 stitution.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arrests are carried out openly. The law
 requires a valid warrant, which a court must confirm within 48 hours. However,
 there were credible reports that these legal safeguards were violated in some cases.
 On January 25, plainclothes police agents seized Waldo Albarracin, President of
 the Bolivian Permanent Assembly for Human Rights (APDH) on a public bus and
 held him for several hours before delivering him to a police station. Police then took
 
 
 him immediately to a medical clinic to investigate his complaint that he had been
 beaten while in illegal custody. The first examining physician reported that there
 were no signs of physical injury. However, a second clinic to which Albarracin was
 taken at the insistence of Ministry of Justice human rights officials, found ample
 evidence that Albarracin had been physically mistreated.
 The Government said first that Albarracin had been legally arrested on several
 charges including sedition and insurrection because, according to a newspaper re-
 port, he had suggested that the police colonel killed in the Amayapampa violence
 might have been shot by his own men. The complaint against Albarracin was fied
 by a senior police officer. Albarracin alleged that the newspaper had misquoted him
 and that the police had acted arbitrarily based only on an unconfirmed account. The
 acting District Prosecutor for La Paz denied that her office had issued any arrest
 warrant for Albarracin. The Technical Judicial Police, to whom Albarracin was de-
 livered by the arresting agents, denied that they had any documentation to support
 his arrest.
 The Commander of the National Police was replaced quickly after the discrep-
 ancies in the official story became public. Two police intelligence agents were identi-
 fied as Albarracin's abductors. The Constitution Commission of the Chamber of Dep-
 uties assumed jurisdiction over the investigation, which by law supersedes any po-
 lice investigative authority. The Commission became deadlocked because some mem-
 bers wanted the abducting agents to be tried by regular criminal courts while others
 believed that they should only receive administrative discipline. The Commission
 was not able to issue a report before the Congress recessed or the June 1 national
 elections. The new Congress did not deal with the matter, and the police agents re-
 mained unpunished at year's end.
 Denial of justice through prolonged detention remains the most pervasive human
 rights problem. Judicial cortin a sortage of public defenders, inadequate case-
 tracking mechanisms, and complex criminal justice procedures keep persons incar-
 cerated for months, or even years, before trial. The Constitution provides for judicial
 determination of the legality of detention. Prisoners are released if a judge rules de-
 tention illegal, but the process can take months. Prisoners may see a awyer, but
 approximately 70 percent cannot afford legal counsel, and public defenders are over-
 burdened. Bail exists, except in some drug cases, and is generally granted.
 The Government continued to address the problem of delay of justice by imple-
 menting the 1994 constitutional reforms to streamline the judicial system and by
 taking measures to correct other deficiencies as they come to light. Although large
 numbers of priseners continued to be released under the Personal Recognizance Law
 promulgated in 1996 most prisoners still await either trial or sentencing.  rbut
 The expanding public defender program pursues an active approach by     r-
 ing concise information about human rights to the populace and seeking to be in-
 valved in arrest cases at the earliest possible juncture to ensure that human rights
 and due process are honored. The new program of mobile ublic defenders who can
 reach the more remote parts of the country has proven efective, obtaining the re-
 lease of arrested persons in about 60 percent of the cases handled, and is being ex-
 tended to additional isolated regions.
 Children from 11 to 16 years of age can be detained indefinitely in children's cen-
 ters for known or suspected offenses, or for their protection, simply on the orders
 of a social worker. There is no judicial review.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The judiciary is independent, but corruption and
 intimidation in the judicial system remain major problems. Poor pay and working
 conditions help make judges and prosecutors susceptible to bribes. Five Supreme
 Court justices are the subject of corruption allegations or lawsuits that have not
 been resolved.
 The judicial system has four levels: Investigative, trial, and superior courts, with
 the Supreme Court at the apex.
 Police present the case of an arrested person to a prosecutor. If the prosecutor
 decides to prosecute, the case is then submitted to an investigative court which de-
 cides whether there is sufficient evidence to issue an indictment; if so, the case goes
 to a trial court. The trial court's decision may be appealed to superior court and,
 eventually, to the  Supreme Court. Cases of persons arrested       under the
 counternarcotics law go directly from a special prosecutor to the trial court. The
 trial court's decision must be reviewed by the district superior court, which may con-
 firm, lower, raise, or annul the sentence, or impose a sentence where there was none
 before. Both the district prosecutor and the defense attorney my  n make rec-
 ommendations and comments at this stage. Superior court decisions in narcotics
 cases must be reviewed by the Supreme Court, whose decision is final. Under the
 Personal Recognizance Law, persons who are absolved or found innocent in either
 
 
 of the two first instances may then be granted provisional liberty while they await
 the mandatory higher reviews.
 The authorities generally respect the constitutional provision of the right to a fair
 public trial. However, the maximum time periods permitted by law for different
 stages of the judicial process frequently are exceeded. Supreme Court justices admit
 that it is sometimes difficult to assemble the quorum needed for decisions, and con-
 sequently the Court's rulings are unduly delayed. The  authorities suspended 6
 judges and fined or placed on probation 15 others because they misapplied the law
 or unlawfully delayed the judicial process.
 A revised Criminal Code was adopted containing stronger provisions for the pro-
 tction of life and against official corruption. A new Law on Civil Processes and
 Family Assistance shortened the periods allowed for various stages of civil suits and
 eliminated some opportunities for delaying tactics by attorneys. The long-awaited
 bills to establish the Judicial Council, the Constitutional Court, the national Om-
 budsman, and to revise the Code of Criminal Procedures were submitted to the Con-
 gess in August. Congress passed laws creating the Ombudsman and the Judicial
 ouncil, and the President promulgated them in December.
 Defendants have the right to an attorney, to confront witnesses, to present evi-
 dence, and to appeal judicial decisions. The authorities generally honor these rights.
 Although the law provides for a defense attorney at public expense if needed, one
 is not always promptly available. The highly formal and corrupt judicial system
 makes it difficult for poor, illiterate persons to have effective access to courts and
 legal redress.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens, and
 government authorities generally respect these provisions. There were credible alle-
 gations of UMOPAR abuses involving llegal searches and thefts of property from
 omes. However, residents in the coca-growing areasgenerally are reluctant to file
 and pursue formal complaints. The Human Rights 0fice of the Ministry of Justice
 in the Chapare accepts and pursues complaints of human rights abuses committed
 by anyone, including police, narcotics traffickers, and coca growers.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the fundamental
 right to express ideas and opinions freely by any means of dissemination. There are,
 however, some limitations on freedom of speech. The Penal Code provides that per-
 soas found guilty of insulting, defaming, or slandering public officials for carrying
 out their duties may be jailed from 1 month to 2 years. If the insults are directed
 against the President, Vice President, or a Minister, the sentence may be increased
 by one-half.
 Newspapers are privately owned, and most adopt antigovement positions. State-
 owned and private radio and television stations operate freely. There we redible
 allegations that security forces interfered with broadcasts by a Catholic Church-
 owned radio station in the Amayapampa area during the December 1996 disturb-
 ances there.
 The Government respects academic freedom, and the law grants public univer-
 sities autonomous status. Some Marxist groups of teachers and students sought to
 deny academic freedom and to impose their political agenda on the education proc-
 ess. Radical elements of the teachers' union temporarily prevented the administra-
 tion of tests to qualify teachers for promotions, a new requirement of he Education
 Reform Law, but the tests eventually were given.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the rights
 of peaceful assembly and association, and theauthorities respect them in practice.
 The Government routinely grants permits for marches and rallies and, as a rule,
 the authorities try to avoid confronting demonstrators. However, police clashed with
 union and other demonstrators on some occasions. Labor, political, and student
 Ups carried out many demonstrations and rallies in La Paz and other cities
 thRughout the year, particularly during the first .quarter. The authorities inter-
 vened only when rallies became dangerously violent or interfered substantiallywith
 normal civic activity.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Roman Catholicism predominates, and the Constitution
 recognizes i as the official religion. However, citizens may practice the religion of
 their choice. About 400 religious groups, mostly Protestant, are active. Missionary
 grups must register with the Foreign Ministry as nongovernmental organizations
 trGO's); there was no indication that they were treated differently from other
 NGO's. The Ministry did not disallow any registrations by missionary groups.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on travel. The law permits emigration and
 provides for the right to return. The Government does not revoke citizenship for po-
 litical reasons.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Some refugees
 were accepted for resettlement. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not
 arise. After the takeover of the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima, Peru, by
 Tupac Amar terrorists, the authorities found that some MRTA activists had used
 Bolivia as a safehaven, and announced a more restrictive policy on accepting Peru-
 vian political asylees.
 There were no reports of persons forced to return to a country where they feared
 persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Political parties ranging from far
 left to moderate right function openly. Implementing regulations for the 1994 con-
 stitutional revisions provide for half of the congressional deputies to be elected indi-
 vidually and directly, rather than from party lists. The first national election under
 these regulations was held on June 1, with attendance by international observers.
 Only one instance of tampering with ballots was detected.
 No legal impediments exist to women or indigenous people voting, holding politi-
 cal office, or rising to political leadership. Nevertheless, the number of women and
 indigenous people who have prominent positions in politics remains small. Political
 parties acceded to demands from women that they be allocated a fair share of the
 candidacies in the 1997 national elections, approving a law that every third can-
 didate on party lists must be female. There are 12 women among the 157 deputies
 and senators. The Justice Minister is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. However, they criticize
 human rights advocates for paying attention exclusively to the negative aspects of
 the Government's performance. The Government asked the IACHR to investigate
 the December 1996 Amayapampa violence and cooperated in the subsequent inves-
 tigation (see Section l.a.). The Human Rights Commission of the Congress is very
 active and frequently criticizes the Government publicly.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based upon race, sex, language, religion,
 political or other opinion, origin, or economic or social condition. Nonetheless, there
 was significant discrimination against women, indigenous people, and the small
 black minority.
 Women.-Violence against women is pervasive. Of domestic violence complaints
 studied in 1992-93, 52 percent involved physical mistreatment and 48 percent in-
 volved psychological abuse. A total of 11,069 complaints of violence against women
 were registered in La Paz during this period. The Government estimates that there
 are about 100,000 incidents of violence against women annually nationwide and
 that as many as 95 percent of them go unpunished. The Congressional Committee
 on Women stated that an average of 3.5 cases of rape or statutory rape were re-
 ported each day for the first half of 1995 and estimated that twice that many cases
 were not reported.
 The Government continued to implement a program to protect women. In Decem-
 her 1995, the Government promulgated the Law on Domestic Violence, which makes
 rape .a public crime and broadens the definition of family member abuse. Public
 agencies state that reported incidents of abuse have increased markedly as a result
 of the new law, as citizens become more aware of the problem and of the availability
 of help. A presidential decree issued in October provided for equal rights for women
 and committed the Government to end gendr-based discrimination.
 Legal services offices devoted to family and women's rights operate throughout
 the country. Family protection police units, staffed by specially trained officers, in-
 cluding women, are also active.
 
 
 427
 A medical security program inaugurated in July 1996 provides free medical care
 to women of reproductive age and to children under the age of 5, based on economic
 need.
 The Penal Code does-not define sexual harassment as a crime. Authorities must
 try persons accused of harassment under other penal provisions. There are no sta-
 tistics on the incidence of sexual harassment, but the problem is generally acknowl-
 edged to exist widely in the male-oriented society.
 Women generally do not enjoy a social status equal to that of men. Many women
 do not know their legal rights. Traditional prejudices and social conditions remain
 obstacles to advancement. Women generally earn less than men for equal work.
 Young girls often leave school early to work at home or on the economy. A recent
 study by the Secretary of Education revealed that four out of five illiterate Bolivians
 are female. Although not effectively enforced, the national labor law is overprotec-
 tive in some aspects, limiting women to a workday 1 hour shorter than that of men
 -and prohibiting them from working at night.
 Children.-The Government is aware of the precarious situation of children and
 the need to provide legal and institutional infrastructure for their protection. Seven
 Defender of Children and Adolescents offices were opened in La Paz to help protect
 children's rights and interests. However, the Government has not given the poor sit-
 uation of children sufficient political priority to ensure that it will be corrected
 quickly and effectively.
 Statistics from the Ministry of Planning's Education Reform Team show that in
 rural areas, only 0.7 percent of girls and 1.4 percent of boys finish high school; in
 urban areas, 26 percent of girls and 31 percent zof boys do so. The 1994 Education
 Reform Act sought to improve the situation of children; even optimistic observers,
 however, noted that it would take years for it to have an impact.
 The National Institute of Statistics calculated in 1995 that 47 percent of children
 in La Paz were chronically undernourished, and that 10 percent of the children mi-
 grating from rural areas showed evidence of acute malnutrition.
 Many children, particularly from rural areas, lack the birth certificates and iden-
 tity documents they need to secure social benefits and protection. There are credible
 allegations that as many as 200 juveniles, for instance, are incarcerated as adults
 in the San Pedro jail for lack of reliable civil documents proving their ages. The Mi-
 nors' Code promulgated in 1992 has proven inadequate. A new Minors' Code was
 introduced in the Congress in March but was not passed by year's end.
 According to a 1995 report by the director of the National Institute of Child Devel-
 opment, 96,000 children have mental disabilities, 37,000 have physical disabilities,
 4,000 have hearing impairments, and 2,500 have visual impairments. Because of
 scarce resources, only about 6,000 of these children have access to specialized help.
 Government surveys suggest that about 1 million children (or about 1 child in 3)
 suffer physical or psychological abuse-13 percent of them at school, where corporal
 punishment and verbal abuse are common, and 87 percent at home. About 20 per-
 cent of these children suffer abuse severe enough to result in bruises, scars, or
 burns. Although laws provide safeguards against children working, they are not ef-
 fectively enforced, and about 216,000 children work, usually to help provide for fam-
 ily subsistence, in uncontrolled and sometimes unhealthy conditions (see Section
 6.d.).
 The old practice of "criadito" service still persists in some parts of the country.
 Criaditos are indigenous children of both sexes, usually 10 to 12 years old, whom
 their parents indenture to middle- and upper-class families to perform household
 work in exchange for education, clothing, room, and board. There are no controls
 over the benefits to, or treatment of, such children, who may become virtual slaves
 for the years of their indenture.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government promulgated regulations to implement
 the 1995 Law on Disabilities. The regulations require wheelchair access to all public
 and private buildings; duty free import of orthopedic devices; a 50 percent reduction
 in public transportation fares; and expanded teaching of sign language and Braille.
 A National Committee for Incapacitated Persons was established to oversee the
 law's enforcement, conduct studies, and channel and supervise programs and dona-
 tions for the disabled. The new electoral law made arrangements for blind voters.
 In general, however, there are no special services or infrastructure to accommodate
 people with disabilities. A lack of adequate resources impedes full implementation
 of the new law. Social attitudes keep many disabled persons at home from an early
 age, limiting their integration into society.
 Indigenous People.-Discrimination against, and abuses of, indigenous people con-
 tinued. The indigenous majority generally remains at the low end of the socio-
 economic scale, facing severe disadvantages in health, life expectancy, education, in-
 come, literacy, and employment. Lack of education, inefficient farming and mining
 
 
 methods, indigenous cultural practices, inability to speak Spanish, and societal bi-
 ases keep the indigenous people poor. They continued to be exploited in the work-
 place. Same rural ndigenous workers are kept in a state of virtual slavery by em-
 plyr  ho charg them more for room and board than they earn. Although the
 196 Agrarian Reform Law extended the protection of the national labor law to all
 paid agricultural workers, including indigenous workers, the problem persists for
 lack of effective enforcement.
 The Agrarian Reform Lawprovides for indigenous communities to have legal title
 to their communal lands and for individual farmers to have title to the land they
 work. The Government and indigenous leaders jointly developed provisions of this
 law. Government authorities presented communal land titles to seven indigenous
 groups in May.
 ngenous peopre complain that their territories are not legally defined and pro-
 tected, and that their resources are exploited by outsiders. Specific offenders alleg-
 edly are coca growers and timber pirates. Indigenous groups have taken advantage
 of the Popular Participation Law to form municipalities that otter them greater opy
 portunities for self-determination.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may form and join organizations of their
 choosing. The Labor Code requires prior government authorization to establish a
 Iunion, prmits onlyone union per enterprise,  allows the Government to dissolve
 unions; however, the Government has not enforced these provisions in recent years.
 While the code denies civil servants the right to organize and bans strikes in public
 services, including banks and public markets, nearly all civilian government work-
 ers are unionized. Workers are not penalized for umon activities. In theory, the Bo-
 livian Labor Federation (COB) represents virtually the entire work force; however,
 only about one-half of workers in the formal economy actually belong to labor
 unions. Sme members of the informal economy also participate in labor or trade
 organizations. Workers in the private sector frequently exercise the right to strike.
 Solidarity strikes are illegal, but the Government has neither prosecuted those re-
 sponsible nor imposed penalties. Significant strikes centered around annual negotia-
 tions over salaries an    its for public employees. However, their real targets
 were te Government's economic and social reform pronrams. Most strikes were con-
 ducted and led by the militant Trotskyite element of the Urban Teachers Union.
 Other disturbances occurred in the Chapare region wherethe coca growers unions
 opposed government eradication efforts. Dissension within the COB held disruptive
 public demonstrations to their lowest level in recent years.
 Unions are not free from influence by political parties. The COB itself is a politi-
 cal organization directed by Marxist ideologues. Its stated aim is to overthrow the
 Government's neoliberal economic program, and it gives little attention to serious
 collective bargaining. Most parties have labor committees that attempt to influence
 union activity and also have party activists inside the unions.
 The law allows unions to join international labor organizations. The COB became
 an affiliate of the Communist, formerly-Soviet-dominated, World Federation of
 Trade Unions in 1988.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-eWorkers may organize and
 bargain collectively. Collective barganing, or voluntary direct negotiations between
 employers and workers without the participation of the government, is limited but
 growing. The Labor Code was written in a period in which the COB,_which purports
 to represent all worker groups and interests, had quasi-governmental status and the
 exclusive authority to negotiate with state-owned enterprises. The practice was for
 the COB and the Government to negotiate a global agreement on salaries, minimum
 wages, and other work conditions each year. With the privatization of most of these
 enterprises, the COB's relevancy has diminished markedly, and the practice of di-
 rect employee-management negotiations in individual enterprises is expanding. The
 two most recent governments drafted new labor codes but did not submit them to
 the legislature, largely because of COB opposition.
 The law prohibits discrimination against union members and organizers. Com-
 plaints go to the National Labor Court, which can take a year or more to role. The
 court has ruled in favor of discharged workers in some cases and successfully re-
 quired their reinstatement. However, union leaders say problems are often moot hy
 the time the court rules.
 Labor law and practice in the seven special duty-free zones are the same as in
 the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including forced andbonded labor by children. However, the practices
 of child apprenticeship and agricultural servitude by indigenous workers (see Sec-
 
 
 tion 5) constitute violations, as do some individual cases of household workers effec-
 tively held captive by their employers.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits empoent of persons under 18 years of age in dangerous, unhealthy, or
 immoral work. The Labor Code is ambiguous on conditions of employment for mi-
 nors from 14 to 17 years of age and permits apprenticeship for those 12 to 14 years
 old. This practice sometimes tantamount to bondage (see Section 6.c.), has been
 criticized by the International Labor Organization. The extreme poverty of many
 families dictates the involuntary employment of their children for motives of sur-
 vival.
 Responsibility for enforcing child labor provisions resides in the Labor Ministry,
 but it generally does not enforce provisions about employment of children. Although
 the law requires all children to complete at least 5 years of primary school, this re-
 quirement is poorly enforced, particularly in rural aas. Urban children sell goods,
 shine shoes, and assist transport operators. Rural children often work with parents
 from an early age. Children are not generally employed in factories or formal busi-
 nesses but, when employed, often work the same hours as adults.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In conformity with the law, the minimum wage
 is subject to annual renegotiation and was increased by 7.5 percent to approxi-
 mately $45.50 (240 Bolivianos) per month, plus bonuses and fringe benefits. The
 minimum wage does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family,
 and most workers earn more. Although the minimum wage falls below prevailing
 wages in most jobs, certain benefit calculations are pegged to it. The minimum wage
 does not cover about 20 percent of urban workersvendors and shoe polishers, for
 example-nor does it cover farmers, some 30 percent of the working population.
 Only half the urban labor force enjoys an 8-hour workday and a workweek of 5
 or 5es days, because the maximum workweek of 44 hoursis inot enforced. The Labor
 Ministy's Bureau of Occupational Safety has responsibility for protection of work-
 ers' health and safety, but relevant standards are poorly enforced. Working condi-
 tions in the mining sector are particularly bad. Although the State Mining Corpora-
 tion has an office responsible for safety, many mines, often old and using antiquated
 equipment, are dangerous and unhealthy. In some mines operated as cooperatives,
 miners earn less than $3 per 12-hour day. They work without helmets, bots, or res-
 fatrs in mines where toxic gases abound; they buy their own supplies, including
 ynamite, have no schled   rest periods, and must survive underground from 24
 to 72 hours continuously with little water and food. There are no special prvisions
 in law defining when workers may remove themselves from dangerous situations.
 Unless the work contract covers this area, any worker who refuses to work based
 on the individual's judgment of excessively dangerous conditions may face dismissal.
