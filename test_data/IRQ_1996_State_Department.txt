 IRAQ*
 Political power in Iraq is concentrated in a repressive one-party apparatus domi-
 nated by Saddam Hussein. The provisional Constitution of 1968 stipulates that the
 Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) governs Ira9 through the Revolutionary Com-
 mand Council (RCC), which exercises both executive andlegislative authority. Presi-
 dent Saddam Hussein, who is also Prime Minister, Chairman of the RCC, and Sec-
 retary General of the Regional Command of the ABSP, wields decisive power. Sad-
 dam Hussein and his colleagues continue to point to an October 1995, nondemo-
 cratic "referendum" on his presidency in which he received 99.96 per cent of the vote
 as legitimating the regime. However, his "referendum" included neither secret bal-
 lots nor opposing candidates, and many credible reports indicated that voters feared
 possible reprisal for a negative vote. The judiciary is not independent and is subject
 to presidential interference.
 Ethnically and linguistically, the Iraqi population includes Arabs, Kurds,
 Turkomen, Yazidis, and Armenians. Histrically, the religious mix is likewise var-
 ied: Shi'a and Sunni Muslims (both Arab and Kurdish), Christians (including
 Chaldeans and Assians), and Jews (most of whom have emiated). Ethnic divi-
 sions have resulted in civil uprisings in recent years, especially in the north and
 the south. The Government has reacted against those who revolt with extreme re-
 pression.
 The Government's security apparatus includes militias attached to the President,
 the Ba'ath Party, and the Interior Ministry. They play a central role in maintaining
 the environment of intimidation and fear on whichn government power rests. Secu-
 rity forces have committed widespread, serious, and systematic human rights
 abuses.
 The Government controls most of the economy which is largely based on oil gro-
 duction, and owns all major industries. Damaged by the Gulf War and subjected to
 United Nations sanctions as a result of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the economy
 continues to deteriorate. The sanctions ban all exports and allows imports only of
 food, medicine, and materials and supplies for essential civilian needs. The Govern-
 ment's failure to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions has led to repeated
 extensions of the sanctions. In May, after a year of obstruction and delay, the Gov-
 ernment reached agreement with the U.N. on a plan to implement U.N. Security
 Council Resolution (UNSCR) 986, which would allow a controlled sale of Iraqi oil
 to purchase food and other humanitarian goods to improve the deteriorating situa-
 tion of the Iraqi people. Throughout the rest of 1996, however, the Government con-
 tinued to engage in delaying tactics and other actions which the U.N. and other ob-
 servers cited as delaying implementation. The Government's actions threatened the
 resolution's intended controls on oil sales and the conditions required to ensure fair
 and equitable distribution of relief. In mid-December, the U.N. announced that con-
 ditions were finally in place to allow implementation to begin, although it appeared
 likely that relief would not be delivered until early 1997.
 The Government's abysmal record on human rights worsened in 1996. Human
 rights abuses remain extremely difficult to document because of the Government's
 efforts to conceal the facts, including its refusal to permit visits by human rights
 monitors or other observers and its continued restrictions designed to prevent dis-
 sent. Nevertheless, the Government's renewal of repression and threats in northern
 Iraq following its military attack on the city of Irbil on August 31 make it clear that
 serious human rights violations increased.
 Summary executions of perceived political opponents reportedly increased, as did
 reports of disappearances. Both types of repression were particularly clear in the
 north during and after the August 31 attack on Irbil. Tens of thousands of political
 killings and disappearances remain unresolved from previous years. As socio-
 economic conditions deteriorated, the regime punished persons accused of economic
 crimes, military desertion, and a variety of other charges with torture and cruel and
 inhuman penalties, including the extensive use of amputation. Prison conditions are

 large extent on non-U.S. Government sources.

 poor. The authorities routinely use arbitrary arrest and detention. The judiciary is
 not independent; the President can override any court decision. The Government
 continues to deny citizens the right to due process and privacy. Max van der Stoel,
 the Special Rapporteur for Iraq appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC), confirmed again that freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and associa-
 tion do not exist, except in some parts of the northern areas, beyond control of the
 Government. The Government severely limits freedo    .of religion and movement,
 discriminates against women, children, religious minorities, and ethnic groups. It
 also restricts worker rights.
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. The October "referen-
 dum on Saddam's presidency was not free. It was dismissed by most international
 observers. As in years past, the Government forcibly transferred hundreds of gov-
 ernment workers from one job to another, purportedly to prevent the development
 of potential opposition in any government institutions. After failed coup attempts
 and repressed protests between May and July, the Government arrested, removed
 from their jobs, or otherwise punishednumerous citizens for their alleged association
 with these incidents. The fate of many such persons remains unknown. After
 Saddam's daughters and his sons-in-law, Hussein Kamel and Saddam Kamel al-
 Majid, defected to Jordan in Augu.st 1995, the Government reportedly arrested
 scores of midlevel military and civilian officials for their association with the defec-
 tors. Evidence has emerged that the Government was behind the deaths of
 Saddam's sons-in-law, who returned to Iraq in February from Jordan after they re-
 ceived promises of amnesty. Shortly after entering Iraq, the two were separated
 from their families and were killed, allegedly in a gunfight with relatives. Other
 members of the al-Majid clan were also arrested or disappeared.
 Iraqi military operations continued to target Shi'a Arabs living in the southern
 marshes. In central and southern Iraq, the regime continued to divert humanitarian
 supplies to its security forces, the military, and other supporters. For most of the
 year, the Government maintained an internal embargo against Iraq's northern
 governorates, blocking the shipment of food, medicine, and other goods from govern-
 ment-controlled territory to the Kurdish-controlled areas. The Government an-
 nounced the lifting of the internal embargo on September 12, but anecdotal and
 other reports indicate that the regime still exercises tight control over the flow of
 goods and services into and out of northern areas.
 The Government persisted in its flagrant interference with the international com-
 munity's provision of humanitarian assistance, in contravention of the conditions of
 UNSC Resolution 688. It harassed and intimidated relief workers as well as U.N.
 security personnel throughout the country. The Government renewed a threat to ar-
 rest or kill relief workers, whether foreign or Iraqi, simply for association with a
 foreign relief organization. The Government initially objected to the distribution
 monitors required by the terms of Resolution 986, and it remains to be seen whether
 the Government will allow those monitors to carry out their work. In northern Iraq,
 fighting continued between the two main Iraqi Kurd groups, the Kurdistan Demo-
 cratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), in which both fight-
 ers and civilians were killed. KDP cooperation with the Government in the August
 31 attack and PUK cooperation with Iran in August increased instability and, ac-
 cording to Iraqi and Iranian opposition reports, the ability of both governments to
 act against political opponents in the area. A cease-fire established on October 23
 ended fighting for the rest of the year, albeit with a few sporadic clashes. At the
 end of the year, both groups were considering a mutual release of detainees as one
 of several confidence-building measures to strengthen the cease-fire and improve
 pros    s for political reconciliation between the two groups. Terrorist actions in
 northern Iraq and Turkey by the Turkish terrorist organization, the Kurdistan
 Workers' Party (PKK), also resulted in the death of both fighters and civilians. Both
 Iraqi Kurdish groups and the PKK reportedly committed serious abuses, including
 killings, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The regime has a long record of exe-
 cuting perceived opponents. The U.N. Special Rapporteur, the international media,
 and other groups all reported an increased number of summary executions in 1996.
 In his November report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, the Specal
 Rapporteur stated that "the country is run through extrajudicial measures." In an
 April 10 report, Amnesty International noted that various decrees expanding the
 use of the death penalty in 1994 and 1995 have not been sufficiently clarified to
 
 
 1267
 ensure fair and just applicability, a problem compounded by the lack of an inde-
 pendent judiciary.
 As in previous years, there were numerous credible reports that the regime exe-
 cuted persons allegedly involved in plotting against President Hussein, including
 high-ranking civiian, miitary_, and tribal leaders, as well as members of his family
 and clan. The regime periodically eliminates large numbers of detainees; in May,
 according to unconfirmed reports, the regime executed as many as 100 detainees.
 In June some 400 officers of various ranks were executed, including some senior Re-
 publican Guard officers. Allegedly these executions were ordered directly by Saddam
 H-uein and supervised by his eldest son, Uday. Also in June, Uday reportedly or-
 dered the killing of a former aide, Muhammad A-Rawi, for trading stocks on the
 Baghdad stock market.
 Hussein Kamel and Saddam Kamel, Saddam Hussein's sons-in-law, were executed
 by the Government in February, according to numerous credible sources, when they
 returned from Jordan after defecting in August 1995. Although the Government an-
 nounced amnesties for both men, they and over 40 relatives, including women and
 children, were killed in what the official Iraqi press described as the spontaneous
 administration of tribal justice. The Special Rapjorteur noted in his November re-
 port that "the killings occurred without any legal process and with total impunity.
 He also cited continued reports of the frequent use of the death penalty for such
 offenses as "insulting" the President or the Ba'ath Party, and the pervasive fear of
 death for any act or expression of dissent.
 Government forces reportedly executed more Shi'a inhabitants of the southern
 marshes in 1996, but there remains no independent means to verify these reports
 (see Section 1.g.).
 Indications persist that the Government has offered "bounties" to anyone who
 kills United Nations or other international relief workers in northern Iraq. A Sep-
 tember 12 amnesty announcement specifically excluded anyone accused of espio-
 nage, a charge the Government has repeatedly made against foreign relief organiza-
 tions working in northern Iraq.
 As in previous years, the regime continued to deny totally the widespread killings
 of Kurds in northern Iraq during the "Anfal" Campaign of 1988 (see Sections 1.b.
 and 1.g.). The Special Rapporteur and Human Rights Watch have concluded that
 the Government's policies against the Kurds raise issues of crimes against humanity
 and violations of the 1948 Genocide Convention.
 The most obvious extrajudicial killings occurred during and after the Iraqi army
 attacked northern Iraq in late August and early September. Numerous credible re-
 ports, including but not limited to eyewitness accounts collected by opposition orga-
 nizations, confirm that 96 Iraqi army officers and soldiers who had previously  e-
 serted the army and fled to the north were captured in the town of Qushtapa, 22
 kilometers south of Irbil, on August 31. Local residents were reportedly taken to the
 town center and forced to watch while soldiers executed these prisoners. As noted
 by the Special Rapporteur and media reports, a KDP spokesman acknowledged on
 Septembr 11 that the Government was responsible for these executions. Numerous
 other individual executions and extrajudicial killings were reported over the next
 few months. For example, on October 16 the body of an Iraqi dissident, architectural
 engineer Qutaiba Ghazi Al-Samarra'i, was discovered in Dohuk. According to opposi-
 tion reports, Al-Samarra'i was an opponent of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship and
 was eventually sought out and killed by government intelligence units.
 There was no further information on the death of the prominent Shi'a
 oppositionist Taki Al-Khoei who, along with three others, was killed in 1994 in a
 suspicious automobile crash in southern Iraq. Strong circumstantial evidence points
 to the Government's involvement.
 During the year, political killings and terrorist actions occurred in northern Iraq.
 Intra-Kirdish fighting from August through October between the PUK and the KDP
 resulted in the deaths of several fighters and civilians, and both groups complained
 of forced expulsions of one another's supporters from territory controlled by the
 other party. At the end of the year, both groups were working to confirm the where-
 abouts of one another's detainees and missing supporters and to end forced expul-
 sion and other abuses as part of confidence-building measures to strengthen the Oc-
 tober 23 cease-fire. Throughout 1996 elements of the PKK, a Turkish Kurd terrorist
 group, remained active in northern iraq and reportedly killed local residents in an
 effort to control a territorial base. The PKK sometimes attacked civilians, foreign
 relief workers, and journalists.
 b. Disappearance.-The Special Rapporteur stated in November that he continues
 to receive reports on widespread disappearances. The Government continued to ig-
 nore the more than 15,000 cases conveyed to it in 1994 and 1995 by the U.N. Work-
 ing Group on Enforcement on Involuntary Disappearances, as well as other requests
 
 
 1268
 from the Governments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on the whereabouts of those
 missing from the 1990-91 occupation of Kuwait.
 The United Nations has documented over 16,000 cases of persons who have dis-
 appeared According to the Special Rapporteur, most of these cases occurred during
 the Anfal campaign. He estimates that the total number of Kurds who disappeared
 during Anfal could reach the tens of thousands. HRW estimates the total at between
 70,000 and 150,000, and Amnesty International (Al) at more than 100,000.
 Disappearances in northern Iraq increased in 1996 as Iraqi and Iranian intel-
 ligence units grew more active, On September 11, a KDP spokesman confirmed var-
 ious reports that Iraqi intelligence units arrested numerous individuals, including
 members of the oppositionist Iraqi National Congress (INC) and Turkomen an
 Islamist groups. According to the Special Rapporteur, the fate of these individuals
 remains unknown. Unconfirmed reports blamed Iran for the disappearances of sev-
 eral Iranian opposition figures who resided in the north.
 The Special Rapporteur and several human rights groups continued to request
 that the Government provide information-about the arrest in 1991 of the late Grand
 Ayatollah Abdul Qasim Al-Khoei and 108 of his associates. The Ayatollah died while
 under house arrest in Al-Najaf. Others arrested with him have not been accounted
 for, and the regime refuses to respond to queries regarding their status.
 The Government failed to return or account for a large number of Kuwaiti citizens
 and other foreign nationals detained during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. Regime
 officials, including military leaders known to have been among the last to see the
 persons who disappeared during the occupation, have refused to respond to the hun-
 dreds of outstanding inquiries about the missing. The regime denies having any
 knowledge of them and claims that relevant records were lost in the aftermath of
 the Gulf War.
 In addition to the tens of thousands of reported disappearances, human rights
 groups report that the Government continues to hold thousands of other Iraqis in
 incommunicado detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The security services routinely torture detainees, even though the Constitution pro-
 hibits the practice. The Special Rapporteur and Al provided new, detailed accounts
 of the Government's systemic use of physical and psychological torture in recent
 years. They noted that government decrees an    nouncements that might reduce
 the use of torture had not been confirmed by demonstrable evidence. For example,
 the Special Rapporteur noted that an August 5 RCC decree suspending the use of
 amputation against army deserters did not apply to those convicted of various other
 crimes. The execution of 96 deserters in northern Iraq on August 31 (see Section
 1.a) calls into question whether the Government intended any lesser punishments
 for army deserters.
 According to former detainees, torture techniques include hranding, electric
 shocks administered to the gdnitals and other areas, beatings, burnings with hot
 irons, suspension from ceiling fans, dripping acid on the skin, rape, breaking of
 limbs, denial of food and water, and threats to rape or otherwise harm relatives.
 Tormentors kill many torture victims and mutilate their bodies before returning
 them to the victims' families.
 Eyewitnesses reported that the Government carried out second amputations and
 brandings on repeat offenders and on those who sought corrective surgery for earlier
 disfigurements. In some of these cases, the regime executed the oenders as well
 as the doctors who either performed corrective surgery or refused to carry out ampu-
 tations. The Special Rapporteur also reported the execution of a number of doctors
 who refused to tattoo army deserters on their foreheads as required by government
 decree. In his November report, the Special Rapporteur reconfirmed his previous
 analysis, that the amputations and brandings constituted "gross violations of human
 rights."
 Several government officials cited Islamic law (Shari'a) as a rationale for ampu-
 tating the right hands of convicted thieves, but none commented on the punish-
 ments impsed on repeat offenders or the Government's disregard for rights pro-
 tected uner Islamic law. One senior official claimed that brandings were instituted
 in order to avoid confusing criminals with war veterans who hadlost limbs in bat-
 tle.
 The Special Rapporteur, human rights organizations, and opposition groups con-
 tinue to receive numerous reports of women still suffering severe psychological trau-
 ma after they were raped while in custody. The security forces allegediy raped
 women captured during the Anfal Campaign and during the occupation of Kuwait.
 The Government has never acknowledged these reports of rape or conducted any in-
 vestigation. Although the regime made a variety of pronouncements against rape
 
 
 1269
 and other violent crimes during the year, it took no action against regime activists
 who committed these abuses.
 Prison conditions are poor. Certain prisons are notorious for routine mistreatment
 of prisoners. Al-Rashidiya Prison, on the Tigris River north of Taji reportedly has
 torture chambers. The Al-Shamma'iya Prison, located in east Baghdad, holds the
 mentally ill and is reportedly the site of both torture and disappearances.
 The Al-Radwaniyah Prison is a former prisoner-of-war facility near Baghdad and
 reportedly the site of torture as well as mass executions. This prison was the prim-
 il detention center for persons arrested following the civiluprisings of 1991.
  and others have estimated that the A-Radwaniyah Prisn holds more than
 5,000 detainees.
 There were continued reports that Iraqi Kurdish groups tortured captured crimi-
 na suspects and political opponents. A wide variety of observers documented KDP
 abuses against the al-sourchi tribe and others for alleged ooperation with the PUK
 and others. Some observers charged that the KDP was reportedly responsible for the
 death of a respected leader of the tribe, Hussein al-Sourchi, as well as for detaining
 tens of suspected KDP opponents and for property damage. The KDP claimed that
 Hussein al-Sourci's death was an accidental result of a preemptive strike against
 KDP opponents, and the KDP denied what it termed exaggerated reports of damage
 and of detainees. Numerous other reports of KDP and PUK abuses against per-
 ceived opponents also circulated during the year, especially in the aftermath of Ira-
 nian support for PUK military moves in Augst and of Saddam Hussein's August
 31 attack on Irbil (see Section 1.g.). The PKK also reportedly tortured civilians cap-
 tured in northern Iraq in the latter half of the year. The UNHCR and other observ-
 ers noted that PKK influence at the Atrush refugee camp had grown to such a point
 that at year's end the UNHCR decided to close the camp, with its inhabitants of-
 fered the options of voluntary repatriation to Turkey or relocation elsewhere in
 northern Iraq.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution and Legal
 Code explicitly prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, the authorities routinely en-
 gage in these practices. In his November report, the Special Rapporteur stated that
 arbitrary arrests are still common throughout the country and often lead to deten-
 tion for long periods of time without access to a lawyer or being charged. The mili-
 tary and security services, rather than the ordinary police, carry out most cases of
 arbitrary arrest and detention. Government officials have linked ending these prac-
 tices to the lifting of the international embargo. They maintain that the arrests are
 a tempry preventive measure and do not constitute human rights violations.
 It has also been reported that there is a widespread practice of holding family
 members and close associates responsible for the allege[ actions of others. In the
 aftermath of several security incidents, security forces reportedly arrested hundreds
 of persons perceived as security threats, mainly on the basis of an individual's per-
 sonal association or family connection with opponents of the regime. Many of those
 arrested were reportedly killed while in custody (see Section L.a.). The Special
 Rapporteur also notes that "guilt by association" is facilitated by administrative re-
 quirements on relatives of deserters or other perceived opponents of the regime. Rel-
 atives who do not report deserters, for example, could lose their ration cards for pur-
 chasing government-controlled food supplies or be evicted from their residences.
 According to international human rights groups, numerous foreigners arrested ar-
 bitrarily in previous years remain in detention.
 According to the Special Rapporteur's report, Iraqi military and security authori-
 ties arbitrarily arrested hundreds of people during and after the Government's mili-
 tary operations against the northern city of Irbil in late August and early Septem-
 ber. Among those arrested were several prominent local politicians, intellectuals,
 lawyers, journalists, and university lecturers. Reportedly 1,500 persons were ar-
 rested in Irbil alone, including women and children. In addition, 150 members of
 an opposition group and persons suspected of involvement with opposition groups
 were reportedly detained by government security personnel. Their fate remains un-
 known.
 Opposition groups provide many detailed but unconfirmed reports of arbitrary ar-
 rest in other areas of the country. In April, for example, the regime reportedly
 launched a random arrest campaign in the Ai-Basrah governorate. Troops report-
 edly raided a number of homes in the AI-Zubayr district and arrested about 30 citi-
 zens under the pretext that the detained persons had connections with Kuwaiti citi-
 zens who own farms near the Iraqi border. In the Abu AI-Khasib district, six citi-
 zens reportedly were arrested on the same charge.
 The Government reportedly continued to target Shi'a Muslim clergy and their
 supporters for arbitrary arrest and other abuses. The Government also reportedly
 continued to forcibly move various Shi'a populations from the south to the north and
 
 
 1270
 other minority groups such as Assyrians and Turkomen from the north to govern-
 ment-controlled terntor. There was no substantive evidence that the Government
 was implementing two amnesty" decrees issued in 1995. Al stated on April 10 that
 it "remains concerned that Iraqi authorities may be attempting to bring deserters
 and government opponents out of hiding in order to penalize them." The Special
 Rapporteur reported in November that his similar analysis in 1995 remained accu-
 rate.
 Although the figure is unknown, there are possibly thousands of political detain-
 ees.
 The Government apparently does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public *raL-The judiciary is not independent, and there is no
 check on the President's power to override any court decision. The Special
 Rapporteur and international human rights groups all observed during the year
 that the repressive nature of the political and legal systems precludes any concept
 of rule of law.
 There are two parallel judicial systems: the regular courts, which try common
 criminal offenses; and special security courts, which generally try national security
 cases, but may also try criminal cases. There is a Court of Appeal. The Court of
 Cassation is the highest court.
 Procedures in the regular courts theoretically provide for many protections. How-
 ever, the regime often assigns to the security courts cases which, on their merits,
 would appear to fall under the jurisdiction of the regular courts. Trials in the regu-
 lar courts are public, and defendants are entitled to counsel, at government expense
 in the case of indigents. Defense lawyers have the right to review the charges and
 evidence brought against their clients. There is no jury system; panels of three
 judges try cases. Defendants have the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal and
 then to the Court of Cassation. The Special Rapporteur noted in his November re-
 port that numerous laws lend themselves to continued oppression. He reported in
 detail on extrajudicial methods used by the Government in previous years to extract
 confessions or coerce cooperation with repressive actions by the Government's secu-
 rity forces.
 The Government shields certain groups from prosecution for alleged crimes. A
 1992 decree grants immunity from prosecution to members of the Ba ath Party and
 the security forces who kill anyone while inpursuit of army deserters. Unconfirmed
 but widespread reports indicate that this dcree was a pplied in 1996 to prevent
 trials or punishment of such government officials as Uday Saddam Hussein the
 Presidents son. A 1990 decree grants immunity to men who kill their mothers,
 daughters, and other female family members who have committed "immoral deeds,"
 e.g., adultery, fornication, etc.
 Special security courts have jurisdiction in all cases involving espionage and trea-
 son, peacefil political dissent, smuggling, currency exchange violations, and drug
 trafficking. According to the Special a  orteur and other sources, military officers
 or civil servants with no le a training head these tribunals, which hear cases in
 secret. Authorities often hold defendants incommunicado and do not permit contact
 with lawyers. The courts admit confessions extracted by torture, which often serve
 as the basis for conviction.
 Many cases appear to end in summary execution, although defendants may ap-
 peal to the President for clemency. Saddam Hussein may grant clemency in any
 case that apparently suits his political goals.
 There are no Shari'a, or Islamic law, courts as such. Regular courts are empow-
 ered to administer Islamic law in cases involving personal status, such as divorce
 and inheritance.
 Because the Government rarely acknowledges arrests or imprisonments, it is dif-
 ficult to estimate the number of political prisoners. Many of the tens of thousands
 of persons who have disappeared or been killed in recent years were originally held
 as political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government frequently disregards the constitutional right to privacy, particularly in
 cases allegedly involving national security. The law defines security offenses so
 broadly that authorities are virtually exempt from the legal requirement to obtain
 search warrants. In 1996 the authorities subjected citizens of various ethnic groups
 and tribal affiliations to searches without warrants (see Section 1.g.). The regime
 routinely ignores the constitutional provisions safeguarding the confidentiality of
 mail, telegraphic correspondence, and telephone conversations. The Government pe-
 riodically jams news broadcasts, including those of opposition groups, from outside
 ile security services and the Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive networks of in-
 formers to deter dissident activity and instill fear in the public. For example, the
 
 
 1271
 Special Rapporteur reported in November that an operator was arrested and exe-
 cuted in 1993 for having warned a person not to use a bugged telephone line. The
 authorities also hold family members and close associates responsible for the alleged
 actions of others (see Section 1.d.).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-As in previous years, the armed forces conducted deliberate artillery attacks
 against Shi'a civilians in the southern marshes and against minority groups in
 northern Iraq. In 1992 the Gulf War allies imposed "no-fly zones" over both north-
 ern and southern Iraq. The no-fly zones continue to deter aerial attacks on the
 marsh dwellers in southern Iraq and residents of northern Iraq, but they do not pre-
 vent artillery attacks in either area, nor the military's large-scale burning oper-
 ations in the south.
 Credible reports confirm the ongoing destruction of the marshes. The army contin-
 ued to construct canals, causeways, and earthen berms to divert water from the wet-
 lands. Hundreds of square kilometers have been burned in military operations.
 Moreover, the regime's diversion of supplies in the south limited the population's ac-
 cess to food, medicin e, drinking water, and transportation.
 During 1996 the Government regularly reported on several water-diversion and
 other projects in the south, which continued the process of large-scale environmental
 destruction. The Government claims the drainage is part of a land reclamation plan
 to increase the acreage of arable land, spur agricultural production, and reduce salt
 pollution in the Tigri's and Euphrates rivers. However, the evidence of large-scale
 human and ecological destruction appears to belie this claim.
 The Government maintained an internal embargo against the three governorates
 in northern Iraq for most of the year. These governorates are populated primarily
 by Kurds, Assyrians Turkoman, and other ethnic minorities. The embargo pre-
 vented the entry of fod, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies to that area.
 Beginning in 1993, the embargo also included electrical power cut-offs in specific
 areas, causing the disruption of water and sanitation systems and interfering with
 the delivery of food and fuel. The United Nations and donor governments installed
 temporary generators to alleviate the crisis. The Government announced that the
 embargo was lifted in mid-September, but anecdotal and other reports indicate that
 some areas are still subject to more restrictive movements of goods and people than
 other parts of the country. The entire northern area remains subject to the threat
 of future cut-offs.
 Operation Provide Comfort-a multinational coalition made up of the United
 States, United Kingdom, France, and Turkey--continued enforcement of a "no-fly
 zone" to inhibit government aerial activity to repress citizens in northern Iraq. How-
 ever, government military forces continued intermittent, sometimes heavy shelling
 of northern villages by long-range artillery throughout the year, especially of areas
 controlled by the PUK. Iranian forces reportedly shelled military positions and civil-
 ian sites within KDP-controlled areas in August. The Government also continued to
 "Arabize" certain areas, such as the urban centers of Kirkuk and Mosul, through
 the forced movement of local residents from their homes and villages and their re-
 placement by Arabs from outside the area (see Section 1.d.).
 On August 31, government troops, tanks, artillery, and helicopters first shelled
 and then captured the city of Irbil in northern Iraq. Several other cities and villages
 in northern Iraq were shelled by artillery and then were entered by government
 troops. The Special Rapporteur stated in November that indiscriminate shelling by
 Iraqi forces of civilian settlements had been a recurrent practice well before these
 most recent clashes. He and numerous other observers confirmed that the Govern-
 ment's use of military forces against civilian targets is a clear violation of Security
 Council Resolution 688, which demands that the Government cease oppression of its
 civilian population.
 According to the Special Rapporteur, there were at least 100 casualties following
 the drive by troops into Irbil, as well as many other casualties of a simultaneous
 push by the KDP. In addition, security forces reportedly executed several members
 of the INC PUK, and other opposition groups in the streets following house-to-
 house searches.
 It has also been reported that the troops that entered the villages upon the first
 attacks burned and destroyed houses after having looted valuable property. Major
 buildings, including hospitals, as well as water and sanitation systems, were report-
 edly looted, damaged, and in some cases destroyed. The armed conflict in Irbil also
 resulted in the cutting of electricity and water supplies by both Kurdish groups,
 which were restored fully a few weeks after a cease-fire was put in place on October
 23.
 The KDP was accused of several extrajudicial killings and indiscriminate attacks
 in September, including a confirmed attack on September 10 on a camp near the
 
 
 1272
 Iranian border that held refugees from PUK-controlled areas. The KDP also de-
 tained PUK members and perceived supporters throughout this peroid, including
 PUK plitburo member Fuad Massoum and 11 other PW su)pporters who were re-
 leased on September 25. The PUK was accused of similar indiscriminate attacks
 and detainees in August and October, which the KDP said were supported by Ira-
 nian forces. The vast majority of these reports could not be confirmed due to the
 absence of impartial observers and the general lack of security, but individual cases
 that were confirmed indicate that the abuses likely took place on both sides while
 fighting continued.
 During this period, the KDP and PUK took steps to protect foreign workers en-
 gaged in humanitarian relief work. However, there were several reports that Kurd-
 ish relief workers were abused during the second half of the year.
 The PKK committed numerous abuses against civilians in northern Irag through-
 out the year. It also stepped up violence against UNHCR officials working in the
 Atrush refugee camp late in the year.
 On severa occasions in 1996, Turkish armed forces entered northern Iraq in pur-
 suit of PKK terrorists and bases. Human rights organizations and political organiza-
 tions charged that these operations resulted in some civilian deaths and destruction
 of residences. Turkish government authorities stressed that the operation sought to
 avoid civilian casualties.
 Land mines in northern Iraq, mostly planted by the Government before 1991, con-
 tinue to kill and maim civilians. Many of the mines were laid during the Iran-Iraq
 War, but the army failed to clear them before it abandoned the area. The mines
 appear to have been haphazardly planted in civilian areas. The Special Rapporteur
 has repeatedly remindedl the Government of its obligations under the Land Mines
 Protocol to protect civilians from the effects of mines. Various nongovernmental or-
 ganizations continue efforts to remove mines from the area and increase mine
 awareness among local residents.
 Reports from victims and eyewitnesses show that the Iraqi regime engaged in war
 crimes--willful killing, torture, rape, pillage, hostage-taking, and associated acts-
 directly related to the Gulf War. Many governments continue to urge the U.N. Secu-
 rity Council to establish an international commission to study evidence of a broader
 range of war crimes, as well as crimes against humanity and possible genocide.
 HRW continues to work with various governments to bring a genocide case at the
 International Court of Justice against the Government for its conduct of the Anfal
 campaign against the Kurds in 1988. U.S. Government policy is to support these
 efforts to hold Saddam Hussein's regime accountable for its war crimes and crimes
 against humanity.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and of the press do not exist,
 and political dissent is not tolerated in areas under the Government's control. The
 Special Rapporteur reports that "the possibility for citizens to freely express their
 opinions is seriously undermined if not totally meaningless."
 The Government and the Ba'ath Party own all print and broadcast media and op-
 erate them as propaganda outlets. They generally do not report opposing points of
 view that are expressed either domestically or abroad. According to the Special
 Rapporteur, journalists are under regular pressure to join the Ba'ath party. The
 Special Rapporteur and other observers have described how journalists are under
 instruction to mention Saddam Hussein positively in any article, regardless of the
 subject. The same sources have detailed how journalists may fall under suspicion
 for not writing about Saddam HIussein every few months. Negative articles can
 carry extreme consequences: one journalist was reportedly executed extrajudicially
 for criticizing an article written by Saddan Hussein under a pseudonym, while an-
 other was sentenced to life imprisonment for telling a joke about the President.
 The Special Rapporteur also reported that the Ministry of Culture and Informa-
 tion periodically holds meetings at which orientation and general guidelines for the
 press are provided. Furthermore, books can be published only with the authoriza-
 tion of theMinistry of Culture and Information. The Presidents son, Uday Hussein,
 also reportedly exercises control over journalists. He sometimes uses a newspaper
 under his personal control, Babel, to threaten members of a particular tribe or clan
 believed to be insufficiently supportive of the regime. In a more direct example of
 control, the Special Rapporteur reported that Uday Hussein and his cohorts pelted
 two elderly, well-respected journalists with tomatoes at a conference as punishment
 for not being sufficiently supportive of the regime. The Government also jams for-
 eign news broadcasts (see Section 1.f.).
 Several statutes and decrees suppress freedom of speech and the press. These in-
 clude a 1986 decree stipulating the death penalty for anyone insulting the President
 
 
 1273
 or other high government officials; Section 214 of the Penal Code, which prohibits
 singing a sng likely to cause civil strife; and the Press Act of 1968, which prohibits
 the writing of articles on 12 specific subjects, including those detrimental to the
 President.
 Foreigners are also subject to restrictions on freedom of the press. The Govern-
 ment refused to admit a returning Danish member of the U.N. Guard Contingent
 in Iraq, which protects international humanitarian workers throughout the country,
 for carrying a foreign newspaper with unfavorable coverage of Saddam Hussein.
 In northern Iraq, several newspapers have appeared over the past 5 years, as
 have opposition radio and television broadcasts. The absence of central authority
 permits some freedom of expression, although most journalists are influenced or
 controlled by various political organizations.
 The Government has no respect for academic freedom, exercising strict control
 over academic publications. University staff is hired or fired depending on their sup-
 port for the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens may not peacefully as-
 semble or organize for any political purpose other than to express support for the
 regime. The Government regularly orchestrates crowds to demonstrate support for
 the regime and its policies through financial incentives for those who participate
 and threats of violence against those who do not.
 Unconfirmed reports continued to circulate of small demonstrations and even con-
 frontations between farm workers and the security forces. The Special Rapporteur
 and other observers expressed doubts that the Government would allow such reports
 to be confirmed by monitors, whose mandate under Resolution 986 could cover such
 activities insofar as they are related to the distribution of relief.
 The Government controls the establishment of political parties, regulates their in-
 ternal affairs, and monitors their activities. Several parties are specifically out-
 lawed, and membership in them is a capital offense. A 1974 law prescribes the
 death penalty for anyone "infiltrating" the Ba'ath Party.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government severely limits freedom of religion. The
 Provisional Constitution of 1968 states that "Islam is the religion of the State." The
 Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs monitors places of worship, appoints
 the clergy, and approves the publication of religious literature.
 Although Shi'a Muslim Arabs, who compose between 60 and 65 percent of the
 population, are the largest religious group, Sunni Arabs (composing only about 12
 to 15 percent of the population) have traditionally dominated economic and political
 life. Despite legal, guarantees of sectarian equality, the regime has in recent years
 repressed the Sia clery and followers of the Shi a faith. Security forces have dese-
 crated Shi'a mosques and holy sites, particularly in the aftermath of the 1991 civil
 uprisings.
 The security forces reportedly were still encamped in the shrine to Imam All at
 AI-Najaf, one of Shi'a Islam's holiest sites, using it as an interrogation center. The
 former Shi'a theological school in Al-Najaf, which the Government closed following
 the 1991 uprising, continues to be used as a public market. Security forces contin-
 ued to expel foreign Muslim clerics from Al-Najaf, under the pretext that the clerics'
 visas had expired.
 The following government restrictions on religious rights remained iii effect
 throughout 1996: a ban on the Muslim call to prayer in certain cities; a ban on the
 broadcast of Shi'a programs on government radio or television; a ban on the publica-
 tion of Si'a books, including prayer books; a ban on funeral processions; and the
 prohibition of certain processions and public meetings commemorating Shi'a holy
 days. Moreover, the Government also continued to insist that its own appointee re-
 place the late Grand Ayatollah Ahul Qasim A-Khoei, formerly the highest ranking
 Iraqi Shi'a clergyman, who died in government custody in 1992 (see Section 1.b.).
 The Shi'a religiou s establishment refuses to accept the Government's choice. The
 Government also continued to harass and threaten members of the late Ayatollah
 A1-Khoei's family (see Section l.a. and 1.h.).
 The Special Rapportur and others report that the Government has engaged in
 various abuses against the country's 350,000 Assyrian Christians. Most Assyrians
 traditionally live in the northern governorates, and the Government often has sus-
 pected them of "collaborating" with Kurds. Military forces destroyed numerous As-
 syrian churches during the Anfal Campaign and reportedly tortured and executed
 many Assyrians (see Section 4). According to HRW and Assyrian sources, the Gov-
 ernment continues to harass and kill Assyrians throughout the country by forced
 relocations, terror, and artillery shelling.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigrat ion, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government controls the movement within the country of citizens
 and foreigners. Persons who enter sensitive border areas and numerous designated
 
 
 1274
 security zones are subject to arrest (see Section 1.d.). Police checkpoints are common
 on major roads and highways. High-ranking officials and other key supporters of the
 regime were exempt from these restrictions, but some reports indicate that the Gov-
 ernment removed most of these exceptions and tightened internal and border travel
 controls at times of relative instability, such as reported internal disturbances in
 Mgy and July.
 he Government requires citizens to obtain expensive exit visas for foreign travel.
 Citizens may not make more than two trips abroad annually. Exit from the country
 requires possession of specific government authorization, and the Government re-
 portedly prohibits some citizens from all international travel. Before traveling
 abroad, citizens are required to post collateral with the Government which is re-
 fundable only upon their return. There are restrictions on the amount of currency
 that may be taken out of the country. Women are not permitted to travel outside
 Iraq alone; male relatives must escort them.
 The Government prohibits the granting of approval for foreign travel to *ournal-
 ists, authors, and allthe employees of the Information Ministry. Security authorities
 interrogate all media employees, journalists, and writers who have traveled outside
 Iraq about the reasons for their travel and who they met during their trips. Some
 citizens without personal documents have turned themselves over to Jordanian bor-
 der posts to avoid paying the departure tax levied on citizens who wish to travel
 abroad. Most citizens are unable to pay this tax. In addition, the Jordanian Govern-
 ment has asked the Iraqi regime to prevent Iraqi border guards from shooting at
 Iraqi soldiers who try to flee to Jordan. Iraqi border guards tire at fleeing soldiers
 even after they crss into Jordanian territory.
 Students abrad who refuse to return to Iraq are required to reimburse any of
 their expenses that were paid by the Government. Each student wishing to travel
 abroad Must provide a guarantor. The guarantor and the student's parents may be
 liable if the student fails to return.
 Foreign spouses of citizens who have resided in Iraq for 5 years are required to
 apply for nationality. The requirement is 1 year of residene or the spouses of citi-
 zens employed in government offices. Many foreigners thus have been obliged to ac-
 cept citizenship and are subject to official travel restrictions. The penalties for non-
 compliance inciude, but are not limited to, loss of the spouse's job, a substantial fi-
 nancial penalty, and repayment for any governmental educational expenses.
 The Goverment prevents many citizens who also hold citizensp in another
 country-especially the children of Iraqi fathers and foreign-born mothers-frm
 visiting the country of their other nationality.
 The Government does notprovid first asylum or respect the rights of refugees.
 In northern Iraq, the UnitdNations High Commissioner for Rgees (UNHCR)
 worked with the sP and the PUK on the return of Iraqis who fled into Iran during
 the September clashes, and along with the Government of Turkey, on the disposi-
 tion of the Atrush camp.
 The Government continued to pursue its discriminatory resettlement policies, in-
 cluding demolition of villages and forced relocation of Kurds, Turkomen, Assyrians,
 and other minorities. Human rights monitors reported that the Government contin-
 ues to force Kurdish and Turkomen residents ofMosul and Kirkuk to move to other
 areas in the north or the south.
 Tens of thousands of refugees fled to Iran from northern Iraq after the Iraqi at-
 tack on Irbil and other attacks in early September. Hundreds of thousands of others
 temporarily fled their residences in these areas, although they did not leave Iraq
 itself. By December, most of these refugees and displaced persons had returned to
 their residences.
 According to the Special Rapporteur, security forces continue to relocate Shi'a in-
 habitants of the southern marshes to major southern cities. Many have been trans-
 ferred to detention centers and prisons in central Iraq, primarily in Baghdad, or
 even to northern cities like Kirkuk, as part of the Government's attempt to "Arab-
 ize" traditionally non-Arab areas.
 According to the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR), hundreds of
 thousands of Iraqi refugees remain abroad-mainly in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
 Syria, Turkey, Pakistan and Jordan. Apart from those suspected of sympathizing
 with Iran, most fled after the Government's suppression of the civil uprising of
 1991; others are Kurds who fled the Anfal Campaign of 1988.
 Of the 1.5 million refugees who fled following the 1991 uprisings, the great major-
 ity, particularly Kurds, have repatriated themselves to northern Iraq, in areas
 where the allied coalition has prohibited overflights by Iraqi aircraft. Several hun-
 dred thousand Kurds remain unsettled in northern Iraq because political cir-
 cumstances do not permit them to return to their former homes in government-con-
 trolled territory.
 
 
 1275
 
 Both the KDP and the PUK fulfilled security guarantees and provided assistance
 in evacuating more than 6,000 relief workers and Iraqi oppositionists perceived to
 be affiliated with the United States.
 Approximately 14,000 Turkish Kurds remain in the north who have fled civil
 strife in southeastern Turkey. The UNHCR is treating these displaced persons as
 refugees until it reaches an official determination on their status. In late 1996, the
 UNHCR and the Government of Turkey began implementing a plan to close the
 Atrush refugee camp and conduct voluntary repatriation of the refugees to Turkey.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Although the Govern-
 ment has taken steps to provide an increased appearance of democracy, the political
 process is still controlled by the State. There are strict qualifications for candidates;
 candidates to the National Assembly, by law, must be over 25 years old and "believe
 in God, the principles of the July 17-30 revolution, and Socialism." In the 250-seat
 National Assembly 160 deputies reportedly belong to the Ba'ath Party and 60 are
 independent, Saddam Hussein appointed 30 deputies to represent the northern
 governorates. According to the Special Rapporteur, the Ba'ath Party allegedly in-
 structed a number of its members to run as nominally "independent" candidates.
 Full political participation at the national level is confined to members of the
 Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, estimated at about 8 percent of the population. The po-
 litical system is dominated by the Party, which governs through the Revolutionary
 Command Council, headed by President Saddam Hussein. However, the RCC exer-
 cises both executive and legislative authority. It overshadows the National Assem-
 bly, which is completely subordinate to it and the executive branch.
 The President wields decisive power over all instruments of government. Almost
 all powerful officials are either members of his family or are family allies from his
 hometown of Tikrit.
 Opposition political organizations are illegal and severely suppressed. Member-
 ship in certain political parties is punishable by death (see Section 2.b.). In 1991
 the RCC adopted a law that theoretically authorized the creation of political parties
 other than the Ba'ath; in practice the law is used to prohibit parties that do not
 support Saddam Hussein and the current Government. New parties must be based
 in Baghdad and are prohibited from having any ethnic or religious character.
 The Government does not recognize the various political groupings and parties
 that have been formed by Shi'a Muslims, as well as Kurdish, Assyrian, Turkomen,
 and other Iraqi communities. These political groups continued to attract support
 notwithstanding their illegal status.
 Women and minorities are underrepresented in government and politics. The law
 provides for the election of women and minorities to the National Assembly, but
 they have only token representation.
 In northern Iraq, all central government functions have been performed by local
 administrators mainly Kurds, since the Government withdrew its military forces
 and civilian administrative personnel from the area after the 1991 uprising. A re-
 gional parliament and local government administrators were elected in 1992. These
 were the only free and open elections held in Iraq in recent decades, and those only
 for local officials and institutions. This parliament last met in May 1995. Discus-
 sions among Kurdish and other northern Iraqi political groups continue on the re-
 convening of parliament, but the tensions and maneuverings by both the PUK and
 KDP continue to prevent parliamentary activity.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit the establishment of independent human rights
 organizations. It operates an official human rights group that routinely dehies alle-
 gations of abuses. Citizens have established several human rights groups abroad
 and in northern areas not under government control.
 As in 1995, the Government did not allow the U.N. Special Rapporteur to visit
 Iraq, nor did it respond to his requests for information on several cases. The Gov-
 erment continued to defy various calls from U.N. bodies to allow the Special
 Rapporteur to visit the southern marshes and other regions.
 In 1996 the U.N. Human Rights Committee and the UN. Subcommission on Pre-
 vention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities adopted resolutions condemn-
 ing the Government's human rights violations. For the fourth consecutive year, the
 UNHRC passed a resolution calling on the U.N. Secretary Goneral to send human
 rights monitors to "help in the independent verification of reports on the human
 rights situation in Iraq. The U.N. Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination
 
 
 1276
 and Protection of Minorities adopted a resolution reiterating the UNHRC request
 for the deployment of monitors. The Government has continued to defy these calls
 for the entry of monitors.
 The Special Rapporteur nonetheless was able to gather more evidence, in part due
 to interviews with current and past government officials who shed new light on the
 systemic nature of human rights violations. The Special Rapporteur dispatched
 members of his staff to Jordan and other locations to interview victims of Iraqi
 human rights abuses. The Special Rapporteur repeatedly has asserted the need for
 further resources to carry out his mandate, while recalling that appropriate action
 on major issues like the Anfal Campaign are beyond the scope of his potential re-
 sources (see Section 1.g.).
 The Government continues to fail to accept U.N. Security Council Resolution 688,
 which insists that the Government afford immediate, unrestricted access by human-
 itarian workers to all those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq. Throughout
 1995 the Government threatened, harassed, and assaulted employees of the U.N.
 and nongovernmental organizations working in Iraq (see Sections 1.g. and 2.a.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and legal system provide for some rights for women, chldren,
 and minorities. However, in practice, the Government systematically abuses these
 rights.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women occurs, but little is known about its
 extent. Such abuse is customarily addressed within the tightly knit family structure.
 There is no public discussion of the subject, and the Government issues no statistics.
 Spousal violence constitutes grounds for divorce and criminal charges, but suits
 brought on these charges are believed to be rare. Men who kill female family mem-
 bers for "immoral deeds" may receive immunity from prosecution under a 1990 law
 (see Section 1.c.).
 The Special Rapporteur has noted that there is an unusually high percentage of
 women in the Kurdish areas, purportedly caused by the disappearances of tens of
 thousands of Kurdish men during the Anfal Campaign. The Special Rapporteur has
 reported that the widows, daughters, and mothers of the Anfal. Campaign victims
 are economically dependent on their relatives or villages because they may not in-
 herit the property or assets of their missing family members. Other reports suggest
 that economic destitution has forced many women into prostitution.
 Evidence concerning the Anfal Campaign indicates that the Government killed
 many women and children, including infants, by firing squads and in chemical at.
 tacks. Government forces also raped many women during the Anfal campaign as
 well as during the occupation of Kuwait. Reports indicate that women are raped in
 custody, but the Government takes no action against the abusers (see Section 1.c.).
 The Government claims that it is committed to equality for women, who make up
 about 20 percent of the work force. It has enacted laws to protect women from ex-
 ploitation in the workplace and from sexual harassment; to permit women to join
 the regular army, Popular Army, and police forces; to require education for girls;
 and to equalize women's rights in divorce, land ownership, taxation, suffrage, and
 election to the National Assembly. It is difficult to determine to what extent these
 protections are afforded in practice. Reports indicate, however, that the application
 of these laws has declined as Iraqs political and economic crisis persists. Women
 are not allowed to travel outside Iraq alone (see Section 2.d.).
 Children.-No information is avaiable on whether the Government has enacted
 specific legislation to promote the welfare of children. However, the Special
 Rapporteur and several human rights groups have collected a substantial body of
 evidence pointing to the Government's continuing disregard for the rights and wel-
 fare of children.
 The Government's failure to comply with relevant U.N. Security Council resolu-
 tions has led to a continuation of economic sanctions. As a result, general economic
 and health conditions have deteriorated dramatically. Children have been particu-
 larly susceptible to the decline in the standard of living. Increases in child mortality
 and disease rates have been reported.
 There were continued accounts of aggressive government action against youths.
 In February security forces launched an arrest campaign against youths who fre-
 quented the Al-Tali'ah Youth Center in Baghdad, afar the discovery of leaflets de-
 nouncing the ruling regime. In another report, three Jordanian youths, who were
 on their way to Baghdd aboard a truck laden with sugar, were killed by a gang
 led by an army midlevel officer. The gang reportedly killed the young men, hacked
 their bodies into pieces, and scattered them in the desert.
 
 
 1277
 In late July, opposition sources reported that more than 300 children had died
 while undergoing compulsory training in Fedayeen camps. The Fedayeen system
 was widely reported by opposition and other sources as another systematic regime
 effort to extend and solidify its control through forced indoctrination of Iraqi youth.
 People with Disabilities
 o information is available on the Government's policy towards people with dis-
 abilities.
 National IRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Kurds, who make up approximately 20 per-
 cent of the population, historically have suffered political and economic discrimina-
 tion, despite the token presence of a small number of Kurds in the national Govern-
 ment (see Sections L.a., 1.b., and 1.g.).
 Assyrians and Chaldeans are ethnic groups as well as separate Christian commu-
 nities (see Section 2.c.). Assyrians speak a distict language-Syriac. Public instruc-
 tion in Syriac, which was to have been allowed under a 1972 decree, has never been
 implemented. Numerous reports indicated continued systematic discrimination
 against Assyrians throughout 1996, especially i terms of forced movements from
 northern areas and repression of political rights there.
 Citizens considered to be of Iranian origin must carry special identification and
 are often precluded from desirable employment. Over the years, the Government
 has deported hundreds of thousands of citizens of Iranian origin (see Section 2.d.).
 Religious Minorities.-Iraq's cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity are not re-
 flected in the country's political and economic structure. Various segments of the
 Sunni Arab comnunity, which itself constitutes a small minority of the population,
 have effectively controiled the Government since independence in 1932. Shia Arabs,
 the overwhelming majority of the population, have long been economically, politi-
 cally, and socially disadvantaged. Like the Sunni Kurds and other ethnic and reli-
 gious groups in the north, the Shi'a Arabs of the south have been targeted for par-
 ticular discrimination and abuse, ostensibly because of their opposition to the Gov-
 ernment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although Iraq is a party to the 1919 Constitution
 of the International Labor Organization (ILO), which provides for the freedom of as-
 sociation, trade unions independent of government control do not exist. The Trade
 Union Organization Law of 1987 established the Iraqi General Federation of Trade
 Unions, a government-dominated trade union structure, as the sole legal trade fed-
 eration. The General Federation is linked to the Ba'ath Party, which uses it to pro-
 mote party principles and policies among union members.
 Workers in private and mixed enterprises--but not public employees or workers
 in state enterprises--have the right to join local union committees. The committees
 are affiliated with individual trade unions, which in turn belong to the General Fed-
 eration.
 The Labor Law of 1987 restricts the right to strike. No strike has been reported
 over the past two decades. According to the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions, the severe restrictions on the right to strike include penal sanctions.
 The General Federation is also affiliated with the International Confederation of
 Arab Trade Unions and the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade
 Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively is not recognized. Salaries for public sector workers (the majority of the em-
 ployed) are set by the Government. Wages in the much smaller private sector are
 set by employers or negotiated individually with workers.
 The Labor Code does not protect workers from antiunion discrimination, a failure
 that has been criticized repeatedly by the ILO's Committee of Experts.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is theoretically
 prohibited by law. However, the Penal Code mandates prison sentences, including
 compulsory labor, for civil servants and employees of state enterprises accused of
 breaches of labor "discipline," including resigning from a job. According to the ILO,
 foreign workers in Iraq have been prevented from terminating their employment to
 return to their native countries because of government-imposed penal sanctions on
 persons who do so.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The employment of children under
 the age of 14 is prohibited except in small-scale family enterprises. Children report-
 ediy are increasingly encouraged to work in order to support their families, given
 the country's harsh economic conditions. The law stipulates that employees between
 the ages of 14 and 18 work fewer hours per week than adults.
 
 
 1278
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Theoretically, most workers in urban areas
 work a 6-day, 48-hour workweek. Hours for government employees are set by the
 head of each ministry. In practice, the rate of absenteeism has likely increased with
 the deterioration of socioeconomic conditions. There is contradictory information on
 whether laws and regulations mandate a minimum wage, but the Government
 makes no effort to protect this or other worker entitlements.
 Working hours for agricultural workers vary according to individual employer-em-
 ployee agreements.
 Occupational safety programs are in effect in state-run enterprises. Inspectors
 theoretically inspect private establishments, but enforcement varies widely.
