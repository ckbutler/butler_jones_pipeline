 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy with a popularly elected
 President and a bicameral Congress. In practice, the system heavily favors the exec-
 utive branch, headed by six-term President SJoaquin Balaguer. The Supreme Court
 heads an only nominally independent judiciary whose members are appointed by the
 
 
 420
 
 Senate. Political parties representing the ideological spectrum from left to right free-
 ly participate in elections.
 The National Police (PN), the National Department of Investigations (DNI), the
 National Drug Control Directorate (DNCD), and the military (army, air force, and
 navy) form the security services. The PN has general investigative and principal ar-
 rest authority. The military services have investigative and general arrest authority
 for armed forces personnel and may arrest suspects apprehended by military pa-
 trols. The DNI is the principal national investigative body for national security con-
 cerns and also possesses arrest authority. The DNCD, a narcotics law enforcement
 agency formed in 1988, brings under a single authority elements of the PN and mili-
 tary services. All security services are under control of the Government and are gen-
 erally responsive to civilian authority, but some members of these organizations con-
 tinued to be responsible for human rights abuses.
 Once heavily dependent on sugar, the Dominican economy has grown more di-
 verse; tourism and export processing zones (EPZ's) are now major sources of income
 and employment. The economy showed the benefits of reforms initiated in 1990; in-
 flation was reduced and real economic growth was expected to be from 1.5 to 3 per-
 cent in 1993. State-owned firms such as the State Sugar Council (CEA), the Consor-
 tium of State Enterprises (CORDE), and the Dominican Electricity Corporation
 (CDE) continue to be heavily involved in the economy, and the financial and admin-
 istrative difficulties of these firms still impede economic growth.
 Principal human rights problems included continuing instances of police killings
 of civilians arbitrary detention and beatings of suspects, security services' refusal
 to obey judicial orders, judicial corruption, court backlogs and maladministration,
 and abuses of Haitian migrant workers. The extent of antiunion discrimination in
 the EPZ's gained increased public attention, while the condition of itinerant Haitian
 workers in the sugar industry continued to show improvement from previous years.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHITS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No political killings occurred in
 1993, but there were several instances of extrajudicial killings by the police. Police
 use of excessive force led to at least nine civilian deaths. At least six other civilians
 were killed in personal disputes with low-ranking police personnel, with intoxication
 or romantic interest as the typical causes in these deaths. A police tribunal con-
 victed a former police lieutenant and two former patrolmen on homicide charges and
 sentenced them to 5 years in prison for their role in one of the nine deaths. The
 cases involving the other eight deaths reportedly were pending before civilian courts
 at year's end.
 Among other cases heard by police tribunals in 1993, a DNCD agent received a
 15-year sentence for voluntary manslaughter in a September 1992 shooting, and a
 police corporal received a 15-year sentence (reduced to 5 years on appeal) for fatally
 wounding a fleeing suspect during an April 1992 raid on a gambling ring. Police tri-
 bunals also sentenced two ex-patrolmen to 15 years and 10 years, respectively, in
 prison in connection with two incidents in which they shot and killed other police
 personnel.
 Police personnel discharged for their involvement in deaths in 1993 were report-
 edly awaiting trial in the civilian court system, a process which will likely take
 years. Although a civilian court dismissed charges against an ex-police lieutenant
 involved in killing lawyer Rafael Ortiz during September 1992 antigovernment pro-
 tests, the police have refused to release the ex-lieutenant. Two ex-police majors ac-
 cused of misconduct in the same case remain fugitives; the ex-patrolmen and civil-
 ian informant charged in the actual shooting remain in prison awaiting trial on
 charges of homicide.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known cases of politically motivated disappear-
 ances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other forms of physical abuse are illegal under law. There continued
 to be instances of security service personnel engaging in beatings of detainees, al-
 though some monitors report a decline in incidence of abuse.
 Cases in which police officials received little or no punishmentfor abuse continued
 in 1993. In one instance, a National Policelicutenant colonel accused of running a
 torture ring in police headquarters was relieved of his job in March 1992 but se-
 lected for advanced training before the charges were formally dismissed in January
 1993. The National Police appealed the ruling, and the case remains pending before
 a higher court. In another case, on September 29, a police tribunal sentenced a po-
 lice captain to a 1-month suspension without pay and an ex-police captain to 6
 
 
 months in prison in connection with the torture of a part-time university professor
 in January 1992. In other instances police tribunals convicted for physical abuse an
 ex-patrolman who received a prison sentence of 5 months, a corporal sentenced to
 2 months in prison, a patrolman who was given 5 months, and two patrolmen who
 received 2-month sentences in two separate incidents. Approximately 60 percent of
 cases brought before police tribunals resulted in convictions; the figure in civilian
 courts is significantly lower.
 Prisons are overcrowded, and health and sanitary conditions are substandard.
 Some prison personnel reportedly engage in extortion and other corrupt activities,
 and most prisoners find it necessary to rely on relatives or their own finances in
 order to be fed adequately. Medical care suffers from a lack of supplies. In some
 instances, minors have been incarcerated in adult prisons (see Section 5).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that suspects
 may be detained for a maximum of 48 hours for investigation before arraignment,
 after which they must be charged or released. However, in special circumstances,
 suspects may be detained for longer periods with the approval of the prosecutor's
 office. Security services officials continued routinely to violate constitutional provi-
 sions by detaining suspects for "investigation" or "interrogation" beyond the pre-
 scribed 48-hour limit. Law enforcement authorities traditionally detain all suspects
 and witnesses to a crime, and use the investigative process to determine who are
 innocent and merit release and who should continue to be held.
 Military officers occasionally violated legal provisions against military detention
 of civilians. Despite announcements to the contrary, the DNCD and National Police
 continued to engage in indiscriminate roundups of people in poorer neighborhoods.
 In 1993 these roundups were increasingly targeted at drug trafficking, and most de-
 tainees were released after several hours in custody. The security services also con-
 tinued occasionally to detain relatives of suspected criminals with the aim of forcing
 the surrender of suspects; most of these cases occurred when relatives were present
 at the scene of a search that uncovered narcotics.
 The National Police and the DNCD persisted in their refusals to release some
 prisoners and detainees who had be~n granted judicial release orders. Law enforce-
 ment and other governmental authorities cited judicial corruption as the justifica-
 tion for this noncompliance. In some of these cases involving narcotics or terrorist-
 related crimes, it appeared that evidence merited pursuing the cases in the judicial
 system. In other cases, prosecutors unsuccessfully appealed the judicial decisions to
 the Supreme Court so there was no further recourse available to block the release
 orders. The 54 prisoners in such circumstances include Luis Lizardo Cabrera, the
 subject of three separate judicial release orders since his detention as a suspect in
 the 1989 bombing of a U.S.-Dominican Binational Center which killed a 1-year-old
 girl.
 No exile of citizens took place in 1993.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-Although the Constitution stipulates an independ-
 ent judiciary, in practice interference occurs from other public and private entitites,
 including the executive branch. The court system includes a Supreme Court, an ap-
 pellate court, and courts of the first instance. The Senate appoints judges at all lev-
 els. Their terms of office correspond roughly to those of the President and other
 elected officials. A newly elected Senate can either replace the judges or reconfirm
 them, and may removeor transfer them by a majority vote. Critics credibly charge
 that senators customarily nominate judges on political grounds rather than for their
 competence as jurists. These same critics also fault some prosecutors and judges for
 corruption, incompetence, and a lack of effort. Administrative supervision of judges
 and prosecutors by the authorities in charge of these bodiesis poor to nonexistent.
 The Constitution provides for publi trial, and court-appointed lawyers normally
 are provided at public expense to indigents in felony criminal cases, but rarely in
 criminal misdemeanor cases. The judicial process is plagued by chronic delays; of
 the penal system's approximately 11,000 detainees, ony about 10 percent have been
 convicted. Although the right tojudicial determination of the legality of detention
 exists, p retrial detention is legal and commonly employed. This custom, coupled
 with a lack of administrative and financial support for the system, creates a major
 backlog of cases, which in turn causes suspects to suffer long periods of pretrial de-
 tention that sometimes exceed possible criminal penalties.
 Though the judicial system has prvisions for a suspect's release on bail while
 awaiting trial, in practice, release on bail usually signifies dismissal of a case as
 the judiciary rarely, if ever, continues proceedings in such instances.
 There are no special courts for political or national security cases, and civilians
 may not be tried by a military court. Members of the armed forces and police are
 under the jurisdiction of military or police courts but are frequently remanded to
 the civilian court system after review by a military or police board.
 
 
 The Dominican Republic has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no credible reports of arbitrary governmental interference with the private
 lives of persons or families. Constitutional safeguards against invasion of the home
 are generally observed. A residence may not be searched except in the presence of
 a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, except in cases of "hot pursuit" or instances
 where there is probable cause to believe that a crime is in progress.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these liberties and they
 are respected in practice. Dominicans of all political persuasions exercise freedom
 of speech. The numerous privately owned radio and television stations broadcast all
 political points of view.
 The Government controls one television station but no major newspapers. News-
 papers freely reflect independent and opposition points of view. Although journalists
 operate in a relatively tolerant environment, a certain amount of self-censorship ex-
 ists for fear of offending prominent persons. In April the Government refused to be-
 stow the "best novel of the year" award on the work chosen by an indepndent selec-
 tion committee; this refusalstemmed from the perception that the boo was an alle-
 gorical parody of the President. Economic considerations also inhibit free expression,
 as all the principal media outlets are owned by powerful economic consortiums or
 wealthy, influential families. In addition, some journalists solicit, or are responsive
 to, bribes in order to generate reports.
 Public and private universities enjoy broad academic freedom. The main public
 university, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, with approximately
 35,000 students, has no restrictionson enrollment and maintains a policy of non-
 intervention (other than curriculum development) in classroom affairs. The Govern-
 ment exerts no control over private universities except for the preservation of stand-
 ards, and teachers are free to espouse their own theories without government over-
 sight.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution grants these
 freedoms, which are commonly respected in practice. Outdoor public marches and
 meetings require government permits, which are usually granted. Professional orga-
 nizations of lawyers, doctors, teachers, and others function freely and can maintain
 relations with counterpart international bodies of diverse political philosophies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination on religious
 grunds and the Government has not interfered with the free practice of religion.
 there exist no religious requirements to hold public office, no restrictions on the
 practice of religious faiths, and no social discrimination based on religion. The Do-
 minican population is predominantly Roman Catholic; several non-Catholic faiths
 have well established churches in the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Dominican citizens face no unusual legal restrictions on travel within
 or outside the country. During a week-long period in October, the Government or-
 dered Dominican military personnel to repatriate undocumented Haitian nationals.
 The forced repatriations occurred in various regions of the country; human rights
 grups estimated that between several hundred and a few thousand Haitians were
 orcibly repatriated to Haiti. Local authorities in border regions have also under-
 taken on their own recognizance to repatriate small numbers of illegal Haitians, but
 these instances are difficult to document. Charges of forced recruitment and deten-
 tion of Haitians to work on sugar plantations diminished in comparison with earlier
 years (see Section 6,c.).
 Since the 1991 coup in Haiti, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) accorded refugee status to 1,341 Haitians who fled to the Dominican Re-
 public. Although the Government began processing petitions for Dominican recogni-
 tion of the refugee status of the UNHCR wards in 1991, only 107 Haitians have
 been granted such status. Contingency planning for refugees has not developed very
 far since then.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Righis: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy. The President, all 150
 members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, and the mayors and city council-
 men of over 100 municipalities are freely elected every 4 years by secret ballot and
 universal suffrage (except for active duty military and police, who may not vote).
 The President appoints the governors of the 29 provinces. The nation enjoys a func-
 tioning multiparty system. Opposition groups of the left, right, and center operate
 openly.
 
 
 423
 In practice, the President dominates public policy formulation and implementa-
 tion, exercising his authority through use of the veto, discretion to act by decree,
 and influence as the leader of his party. The Congress traditionally has had limited
 powers and seldom disapproves actions by the executive branch, but it provides an
 open forum for the free exchange of views and debate. The governing party holds
 a majority in the Senate (16 o 30 seats) and has a plurality (42 of 120 seats) in
 the Chamber of Deputies.
 Women and minorities confront no legal or practical impediments to political par-
 ticipation. Eight of the country's 29 governors, 4 Cabinet-level executive branch offi-
 cials, and 14 of the 120 Congressional Deputies are female.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental human rights organizations operate freely without government
 interference. In addition to the Dominican Human Rights Committee, several other
 Haitian, church, and labor  oups exist. The Dominican Republic has been slow to
 acknowledge renuests for in formation and criticism from some international human
 rights organizations. The Government took note of criticism by the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission (UNHRC) at its March 1993 session but did not address the is-
 sues or take any action on them. There were no instances of killings, beatings, or
 harassment of human rights monitors in 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Discrimination based on race and sex is prohibited by law. However,
 women traditionally have not shared equal social and economic status or oppor-
 tunity with men, and men hold the overwhelming majority of leadership positions
 in all sectors. In many instances, women are paid less than men in jobs of equal
 content and equal skill level. According to one study, women are the head of the
 household in 37 percent of the families in the capital city of Santo Domingo. Divorce
 is easily obtainable by either spouse, and women can hold property in their own
 names apart from their husbands. Legislative proposals to modify women's status
 under the Civil and Penal Code remained stalled in the Congress at year's end.
 A study by one women's group reported 280 cases of violence against women from
 November 1990 to November 1992, based upon media reports and national police
 statistics. Of these, 64 percent were homicides, indicating that physical abuse cases
 were greatly underreported. No systematic studies exist on the extent of sexual har-
 assment, an issue especially relevant to the export processing zones (EPZ's), which
 have a predominantly female work force. An undetermined number of Dominican
 women are victims of rings which smuggle Third World women to Europe to work
 as prostitutes in conditions rife with exploitation and mistreatment. The Govern-
 ment periodically prosecutes organized alien smuggling rings (commonly on docu-
 ment falsification charges), but enforcement is hindered by corruption and reluc-
 tance to restrict the emigration of Dominicans.
 Children.-The Government's professed commitment to child welfare has not been
 supported by financial and intellectual resources. Despite the existence of govern-
 ment institutions dedicated to child welfare, the principal burden is carried by pri-
 vate social and religious organizations. The most serious abuse involving children
 is the failure of the justice system to respect the status of minors in criminal cases.
 Especially in narcotics cases, minors are sometimes treated as adults and incarcer-
 ated in prisons rather than juvenile detention centers. In 1993 the media widely
 publicized several sexual abuse cases involving minors; however, the lack of statis-
 tics makes it difficult to determine if such crimes are increasing. According to local
 monitors, the incidence of child abuse is underreported owing to continuing societal
 reluctance to overcome traditional beliefs that family problems should be dealt with
 inside the family. In 1993 sporadic instances of Haitian child labor on sugar planta-
 tions continued to occur (see Section 6.d.). A new Minor's Code was approved by the
 lower chamber of the Congress but stalled and was not passed by the Senate.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Dominicans are strongly prejudiced against
 Haitians, many of whom are illegal immigrants and who constitute a significant
 percentage of the unskilled manual labor force. This often translates into discrimi-
 nation against those with darker skin. The Government has not acknowledged the
 existence of this discrimination nor made any efforts to combat it.
 Credible sources charge that a long-standing government practice is to obstruct
 the recognition of Haitians born in the Dominican Republic as Dominican citizens.
 Lack of documentation also sometimes hinders the ability of children of Haitian de-
 scent to attend school; some parents fail to seek documentation for fear of them-
 selves being deported.
 
 
 People with Disabilities.-Disabled persons encounter discrimination in employ-
 ment and the provision of other services. Law No. 21-91, which took effect in Sep-
 tember 1991, mandates certain provisions for physical access for the disabled for all
 new public and private buildings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the freedom to orga-
 nize labor unions and also for the rights of workers to strike and (and for private
 sector employers to lock out workers). All workers, except military and police, are
 free to organize and workers in all sectors exercise this right. The new Labor Code
 enacted in 1992 significantly strengthened the right of freedom of association and
 removed some restrictions on the right to strike by narrowing the definition of es-
 sential services to exclude transportation, food services, and fuel services. Require-
 ments for calling for a strike include an absolute majority of the workers in the unit,
 a prior attempt to resolve the conflict through arbitration, written notification to the
 Labor Secretariat, and a 10-day waiting period following notification before proceed-
 ing with the strike. The Code also eliminated previous prohibitions against political
 and sympathy strikes. The Government respects association rights and places no ob-
 stacles to union registration, affiliations, or the ability to engage in legal strikes.
 Strikes in 1993 occurred principally in the public sector, where doctors and nurses
 cointinued to stage periodic strikes and walkouts, and employees of state-owned com-
 panies staged strikes in response to financial difficulties and threats of job losses.
 One work stoppage was declared illegal in 1993.
 m plementing regulations for the 1992 Labor Code were issued in November 1993.
 The Labor Code specifies in detail the steps legally required to establish a union,
 federation, and confederation. The Code calls for automatic recognition of a union
 if the Government has not acted on its application within a specific time. Inprac-
 tice, the Government has readily facilitated recognition of labor organizations. Orga-
 nized labor represents between 10 and 15 percent of the work force and is divided
 among three large confederations, three minor confederations and a number of
 independent unions. The International Labor Organization's (IL6) Committee of Ex-
 perts (COE) observed in 1993 that the two-thirds majority vote required to form con-
 rederations was too high.
 Unions are independent of the Government and political parties, although sym-
 pathizers of various political parties are found in most union organizations. Labor
 unions can and do freely affiliate regionally and internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is law-
 ful and may take place in firms in which a union has gained the support of an abso-
 lute majority of the workers. Only a minority of companies have collective bargain-
 ing pacts. The Labor Code expressly stipulates that workers cannot be dismissed be-
 cause of their trade union membership or activities. The previous Code allowed arbi-
 trary termination of a worker so long as severance pay was provided; the 1992 Code
 exempts from dismissal specific numbers of union organizers and officials. The num-
 ber or union organizers or officials given protection from layoffs can total up to 20
 members of a union in formation, between 5 to 10 members of a union executive
 council (depending on the size of the work force), and up to 3 members of a collective
 bargaining negotiating committee. The new Code established a new system of labor
 courts for dealing with labor disputes; but their effectiveness has yet to be deter-
 mined.
 There are 26 established expert processing zones (EPZ's) with over 400, mostly
 U.S.-owned or associated, companies and about 150,000 employees, mostly women
 workers. The Labor Code applies in these zones. Some EPZ companies have a his-
 tory of discharging workers who attempt to organize unions. Although the Govern-
 ment registered more than 50 unions in the EPZ's since the new Labor Code went
 into effect in June 1992, fewer than 5 of these unions still have their membership
 intact. Of these, none was apparently able to function freely in the workplace. The
 other unions apparently ceased to function due to firings of union members, al-
 though some may have dissolved because of voluntary resignations or company clo-
 sure. More than 20 EPZ firms face criminal charges brought by the Secretariat of
 Labor for Labor Code violations involving worker rights. By year's end, two firms
 had been convicted of such violations. No EPZ company has concluded a collective
 bargaining agreement with a union.
 In June the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations
 filed a petition accusing the Government of failing to ensure EPZ companies' compli-
 ance with Labor Code provisions concerning freedom of association and the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. The petition charged that EPZ companies contin-
 ued to fire workers for attempting to organize unions and castigated the Dominican
 justice system for failing to issue timely decisions in cases brought before the courts.
 
 
 A collateral charge was that a provision in Article 75 of the Labor Code enabled de
 facto blacklisting of trade union members. One such case brought under the old
 Labor Code in 1992 is under appeal by the Secretary of Labor flollowing a judicial
 ruling in favor of the employer.
 The State Sugar Council (CEA) employs workers from over 100 unions. Dominican
 workers predominate in the unions, although between two and five unions are Hai-
 tian-dominated. There have been some reports that the CEA has interfered with
 other efforts by Haitians to organize.
 At year's end, no agreement had been reached in a 1990 dispute in which the ad-
 ministrator of the state-owned Dominican Electric Corporation (CDE) charged the
 CDE union (Sitracode) with sabotage, featherbedding, and corruption, and began
 massive firings of Sitracode leaders and activists which generated a complaint
 against the Dominican Republic in the ILO. In December 1991, the Government
 agreed to a settlement calling for pensioning 75 percent of the fired workers and
 rehiring the remainder. However, the Government refused to rehire Sitracode lead-
 ers, which the union thought had been part of the agreement. The case remained
 before the ILO, which requested that the trade union leaders be reinstated.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsr labor is pro-
 hibited by law. During previous years, the Government and the CEA forcibly re-
 cruited Haitian seasonal agiltural workers and then restricted them to work on
 specific sugar plantations. CEA denied the use of paid recruiters inside Haiti to ob-
 tain workers, and there is no conclusive evidence that either practice occurred to
 any significant degree in 1993. However, Haitian workers continued to face other
 problems (see below). Human rights groups alleged same instances of forced recruit-
 ment and forced labor of Haitians in the harvesting of other crops such as coffee
 and ric. The extent of such abuses remained unclear, as these agricultural sectors
 were not traditionally subject to the scrutiny received by the sugar industry.
 In 1993 itinerant Haitian sugar cane workers continued to encounter restrictions
 on their freedom of movement, but the restrictions were less onerous than in the
 past. They included the presence of armed guards in and around various sugar plan-
 tations and the sequestering of workers' belongings in order to discourage their
 movement to other CEA plantations or other types of employment. To alleviate free-
 dom of movement problems faced by itinerant Haitian workers, CEA and the Do-
 minican Office of Immigration in late 1991 initiated a program to issue 1-year tem-
 porary work permits to the workers. The Office of Immigration reported that 32,357
 temporary work permits had been issued under this program. Over half of the re-
 cipients were employed in private cane plantations or noncane cutting activities;
 12,717 permits were issued to Haitians employed on CEA plantations. There are no
 firm statistics on the number of cane cutters on CEA plantations; estimates range
 from 15,000 to 30,000. According to an August 1993 survey by an independent poll-
 ing firm, 50 percent of all itinerant Haitian workers possessed permits. There are
 no figures available on the number of forcibly repatriated Haitian cane and coffee
 workers.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code prohibits employ-
 ment of youth under 14 years of age and places various restrictions on the employ-
 ment of youth under age 16. These restrictions include a limitation of no more than
 6 hours of daily work, no employment in dangerous occupations or jobs involving
 the prvision of intoxicating beverages, and limitations on nighttime work.
 In practice, many of the child labor restrictions are ignored. The high level of un-
 employment and the lack of a social safety net create pressures on families to allow
 children to earn supplemental income. A United Nations Children's Fund study esti-
 mated that approximately 58,000 minors work as itinerant vendors in occupations
 such as shining shoes, selling newspapers, and cleaning cars. During the past few
 years, the Labor Secretariat made some effort to enforce the law in cases where
 companies employed underage workers, but penalties were largely limited to small
 fines. Some young workers obtained work permits and continued their employment;
 those unable to obtain permits were dismissed.
 Instances of child la r in CEA sugar plantations have diminished greatly. Past
 abuses reportedly included the use of unaccompanied minors recruited from inside
 Haiti without parental knowledge. CEA and the Labor Secretariat took steps to dis-
 courage child labor, and in 1993 it occurred in only isolated instances, most involv-
 ing children accompanying their fathers into the fields.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution gives the Government legal
 authority to set minimum wage levels and the Labor C ode assigns this task to a
 national salary committee. Congress may also enact minimum wage legislation. Real
 wages, especially in the public sector, still suffered from a serious erosion caused
 by an unprecedented 1990 inflation rate of 101 percent. Minimum wage raises since
 1990 have not compensated for the loss of purchasing power, and no wage increases
 
 
 426
 took place in 1993. The vast majority of workers receive only the minimum wage,
 which is about $61 (780 pesos) per month. This represents only 20 percent of the
 estimated monthly cost of living for an average-size family in Santo Domingo. As
 a result, many people hold more than one job.
 The Labor Code establishes a standard work period of 8 hours per day and 44
 hours per week. The Code also stipulates that all workers are entitled to 36 hours
 of uninterrupted rest each week. In practice, a typical workweek is Monday through
 Friday plus a half day on Saturday, but longer hours are not unusual. The Code
 grants workers a 35 percent wage differentia for work over 44 and up to 68 hours
 per week and a 100 percent differential for any hours above 68 per week.
 Workplace safety and health conditions frequently do not meet legal standards.
 Health standards for workers are set by the Dominican Social Security Institute
 (IDSS). Nonhealth safety standards are covered by the Labor Code. The existing so-
 cial security system does not apply to all workers and is underfunded. Furthermore,
 some employers charge workers for social security coverage but fail to pass the pay-
 ments on to the IDSS. As a result, benefits are low, payments often delayed, and
 medical care is limited and available only in the major cities.
 Workplace regulations and their enforcement in the EPZ's do not differ from those
 in the country at large, although working conditions are typically better. Some com-
 panies in privately owned EPZ's practice much higher worker safety and health
 standards. Both the IDSS and the Labor Secretariat have small corps of inspectors
 charged with enforcing standards. However, these posts are customarily filled
 through political patronage, and some inspectors have earned a reputation for cor-
 ru tion.
 Conditions for agricultural workers, particularly Haitians, are in general much
 worse, especially in the sugar industry. Although CEA readily cooperates with non-
 governmental organizations active in efforts to improve the conditions of sugar cane
 workers, in some cases CEA and the Government have failed to take measures to
 implement written agreements designed to overcome the problems facing sugar cane
 workers. Cane cutters on CEA plantations are paid by weight of cut cane rather
 than hours worked and thus are usually required to work significantly more hours
 than the standard workweek in order to earn a wage approaching that of workers
 in other industries. CEA continued to pay cane cutters in vouchers rather than cash,
 a violation of the 1992 Labor Code's prohibition of payment in noncash forms. Cane
 cutters also faced widespread cheating during the weighing of their cut cane. Al-
 though CEA and the Lar Secretariat signed an agreement with labor unions to
 allow union officials to assist the Labor Secretariat in the inspection and monitoring
 of CEA weigh stations, no action was taken to implement this agreement. Many
 Haitian worker villages continued to suffer high rates of disease and a lack of
 schooling, medical facilities, running water, and sewage systems.
