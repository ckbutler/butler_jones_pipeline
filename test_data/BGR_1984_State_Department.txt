 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional
 monarch. Its Council of Ministers (Cabinet), responsible for
 governmental decisions, is led by the Prime Minister and holds
 office as long as it retains the confidence of the
 Parliament. Direct popular elections for the Houses of
 Parliament (excluding 76 of the 182 Senate seats apportioned
 by other means) are held at least every 4 years under a system
 of universal suffrage, obligatory voting, and proportional
 representation.
 Respect for human rights in Belgium is guaranteed in the
 Constitution and laws and is observed in practice. Belgium is
 also actively involved in the pursuit of human rights
 internationally.
 The Belgian economy is beginning a slow recovery from the
 severe recession which followed the second oil price shock and
 the industrial downturn of the early 1980's. High wages and
 costs had made Belgian industry uncompetitive, contributing to
 steeply rising unemployment and large current account and
 budget deficits. A special economic recovery program,
 inaugurated in early 1982 with an 8.5 percent devaluation and
 a plan to lower real wages, has restored the competitive
 position of Belgian industry and made appreciable progress
 toward current account equilibrium. However, because
 significant growth has not returned to the economy, the budget
 deficit is about 11 percent of the gross national product
 (GNP), and unemployment is at least 15 percent.
 Belgium has three linguistic groupings: The Dutch speakers of
 Flanders (57 percent of the population), the French speakers
 of Walloonia (about 42 percent of the population), and a small
 number of German speakers along the southeast border area.
 The politically significant division of Belgium between
 Dutch- and French-speaking regions poses significant problems
 for the Belgian state. All major institutions, including
 political parties, are divided into Dutch- and French-speaking
 sections. (There are special provisions for Dutch-, French-,
 and German-speaking community councils at the national
 level.) Regional and linguistic needs are taken into account
 in national decisions. Linguistic disputes are a perennial
 problem which can immobilize the political process and from
 time to time cause minor, temporary civil disorder. A
 committee established in 1983 to study all outstanding
 linguistic issues will issue its report in 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither the Belgian authorities nor officially sanctioned
 groups engage in killings for political motives. Terrorism
 remained at a low level most of the year, but several
 terrorist acts in the last quarter of the year were directed
 at multinational defense contractors and Belgian government
 offices. The perpetrators are unknown.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, or clandestine detentions by
 
 
 922
 BELGIUM
 government or opposition groups are proscribed by Belgian law
 and unknown in practice.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. The Belgian Penal Code prohibits the deliberate
 mistreatment or injury of anyone, and is applicable to the
 actions of officials and private individuals. There are no
 differences in the conditions of confinement based on race,
 sex, religion, or social class.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. Arrested persons must be
 brought before a judge within 24 hours or released. Belgian
 law provides for pretrial confinement only under special
 circumstances: when a person is apprehended in the commission
 of a criminal act; when there is a risk that the suspect will
 prove a danger to the community; when there is a risk that he
 will flee the jurisdiction and when the case involves one of
 a number of serious offenses specified by law. The
 justification for such confinement is subject to periodic
 review by a panel of judges. Exile of Belgian citizens is not
 permitted by law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair, public trial, including the right to
 counsel, is guaranteed by law and observed in practice. A
 suspeot is charged, if the evidence so warrants, when the
 preliminary judicial investigatory phase is completed.
 Charges are clearly and formally stated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy by the state
 is guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Participation
 in the political process and enjoyment of civil and personal
 liberties in Belgium are not inhibited by law or by actions of
 security forces for any section of the population. The
 inviolability of the home is specifically guaranteed by the
 Belgian Constitution, with exceptions expressly laid down and
 regulated by law. The law forbids searches of private homes
 at night, except in special circumstances; warrants issued by
 a judge are required unless the inhabitants of the domicile
 agree to the search. The penal code provides penalties for
 all violations of the home by officials as well as by private
 persons. Monitoring of telephones and interference with mail
 are also strictly prohibited.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Varying political, religious, philosophical, and
 artistic views are permitted free public expression, and there
 is no political censorship of the media. There are, however,
 prohibitions on publications and productions held to undermine
 
 
 923
 BELGIUM
 .public order" (e.g., extreme pornography and incitement to
 violence). There are laws against libel, provisions for a
 citizen's right of reply to media criticism, and restrictions
 on criticism of government policies by civil servants.
 Belgium has a state-owned radio and television network, but
 programs are supervised by boards of directors which represent
 the main currents of opinion. The Government has a
 representative on the boards, but no veto power. "Free* (not
 state-owned) radio stations operate openly.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Subject to regulations to preserve public order, political,
 civic, religious, artistic, social, and special interest
 groups are permitted to engage in free public assembly. The
 right to organize, strike, and bargain collectively is
 recognized and exercised freely. Government austerity
 measures sometimes limit or alter the results of collective
 bargaining. This was the basis of a 1983 complaint to the
 International Labor Organization by one of Belgium's two major
 labor federations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Belgium has a long tradition of religious tolerance. Belgian
 law accords the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religions
 "recognized" status for which a government subsidy is
 accorded. Minority, *non-recognized' religions enjoy full
 freedom to practice and are not subject to harassment or
 persecution.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Belgian citizens enjoy freedom of travel within the
 country and internationally, including the right of voluntary
 repatriation. Within a system of immigration and labor
 regulations, Belgium previously admitted a large number of
 foreign immigrants. The granting of resident status to
 non-European Community nationals has become more restrictive
 since December 1980. Belgium grants the right of political
 asylum to those foreign nationals applying in Belgium who are
 recommended by the local office of the U.N. High Commission
 for Refugees (UNHRC) as eligible for asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Participation in the political system is open to all citizens.
 Suffrage is universal for all adults (18 and over), secret,
 and compulsory. Unweighted voting (one person/one vote) has
 been in effect since 1919, and women's suffrage since 1948.
 There are 13 parties currently represented in the Belgian
 Parliament. Opposition parties are free, under law and in
 practice, to operate without constraints or repression.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Belgian Government actively promotes independent
 investigation of alleged human rights violations, such as
 sponsoring resolutions in the UNHCR on Iranian treatment of
 
 
 924
 BELGIUM
 Bahais. No requests have been made for outside investigation
 of the human rights situation in Belgium. Freedom House rates
 Belgium "free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 According to the World Bank, Belgium's per capita GNP was
 about $10,760 in 1982. Social programs insure adequate living
 standards to all the population. Excellent medical care is
 available at reasonable cost. Belgium's population enjoys a
 life expectancy at birth of 73.8 years. The infant mortality
 rate is 11.6 per 1,000 live births.
 The adverse effects of a general downturn in the world
 economy, combined with structural problems in the national
 economy, led to a high unemployment rate. Governmental
 policies to promote employment and an extensive system of
 unemployment compensation and other social benefits have
 served to minimize serious individual financial hardship.
 A common educational system serves all economic levels.
 School attendance is mandatory until age 18 for both sexes,
 and the population is almost totally literate. To deal with
 the longstanding ethnic rivalries inherent in the linguistic
 division between the Dutch-speaking north and the
 French-speaking south, detailed provisions have been made in
 law and government structure to assure equitable participation
 in the national life for both major linguistic groups. In
 1983, the Prime Minister formed a committee to study
 linguistic issues for 2 years, which has subdued public and
 parliamentary debate on these issues. A long-term solution to
 the linguistic community problems remains a priority goal of
 the Government.
 Belgium is active in the area of women's rights. The
 Consultative Commission for the Condition of Women, attached
 to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, advises the Government on
 international women's issues. Within the country there are
 several other commissions on women's rights which deal with
 oversight of women's education and working conditions.
 
 
 925
 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a Marxist-Leninist state ruled by the Bulgarian
 Communist Party. The Communist leadership, a
 self-perpetuating elite group which holds a monopoly of power,
 seeks to direct and control all economic, social, and cultural
 activities. A minority party, the Bulgarian National Agrarian
 Union, is represented in the Government and the National
 Assembly (Parliament) but is totally subservient to the
 Communist Party.
 The Bulgarian Constitution provides for certain basic rights,
 including the right to citizenship, work, rest, access to
 health care and free education, speech, press, association and
 demonstration, and freedom of worship. In practice, these
 freedoms are circumscribed to varying degrees, and they are
 not permitted to be exercised in any way that might weaken
 Communist Party control. All challenges to this control are
 dealt with quickly, firmly, and harshly. The Communists'
 power monopoly seems to have been tolerated in Bulgaria less
 grudgingly than in some of the other Eastern European states.
 Nevertheless, latent discontent exists among persons of all
 age groups, particularly with regard to the lack of political,
 cultural, and intellectual freedom under the party's tight
 rein.
 The Government's observance of human rights during 1984 has
 not changed significantly  Beatings and mistreatment of
 political prisoners, and arbitrary arrest and detention of
 persons critical of the authorities reportedly continue. The
 Government maintains its constant widespread interference in
 the affairs of its citizens through its system of police
 informers, electronic monitoring, mail censorship, and control
 of information. Basic human freedoms continue to be
 abridged. With legitimate areas of free expression closed off
 to Bulgarian citizens, several instances of terrorism in 1984
 posed an ominous new feature on the Bulgarian scene. Bomb
 explosions at the Plovdiv railway station, Gorna Oryakhovitsa
 post office, and Varna airport, which caused multiple
 casualties, seem to have been politically inspired.
 Concerted industrialization of Bulgaria's primarily
 agricultural economy got under way only in the postwar years.
 As the executor of this economic modernization, which brought
 increased urbanization and a rise in living standards, the
 Communist Party has taken credit for Bulgaria's emergence into
 modernity.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although there were no reports in 1984 of politically inspired
 killings by security forces or anti-regime groups, Bulgaria's
 tight control of its information media renders it impossible
 to assess whether such killings have occurred.
 Three executions were publicly announced in 1984, including
 that of Plamen Antonov Penchev. He had been convicted of
 sending a package bomb which killed several persons at the
 Gorna Oryakhovitsa train station post office in April 1984.
 His death sentence was announced in July, and a Bulgarian
 
 
 926
 BULGARIA
 official said in August that Penchev had been executed. The
 other two announced executions were for armed robbery.
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of disappearance in 1984 at the hands of official or
 quasi-official security forces have come to light.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Beatings continue to be a feature of imprisonment in Bulgaria,
 according to 1984 reports by dissidents and their families.
 Political prisoners, who are usually intellectuals, are
 detained together with common criminals and subjected to
 brutal treatment by these elements as well as by guards.
 These practices are confirmed by veteran inmates from various
 prisons. Three inmates at the Central Prison in Sofia were
 allegedly shot in early 1984 when they failed to respond to a
 command in the prison courtyard.
 At the Razvigor Street Jail in Sofia, prisoners are held two
 to a cell during the pretrial investigation stage. The cells
 measure one and a half by two paces and are furnished only
 with a plank bed and pallet. Each cell is illuminated around
 the clock by a single naked bulb. Access to washing
 facilities is limited, with one shower permitted about every 2
 weeks. Latrines consist of a hole in the ground. Only two
 daily latrine trips are permitted. Toilet paper is severely
 rationed, and cell walls are smeared with excrement.
 Convicts are assigned to the most hazardous jobs at the Devnia
 Chemical Plant but at rates of pay considerably below those of
 their coworkers. One Bulgarian dissident characterized the
 conditions of forced labor at this facility as potentially
 fatal in a matter of months.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Bulgarians may be detained, tried, and punished for many
 actions which are generally considered political in nature.
 Any type of unauthorized demonstration, public expression of
 view critical of the Government, or even the simple act of
 entering a Western embassy can bring detention or arrest.
 Occasionally, arrestees are charged with having committed a
 *crime' such as visiting an embassy, although there appears to
 be no law against such activity. More often, however, they
 are charged with vaguely-worded political 'crimes', or with a
 common petty crime such as currency violation, or with
 violation of administrative restrictions on their personal
 travel.
 The principle of habeas corpus exists under the Bulgarian
 Criminal Code and is followed in most cases. Except for some
 cases which the Government considers politically sensitive,
 the law provides that preliminary detention is limited to 10
 days, and then only whenever evidence indicates some
 justification for a later indictment. The accused may wait
 for formal indictment for up to 6 months provided charges have
 been made. In all cases, according to the law, the accused
 must be informed of the charges pending against him. The
 letter of the law is usually, but not always, followed.
 Persons may also be subject through administrative regulation
 
 
 927
 BULGARIA
 to an informal system of detention in which they are detained
 at their place of residence and must appear at the local
 police station several times daily to sign in. Another form
 of punishment is forced change of domicile or internal exile.
 A person's right to live in a certain town may be revoked, and
 he may be required to move to a town far away from family,
 friends, and familiar surroundings. Banished persons are
 often sent to remote villages to perform agricultural labor.
 One dissident banished from Sofia in 1984 was denied lodging
 upon arrival at the place of exile. He spent several weeks
 living in the open at a public park, where he became ill from
 exposure. The identity cards of exiles are stamped to note
 their restriction to a particular locality. Should the exile
 leave despite these prohibitions, he may face more severe
 administratively imposed imprisonment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bulgarian law and general practice provide for public trial in
 criminal cases. Defendants are entitled to counsel, but only
 after the preliminary investigation, sometimes lasting many
 weeks, has been completed and an indictment prepared. When
 legal counsel is finally available to the accused, it often
 cooperates with the prosecution. In theory, the accused is
 informed of the charges against him, but recent practice
 indicates that detainees are often not told precisely under
 what statutes they are being held.
 Special court procedures are followed in cases involving state
 security. Such trials may be held in camera, as was that of
 Plamen Antonov Penchev, the convicted bomber at Gorna
 Oryakhovitsa. The trials of Volodya Nakov and Yanko Yankov,
 dissidents who suffered exile for contacting Western
 embassies, were also conducted in secret.
 Generally, the Bulgarian penal system follows the letter of
 the law. However, although the laws themselves are codified
 and published, numerous procedural and administrative
 regulations are not. Frequently, such regulations, access to
 which is restricted, are invoked arbitrarily. The defendant
 and his counsel have little recourse, since the validity or
 applicability of the regulation in question cannot easily be
 verified. These procedural regulations play a central role in
 the judicial system and enable the Government and its
 prosecutors to manipulate the circumstances and outcome of
 trials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government interferes in the private lives of its citizens
 in myriad ways. An elaborate system of informers directed by
 the party and security apparatus, with representation in
 virtually all workplaces, residential areas, and social
 organizations, monitors the daily lives of Bulgarians in
 search of signs of dissidence or other unacceptable behavior.
 Sanctity of the home is safeguarded by law, and police may
 legally search property only with prior permission from a
 court or prosecutor. However, searches may be undertaken in
 urgent situations before judicial permission is given.
 The Government organizes the private lives of its citizens.
 Virtually all citizens belong to "mass' political
 
 
 928
 BULGARIA
 organizations. Children and young adults belong to the
 Pioneers and Komsomol, while their elders join the Fatherland
 Front, a mass organization, or, in the case of the elite, the
 Communist Party. There appears to be strong pressure on all
 citizens at least to pay dues and become nominal members of
 these organizations. Those who refuse--an extremely small
 percentage of the population--are likely to be denied normal
 promotions and other benefits and to come under official
 scrutiny.
 The Government attempts to insulate the populace from most
 kinds of contact with foreign non-Communist influence.
 International mail and telephone conversations are closely
 monitored, and Western shortwave radio broadcasts have been
 subjected to periodic jamming. Western publications, except
 for those of Communist parties, are virtually unavailable.
 Suspect publications are often confiscated from travelers'
 luggage before they are admitted to the country. Some persons
 with valid visas have been denied entry to Bulgaria because
 objectionable literature was found in their possession.
 Foreign citizens, including even family members of Bulgarians,
 have sometimes been denied the opportunity of staying in the
 homes of their Bulgarian relatives and friends while visiting
 the country.
 In the case of the Turkish and Pomak minorities, Bulgarian
 authorities have reportedly even interfered with the normal
 registration of civil documents. The Pomaks, numbering some
 200,000 in Bulgaria, are ethnic Slavs whose ancestors
 converted to Islam during the 500 years of Turkish rule. Many
 have kept Muslim religion, habits, dress, and names to this
 day. According to several sources, Bulgarian authorities have
 put increasing pressure on Muslim minorities to accept Slavic
 or Slavicized names and have even refused in some provinces to
 issue birth and marriage documents, diplomas, and other civil
 documents to ethnic Turks and Pomaks who refuse to accept
 Bulgarian names.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for certain basic rights including
 freedom of speech, press, association and demonstration, and
 worship. In practice, these freedoms are circumscribed and
 are not permitted to be exercised in any way that might weaken
 Communist Party control. The state controls the press,
 decides which political organizations may exist, and
 determines which political demonstrations may take place.
 Laws provide for severely punishing anyone accused of
 criticizing the state. The dissemination of 'untruthful
 remarks which might increase mistrust of state power or cause
 confusion in society' is proscribed. The divulging of certain
 information (for example, the size of the foreign debt) is
 illegal and subject to severe penalties.
 Although censorship does not exist officially, the media
 operate within well-understood party and government guidelines
 and practices. International news is usually limited to that
 provided by the government news agency or official Soviet
 sources. Forbidden topics in the Bulgarian press include
 unauthorized criticism of party and state leaders, of
 
 
 929
 BULGARIA
 socialist ideology, and of other socialist countries,
 particularly the U.S.S.R. All-pervasive party control of the
 media makes self-censorship by journalists unnecessary.
 However, self-censorship is practiced carefully by virtually
 the entire population in all aspects of public life. There
 have also been instances of interference with academic inquiry
 in the social sciences.
 The public is permitted to send criticism, suggestions, and
 complaints by letter to newspapers and to National Assembly
 representatives on a broad range of topics such as inadequate
 service from public agencies and housing shortages. None of
 the letters published goes beyond criticism of specific
 economic or service shortfalls or failure of individuals in
 government administration. None deals with fundamental
 questions of how society, the economy, or the nation's
 political life are structured. Thus the state allows limited
 criticism and reportedly seeks to investigate complaints and
 respond to them.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In practice, freedom of assembly is a right granted only to
 legally constituted organizations and only for approved
 purposes. Private associations are totally unknown, and the
 law provides for punishment of anyone "founding an illegal,
 anti-state organization.* Public assemblies are never
 spontaneous affairs, but rather are party-organized to achieve
 a particular purpose. The possibility of an unauthorized
 group demonstration is remote.
 Bulgarian trade or labor unions are totally controlled and
 organized by the Government. Their important political
 function is to increase public support for the Government and
 the quality and quantity of production. Members are not in a
 position to negotiate or strike for better pay or working
 conditions. Union leaders represent the interests of the
 management. Bulgarian trade unions organize vacations for
 workers and look after the general social welfare of their
 members.
 People working as lawyers, doctors, artists, musicians,
 writers, and academics are represented by professional
 associations which also have the party-assigned function of
 controlling their membership. Professional associations are
 more likely to have contacts with foreign--even Western--
 professional associations, however, and arrange foreign travel
 for trusted members to attend conferences and take part in
 international exchanges.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Bulgaria is a Communist state which officially espouses
 atheism and discourages religion. Openly expressed religious
 conviction is incompatible with party membership or the
 attainment of responsible government position. Nevertheless,
 a number of faiths do hold services. The Bulgarian Orthodox
 Church, the state religion before the Communists took power,
 is the largest and most acceptable in the Government's view.
 This is in recognition of the Church's historical and cultural
 role in Bulgarian history, as well as its continuing appeal to
 masses of ordinary Bulgarians. The Church receives
 substantial government financial support and in return voices
 concurrence with government propaganda lines such as on peace
 
 
 930
 BULGARIA
 and disarmament. The Church is allowed to print a newspaper
 and sell religious articles such as candles, small jewelry
 crosses, etc. A Bulgarian Orthodox bookstore sells limited
 editions of scholarly books on church history, but the number
 of Bibles in circulation is strictly limited.
 Worship services continue to be popular, especially on
 important holidays such as Palm Sunday and Easter.
 Authorities tend not to interfere with older worshipers
 entering churches on these occasions, but in some cases in
 1984, youths have been required to have passes to gain
 admittance. The passes are handed out by local branches of
 the Communist Youth League (Komsomol). On Easter Eve 1984,
 militiamen harassed young people trying to enter a
 neighborhood church in Sofia.
 Islam and Judaism are also officially recognized by the
 state. Ethnic Turks make up the majority of Bulgaria's
 Muslims, the remainder being Gypsies or Slavic Pomaks. Muslim
 believers have been inhibited from practicing their religion
 by the closure of many mosques and by prohibition against
 religious education of children. Although Sofia's main mosque
 is being slowly renovated with some government funds, many
 other mosques throughout the country have fallen into
 disrepair, been razed, or been converted to other uses. When
 mosques have been razed, their associated graveyards have
 usually also been razed, often without a trace.
 Muslims have no access to Korans, which are not printed in
 Bulgaria. A Muslim wishing to undertake the hajj to Mecca
 would encounter the same barriers faced by any Bulgarian
 seeking a private trip abroad: currency restrictions and a
 letter of support from an overseas relative. The Bulgarian
 press for the past few years has not reported even token
 contingents from Bulgaria making the pilgrimage to Mecca.
 Bulgaria's Jewish minority of about 5,000, mainly middle-aged
 and elderly persons, is permitted freedom to attend worship
 services. Jews in Bulgaria have not undergone strident
 anti-Semitic repression. Sofia's Sephardic Synagogue was
 provided government funds for refurbishing as a national
 architectural monument, but work has come to a virtual halt.
 The synagogue's prayer books are old, with no replacements
 provided. Bulgaria's Jewish cultural center emphasizes the
 community's ethnic, not religious, identity. Government
 slaughterhouses will not cater to the special dietary
 requirements of pious customers. The Government will not
 allow appropriate clergy to participate in slaughterhouse
 operations.
 Relations between churches and the Government are regulated by
 the Foreign Ministry's Committee for Questions of the
 Bulgarian Orthodox Church and Religious Cults. Although no
 churches are 'licensed', only the Orthodox, Moslem, and Jewish
 religions enjoy any sort of official support. A number of
 other religions and sects are allowed to operate churches and
 congregations in Bulgaria. Included in this group are
 Catholics, Evangelicals, Baptists, Pentecostalists,
 Seventh-Day Adventists, Armenians, Congregationalists, and
 Methodists.
 Bulgaria's Roman Catholics are few in number and divided
 between followers of the Latin and Uniate rites. Church
 sermons hew closely to topics of personal piety, avoiding
 
 
 931
 BULGARIA
 social and political issues. During 1983-84 two priests were
 allowed to study in Rome. Upon their return to Bulgaria, the
 authorities confiscated Bibles and theological books which
 they had brought back with them. Two Uniate Roman Catholic
 nuns are studying theology in Rome.
 No religious groups may engage in open proselytizing, and
 foreign missionary activity is likewise banned. Religious
 education of children is prohibited, but some youngsters do
 enter churches with family members for services. Although a
 Bulgarian-language Bible was printed in 1982, only 2,000
 copies were distributed domestically. Most denominations have
 privately complained about the lack of scriptural materials.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government controls where Bulgarians live, work, and
 travel. All Bulgarians carry a personal identity card with
 them at all times stating their legal place of residence and
 work. Without this card, they cannot purchase domestic
 airline tickets, register at a hotel, or seek any kind of
 social service such as medical assistance. Change of place of
 residence or work is a complicated process unless the change
 is at the Government's initiative and convenience. Changing
 residence to Sofia and other major cities from the provinces
 is especially difficult because of the desire to limit the
 size of cities. Travel around the country is unrestricted,
 except for border areas where non-local Bulgarians are stopped
 and questioned if they do not have special permission to be
 there.
 Foreign travel is extremely restricted. Bulgarian citizens
 must have a passport for foreign travel and an exit visa
 specifying the destination for each trip. If they go to a
 country not mentioned in the exit permit, they can face
 serious complications upon their return home. A citizen's
 application for an exit document is refused most often because
 travel is deemed "not in the interest of the state."
 Applications for pure tourist travel to the West are rarely
 granted except to trusted and highly placed individuals.
 Travel to Eastern European countries is encouraged.
 Emigration is provided for by law, but is rarely permitted.
 However, the Government occasionally permits members of
 divided families, including spouses, to join relatives in the
 West in accordance with the Helsinki Final Act. Since 1983,
 several of the approximately three dozen American divided
 family cases were resolved, as were a few cases involving
 other Western countries.
 The Government encourages the repatriation of ethnic
 Bulgarians residing abroad, although the right of repatriation
 is not guaranteed. In the summer of 1981, the authorities
 declared an amnesty for all Bulgarians who had left the
 country illegally, inviting them to return home without fear
 of prosecution. Few took advantage of this offer before it
 expired at the end of 1983. Among those who did, one family
 had their U.S. passports confiscated by local militia
 authorities. A new amnesty was announced in 1984. A number
 of Bulgarian-born foreign residents and citizens do
 voluntarily return to Bulgaria to live in retirement each
 year. These repatriates are well treated by the Government.
 Less fortunate are those involuntary repatriates who are
 
 
 932
 BULGARIA
 returned from other Communist countries for having attempted
 illegally to emigrate. Likewise, Bulgaria's policy is to
 return to their home countries potential refugees from other
 Warsaw Pact countries who have tried to cross the Bulgarian
 border into Greece, Turkey, or Yugoslavia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bulgaria is governed by a small ruling elite representing the
 Bulgarian Communist Party. Rank and file members of the party
 have little, if any, actual political power or opportunity to
 change the party's policies. Non-party members are virtually
 denied any role in influencing the policies of their
 Government or in changing its form.
 Political pluralism and free participation in the political
 process are essentially nonexistent. Domestic opposition to
 the state or party is dealt with promptly and severely with
 prison sentences. Premier Grisha Filipov told Austrian
 journalists on September 26, 1984: "We do not have any
 opposition. Our national and political unity is important.'
 Opponents and dissidents are not tolerated, he added, since
 Bulgaria's economic successes are based on this national unity
 under the party.
 Bulgaria has no free elections in the Western sense, although
 it tries to maintain the appearance of pluralism through the
 participation of the Bulgarian National Agrarian Union in the
 Government and National Assembly. The Communist and Agrarian
 parties, together with labor, youth, and other organizations,
 comprise the Fatherland Front, an umbrella organization of
 Communist and non-Communist elements established in 1942. In
 practice, the Fatherland Front as well as its various
 organizations are all ultimately controlled by the Communist
 Party, to which the Constitution gives clear primacy. The
 Agrarians run separate candidates but do not compete against
 Communist candidates or face any other opposition. They hold
 about one-fourth of the seats in the National Assembly, but
 all votes in the Assembly are unanimous.
 The National Assembly, which normally meets fewer than four
 times a year, has no independent role in governing. No debate
 of alternatives takes place. The National Assembly has never
 failed to endorse government policy.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The human rights record of Bulgaria has not been the subject
 of resolutions by international human rights organizations.
 Bulgaria has not admitted any independent group to investigate
 questions of human rights violations, and has not responded to
 or communicated with any non-governmental human rights group.
 Although Bulgaria is a member of the UN Human Rights
 Commission, Bulgarian authorities contend that human rights
 are strictly an internal matter for each government to
 resolve. There are no government or private organizations in
 Bulgaria which attempt to protect individual liberties or
 observe and report on human rights violations.
 Amnesty International has repeatedly commented on human rights
 violations in Bulgaria. In its 1984 report, Amnesty expressed

 concern about the imprisonment of prisoners of conscience and
 two cases of confinement to psychiatric hospitals for
 political reasons. Freedom House rates Bulgaria "not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 During the past 40 years, Bulgaria has changed from an
 overwhelmingly agricultural country to one with a mix of
 industry and agriculture. Communist rulers have emphasized
 state ownership of nearly all means of production, rapid
 economic growth, central control over the economy, and
 industrial development. The country remains a large producer
 of agricultural goods, and Bulgarians can sell produce raised
 on their own private plots. Per capita income in 1980 was
 estimated at $2,625.
 Bulgaria has been successful in feeding, educating, and
 looking after the basic necessities of its citizens. Its
 present performance in all of these areas is better than at
 any other time in Bulgaria's history. All citizens are
 guaranteed a job. Officially there is no unemployment,
 although in practice underemployment is widespread. Basic
 needs are generally met on a non-discriminatory basis,
 although high party officials and those with access to hard
 currency may be able to afford superior foreign health care,
 education, and better food. There are no grounds for charges
 of discrimination on the basis of sex when it comes to
 provision of the necessities of life. Although Bulgaria has
 poor people, there do not seem to be great disparities between
 poverty and wealth. Success in the Government or party
 results more in privileges than in great personal wealth.
 A system of government facilities caters to the health needs
 of Bulgarian citizens. Patients do not pay direct fees for
 medical care, which appears to be of adequate quality.
 Bulgaria's leaders have expressed concern about the country's
 low and dropping population growth rate of 0.3 percent in 1984
 and have established financial incentives for families to have
 more children. Despite extensive construction of new public
 apartment buildings in the past decade, the general housing
 shortage continues.
 Education is free through the university level with a general
 system of merit selection for university admission. However,
 certain priorities and privileges go to the children of the
 influential. Adult literacy is high. The primary school
 enrollment ratio in 1981 was 132 percent.
 Women are guaranteed equal rights with men, and all citizens
 are declared to be equal before the law, regardless of
 national origin, creed, social status, education, or sex.
 Educational and professional opportunities do not discriminate
 against Bulgarian women. One-half of the openings for
 university students available each year are reserved by law
 for women, who consequently are well represented in some of
 the more prestigious professions such as medicine. However,
 women continue to be underrepresented in policymaking jobs
 within the Government, and overrepresented in manual
 occupations in areas such as farming, light industry, and
 cleaning and maintenance.
