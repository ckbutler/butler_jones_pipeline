 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy in which the Liberal and Con-
 servative parties have long dominated the political scene. President Ernesto Samper
 was the Liberal Party's candidate in the relatively peaceful presidential and con-
 gessional elections held in 1994. Throughout 1995 Samper was beset by allegations
 hat he knowingly received campaign contributions from drug traffickers.
 Responsibility for internal security resides in the Ministry of Defense which over-
 sees both the armed forces and the National Police.he e Department of Administra-
 tive Security which is responsible for national security ite ligence, reports directly
 to the presdent. Civil unrest and lawlessness continued to dominate society. The
 police and the armed forces were responsible for widespread human rights abuse.
 On August 16, President Samper declared a 90-day state of emergency claiming
 this action was designed to combat the ever-increasing violence in the country. On
 October 26, the Constitutional Court struck down the declaration as unconstitu-
 tional for lack of justification that the level of violence was extraordinary. Following
 the November 2 assassination of prominent politician Alvaro Gomez Hurtado, the
 President again declared a state of emergency. For 35 of the past 44 years, the Gov-
 ernment has operated under declared states of emergency which enable the execu-
 tive to rule by decree. These decrees frequently set aside temporarily fundamental
 judicial guarantees of due process, and sometimes have been incorporated into per-
 manent law by subsequent legislative action. Several violent guerrilla organizations
 continued to operate, despite regular attempts by the Government to negotiate
 peaceful settlements. Military cooperation with paramilitary groups in remote re-
 gions of the country continued.
 Colombia has a mixed private and public sector economy. The Government contin-
 ued an economic liberalization program and the privatization of selected public in-
 dustries. Crude petroleum rivals coffee as the principal export and, as a result of
 the Augnst 1994 discovery of immense natural gas reserves, petroleum and gas ex-
 ports play an even greater role. Narcotics traffickers controlled vast numbers of en-
 terprises.
 in an all-out campaign against narcotics traffickers, a special task force arrested
 six top leaders of the Call cartel. While violence by narcotics traffickers against the
 population declined from previous years, internecine violence among the trafficking
 organizations still accounted for substantial numbers of homicides, kidnapings,
 cases of torture, and attacks against the military and the police. Guerrillas and nar-
 cotics traffickers collaborated, especially in rural regions of the country. Their tar-
 gets included politicians, labor organizers, human rights monitors, and-overwhelm-
 ingly-peasant farmers.
 The Government took steps to reduce human rights violations. The President pub-
 licly acknowledged government responsibility for the 1989-90 massacres in Trujillo.
 A special commission submitted a draft penal reform proposal, which was designed
 to end the traditional sense of impunity enjoyed by military and police personnel
 implicated in human rights violations. The Government announced the formation of
 a special task force to combat paramilitary groups, and several paramilitary leaders
 were arrested. Despite these arrests, however, paramilitary activity grew. In addi-
 tion, both government and nongovernment sources acknowledge that many military
 
 
 363
 and police officers still regard human rights with hostility and believe that the Gov-
 ernment granted the guerrillas excessive concessions during the peace process. This
 process, which many hoped would bring guerrilla factions to the negotiating table,
 came to a virtual halt in August, largely because of guerrilla intransigence.
 The number of human rights violations committed by government security forces
 declined, but the overall human rights situation in the country remained critical,
 with a variety of institutions--including the police and the military--continuing to
 commit abuses such as political and extrajudicial killings, kidnapings, torture, and
 other physical mistreatment. The Government allowed the military to exercise juris-
 diction over military personnel accused of abuses, who in most cases were not pros-
 ecuted. Other perpetrators of human rights abuses include antigovernment guerrilla
 groups, narcotics traffickers, and paramilitary groups. Rampant impunity is the core
 of the country's human rights violations: 97 percent of all crimes go unpunished. In
 a major setback for human rights, Attorney General for Human   ights Hernando
 Valencia Villa resigned in August under pressure from members of the military hi-
 erarchy. He subsequently left the country, alleging that he had received numerous
 threats against his life.
 Tho overburdened judiciary has a huge case backlog. Discrimination against
 women, minorities, and the indigenous continued. Violence against women, children
 and indigenous people also remained commonplace. Vigilante groups, often sup-
 ported or ignored by the police and the military, engaged in "social cleansing-the
 killing of street children, prostitutes, homosexuals, and others deemed socially unde-
 sirable.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The total number of murders in Co-
 lombia appeared to rise slightly during the first half of 1995 compared with the cor-
 responding period in 1994. According to the National Police, there were 83.71 homi-
 cides per 100,000 inhabitants in 1994, considerably higher than the 5-year average
 of approximately 78 per 100,000. When President Samper declared the state of
 emergency in August, he stated that 19,450 Colombians were the victims of homi-
 cide during the first 6 months of 1995 alone. This figure gave rise to considerable
 controversy because it greatly exceeded National Police statistics. Many critics sug-
 gested the administration used the higher figure to strengthen its rationale for the
 state of emergency. Nevertheless, most observers expected the number of homicides
 to exceed 30,000 by year's end.
 The police and the judiciary have insufficient resources to investigate most
 killings properly. It is also often difficult to identify precisely which warring party
 was responsible for which violent incident. As a result, it is frequently hard to dis-
 tinguish between political and nonpolitical murders. According to the Bogota-based
 nongovernmental organization (NGO) Justice and Peace, there were 1,288 known or
 presumed politically motivated murders between January and June. The Andean
 Commission of Jurists (CAJSC) estimated that 4 of the 10 victims murdered each
 day were targeted for their involvement with political, labor, or social causes. Evi-
 dence was sufficient to establish a probable perpetrator in only 35 percent of those
 cases. Of the perpetrators identified, 45 percent were members of paramilitary
 groups, 27.5 percent were guerrillas, and 24 percent belonged to the armed forces
 or state security forces. CAJSC claimed that whereas 97 percent of all violent crimes
 u unpished, the impunity rate for politically motivated crimes is even higher. Al-
 though the number of political or presumed political murders committed by the mili-
 tary and the police fell by approximately 30 percent during the months of January
 through June compared with the corresponding 1994 figures, security forces contin-
 ued to be implicated in cases of extrajudicial killings.
 The independent, state-sponsored Office of the Public Ombudsman for Human
 Rights (Defensoria del Pueblo) reported receiving 268 complaints against the army
 alleging murder, forced disappearances, and threats between January and June.
 Some of the complaints referred to 1994 incidents. There were no reports of mass
 summary executions by the military or police forces.
 The Public Ombudsman for Human Rights reported that it received 257 com-
 plaints between January and June implicating the police in arbitrary killings. In
 August police shot and killed a small-scale coffee farmer during a demonstration in
 Bogota, reflecting the police tendency to adopt an adversarial stance toward dem-
 onstrations rather than to facilitate them while ensuring public safety. Human
 rights monitors also implicated the police in incidents of social cleansing-including
 attacks and killings--drected against individuals deemed socially undesirable such
 as drug addicts, prostitutes, transvestites, beggars, and street children. They alleged
 
 
 not only that police failed to pursue the social-cleansing death squads and tolerated
 their presence in high-crime areas, but that off-duty policemen actually participated
 in social cleansing operations. The Center for Investigations and Popular Research
 (CINEP) reported 118 victims in 40 incidents of what it considered social cleansing
 between January and June. In November the Supreme Court sentenced two police-
 men to 20 years' imprisonment for the 1990 murders of two indigents in
 Bucaramanga, Santander department. The Court determined that the two officials
 were part of a social-cleansing network active in the area.
 While incidents of extrajudicial killings by police and military forces decreased,
 both government and nongovernment sources agree that extrajudicial killings by
 paramilitary groups increased significantly, often with the alleged complicity of indi-
 vidual soldiers or of entire military units. The groups targeted teachers labor lead-
 ers, community activists, mayors of towns and villages, and, above all, peasants.
 Many of these victims included members of indigenous communities.
 The leftist coalition party known as the Patriotic Union (UP) lost over 2 000 of
 its members over the last 10 years in what the UP perceives as a campaign o? assas-
 sination waged against its leadership. UP leader Hernan Motta is the party's mem-
 ber of the Senate, replacing UP leader Manuel Vargas Cepeda who was assassinated
 in 1994. Initial reports indicated that Cepeda's assassins might have been members
 of a paramilitary group, but the investigation of his murder was still underway at
 years end. The UP implicated members of the state security forces in many of the
 murders, but no final determination as to the perpetrators has been reached. The
 UP brought a complaint, still pending, before the Inter-American Commission on
 Human Rights that charges the Government with "action or omission7 in what the
 UP terms "political genocide" against the UP and the Communist Party.
 Although most paramilitary killings remain unsolved, in July members of the
 army's 7th Brigade and the Prosecutor General's Technical Investigative Corps ar-
 rested Arnulfo Castillo Agudelo, a paramilitary leader implicated in the murders of
 an estimated 100 civilians since 1993 in Meta department. He was alleged to be a
 key figure in the extensive paramilitary apparatus reportediy funded by emerald
 magnate Victor Carranza who has successfully avoided legal scrutiny. Authorities
 continued to -search for Fidl Castano, believed to be the leader of paramilitary
 groups operating in Uraba.
 Seven massacres in Cesar department from January through September claimed
 the lives of 30 civilians, including farm laborers and organizers. The governor of
 Cesar attributed the massacres to the ongoing conflict between paramilitary and
 guerrilla forces, whose victims were typically innocent civilians. In January para-
 miitary forces killed seven and apparently forcibly kidnaped two citizens of the
 Aguachica region of Cesar department in a continuation of a series of kilings and
 disappearances in that community that began in October 1994. An official investiga-
 tive commission determined that paramilitary groups active in Aguachica main-
 tained close relations with commanders in the army and other state security organi-
 zations. This investigation resulted in the arrest of the army major who commanded
 the army base.
 Meta department is another region that saw an escalation of paramilitary activ-
 ity. Paramilitary forces carried out at least 7 of the 19 extrajudicial murders be-
 tween October 1994 and March 1995. Their victims included three members of the
 leftist Patriotic Union Party and various members of peasant organizations. The
 Meta Civic Committee for Human Rights reported that known paramilitary leaders
 freely appeared in public meetings. Having suffered the murders of 4, the forced dis-
 apearances of 3, and the dislocation of 25 of its members since 1991, the Meta
 Cii  ommittee finally closed down its office in Villavicencio because of increasing
 death threats against its members. Instead, it opened a Bogota office with a ma
 staff. At the same time, the Government established a special commission to seek
 a solution to the violence in Met.
 The banana-producing region of Uraba in Antioquia saw major conflicts. The con-
 vergence of paramilitary groups, guerrilla forces, narcotics traffickers, arms traffick-
 ere, and common criminas created a climate ofunrelentin  h violence from which the
 population has suffered for the past 8 years. However, direct armed engagements
 among these groups or between them and the military, were rare. The military com-
 mander in Cuoorudo reported that two murders per day were normal for that town-
 ship. The town of Necocei alone suffered 130 murders, 122 disappearances, and the
 dislocation of 1,307 families during the February to April period. In January a para-
 military group identifying itself as the Self-Defense Forces of Fidel Castano tortured
 and murdered six alleged guerrillas in Necopi.
 According to estimates by Justice and Peace, guerrillas were responsible for the
 extrajudicial killings of at least 64 civilians between January and June. In the
 Uraba massacres of August and September alone, guerrillas were responsible for
 
 
 365
 over 60 of the approximately 90 murders. To justify the executions, guerrillas regu-
 larly charged that their victims were either informants for the army or related in
 some other way to the State, or that they simply refused to support the guerrillas'
 operations.
 The National Liberation Army (ELN), too, killed scores of civilians. In May ELN
 forces killed five peasants in Sucre for allegedly collaborating with the army. Also
 in May, ELN forces killed five teenage girls and one woman in Arauca for fraterniz-
 ing with soldiers. In June ELN forces bombed a building next to an orphanage,
 wounding several children. In March the Minister of Defense formally denounced
 the ELN before the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights for its persistent
 use of land mines. Killings of noncombatants by guerrilla groups consistently out-
 numbered casualties inflicted upon the military in armed engagements.
 The President publicly acknowledged government responsibility for the Trujillo
 massacres of 1989 and 1990, in which over 100 local residents were killed. As a re-
 sult, some of the victims' surviving family members received indemnification from
 the Government. Investigation of the Trujillo massacres continued. A special govern-
 ment antidrug cartel task force captured a leading drug kingpin implicated in the
 Trujillo massacres, but a central figure in the massacres, an army lieutenant colo-
 nel, was discharged from the army without criminal sanction.
 b. Disappearance.-Colombia continued to suffer from extremely high overall rates
 of disappearance and kidnaping. Human rights officials in the President's executive
 offices confirmed approximately 1,200 reported kidnaping cases. The Office of the
 Defender of the People received98 reports of forced disappearances attributed to or-
 ganized criminals, police, military, paramilitary, and guerrilla forces between Janu-
 ary and June. Authorities believe that the actual number of kidnaping victims was
 siguificantly higher because many families choose not to report kidnapings in order
 to protect ransom negotiations. Due to the complex interplay of military, para-
 military, guerrillas, and narcotics-based forces involved in the country's internal
 conflicts, it was often difficult to distinguish between disappearances for political
 motives and kidnapings for profit. It is clear, however, that guerrillas were respon-
 sible for approximately half of all these crimes. The guerrillas deny that their prac-
 tice of kidnaping constitutes the taking of hostages. In June FARC agents murdered
 two American missionaries held since 1994. Arrests or prosecutions in any of these
 cases were rare. In September President Samper appointed an antikidnaping czar
 to oversee increased efforts to investigate and prevent kidnapings.
 Colombian law codifies the act of forced disappearance as a crime. However, the
 law relaxes the standard when forced disappearances have been committed by mili-
 tary or police personnel, classifying them as acts performed in the line of duty.
 Moreover, the proposed reform of the military penal code submitted in August left
 unresolved the definition of an act of service or act committed in the line of duty.
 For the first time in Colombian history, an army officer-Brigade Commander
 Alvaro Velandia Hurtado-was discharged from active duty in August for official
 misconduct by failing to prevent or investigate the forced disappearance, torture,
 and murder of an M-19 guerrilla in 1987. The commander challenged the dismissal
 ordered by the Attorney General for Human Rights after an exhaustive 5-year in-
 vestigation. Within days of the first ruling reversing the dismissal, President
 Samper personally signed an award which the Ministry of Defense presented to the
 commander. A higher court supported the dismissal, however, and the President
 was obliged to fire the commander. Attorney General for Human Rights Hernando
 Valencia Villa resigned under pressure from the military hierarchy and the Attor-
 ney General and left Colombia amid reports of threats against his security. At year's
 end, the Prosecutor General's newly created human rights unit initiated an inves-
 tigation to examine further the forced disappearance and murder of this M-19 guer-
 rilna.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, but reports of incidents of police and military beatings
 and torture of detainees continued throughout the year. These abuses often occurred
 in connection *with illegal detentions in the context of counterinsurgency or
 counternarcotics operations. Paramilitary groups operating in rural areas were also
 responsible for instances of torture and sometimes took credit for their macabre
 work, leaving menacing notes on the bodies of their victims. In many cases, how-
 ever, it was difficult to identify the peretrators of torture since cadavers which bore
 the traces of physical torture were rarely subject to extensive forensic investigations.
 In May the Attorney General's office brought charges against 7 members of the
 army, 17 members of the National Police, and 3 detectives of the Department of Ad-
 ministrative Security for their presumed participation in incidents of torture
 throughout the country.
 
 
 366
 Prison conditions are harsh, especially for those prisoners with reduced means of
 support. Overcrowding and dangerous sanitary andhealth conditions remained seri-
 ous problems. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continued to
 have access to most prisons and police and military detention centers. However, the
 ICRC noted that local or regional commanders did not always prepare mandatory
 detention registers or follow notification procedures. As a result, accurate detainee
 counts do not exist.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution includes several provi-
 sions designed to prevent illegal detention. Suspects must be brought before a judge
 within 36 hours of their arrest, and they have a right to petition for habeas corpus
 from any judge. That petition, too, must be acted upon within 36 hours of its appli-
 cation. Despite these legal protections, instances of arbitrary detention continued,
 and a large percentage of the prison population remained in an undetermined pre-
 trial status. Under the state of emergency, preventive detention was legal with or
 without prior judicial authorization, but authorities were required to bring the de-
 tainees before a judicial officer within 36 hours of their arrest. Although authorities
 were able to increase the number of arrests, they were unable to bring the detainees
 before the judicial authorities within the required time, thus holding citizens with-
 out any justification before eventually releasing them. The Government not only
 failed in its stated objective to get criminals off the streets but also violated the
 rights of suspects in the process. The Government ignored the impact which its dec-
 laration of a state of emergency would have on a judicial system that could not even
 address the needs of citizens under normal circumstances.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is largely independent of the
 executive and legislative branches, both in theory and practice. It continued to expe-
 rience    wing pains as the various courts, prosecutor's offices, and ministries at-
 tempted todeine their roles and streamline their operations following the judicial
 reorganization provided for in the 1991 Constitution. The court system includes the
 Supreme Court of Justice, the Council of State, the Constitutional Court, the Judici-
 ary Council, and tribunal courts. The 1991 Constitution modified the structure of
 the judicial branch by creating the office of the Prosecutor General as an independ-
 ent prosecutorial body. Prosecutors bring criminal cases before the tribunal courts.
 A National Tribunal serves as the first court of appeal in these cases. The Supreme
 Court of Justice serves as the appellate court for decisions by the National Tribunal;
 it is also the court in which elected officials are tried. The Council of State is the
 appellate court for civil cases. The Judicial Council is the administrative arm of the
 judicial system. The Constitutional Court adjudicates cases of constitutionality.
 The judiciary has long been subject to threats and intimidation when dealing with
 narcotics and paramilitary cases. With the decline in drug-related terrorism, there
 was a corresponding decrease in violent attacks against members of the judiciary.
 Nevertheless, in June, unknown assassins tortured and murdered family court judge
 Luis Guillermo Acevedo. Justice and Peace reported that, of the 10 murders which
 targeted lawyers between January and June, 7 were presumed to be politically moti-
 vated. In September armed gunmen atte         d to assassinate President Samper's
 legal counsel; the counsel was wounded, and two government security escorts were
 killed in the incident.
 The 1991 Constitution formalized the "regional" or "public order" jurisdictions, in
 which anonymous or "faceless" judges and prosecutors handle narcotics and terror-
 ism cases. Human rights groups continued to charge that this system violated basic
 legal norms and procedural rights. Prosecutors, judges, and witnesses agree, how-
 ever, that the protection provided by a faceless system is essential to any progress
 in investigations and prosecution of human rights cases involving massacres, forced
 disappearances, torture, extrajudicial killings, and other acts of extreme violence. As
 in past years, the judiciary remained overburdened and often in a state of chaos,
 staggering under abacklog of over 1 million cases.
 The Constitution specifically provides for the right to due process. The accused
 has the right to representation by counsel, although representation for the indige-
 nous and the indigent historically has been inadequate. The Government continued
 to labor under stailng and funding shortages in an effort to develop a credible pub-
 lic defender system.
 The Attorney General investigates some allegations of human rights abuses by
 members of the state security apparatus, drawing upon a network of government
 human rights ombudsmen in over 1,000 municipalities. However, the Attorney Gen-
 eral can only recommend administrative sanctions; police and military personnel are
 rarely punished commensurately for human rights abuses. The Office of the De-
 fender of the People has the constitutionally assigned duty to ensure the promotion
 and exercise of human rights but is severely underfunded. During the year, it coin-
 
 
 pleted expansion of regional offices to serve citizens throughout the country. The
 number of cases referred to it increased by almost 30 percent, largely because of
 its expanded reach and increased public awareness of its function. The President
 has a special adviser for human rights issues who investigates allegations of abuse
 and disseminates human rights educational information.
 In a major effort to end impunity for human rights violations, the Prosecutor Gen-
 eral's office opened a special human rights unit consisting of faceless prosecutors as-
 signed to major cases. The Ministry of Defense also has a Secretariat for Human
 Rights which has instituted human rights advisory offices at brigade level, devel-
 oped human rights training programs, and coordinated the project to reform the
 military Penal Code. The National Police, which is under the direction of the Min-
 ister of Defense, instituted a Special Office of Oversight to monitor human rights.
 violations by the police and expanded human rights training. The new director of
 the Nationa Police ordered a majorpurge of corrupt and incompetent police officers.
 In general, thepurge was welcomed by the public and by human rights observers,
 although some feared that the dismissed police officers would turn to crime if given
 no means to find alternative employment.
 While a late 1993 reform of the Criminal Procedures Code addressed certain pro-
 cedural shortcomings within the system, problems remained. It was still difficult for
 defense attorneys to impeach or cross-examine anonymous witnesses, and often they
 did not have unimpeded access to the State's evidence. Supporters of the regional
 jurisdictions argued that it was better to address those shortcomings than to abolish
 the system. As a result of such considerations, judges may no longer base a convic-
 tion solely on the testimony of an anonymous witness. Human rights groups also
 criticized the Government's policy of allowing major narcotics traffickers to surren-
 der voluntarily and negotiate their sentences. These critics charged that "small-
 time" defendants were at a disadvantage under the system while powerful criminals
 received deferential treatment. They also charged that the system, lacking re-
 sources, could not effectively prosecute the major guerrilla leaders and was left to
 handle only low-level criminals suspected of subversive activity. Prosecutors re-
 ported, moreover, that potential witnesses in major cases often doubted the Govern-
 ment's ability to protect their anonymity.
 Colombia does not imprison citizens for political beliefs or expression of political
 onvictions. Howev-�er, the JCRC reported that it monitored 1,800 cases of citizens
 imprisoned under accusations of rebellion or aiding and abetting the insurgency,
 which are punishable under law. Many of thes prisoners were noncombatants who
 in some cases were held for months before formal charges were filed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Coespondence.-The law
 generally requires a judicial order for authorities to enter a private home, except
 in cases of hot pursuit. In remote regions, the military forces have civilian prosecu-
 torial units delegated to them. Human rights groups charged that these delegated
 units were unconstitutional, and Congress refused to grant them permanent status.
 Nonetheless, there were credible reports that they continued to function, often facili-
 tating army searches without bothering to apply for search warrants from the
 courts. To address this problem, the Ministry of Defense increased training in legal
 search procedures that comply with constitutional and human rights.
 A prosecutor must authorize telephone monitoring and the interception of mail.
 This protection extends to prisoners held in jails. However, various state authorities
 tap phones without obtaining authorization.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The Government devoted much attention to the internal conflict. The mili-
 tary forces, paramilitary groups, and particularly guerrilla organizations violated
 internationa humanitarian law in Colombia's internal conflict. On May 18, the Con-
 stitutional Court formally declared Law 171 of 1994 to be constitutional- this law
 ratified without reservation Protocol II of the Geneva Convention. By declaring the
 Protocol to be equall applicable to both armed insurgents and government forces,
 the Court challengedthose guerrilla groups who have refused to cease kidnaping,
 deploying land mines, and recruiting minors.
 In February military helicopters and planes attacked the village of Puerto Tru-
 jilo, Meta. They shot and killed one 49-year-old woman and wounded several towns-
 people, including a 5-year-old child. The military claimed that they believed guerril-
 las were in the village. A commission comprised of both government and nongovern-
 mental members determined that the military received no return fire and that no
 guerrillas were present in the village at the time.
 A persistent, if unofficial, emphasis by the army on body counts as a means of
 assessing field performance is a leading cause of violations of international humani-
 tarian law. Both NGO and military sources reported that some units placed weap-
 ons in the hands of dead bodies in an effort to create the impression that they had
 
 
 368
 engaged in combat as members of guerrillas forces. In April military authorities re-
 lieved an army lieutenant colonel of his command and placed him under house ar-
 rest for murdering local indigents and claiming that they were guerrillas killed in
 action. Authorities also imprisoned seven noncommissioned officers on murder
 charges in the same case. At year's end, the Prosecutor General's Office was still
 investigating the case.
 Paramilitary groups, who often allegedly operated with individual soldiers or en-
 tire military units, usually carried out their violent acts with impunity. In Septem-
 ber the Intercongregational Commission of Justice and Peace reported cases of tor-
 ture, beatings, and death threats against residents of several rural communities in
 Santander at the hands of paramilitary forces working for a local landowner. Local
 military units tolerated these acts and, in some instances, participated in them.
 However, peasants whom paramilitary forces had driven out of the community of
 La Leal were able to return to their homes under the protection of a special army
 unit. In response, paramilitary members threatened they would again drive out the
 residents ofLa Leal as soon as their military protectors left. The report faulted civil-
 ian authorities for refusing to investigate charges brought by the peasants, thus al-
 lowing the 8-year saga of violence in the region to continue unabated.
 The violence reached a peak when paramilitary and guerrilla elements killed
 some 90 civilians in a series of massacres between August 12 and September 20.
 With unusual speed, the authorities arrested 13 paramilitary soldiers within a week
 of the first of the massacres. Military authorities, regionally elected officials, the
 Catholic Church, and former guerrilla leaders agreed that of the six massacres dur-
 ing this period, five were probably part of a campaign by the Revolutionary Armed
 Forces of Colombia (FARC) against members and sympathizers of the Hope, Peace,
 and Freedom Party. (These are former members of The Popular Liberation Army
 (EPL) who laid down their arms in the early 1990's.) Critics charged that the army
 had advance knowledge of the FARC plan to carry out the August 29 massacre but
 failed to take proper measures to protect the population. The majority of the FARC's
 victims were banana workers.
 There were no reports of armed confrontations between the FARC and para-
 military groups, despite the fact that the declared purpose of the FARC's so-called
 dignity plan was to combat paramilitary groups. The FARC massacre of September
 20 took the lives of at least 25 banana workers, including 5 women and 2 minors.
 After summarily executing the workers, the FARC mutilated the bodies of five or
 six of the dead. In response, the Government declared martial law in the Uraba re-
 gn and pledged to deploy large numbers of troops to protect the civilian popu-
 lation. A government proposal to establish civilian security cooperatives met with
 considerable resistance from local community leaders and human rights observers
 who believed that such cooperatives would raise the level of violence in the area.
 The loosely organized guerrilla gups of the Simon Bolivar Coordinating Board,
 which include the FARC and ELN, committed a host of violations against humani-
 tarian law, among them extrajudicial killings and kidnapings (see Section 1.b.), as
 well as bombings and other acts of sabotage. In March various FARC units attacked
 the headquarters of the Agrarian Bank, the Coffee Growers Bank, and the local po-
 lice in the town of Ituango, Antioquia. They took hostages, wounded several citizens,
 and killed one policeman and three civilians, including the 11-year-old daughter of
 the police commander. The Jaime Bateman Cayon guerrillas (dissident M-19 mem-
 bers who refused their leadership's order to lay down their arms in 1990) destroyed
 installations at the Center for Sugar Cane Research. In July the ELN injured seven
 children at an orphanage for girls when it bombed an adjacent police station. Other
 acts of sabotage and deployment of land mines by the guerrillas showed an equal
 lack of concern for the civilian population. In September a car bomb wounded sev-
 eral citizens and caused extensive damage to the Santander Financial Corporation
 building in Bucaramanga. The governor of Santander reported that guerrilla organi-
 zations declared that they would increase terrorist acts in Bucaramanga.
 Soldiers and police continued to be targeted by drug traffickers, guerrillas, and
 common criminals on a daily basis. For example, in Kay FARC-placed land mines
 in Tolima killed six soldiers. In July FARC guerrillas attacked the village of Sueva,
 Cundinamarca, tortured and murdered all five members of its police force, and set
 fire to the bodies. In another July attack, the ELN dynamited a public road in El
 Playon, Santander, killing seven policemen. In August in Miraflores guerrillas killed
 6 and wounded 29 antinarcotics police in a 72-hour attack that nearly destroyed the
 village. After the attack, two army soldiers died while attempting to deactivate land-
 mines. The guerrillas also fired on a Red Cross plane as it evacuated women and
 children from Miraflores. In December a guerrilla attack on a police unit stationed
 near Bogota resulted in the death of an 18-month-old child. Antinarcotics police re-
 ported continuing confrontations with paramilitary groups in Tolima.
 
 
 369
 
 Internecine violence among guerrilla groups has a long history. In August a re-
 gional judge sentenced dissident FARC leader Javier Delgado to 19 years in prison
 or the 1985 massacre of 180 rival FARC guerrillas in Tacueyo, Cauca.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-All citizens have the right to seek a judicial in-
 junction or motion (tutela) in cases involving violations of basic constitutional rights.
 This provides all persons and organizations, including the media, with a mechanism
 to denounce both private and government violations of basic constitutional rights.
 The authorities generally respected these constitutionally protected rights but
 were prone to apply subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) pressure on certain media
 when their core interests were threatened. Most media, however, were disinclined
 to bend. For example, in April journalists at leading news magazine Semana com-
 plained publicly that agents representing the President's office inquired about the
 contents of an upcoming article which was to criticize President Samper. The Presi-
 dent's office immedately denied attempting to intimidate Semana staff, but the de-
 nial was not considered credible. Other signs of government efforts to influence the
 media included occasional calls on patriotic grounds to limit negative reporting
 which might hurt Colombia's image in the world and implied threats that govern-
 ment advertising might be withdrawn. In spite of these efforts, print and broadcast
 media regularly criticized the Government without recrimination. The privately
 owned print media published a wide spectrum of political viewpoints and often
 voiced harsh antigovernment opinions without administrative reprisals. The Govern-
 ment imposed some restrictions on electronic media coverage of incidents of public
 disorder and of drug terrorist activity and reserved the right to prohibit coverage
 of certain news events that could affect state security.
 Based on the Government's Decree 221 issued in January, the National Peniten-
 tiary and Prison Institute issued a resolution in March prohibiting journalists from
 visiting inmates of high security facilities.
 Some observers charged that anticorruption legislation passed by the Congress on
 May 30 directly violated constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press. They
 suggested that the restrictions imposed upon      media reporting of pending
 anticorruption cases deprived the public of its right to know about misconduct by
 public officials. Under the state of emergency the Government may regulate the
 media only if the information will endanger lives or directly induce public disturb-
 ances. The Government may use television and radio stations as it deems appro-
 priate but may not prohibit reports of human rights violations. The Government
 may not establish an official censorship board, but accredited media associations are
 to act as a self-regulatory tribunal.
 In February publisher Juan B. Fernandez escaped assassination when a contract
 killer revealed that two former agents of the National Police investigatory appara-
 tus SIJIN (fired in 1992 for alleged involvement in the murder of seven citizens of
 Barranquilla) had hired him to assassinate Fernandez. In April the Bogota circle
 of journalists publicly condemned the threats and intimidation suffered in particular
 by journalists covering narcotics trafficking. In May Ombudsman for Human Rights
 Jaime Cordoba Trivino reported that 107 journalists had been murdered since 1980.
 In December hit men in Armenia, capital of Quindio department, assassinated
 Ernesto Acero Cadena, a prominent journalist known for his harsh criticism of cor-
 rupt officials. While very few of these cases were ever definitively resolved, it was
 apparent that journalists were often victims of guerrilla groups, paramilitary orga-
 nizations, and narcotics traffickers.
 The Government generally respected Pcademic freedom, and there exists a wide
 spectrum of political activity throughout the country's universities. Teachers at the
 elementary and secondary levels in guerrilla-controlled territory were often threat-
 ened and intimidated by local guerrillas and paramilitary groups. Paramilitary
 forces killed at least 19 teachers in Uraba.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and the Government respects these
 rights in practice. The authorities do not normally interfere with public meetings
 and demonstrations and usually grant the required permission except when they de-
 termine that there is imminent danger to public order. Any organization is free to
 associate with international groups in its field. NGO's criticized the Government's
 response to the coffee workers' strike in the spring and summer. Among the inci-
 dents cited was the August 14 police shooting of a peasant who participated in a
 peaceful march by the small-scale coffee growers in Bogota. In addition, there was
 police harassment and the arbitrary arrest of some peasant protesters in Tbague,
 and the use of excessive force to dismantle the tent city set up by the protesters.
 
 
 370
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for complete religious freedom,
 and the Government respects this right in practice. There is little religious discrimi-
 nation. Roman Catholic religious instruction is no longer mandatory in state schools,
 and a Constitutional Court decision in 1994 found unconstitutional any official gov-
 ernment reference to religious characterizations of the country. The Government
 permits proselytizing among the indigenous population, provided it is welcome and
 does not induce members of indigenous communities to adopt changes that endanger
 their survival on traditional lands. In May the Samper administration issued a reg-
 ulatory decree implementing the Law on the Freedom of Cults which provides a
 mechanism for religions to obtain the status of recognized legal entities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to travel domestically
 and abroad. Outsiders wishing to enter Indian tribes' reserves must be invited. In
 areas where military operations against guerrillas are underway, police or military
 officials occasionally required civilians to obtain safe-conduct passes; guerrillas re-
 portedly used similar means to restrict travel in areas under their control.
 Guerrilla incursions, military counterinsurgency operations, guerrilla and para-
 military conscription, and land seizures by narcotics traffickers often forced peas-
 ants to flee their homes and farms. In its 1995 Report on Violence and Internal
 Forced Displacement in Colombia, the Colombian Conference of Bishops noted that
 approximately 600,000 Colombians, or 2 percent of the population, were displaced
 persons. Displaced persons continued to face a crucial dilemma: while they could not
 stay in conflict zones because of legitimate fears for their safety, they were rejected
 and perceived as an economic drain in the regions and cities which were their most
 common destinations.
 Colombia has had a tradition of providing political asylum since the 1920's. Dur-
 ing the 1970's, Colombia granted asylum to Argentine, Chilean, Uruguayan, and
 Paraguayan citizens seeking refuge from dictatorial regimes in their own countries.
 The Government reserves the right to determine eligibility for asylum, based upon
 its own assessment of the political nature of the persecution an applicant may have
 suffered. In a controversial decision, the Government granted asylum to former Hai-
 tian dictator Prosper Avril, who remained in the Colombian embassy in Port au
 Prince at year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right in regular, secret ballot elections that have historically
 been considered fair and open, although critics maintain that vote buying is a regu-
 lar feature of elections in some regions. Presidential elections are held every 4
 years. The Liberal and Conservative parties have long dominated the political scene
 with one or the other customarily winning the presidency. The President serves only
 one term and may not be reelected. All citizens are enfranchised at age 18. Public
 employees are not permitted to participate in campaigns but, with the exception of
 the military, may vote. Officially, all political parties operate freely without govern-
 ment interference. Those that fail to garner 50,000 votes in a general election may
 lose the right to present candidates and may not receive funds from the Govern-
 ment. However, they may reincorporate at any time by presenting 50,000 signatures
 to the National Electoral Board.
 In 1994 the country held a national presidential election as well as congressional,
 gubernatorial, and mayoral elections. For the first time, the country also elected a
 Vice President Humberto de la Calle, who ran on the Liberal party ticket with pres-
 idential candidate Ernesto Sampr. The office of Vice President was created by the
 1991 Constitution and replaced a less powerful "presidential designate," elected by
 congress. Liberal party representatives dominated the congressional elections, pro-
 viding a Liberal majority in both houses. However, bipartisan coalitions were still
 often necessary for the Liberals to enact legislation. Throughout 1995 Samper was
 beset by allegations Lhat he knowingly received campaign contributions from drug
 traffickers.
 There are no legal restrictions, and few de facto ones, on the participation of
 women or minorities in the political process. Seven female senators and 19 female
 representatives served in Congress, including the First Vice President of the House
 of Representatives. The Ministers of Labor, Environment, and Education were
 women, as were the President's advisers for social policy, human rights, and Bogota
 issues.
 Two seats in the 102-seat Senate are reserved for representatives of the indige-
 nous population, and 2 in the 165-seat House of Representatives are reserved for
 citizens of African heritage. Both the African-Colombian and indigenous populations
 continued to expand their social and political agenda, and an indigenous politician,
 
 
 371
 Jesus Pinacue, was a vice presidential candidate on the unsuccessful ticket of the
 ADIM-19 Party in 1994. Senator Piedad Cordoba de Castro, an African-Colombian
 woman, is a senior member of the Liberal party.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups active in Colombia include the Center for Investigations and
 Popular Research, the Andean Commission of Jurists, the Intercongregational Com-
 mission for Justice and Peace, the Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights, the Episcopal Bishops Conference, the Latin American Institute for Alter-
 native Legal Services, and Peace Brigades International.
 NGO's investigated and reported on a number of human rights abuses, including
 killings by FAC and ELN forces; the paramilitary murders of 19 teachers in
 Uraba; the lack of military protection in Uraba; the paramilitary persecution of the
 Meta Civic Committee in Sabana de Torres and of the Barrancabermeja Human
 Rights Committee known as CREDHOS; the guerrilla and paramilitary campaigns
 against Hope, Peace, and Freedom in Uraba; and the government response to the
 coffee growers' strike. NGO's were nearly unanimous in their criticism of the dec-
 laration of the state of emergency. In August the NGO members of the Joint Com-
 mission on Human Rights formed in 1994 withdrew from the Commission as a pro-
 test against the state of emergency as well as President Samper's approval of an
 award for General Alvaro Velandia (see Section 1.b.).
 The Government generally did not interfere with the work of human rights
 NGO's. These NGO's were often threatened and intimidated by the guerrillas, para-
 military groups, or individual members of the police and military forces. Many
 prominent human rights monitors worked under constant fear for their physical
 safety.
 When President Samper took office in August 1994, he publicly admitted that the
 human rights situation reflected a "shameful and troubling reality." He also pledged
 to work closely with representatives of the ICRC and the Colombian Red Cross and
 declared an "open door" policy with respect to international and local human rights
 NGO's. In general, the Samper administration abided by that pledge. However, the
 relationship deteriorated over the course of the year for a number of reasons.
 Human rights observers and many community leaders believed that the Ministry of
 Defense pilot p~roject to institute rural civilian defense ooperatives legitimized vigi-
 lante justice. Despite positive steps such as the historic acknowledgmen  of govern-
 ment responsibiity in the Trujfllo massacres, a corps of government human rights
 monitors and advisers was often on the losing side in policy disputes. The resigna-
 tion of the Attrney General for Human Rights and the decoration of the general
 he had accused of human rights abuses sent a negative signal about the administra-
 tion's support for the government human rights apparatus. President Samper's dec-
 laration of the state of emergency further strainedhis administration's relationship
 with NGO's.
 On October 27, the U.N. Committee on Human Rights formally declared the Gov-
 ernment responsible for the 1987 arrest, disappearance, torture, and subsequent
 murder of Nydia Erika Bautista de Arellana. In another case, the Inter-American
 Court of Human Rights issued on December 8 a finding of government responsibility
 in the 1989 disappearances and prsumed deaths of Isidro Caballero and Maria del
 Carmen Santana. At year's end, both cases were under criminal investigation by the
 Prosecutor General's office.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 disability, language, or social status. In practice, however, many of these provisions
 are not enforced.
 The Government does not discriminate against homosexuals, although there are
 relatively few open ones among the political and business elite of the country. Unof-
 ficial, societal discrimination undeniably exists. Homosexuals are often listed as vic-
 tims of social cleansing. Those targeted by social-cleansing groups are almost exclu-
 sively involved in the sex industry.
 Women.-Rape and other acts of violence against women are pervasive in society,
 and like other crimes, are seldom prosecuted successfully. The law provides rel-
 atively mild sentences, ranging from 6 months to 8years, for crimes of sexual abuse
 and allows for significant sentence reductions based on the conduct of the convicted
 perpetrator. In most cases, the assailant is released because the law permits the
 probationary release of criminals convicted of crimes carrying minimum sentences
 of less than 2 years. The law does not penalize marital rape or other forms of mari-
 
 
 372
 tal sexual abuse. Many jurists and women's advocates called for a reform of the law.
 In May the Supreme Court ordered the arrest of a man who had ignored a restrain-
 ing order and continued to sexually assault and beat his wife. The 15-day sentence
 and fine was the first ever passed by a court for spousal abuse. The Bogota police
 reported that, of the 170 reorts of sexual abuse received between January and
 June, it could legally detain the perpetrators in only 36 cases. In those cases deten-
 tion was permitted by virtue of the fact that the crimes were committed in conjunc-
 tion with other crimes.
 The Constitution prohibits any form of discrimination against women and specifi-
 cally requires the authorities to "guarantee adequate and effective participation by
 women at decisionmaking levels of public administration." Even prior to implemen-
 tation of the 1991 Constitution, the law had provided women with extensive civil
 rights. Despite these constitutional provisions, however, discrimination against
 women persists.
 The quasi-governmental Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF) and the presidential
 advisers Office for Youth, Women, and Family Affairs reported high leveis of spous-
 al and partner abuse throughout the country. The ICBF conducted programs and
 provided refuge and counseling for victims of spousal abuse, but the level and
 amount of these services were dwarfed by the magnitude of the problem.
 According to figures published by the United Nations, women's earnings for 'ion-
 agricultural work correspond to approximately 84.7 percent of men's earnings for
 comparable work. Women constitute a high percentage of the subsistence labor work
 force, especially in rural areas. Women's groups such as Promujer and the Associa-
 tion of Twenty-first Century Women reported that the social and economic problems
 of single mothers remained great throughout the year, despite government efforts
 to provide them with training in parenting skills, reproductive rights, and birth con-
 trol.ov
 Children.-Despite significant constitutional and legislative commitments to the
 protection of the rights of children, these were only minimally implemented. The
 Constitution imposes the obligation on family, society, and the State to assist and
 protect children, to foster their development, and to assure the full exercise of these
 rights. A special Children's Code sets forth many of these rights and establishes
 services and programs designed to enforce protection of minors.
 In June the Government announced a progrm to improve opportunities for youth,
 including obligatory environmental service, the creation of clubs for adolescents, em-
 ployment for 150,000 teenagers, and subsidies for instruction and on the job train-
 ing. The Attorney General's office recommended better interagency coordination for
 child protection; better control of licensing agencies, schools, daycare centers and
 other organizations offering services to children; more vigilance on the part of gov-
 ernment agencies to ensure compliance with the Children's Code; legislation to in-
 crease awareness of children's issues; and establishment of a network for abused
 children.
 Child prostitution was commonplace in the five major cities. In May the press
 gave wide coverage to the discovery of a child pornography ring in Bogota. The pub-
 lic was outraged when the police released the perpetrators due to the laxity of the
 law. An attorney from the Attorney General's office investigating the case was as-
 sassinated in July.
 Children's rights were frequently -abused. Vigilante gangs often linked to the po-
 lice killed street children in several major cities as part of social-cleansing killings
 (see Section L.a.). Merchants and citizens' groups allegedly hire off-duty police
 agents and contract killers to rid neighborhoods of children suspected to be beggars
 and thieves; the Office of the Defender of the People reported clear complicity by
 police officers in some of these killings. In conflict zones, children were also often
 caught in crossfire between the security forces, paramilitary groups, and guerrilla
 organizations. Deadly landmines known as "leg breakers" laid by guerrillas killed
 or mutilated many children in these areas. Despite national and international con-
 demnation, guerrilla groups continued to recruit minors. A survivor of the Uraba
 massacre of September 21 reported that a boy of 10 to 12 years of age was among
 the guerrillas who killed 25 farm laborers. Children were the most vulnerable vic-
 tims of the mass displacement of rural populations. In May nine children died of
 starvation in the Valencia region of Cordoba as they attempted to escape from para-
 military violence and guerrilla engagements with the army.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution enumerates the fundamental social,
 economic, and cultural rights of the physically disabled, but serious practical im-
 pediments exist to prevent disabled persons' full participation in society. There is
 no legislation that specifically mandates access for pe with disabilities. The Con-
 stitutional Court ruled in September that physics   disaled individuals must be
 given access to and assistance at the voting stations. In August the Constitutional
 
 
 373
 Court ruled that the social security fund for public employees cannot refuse to pro-
 vide services for the disabled children of its members, regardless of the cost in-
 volved.
 Indigenous People.-There are approximately 82 distinct ethnic groups among the
 800,000 indigenous inhabitants. The Constitution gives special recognition to the
 fundamental rights of indigenous people. Under its provisions, two senatorial seats
 are reserved exclusively for indigenous representation and a special criminal and
 civil jurisdiction, basedupon traditional community laws, functions within Indian
 territories. The Ministry of Interior, through the Office of Indigenous Affairs, is re-
 sponsible for protecting the territorial, cultural, and self-determination rights of In-
 dians. Ministry representatives are located in all regions of the country with indige-
 nous populations and work with other governmental human and civil rights organi-
 zations to promote Indian interests and investigate violations of indigenous rights.
 Nonetheless, members of indigenous groups suffer discrimination in the sense that
 they have traditionally been relegated to the margins of Colombian society. Few op-
 portunities exist for those who might wish to participate more fully in modern life.
 There are some 334 designated Indian reserves that are run by traditional Indian
 authority boards which handle national or local funds and are subject to fiscal con-
 trol by the national Comptroller General. These boards administer their territories
 as municipal entities, with officials locally chosen or elected according to Indian tra-
 dition. Indigenous communities are free to educate their children in traditional dia-
 lects and in the observance of cultural and religious customs. The Constitutional
 Court reaffirmed in March that indigenous men are not subject to the national mili-
 tary draft.
 Despite protective efforts by the Government, Indians were frequently the victims
 of violence throughout the year by government security forces, paramilitary groups
 (often sponsored by landowners), narcotics traffickers, and guerrillas. In zones
 where the guerrillas were active, such as the Sierra Nevada and Valle de Cauca,
 the security forces often suspected the indigenous population of complicity with nar-
 cotics traffickers and guerrillas. Most of the incidents in which Indians were at-
 tacked or threatened stemmed from land ownership disputes concerning the des-
 ignated Indian reserves. The National Land Reform Institute estimated that some
 40 indigenous communities had lost the legal title to land they claimed as their own
 and that roughly 100 other groups had title claims that were not recognized or rec-
 onciled.
 In April, 500 members of the Zenu tribe began a mass exodus from Uraba to re-
 turn to Sucre, a region they left in the 1980's in search of a better standard of liv-
 ing. Caught in the conflict among guerrilla, paramilitary, and military forces, they
 cited incidents of physical and psychological torture, abductions, arson, and other
 threats. Unidentified assassins murderedthree Zenu leaders, including reservation
 governor Jose Elias Suarez, in the first 3 months of 1995, which led to the Zenus'
 decision to leave Uraba.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Two million Colombian citizens of African
 heritage live primarily in the Pacific departments of Choco, Valle del Cauca, and
 N~larino, and alongthe Caribbean oast. They represent roughly 4 percent of the gen-
 eral population. B lacks are entitled to all onstitutional rights and protections but
 have traditionally suffered from economic discrimination. Despite the passage of the
 African-Colombian Law in 1993, little concrete progress was made in expanding
 public services and private investment in the Choco or other predominantly black
 regions. The Navy makes little effort to recruit African-Colombians, despite their
 traditional ties to the sea and maritime commerce.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law recognizes the rights of workers to organize
 unions and strike. The Labor Code provides for automatic recognition of unions that
 obtain at least 25 signatures from the potential members and comply with a simple
 registration process at the Labor Ministry. The law penalizes interference with free-
 dom of association. It allows unions to freely determine internal rules, elect officials,
 and manage activities, and forbids the dissolution of trade unions by administrative
 fiat. According to Labor Ministry estimates, only about 8 percent of the work force
 is organized. Unions are free to join international confederations without govern-
 meat restrictions.
 The 1991 Constitution provides for the right to strike by nonessential public em-
 ployees and authorizes Congress to pass enabling legislation that would define "es-
 sential." Since this has not yet been done, existing legislation which prohibits public
 employees from striking is still in force. Before staging a legal strike, unions must
 negotiate directly with management and-if no agreement results-accept medi-
 ation. By law, public employees must accept binding arbitration if mediation fails;
 
 
 374
 in practice, public service unions decide by membership vote whether or not to seek
 arbitration.
 In 1993 the International Labor Organization (ILO) criticized 10 provisions of Co-
 lombian law, including the supervision of the internal management and meetings
 of unions by government officials; the presence of officials at assemblies convened
 to vote on a strike call; the suspension of union officers who dissolve their unions;
 the requirement that contenders for trade union office must belong to the occupation
 their union represents; the prohibition of strikes in a wide range of public services
 which are not necessarily essential; various restrictions on the right to strike; the
 power of the Minister of Labor and the President to intervene in disputes through
 compulsory arbitration; and the power to dismiss trade union officers involved in an
 unlawful strike.
 Public primary and secondary school teachers went on strike for higher wages
 three times between January and late May. The Government declared the strikes
 illegal and threatened reprisals against members of the Colombian Federation of
 Educators. The strike settlement reached on May 24 allowed for a 26-percent wage
 increase, falling far short of the teachers' demands but exceeding the Government's
 18-percent limit set for other public workers. In addition, the Government agreed
 not to take disciplinary action against the striking teachers.
 The Government restructured but did not privatize the state petroleum company
 Ecopetrol in a move that allayed workers' fears of massive layoffs. In May Ecopetrol
 and the Union of Syndicated Labor (USO) signed a collective work convention for
 1995-96. The USO leadership, however, declared that it remained in open conflict
 with the Government with regard to the cases of union leaders subject to detentions
 by the Prosecutor General's office, outstanding arrest orders, and administrative in-
 vestigations by the Attorney General's office. The leadership reported further that
 USO participants in the collective bargaining with Ecopetrol had received death
 threats from presumed paramilitary groups active in the oil producing region of
 Magdalena Medio.
 Labor leaders throughout the country continued to be the target of attacks by
 guerrillas, paramilitary groups, narcotics traffickers, the military, police, and their
 own union rivals. According to figures published by Justice and Peace, during the
 first 6 months of 1995, 13 labor activists were murdered in connection with their
 labor activities. Another 2 were murdered presumably because of their labor activi-
 ties, and 16 were kidnaped, detained illegally, and threatened. In the banana-pro-
 ducing region of Uraba, organized workers historically belonged to the extreme left
 wing of the labor movement but refused to cooperate with the FARC. Over a 45-
 day period in Auk~st and Septembr, paramilitary and FARC guerrilla forces mur-
 dered some 90 civilians in Uraba. Ofthat number, approximately half may have
 been targeted for their participation in or sympathy with the National Sydicate of
 Agr-Incustry Workers, a labor union closely associated with the Hope, Peace, and
 Freedom movement of demobilized EPL guerrillas.
 The list of killings, intimidations, and arbitrary arrests of labor union leaders in-
 cludes the murders of Association Nacional de Usuarios Campesinos (ANUC) presi-
 dent William Gustavo Jaime Torres in August and ANUC director for Sucre,
 Manuel Herrera Sierra, in April; the June disappearance, torture, and murder of
 teachers' union member German Rodriguez; the attempted murder of the president
 of the Syndicate of Workers of Yumbo, Fidel Castro Murillo, in July; and the at-
 tempted murder of Jesus Tovar Durango, president of Sintraigro, the syndicate of
 agricultural workers. Numerous threats against other labor leaders were reported.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution protects the
 right of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining. Workers in larger
 firms and public services have been most successful in organizing, but these union-
 ized workers represent only a small portion of the economically active population.
 High unemployment, traditional antiunion attitudes, and weak union organization
 and leadershbip limit workers' bargaining power in the private sector and in agri-
 culture.
 The law forbids antiunion discrimination and the obstruction of free association.
 Government labor inspections theoretically enforce these provisions but, because of
 the small number of inspectors and workers' fears of losing their jobs, the inspection
 apparatus is weak. The new Labor Code increases the fines levied for restricting
 freedom of association and prohibits the use of strike breakers.
 Collective pacts, alreements between individual workers and their employers, are
 not subject to collective bargaining and are typically used by employers to obstruct
 labor organization. Although collective pacts must be registered formally with the
 Ministry of Labor, the Ministry does not exercise any oversight or control over them.
 The Labor Code also eliminates mandatory mediation in private labor-manage-
 ment disputes and extends the grace period before the Government can intervene
 
 
 in a conflict. Federations and confederations may assist affiliate unions in collective
 bargaining.
 Labor law applies to the country's seven free trade zones (FTZ's), but its stand-
 ards are difficult to enforce. Public employee unions have won collective bargaining
 agreements in the FTZ's of Barranquilla, Buenaventura, Cartagena, and Santa
 Marta, but the garment manufacturing enterprises in Medellin and Risaralda,
 which have the largest number of employees, are not organized. National labor lead-
 ers claim that in these FTZ's the provisions of the Labor Code dealing with wages,
 hours, health, and safety are not honored.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and any form of forced or compulsory labor, and this prohibition is respected in
 practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution bans the employ-
 ment of children under the age of 14 in most jobs, and the Labor Code prohibits
 the granting of work permits to youths under the age of 18. This provision is re-
 spected in larger enterprises and in major cities. Nevertheless, Colombia's extensive
 informal economy remains effectively outside government control. Some 800,000
 children between the ages of 12 and 17 work, according to Labor Ministry studies.
 These children work--often under substandard conditions--in agriculture or in the
 informal sector, as street vendors, in leather tanning, and in small family-operated
 mines. Working children are exposed to the same risks which affect adult workers,
 including exposure to toxic substances and accidental injuries, all of which contrib-
 ute to impaired physical development. In May the Government launched a media
 outreach campaign to inform child laborers of their rights and where to turn for
 help. No figures were available to measure the impact ofthis effort.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a uniform minimum
 wage for workers every January to serve as a benchmark for wage bargaining. The
 monthy    nimum wage was approximately $124 (Co$118,000). Over one-quarter
 of workers earn the minimum wage. Although consistent with the Government's
 anti-inflation policies, it fails to provide an adequate standard of living for a worker
 and family, which, by government estimates, would require two-and-one-half times
 the minimum wage.
 The law provides for a standard workday of 8 hours and a 48-hour workweek but
 does not specifically require a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, a failing criti-
 cized by the ILO. Legisation provides comprehensive protection f  or kers' occupa-
 tional safety and health, but these standards are difficult to enforce, in part due to
 the small number of Labor Ministry inspctors. In addition, unorganized workers in
 the informal sector fear that they will ose their jobs if they exercise their right to
 denounce abuses, particularly in the agricultural sector. According to the Labor
 Code, workers have the right to withdraw from a hazardous work situation without
 jeopardizing continued employment. In general, a lack of public safety awareness,
 inadequate attention by unions, and lax enforcement by the Labor Ministry result
 in an unacceptable high level of industrial accidents and unhealthy working condi-
 tions.
