 KUWAIT
 A generation ago Kuwait was an unknown town struggling for
 survival in an inhospitable climate on the edge of a barren
 land. Dependent on commerce conducted by wooden sailing
 craft, fishing, and a nearly-defunct pearl industry, the
 country was deprived of many basic human needs; tuberculosis
 and smallpox were prevalent and illiteracy extended to 90
 percent of the population. Kuwait was a conservative
 sheikdom and a British protectorate under the guidance of
 Britain's viceroy in India. For about 200 years it had been
 governed by an Amir chosen from the Al-Sabah family who
 followed the precepts of bedouin tribal consensus. Kuwait
 became fully independent in 1961. Since then, the Sabah
 Amirs have ruled upon the basis of a Constitution which
 codifies their traditional method of governing in
 consultation with other members of their family and with
 leaders of the merchant, religious, and tribal communities
 in Kuwait.
 Today Kuwait is blessed by large and easily accessible oil
 reserves, the exploitation of which begun shortly after
 World War II. Kuwait's citizens benefit from progressive
 and liberal distribution of the oil revenues in the form of
 social welfare, education, and material comforts.
 As a small and compact city-state, Kuwait also has a
 tradition of close, continuous opinion sharing. This makes
 it extremely difficult to keep a secret in Kuwait. It also
 provides all citizens with a means to ventilate their
 grievances. A traditional and still vital aspect of this
 opinion sharing is the accessibility of the Amir. Any
 citizen may approach the Amir directly with his grievance,
 should he find himself unable to achieve satisfaction
 otherwise. This form of petitioning the government is
 frequently exercised in Kuwait and the ruler places
 importance upon the daily sessions at which he is available
 for meeting the citizenry.
 Educational levels, which were abysmal a generation ago, are
 now among the best in the developing countries. More than
 80 percent of Kuwaitis below 30, who represent over three-
 fourths of the population, are literate. Numerous Kuwaitis
 go abroad for their education. A substantial number, about
 one-fourth of all Kuwaitis attending universities, take
 their education in the West, particularly in the United
 States, and are exposed to American attitudes concerning
 civil and human rights. Ample financial resources provide
 all that is necessary for basic social benefits. Kuwaiti
 law derives from traditional Islamic law as well as French-
 influenced Egyptian law. Although rushing headlong into the
 20th century socially and materially, Kuwait has sought to
 retain its Islamic tradition.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Kuwait Constitution. Kuwaitis
 are not customarily a violent people. Emerging from a long
 history as a small and neighborly society, Kuwaitis know
 their neighbors, or someone who knows their neighbors. As a
 
 (776)
 
 
 result, there is no tradition of anonymity in this society.
 What touches one, touches all. There were allegations of
 torture broadcast by Iraq three years ago, but these
 allegations appear to have been politically motivated and
 have not been substantiated by any reports available to the
 Department of State. In 1978, Amnesty International
 referred to these allegations but did not prepare a report
 on Kuwait in 1979. The arrest in September 1979, of a reputed
 Shi'ite agitator again brought forward allegations of
 torture from a few individuals, but again the Department of
 State has received no confirmation of these allegations.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Department of State has no evidence of the occurrence of
 these practices, and they are prohibited by the Constitution
 of Kuwait. It is not in the tradition of this small and
 closely knit society to abuse one's neighbors. Prison
 conditions are relatively humane. The Kuwaiti Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs affirmed to the American Embassy in a 1979
 diplomatic note that all prisoners in Kuwait receive good
 medical care and good nutrition. It has denied reports of
 maltreatment of prisoners. Consular officers who have
 visited American citizens detained or imprisoned in Kuwait
 found the conditions of the prisons to be good. Visits by
 family members are permitted and attorneys have regular
 access to prisoners.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by the
 Constitution and, with a few exceptions, are not practiced
 by the Kuwaiti Government. At times of tension with
 neighboring states, Kuwaiti authorities sometimes institute
 road blocks. These also appear during occasional periods of
 internal tension brought about by intra-Arab disputes or
 Arab-Iranian friction. Examples are: the quarrel between
 the Palestine Liberation Organization and Iraq during the
 summer of 1978, and the hostile 1979 pronoucements by
 Iranian religious authorities about the internal affairs of
 Kuwait and other Gulf states. Persons without proper
 identification are occasionally detained by the police.
 The one detention case this year that can be characterized
 as a political imprisonment involved Ahmed Al-Mihri, who was
 taken into custody by police on September 8, 1979, following
 public pronouncements that (1) he had become Ayatollah
 Khomeini's official spokesman in Kuwait, and (2) the Kuwaiti
 establishment was Sunni dominated and practiced and condoned
 discrimination against Shi'ites. Al-Mihri was immediately
 charged with having failed to give the prior notification
 necessary under law to hold a public political meeting. The
 government subsequently announced that he and his father
 were considered to have engaged in seditious activity. The
 two men, along with members of their immediate family, were
 stripped of citizenship and expelled from the country on
 September 26. The younger Al-Mihri's arrest was announced
 within 48 hours of his apprehension. The family's banishment
 was announced immediately.
 Habeas Corpus exists and is honored in practice. The law
 permits persons to be held for investigation, but prolonged
 detention must be justified to the courts, which are
 independent bodies. Once arrested, a person is authorized
 
 
 778
 immediate access to counsel. The police may hold a person
 up to four days, during which the detainee must be charged;
 thereafter, the detainee must be released or turned over to
 a public prosecutor who may authorize further detention of
 up to 21 days. Additional detention may be authorized in
 increments of fourteen days by a judge. Detention beyond
 six months may be authorized only by a full court of three
 judges.
 d.   Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait has a well-developed legal system based on Egyptian
 and European law which provides for public trial, the right
 of appeal, and representation by lawyers of choice. The
 Department of State has no evidence of in camera or unfair
 trials, nor of discrimination against defense lawyers. This
 generality, however, does not always apply to resident non-
 Kuwaitis. There have been occasions when aliens reputed to
 hold radical political views were summarily deported. In
 the summer of 1978 approximately 20 Palestinians considered
 by the Kuwaiti Government to be members of or sympathizers
 with radical Palestinian groups were deported. In 1979 an
 Iranian Imam, Ahmed Sherazi, who had been speaking openly
 against the regime, was also deported.
 Civilians are not tried in military courts.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is provided for in the Kuwaiti
 Constitution. The Department of State has no evidence of
 arbitrary invasion of the home by Kuwaiti security
 authorities. Such invasion was alleged by one former member
 of the Kuwaiti Parliament in the case of the arrest of Al-
 Mihri, but this claim has not been substantiated.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Constitution provides that the economic activities of
 the state shall be based on social justice. Kuwait's
 abundant resources permit a lavish social welfare program,
 from which all citizens benefit. The economy is capitalist,
 and to a limited extent, statist. There are immensely rich
 Kuwaitis, but few if any can be considered poor. Programs
 are designed to provide all citizens with jobs, housing,
 medical care, and education. Citizens may obtain free
 education through whatever level they are qualified. The
 1979-80 budget of $8.1 billion reflects a heavy investment
 in social services and development projects. The government
 has also instituted food subsidies, a modest public housing
 program, and nominal-cost medical care for expatriate
 workers and their families in Kuwait.
 Income is widely distributed among Kuwait's citizens.
 Private investment initiative by individual Kuwaitis is
 fostered through commercial laws which permit large
 accumulations of capital. There is only a small import duty
 (usually four percent) and virtually no taxes in force.
 Property other than natural resources is privately owned,
 and private property is inviolable under the Constitution.
 Adequate shelter is a problem only to the extent that the
 breakneck government-sponsored construction program has not
 kept pace with the rapid population growth.
 
 
 779
 Kuwait's resource and capital rich economy lacks the
 indigenous labor resources to sustain itself. Most of the
 resident expatriates who fill this need, many of whom have
 lived and worked in the country for twenty years or more,
 have no immediate prospects for enjoying the extra benefits
 of Kuwaiti citizenship such as higher government salaries,
 additional government stipends, land ownership, business
 ownership, pensions, and the right to majority interest in
 business ventures.
 There is no evidence of corruption in the administration of
 Kuwait's social service programs.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Both Kuwaiti nationals and expatriate residents are
 generally free to speak as they wish.
 Newspapers are not subject to censorship prior to
 publication, but are subject to suspension for violation of
 laws regarding political content. These laws use phrases
 such as "spread dissension" and "contradict the national
 interest" to describe the grounds for such suspensions.
 During 1979, several newspapers and periodicals were
 suspended for periods of a few days up to several weeks.
 The reasons given by the government for having to take such
 actions included: (1) attacking leading personalities of
 friendly Arab states, and (2) discussing sectarian issues in
 a manner which could create tensions in Kuwait. Editors are
 criminally liable for violating these press laws, but to
 date there have been no prosecutions. The Department of
 State believes that the frequency of restrictions on
 newspapers in 1979 has decreased in comparison with the
 previous year.
 Under the Constitution, one's religious beliefs may be
 practiced freely within the context of the public policies
 and morals of a conservative Moslem state. Proselytizing of
 Muslims by non-Muslims is not permitted. There are a number
 of Christian churches in Kuwait.
 Kuwait's Constitution protects private assembly and permits
 public meetings, processions, and gatherings that are
 peaceful and not contrary to morals. Under legislation
 adopted in 1963, a public assembly required prior
 notification. The assembly could then take place unless the
 authorities explicitly prohibited it. Now, however, under a
 new law adopted in mid-October 1979, following the Al-Mihri
 case described above, persons proposing to assemble publicly
 must obtain'explicit permission. The authorities may
 prevent such assembly merely by ignoring the request.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Kuwaitis and other residents are free to travel inside and
 outside the country and to emigrate. Since September 1977,
 the government has prohibited the participation of national
 societies, associations, and trade unions (these groups are
 all subsidized or licensed by the government) in international
 meetings without prior approval of the appropriate ministry.
 
 
 780
 There have been a few cases in recent years in which the
 Government of Kuwait has suspended the passports of
 intellectuals who have publicly criticized the government
 while abroad. Three Kuwaitis involved in unauthorized
 speech-making in the Al-Mihri affair have had their
 passports withdrawn.
 Occasionally, individuals suspected of engaging in
 particularly offensive acts have had their passports removed
 from their personal possession for varying periods of time.
 Offenses include promotion of prostitution or smuggling of
 drugs and alcoholic beverages, as well as outspoken
 criticism of the regime. In even the most notorious cases,
 the individual who has his passport collected in cases such
 as these is usually able to recover it through intercession
 with the authorities at a high level.
 Non-Kuwaitis working in the country must have the
 sponsorship of Kuwaiti citizens.
 Police roadblocks also are occasionally used to intercept
 illegal immigrants.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 By August 1976, the ruling family of Kuwait has grown
 increasingly apprehensive about Arab political divisions,
 particularly those affecting Lebanon, which threatened to
 surface in the multi-national population of this small city-
 state. The National Assembly and the local press became
 fora for quarreling Arab factions. Several moderate Arab
 regimes were under criticism in National Assembly speeches
 and newspaper columns. There was evidence that some Arab
 governments were paying for media attacks on other Arab
 governments, to the growing embarrassment of the Kuwaiti
 leadership. Kuwait's rulers apparently were concerned that
 the security of their country, in which the resident foreign
 population outnumbers native Kuwaitis, might be undermined.
 The largest segment of resident aliens is Palestinian. They
 number about 300,000 and constitute about thirty percent of
 the total population. The total native population of the
 country is only about 450,000.
 In late August 1976, the Amir suspended those parts of the
 Constitution dealing with the National Assembly. He then
 dissolved the Assembly and tightened controls on the press.
 Several newspapers and magazines were suspended for periods
 of one to three months. The government also replaced the
 leaders of certain professional societies. The Istiqlal
 Club, an opposition political discussion group, was
 disbanded in July 1977.
 There now is no popular elective process for government
 officials. The government has proclaimed its intent to
 restore representative government by August 1980. When the
 National Assembly was in existence, only adult male Kuwaiti
 citizens, not serving in the police or armed forces, were
 enfranchised.
 Since December 1978, the Kuwaiti authorities have displayed
 increasing willingness to provide for the resumption of
 parliamentary government in Kuwait. The consensus is that
 elections could occur within the four year period specified
 at the time of the suspension of Parliament in 1976, if
 regional tensions subside.
 
 
 781
 Kuwait's Constitution favors women's "domestic" role over
 their potential "public" role. Women have made remarkable
 strides in the last generation, moving from 95 percent
 illiteracy to over 65 percent literacy among young women.
 Considerable freedom from traditional restraints (costume
 and education) has been won. The momentum in favor of
 increasing women's rights has, for the time being, slowed as
 Kuwait's social mores turn perceptibly conservative. At
 present, it does not appear that this trend is causing a
 great setback to the cause of women's rights. Young Kuwaiti
 women who retain a keen perception of their social and
 political objectives are dictating the pace of change.
 The government permits the establishment of trade unions.
 The petroleum and banking sectors and government employees
 are organized. Kuwaitis, and those non-Kuwaitis resident
 for five years, are permitted to join unions, though only
 Kuwaitis may serve as union officers and vote in union
 elections. Labor union leaders are generally free to speak
 out on issues external to Kuwait, but are subject to the
 same restraints on public domestic criticism as are the rest
 of the population. The right to strike is recognized by the
 government, though strikes are discouraged.  The last
 strike, by bank workers, took place in 1976. Both wages and
 benefits in the unionized sectors of the economy are
 generous.
 Non-Kuwaitis, some of whom have been in Kuwait for more than
 a decade, comprise two-thirds of the 300,000 strong labor
 force. They are diverse and unorganized. The non-Kuwaiti
 work force can be roughly divided into those who consider
 themselves temporary  "guest workers" in Kuwait, and those,
 primarily Palestinians, who, for all intents and purposes,
 are permanent residents of Kuwait. Many of the temporary
 work force, particularly the semi or unskilled workers in
 the construction field and common laborers, remain in
 virtual itinerant conditions, although they frequently stay
 in Kuwait for considerable periods of time. In most cases
 their families remain at home and compile savings from
 remittances. In an effort to keep the Kuwaiti and non-
 Kuwaiti Arab portion of the population in relative balance,
 the government is encouraging increased reliance on contract
 workers who are recruited on short term labor contracts to
 work on specific projects. South Koreans, Indians, and
 Pakistanis, and to a lesser extent Malaysians, Bangladeshis,
 Thai, and Filipinos are coming to Kuwait in growing numbers
 under these conditions.
 Expatriate labor is found in all sectors and levels of the
 economy. Expatriate workers earn the same base pay as
 Kuwaitis, but receive considerably less in welfare benefits.
 Discontent over these differentials and other grievances,
 such as crowded and expensive housing, is balanced by the
 fact that salaries in Kuwait are much higher and living
 conditions generally better than elsewhere. Nearly one-half
 of the Kuwaiti civil service are expatriates. In general,
 the government prefers to preempt potential problems by
 granting liberal increases rather than by mass expulsions.
 Expatriate temporary workers, in Kuwait for financial
 reasons, are little interested in the Kuwaiti political
 process. Their political interests usually are related to
 events in their home countries.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International prepared no report on Kuwait in 1979.
 The Department of State has learned of no current requests
 by Al or by other non-governmental organizations to examine
 human rights in Kuwait.
