 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 The military has dominated the key sectors of government in
 the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) since the 1962 revolution which
 toppled the theocratic Imamate. The central Government in
 Sanaa continues to expand its authority to all parts of the
 country, but tribal leaders in isolated areas are reluctant to
 surrender their traditional prerogatives, such as tax
 collecting and mediating disputes. Tribal conflicts and blood
 feuds occasionally spill into the major cities, and tribesmen
 in rural areas often carry automatic weapons.
 Colonel Ali Abdallah Salih has been president since 1978, when
 his two immediate predecessors were assassinated within 8
 months of each other. He was elected to a third 5-year term
 in July by the new Consultative Assembly, which has specific
 but limited oversight powers. President Salih sets government
 policy and relies on technocrats to administer the Government
 and the military and security services to keep him in power.
 Internal security is largely maintained by an active National
 Security Organization (NSO), whose agents have broad
 discretion, especially when national security matters are
 believed to be involved, to detain citizens for questioning,
 search their homes, and monitor their activities, telephone
 conversations, and correspondence.
 The YAR is a poor country with 9 million people and a
 rudimentary physical and social infrastructure. Oil revenue
 in 1988 was expected, at best, to compensate for the drastic
 decline in the remittances received from YAR nationals working
 abroad, a decline which began in 1983. Import controls,
 imposed in 1986, have been somewhat relaxed. The economy is
 basically a free market economy, although the Government
 controls a wide array of prices, especially in the cities.
 Currency controls are being relaxed gradually as oil revenues
 increase. The small size of proven oil reserves makes rapid
 development as experienced in the Gulf countries unlikely.
 There was no basic change in the human rights situation in
 1988. Civil liberties remained significantly restricted, and
 the Government continued to exercise a large measure of
 control over political life. The new Consultative Assembly,
 elected in generally free elections in July, allowed increased
 popular participation in government. Some 40 alleged
 saboteurs arrested by the Government in 1987 were not publicly
 tried during the year, as was promised at the time of their
 arrest. There is informal and some institutionalized
 discrimination against Yemeni citizens with a non-Yemeni
 parent.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no confirmed reports that government forces
 executed individuals for political reasons. According to a
 foreign press report and the underground leftist opposition
 group, the National Democratic Front (NDF), supported by the
 People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), an aspiring
 candidate for the Consultative Assembly was killed by rivals
 in May; the NDF claimed the Government was responsible for the
 killing.
 
 
 1537
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 In a covertly circulated pamphlet, the NDF also accused the
 Government of having killed 250 NDF followers since 1982,
 including 3 members of the military, shot in Sanaa in December
 1987, who were allegedly associated with the NDF. A tribal
 leader reportedly involved in a 1987 antigovernment plot was
 killed in May in a well-executed ambush; some Yemenis believe
 that the Government exploited tribal tensions to engineer or
 abet the killing.
 b. Disappearance
 Occasionally Yemenis "disappear" as a result of being detained
 secretly by NSO officials. Most of these detainees are
 eventually released.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution, the National Charter, and Yemeni law
 proscribe physical torture. However, security officials
 reportedly resort with impunity to force or the threat of
 force to extract information from detainees. Most informed
 Yemenis believe that the NSO engages in torture on occasion.
 The Yemeni legal code is based on Islamic Shari'a law, which
 calls for such punishments as stoning for adultery; however,
 these penalties are rarely imposed. Prison conditions have
 improved in recent years, especially provisions for medical
 care, although some prisoners, including children, are
 reportedly kept manacled for protracted periods of time.
 Amnesty International (AI), in its 1988 Report covering 1987,
 said that in some cases prisoners' hands had been chained to
 their necks and ankles, and it expressed concern that this
 practice, which is contrary to U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for
 the Treatment of Prisoners, could lead to injuries.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were continuing reports of arbitrary arrests. Detainees
 were held without charge for extended periods despite
 constitutional limits on the time police may hold a suspect
 without judicial concurrence. About 40 alleged saboteurs
 arrested in 1987 have yet to come to trial; the Interior
 Minister publicly stated in December 1987 that there would be
 no trial until the police investigation had ended. No
 information is available as to when such a trial might take
 place. Established procedures which provide for the
 notification of relatives and lawyers by prisoners are not
 always observed. When foreigners are arrested, consular
 notification is late or nonexistent.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are three principal court systems: Sharila, commercial,
 and state security. The Shari'a (Islamic) courts have
 jurisdiction in all cases outside the domain of the other two,
 although there is some overlap in commercial law cases.
 The Shari'a courts, viewed within their traditional Islamic
 context, appear to be fair and impartial. If the defendant is
 taken to trial, he is informed of the charges against him at
 the conclusion of the police investigation. The judge
 actively questions witnesses. Attorneys are allowed to
 
 
 1538
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 counsel their clients, but are not permitted to address the
 court or examine witnesses. Litigants in commercial courts
 can generally expect a fair and open trial with legal counsel,
 although tribal ties and bribery are said to play a role in
 some judicial proceedings. The Shari'a and commercial courts
 are largely independent of the executive, but all decisions,
 as in the state security courts, are subject to presidential
 review and confirmation. The state security courts are
 convened by the President to try specific cases of, espionage
 or other antigovernment activity. Rights normally afforded
 the accused may be suspended in security cases. The state
 security courts are not known to have convened in 1988.
 The number of political prisoners is difficult to estimate,
 but there are probably fewer than 80 long-term detainees.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 National security forces have an open mandate to search homes,
 monitor telephones, read personal mail, and otherwise intrude
 into private matters when national security is believed to be
 involved. Automobiles are routinely stopped and searched and
 the identification of the occupants demanded at intersection
 checkpoints throughout the country, especially at night.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Restrictions exist on free speech but are largely confined to
 the urban areas because of the Government's limited control in
 the countryside. Some Yemenis believe that they may experience
 difficulty if they are overheard criticizing the Government by
 national security agents. The Information Ministry owns and
 operates the radio and television stations, as well as the
 major newspapers. The few privately owned (nondaily)
 newspapers do not voice views contrary to the Government's,
 nor are they permitted to criticize government policies or
 personalities. Complaints about government bureaucracy and
 the implementation of government policy (e.g., import and
 foreign exchange controls and social services) are permitted.
 The Government removes articles from Yemneni publications which
 its censors deem inappropriate. There is also considerable
 self-censorship. The weekly newspaper published by Muslim
 fundamentalists is the only paper to report on Afghanistan and
 enjoys more independence than most publications.
 Several foreign publications, including English-language
 newspapers and magazines, are available in the cities, but
 those containing material deemed offensive are withheld from
 distribution. In the past, the Government has suspended
 publishing licenses for extended periods to punish independent
 publishers.
 Self-censorship is also practiced at Sanaa University, whose
 professors and senior administrators must receive NSO
 clearance before being hired. Most professors, including the
 many expatriates, do not complain about government
 interference in their courses or curriculum development.
 Student organizations independent of the Government are not
 permitted.

 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although ostensibly legal, demonstrations are very rare, and
 the few which have occurred were mostly organized by the
 Government. Because political parties are illegal, the
 Government's view is that there can be no antigovernment
 rallies or demonstrations. Some activist Muslim clergymen,
 however, preach politics, local and international, under the
 pretext of delivering a sermon after Friday prayers.
 Registered organizations, such as professional groups, are
 allowed to invite outside speakers to lecture on their
 official premises so long as the speech does not conflict with
 government policies.
 Contact between Yemenis and foreigners is closely monitored by
 the NSO. All government ministries and major organizations
 have NSO representatives on their staffs. Invitations and
 requests for appointments from diplomats to senior government
 officials must be sent through the Foreign Ministry, and
 Yemeni visitors to foreign embassies are questioned by NSO
 gate guards. The overall effect is to discourage contact
 between Yemenis and foreigners, although nondiplomatic
 personnel--for example, officials working on aid projects--
 generally enjoy good access to their Yemeni colleagues.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the state religion and is professed by virtually all
 Yemenis. Members of the Zaydi (Shi'a) sect have historically
 enjoyed greater political influence than those of the Shafi'i
 (Sunni) sect, although this distinction is often more
 geographical and tribal than sectarian. The two Islamic
 communities coexist with little friction and have fewer
 doctrinal differences than do the Shi'a and Sunni communities
 in some neighboring countries. Islamic associations with ties
 to pan-Islamic organizations enjoy a degree of freedom,
 including the right to operate schools largely independent of
 the national school system. Radical fundamentalism is not a
 major force in the YAR, although the influential and
 well-organized Muslim Brotherhood campaigns for the respect of
 traditional Yemeni values.
 Civil servants swear an oath to Allah, and Consultative
 Assembly members must, according to the electoral law, be
 "good" Muslims. In practice, the "good" Muslim rule is not
 applied except to leftist Yemenis whom the Government wants
 excluded on political grounds. A willingness to swear the
 oath to Allah (and to the Yemeni nation and revolution)
 normally suffices. Although the Constitution does not
 explicitly refer to equal rights for non-Muslims, it does
 say: "The State has no right to impose distinctions in human
 rights due to religion or color or sex or language or natural
 origin or profession." The prison code, in this spirit,
 guarantees freedom of religious practice in prisons.
 Almost all of the once substantial Yemeni Jewish population
 has emigrated to Israel, but a small number--l,000 or
 fewer--remains, mostly in rural areas in the north of the
 country. There are no synagogues, but Jews are permitted to
 practice their religion, including religious instruction, in
 private homes. The Government makes a point of ensuring that
 
 
 1540
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 no impediment to this right exists. Jews usually live in
 relative harmony with their Muslim neighbors. There were no
 reports in 1988 of incidents involving government-inspired or
 condoned harassment, although violent incidents do occur
 periodically, especially in the countryside.  Jews in tribal
 areas are disadvantaged in that they cannot rely on the threat
 of tribal retribution to deter attacks. While there have been
 reports that Yemeni Jews are unfairly treated, persecuted, and
 eager to emigrate to Israel, there has been no confirmation of
 discriminatory actions directed against Yemeni Jews.
 In 1988 a foreign Jew of Yemeni descent was twice arrested and
 eventually deported for attempting to contact Yemeni
 relatives. He later stated to a compatriot that, save for one
 kick in the shins, he was neither abused nor mistreated during
 his 5 days of captivity.
 There are no indigenous Christian Yemenis. Foreign
 Christians, like Jews, are permitted to conduct private
 services, but churches are not allowed. Foreign clergy are
 not allowed to proselytize, but some teach or work in social
 services. Public celebration of non-Islamic religious
 holidays is discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Many Yemenis historically have sought employment abroad. The
 Government does not restrict emigration, partly in recognition
 of the importance to the economy of foreign remittances.
 Procedures for obtaining passports and the necessary exit
 visas are sometimes onerous, especially for Yemeni men who
 have not completed their military service. Political
 dissidents have occasionally gone into self-imposed exile or
 accepted government positions overseas to escape possible
 problems at home. There are no internal travel restrictions
 for Yemenis, although numerous checkpoints exist on major
 roads.
 The YAR and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY)
 agreed in May to permit citizens of each country to enter the
 other by presenting only their national identity card. For
 the first time in the history of the acrimonious YAR-PDRY
 relationship, the border between the two countries is
 basically open to Yemenis. Many PDRY citizens have taken
 advantage of this accord to visit relatives in the YAR; the
 traffic from north to south is comparatively light. Many of
 the tens of thousands of PDRY citizens who came north in the
 first 3 months of the accord are not expected to return home;
 they will join the approximately 60,000 southerners who have
 fled to the north since the 1986 coup in Aden.
 There are about 850 Eritrean refugees from Ethiopia at a camp
 near the coastal town of Al-Khawka. Several thousand more are
 scattered throughout the country. The Government closely
 monitors all political activity by the PDRY and Eritrean
 refugees. Many of the Palestinians who arrived from Lebanon
 in 1982-83 have left; the remainder live in a camp near Sanaa
 and are closely watched by the NSO. The movement and activity
 of the Palestinians is restricted. Palestinians have not
 assimilated into Yemeni society largely due to the
 conservative tribal nature of the society.

 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political parties are banned, and in practice citizens are
 unable peacefully to change the Government. There were
 contested seats during the July Consultative Assembly
 elections, but candidates were not allowed openly to oppose
 the President or the National Charter. The President has the
 final word on all key decisions, appoints ministers, and
 chooses directly or indirectly the members of various
 consultative bodies. In principle, the Consultative Assembly
 could have accepted President Salih's resignation in July and
 chosen to elect someone else as president. In practice there
 was little, if any, likelihood that this would happen.
 The Consultative Assembly, 128 of whose 159 members were
 elected (31 were appointed by President Salih), has the power
 to ratify government legislation and appointments and to give
 or deny its confidence to the. Prime Minister and. the Cabinet.
 In the 6 months since it was elected, the Assembly has
 asserted its prerogatives by having the Government amend its
 basic program to restrict acceptance of foreign loans,
 prohibit tax increases, and specify a number of development
 projects. As the year ended, Assembly members were subjecting
 the Government's proposed budget figures to intense scrutiny
 and questioning. The Consultative Assembly replaces the
 previous presidentially appointed Constituent Assembly.
 Although the Government maintains that no political opposition
 groups exist in the YAR, and that everyone supports the
 National Charter, there are distinct groupings in the
 Assembly: rightists, leftists, government supporters,
 traditional tribesmen, technocrats, and Muslim
 traditionalists. Their political agenda overlap but are not
 identical. Some women hold positions in government and the
 General People's Congress (GPC), but none is in the
 Consultative Assembly. Campaigning in 1988 took the form of
 pamphlets, posters, and rallies; criticism of rival candidates
 was not permitted. The actual polling was orderly, and vote
 counting, by all accounts, was basically honest.
 The GPC, created by President Salih in 1982, meets every 2
 years and has 18,000 members, one third presidentially
 appointed and the remainder elected (most recently in 1986)
 from presidentially-approved lists. The GPC's executive
 organ, the 75-member Permanent Committee, meets frequently to
 discuss current policy issues. At the summit of the GPC's
 elaborate structure is the General Committee, whose 11 members
 include the President, the Prime Minister, the Consultative
 Assembly President, and 8 other leading members of the Yemeni
 political establishment. The General Committee, whose members
 are drawn from the Permanent Committee, is supposed to give
 formal policy guidance to the Prime Minister and his Cabinet.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit organized groups, international
 or nongovernmental, to investigate local cases of possible
 human rights violations in the YAR.
 
 
 1542
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There have been unconfirmed reports that the country's small
 Jewish population is subject to discrimination. The
 Government makes consistent efforts to protect the largely
 rural, isolated Jewish community, both at the local level and,
 when necessary, through the intervention of senior officials
 in Sanaa. Still, government control over areas where the Jews
 live is by no means complete, and disputes must often be
 resolved within the framework of the existing tribal structure.
 A substantial number of Yemeni citizens with a non-Yemeni
 parent do not appear to enjoy the full range of their
 constitutional rights. These people, known as Muwallidin,
 face both institutionalized and informal discrimination.
 Government-operated Sanaa University, for example, advertises
 openings for teaching and-senior administrative positions with
 the stipulation that both parents of applicants be Yemeni
 citizens. The same is true for applicants to the YAR's
 military academy. The two-Yemeni parent rule is not strictly
 enforced at Sanaa University, however.
 Discrimination against Muwallidin is not universal or
 pervasive. Many senior government officials and at least one
 minister are Muwallidin. There is no information that
 Muwallidin are arbitrarily arrested or imprisoned, and there
 are no known special travel restrictions against them.
 Restrictions on women are largely imposed by culture rather
 than law. In May, for example, the Government ratified a 1981
 International Labor Organization (ILO) agreement mandating
 equality of opportunity and treatment in the workplace for men
 and women. The Government publicly opposed the efforts of
 some conservative tribal leaders and Muslim traditionalists to
 prevent women from registering to vote in the July elections;
 government media reiterated the constitutional right of women
 to participate in the elections. On the other hand, five
 women who applied to the electoral commission for certification
 as candidates were pressured by the Government to withdraw
 their applications to appease Muslim traditionalists.
 Women can now be found in the midlevels of several ministries
 and also work in banks and other businesses. Yemen's largest
 factory group employs women at the same pay scale as men, and
 women there have risen through the ranks to lower management
 positions. This same group, however, has a policy of only
 employing single or divorced women; in principle, the group
 would accept a written statement of nonobjection from the
 husband of a married woman, but reportedly none has ever been
 presented.
 Societal pressures often force women to defer to the guidance
 of male colleagues and the general supervision of male
 relatives. Women seeking exit visas are frequently asked to
 demonstrate that male relatives pose no objection to their
 travel. Education for women in significant numbers began only
 at the end of the civil war in 1970. The literacy rate for
 women is approximately 2 percent, but the Government is trying
 to expand their educationar opportunities, including at the
 university level where about 20 percent of the students are
 female. However, staffing shortages and other problems
 continue to hinder the development of education in general.
 
 
 1543
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 Societal pressures, especially in the rural areas, as well as
 the demand for their labor, frequently limit the opportunities
 of women for education.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the YAR Labor Code, a union may be set up by 10 or more
 workers upon application to and approval by the government
 authorities. The Labor Code prescribes a single union system
 with one union committee per enterprise, one union branch per
 locality, one general union per economic sector, and one
 national umbrella organization, which is the Yemeni Trade
 Union Cofnfederation. Government employees and some categories
 of farm workers are excluded from union membership. According
 to the Labor Code, unions are prohibited from engaging in any
 political activity and their financial records are subject to
 government oversight. Trade unions are reported to be under
 heavy NSO influence and have not been known to challenge the
 Government.
 Labor-related legislation neither allows nor disallows strikes
 but union-sanctioned strikes do not occur. Wildcat strikes
 have occurred occasionally. There have been no reports of
 government or employer harassment of wildcat strikers or their
 leaders and no prosecutions. Oil tanker drivers struck for 2
 weeks in September for higher transport fees and, largely due
 to the political influence of the truck owners, won a
 compromise increase. The drivers do not belong to the
 established truckers' union and reportedly were discouraged
 from forming one of their own.
 The Yemeni Trade Union Confederation is affiliated to the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and to the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions. The
 YAR is a member of the ILO and the labor confederation
 participates in its meetings. The YAR ratified ILO Convention
 87 on Freedom of Association and Convention 98 on Collective
 Bargaining in 1976.
 In 1987 the ILO Committee of Experts found that the conditions
 imposed on unions by the Labor Code conflicted with the
 provisions of ILO Convention 87 calling for workers to have
 the possibility of establishing organizations of their own
 choosing. Other shortcomings were noted in the Labor Code as
 well regarding freedom of association and the right to bargain
 collectively.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although the YAR Labor Code calls on employers to treat
 workers correctly, it does not contain provisions to ensure
 worker protection against acts of discrimination by employers,
 nor does it provide a legal framework for a free collective
 bargaining system. There is no bargaining and there are no
 collective agreements in force. There is no export processing
 zone in the YAR.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There are no reports of forced or compulsory labor in the YAR.
 
 
 1544
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no minimum age for employment, but compulsory
 education requirements sometimes have the same effect. In
 general, however, these requirements are ignored. Child
 labor, sanctioned by family custom, is common.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Labor
 The rights of workers are enunciated by law, but labor
 regulations are virtually unenforceable. Hiring often depends
 on family and tribal connections, and there is no minimum
 wage. The prevailing daily wage for unskilled workers is
 about $10. YAR legal codes prescribe a maximum 8-hour workday
 (6 during Ramadan), but many factories operate 10- or 12-hour
 shifts.
 Local production is largely based on agriculture and cottage
 industries. While working conditions are sometimes harsh,
 consistent with the prevailing subsistence economy, the
 Government has set general safety requirements for larger
 concerns and occasionally checks to see if they are being
 observed.
