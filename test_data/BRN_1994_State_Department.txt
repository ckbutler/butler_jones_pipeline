 BRUNET
 Brunei Darussalam, a small, wealthy monarchy located on the north coast of Bor-
 neo, is a sultanate ruled by the same family for 600 years.
 The 1959 Constitution provided for the first delegation of poltical power by
 former Sultan mar Al Saifuddin to an appointed council of state, but in 1962 the
 Sultan invoked an article of the Constitution that allowed him to assume emergency
 powers for 2 years. These powers have been reguarly renewed, most recently in
 September by the current Sultan, Althouh not aof the articles of the Constitution
 are suspended, the state of emergency places few limits on the Sultan's power. He
 also serves as Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, dean of the national university,
 and chief religinous leader.
 The police fore, which has responsibility for internal security, reports to the
 Prime Minister's office and is firmly under the control of civil authorities.
 Brunei's large oil and natural gas reserves, coupled with its small population, give
 it one of the world's highest per capita gross national products.

 Human rights in Brunei remain broadly circumscribed. In practice, citizens do not
 have the right to change their government and they generally eschew political activ-
 ity of any kind, knowing that the Government and ruler will disapprove such activ-
 ity and may punish them. Nor, constitutional provisions notwithstanding, do they
 genuinely exercise the freedoms of speech, press, and association. Other human
 rights abuses, including discrimination against women and restriction of religious
 freedom, continued in 1994.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Incudfng Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Rllling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The media occasionally report on allegations of police mistreatment of prisoners, but
 these reports cannot be verified. In 1988 caning became mandatory punishment for
 42 criminal and drug-related offenses and for vandalism. Since then, sentences of
 whipping have been handed down and carried out in the presence of a doctor who
 monitors implementation and has the authority to interrupt and postpone the pun-
 ishment for medical reasons. Reportedly, as many as 50 offenders per year are
 caned.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-While the law provides for a prompt judi-
 cial determination of the validity of an arrest detention, those provisions, like the
 Constitution itself may be superseded, either partially or wholly, through invocation
 of the emergency powers. Moreover, the Internal Security Act (ISA) permits the
 Government to detain suspects without trial for renewable 2-year periods. The Gov-
 ernment occasionally   has  used   the  ISA  to  detain  persons   suspected  of
 antigovernment activity, but apparently did not do so in 1994.
 Police officers have broad powers to make arrests without warrants. However,
 under normal circumstances, a magistrate must endorse a warrant for arrest. War-
 rants are issued without this endorsement on rare occasions, such as when police
 are unable to obtain the endorsement in time to prevent the flight of a suspect.
 A person detained under the ISA was released-in April following his pledge of loy-
 alty to the Sultan.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Bruneian udicial system consists of five lev-
 els of courts, with final recourse available throu the Privy Council in London. Pro-
 cedural safeguards include the right to defense counsel, the right to an interpreter,
 the right to a speedy trial, and the right to confront accusers. There were no known
 instances of government interference with the judiciary in 1994 and no trials of po-
 litical opponents.
 A few political prisoners, probably "returnees" (individuals who participated in the
 1962 rebellion, fled the country, and subsequently returned), are still in prison be-
 cause of their role in the rebellion and their alleged refusal to renounce violence and
 pledge loyalty to the Sultan.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the law permits government intrusion into the privacy of individual persons,
 fsi ies, or homes, this rarely happens. There are sporadic reports of mail having
 been opened prior to delivery.  I
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While no law restricts freedom of speech and
 freedom of the press, the Government frequently censored international newspapers
 and periodicals by removing or blacking out articles or photographs found toe ob-
 jectionable, particularly those potentially embarrassing to Brunei's royal family,
 critical of the Government or the Sultan, or those judged sexually or morally im-
 proper by censors. The University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD) dismissed an expa-
 triate professor in 1994 for writing articles which Brneian officials deemed obec-
 tionabre. However, the growing use of facsimile machines and access to satellite
 transmissions make it increasingly difficult to keep such material from entering
 Bruni. The independently owned local newspaper practices self-censorship by
 avoiding issues it knows the Government would object to.
 The only television station is government owned. It receives two Malaysian tele-
 vision channels and several channels of a Hong Kog-based network, including the
 Cable News Network and the British Broadcasting Corporation news programs,
 which it rebroadcasts locally on the UHF band. Because of the almost total absence
 of criticism or opposing views, the Government's tolerance of political criticism has
 not been effectively tested recently. In the past it has not hesitated to arrest on na-
 
 
 537
 tional security grounds those who attempted to propagate unwelcome political
 views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom to assemble for politi-
 cal purposes also has not been seriously tested in recent years. Following the 1967
 ban on political parties, the Government allowed two parties to form in 1985 and
 1986. The Government severely restricted membership in both parties, disbanding
 one of them in 1988. The other political party, the Brunei National Solidarity Party,
 lingers on with a few dozen members.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution states, The religion of Brunei
 Darussalam shall be the Muslim religion according to the Shafeite sect of that reli-
 gion: provided that all other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony by
 the person professing them in any part of Brunei Danssalam." In 1991 the Govern-
 ment began to reinforce the legitimacy of the he reditay monarchy and the observ-
 _ane of traditional Brneian and Muslim values by reasserting a national ideology
 known as the Malaya Islam Beraja (MB) or "Malay Muslim monarhy," the genesis
 of which reportedly dates back to the 15th centuiy.
 The resulting Islamization of Brneian society has created a variety of impedi-
 ments to the full and unconstrained exercise of religious freedom called for in the
 Constitution and in the 1993 Kuala Lumpur Declaration. The Government in 1993
 participated in issuing the Kuala Lumpur Declaration, which confirms the right of
 all persons to a wide range of human rights, including freedom of religion. Despite
 this, and constitutional provisions, the Government routinely restricts the practice
 of non-Muslim religions by: prohibiting proselytizing; occasionally denying entry to
 foreign clergy or particular priests, bishops, or ministers; banning the importation
 of religious teaching materials or scriptures such as the Bible; and refusing permis-
 sion to expand, repair, or build new churches, temples, and shrines.
 The Ministry of Education has also restricted the teaching of the history of reli-
 *on or other courses in religion in non-Islamic schools while requiring courses on
 clam or the MIB in all schools. Only the International School, which Bruneian citi-
 zens or permanent residents generally are not permitted to attend, is exempted
 from these restrictions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government restricts the movement of former political prisoners
 during the first year of their release. Otherwise, it generally does not restrict free-
 dom of movement for most citizens, permanent residents, and other foreigners. The
 Government places some contractual restrictions on foreign travel for certain expa-
 triate employees, but this is limited to the first year of the contract. Although
 Brunei has not been willing to accept asylum seekers, it has agreed in principle
 and subject to certain reservations, to the Comprehensive Plan of Action adopted
 by the 1989 International Conference on Indochinese Refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Bruneian citizens are unable to change their government through established
 democratic processes. Under the continuing state of emergency, there is no par-
 liament, and political authority and control rests in the hands of the ruling mon-
 arch. Individual citizens may seek to express their views or influence government
 decisions and policies by petitioning the Sultan or handing him letters when he ap-
 pears in public.
 The only form of popular representation lies in a traditional system of village
 chiefs who, since 1992, are elected by secret ballot by all adults. These leaders com-
 municate constitutents' wishes through a variety of channels, including periodic
 meetings, chaired by the Home Affairs Minister, with several officials appointed by
 the Sultan.
 Substantial numbers of women serve at the junior and middle levels of Brunei's
 large government bureaucracy. Nevertheless, at higher levels of the bureaucracy a
 clear pattern of discrimination exists. Since independence, no woman has been ap-
 pointed to head a ministry, and women continue to be passed over despite the fact
 that there are by now a number of well-qualified candidates for promotion to posi-
 tions at permanent secretary and deputy minister levels. A woman now serves as
 an intermediate court judge, the highest judicial position held by Biruneians.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations in Brunei that deal specifically
 with the protection of human rights. Given the tight restrictions on freedom of
 speech and press and the Government's unwillingness to tolerate criticism, any
 group or individual attempting to investigate and report publicly on human rights
 
 
 538
 issues would face severe constraints. There were no known allegations of abuses or
 requests to visit by international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-In accordance with Koranic precepts, women in Brunei are denied equal
 status with men in a number of important areas, such as divorce, inheritance, and
 custody of children. Under the Brunei Nationality Act, citizenship is passed on
 thmugh males only. Female citizens of Brunei who are married to foreigners or bear
 children by foreign fathers cannot pass on Bruneian citizenship to their children,
 even when such children are born in Brunei. This has resulted m creation of a siz-
 able population of stateless children, estimated at more than 5,000 residents, who
 are entitled to live in Brunei and be documented for travel by the Government, but
 who cannot enjoy the full privileges of citizenship, including the right to own land.
 Although men are eligible for permanent positions in government service whether
 or not they hold university degrees, women who do not have university degrees are
 eligible to hold government positions only on a month-to-month basis. While recent
 changes eliminated some previous inequities, women in month-to-month positions
 continue to receive slightly less annual-leave and fewer allowances than their male
 and female counterparts in permanent positions.
 Religious authorities strongly encourage Brunei Muslim women to wear the
 tudong, a traditional head covering, and many women do so. Some Muslim women
 do not, however and there is no official pressure on non-Muslim women to do so.
 All female students in government-operated schools are required to wear the
 tudong, however, while students in nongovernment schools are officially encouraged
 to wear it.
 The extent to which spousal abuse may occur and go unreported is not known.
 However, in response to a growing perception that domestic violence is a serious
 problem, the police established a special unit to investigate allegations of spousal
 abuse in October. Approximately 20 cases of domestic abuse were reported to plice
 in the first half ofU1994. The Government has established a shelter for aused
 women, and reportedly there were three residents there in 1994.
 The criminal penalty for a minor domestic assault is 1 to 2 weeks in jail and a
 fine. An assault resulting in serious injury would be punished by caning and a
 longer jail sentence. One area of apparent abuse involves female domestic servants.
 While the level of violence in Bruneian society is low, there is less taboo about the
 beating of servants-or refusing them the right to leave the house on days off, some-
 times on grounds that they "might encounter the wrong company." Since most fe-
 male domestics are foreign workers who are highly dependent on their employers,
 those subject to abuse may be unwilling or unable to bring complaints, either to
 Bruneian authorities or to their governments' embassies in Brunei. When such com-
 plaints are brought, however, the Government is generally quick to investigate alle-
 gations of abuse and impose fines and punishment as warranted.
 There are no separate pay scales for men and women and in recent years there
 has been a major influx of women into the work force. women serve in a wide vari-
 ety of capacities in Brunei's armed forces, although they may not serve in combat.
 The number of female university graduates is increasing, and nearly two-thirds of
 UBD's entering class is female.
 Children.-There are no published statistics regarding the welfare of children.
 The strong commitment to family values within society, the high standard of living
 and government funding for children's welfare provides most children a healthy and
 nurturing environment. With a few exceptions involving small villages in extremely
 remote areas, nutritional standards are high and poverty is almost unknown. In-
 stances of child abuse appear low, and child prostitution seems to be nonexistent.
 Indigenous People.-The 6 percent of Brunei's population that is composed of in-
 digenous peoples has long been integrated into Bruneian society, and enjoys the
 same rights as other citizens.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Some members of non-Malay minorities,
 such as ethnic Chinese, including those born and raised in Brunei, are not automati-
 cally accorded citizenship and must travel abroad as stateless persons.
 People With Disabilities.-While no legislation mandates accessibility or other as-
 sistance to disabled persons, they are well integrated into Brunei society and the
 workplace, due mainly to past and ongoing efforts of the Government and associa-
 tions to raise public consciousness.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions are legal in Brunei but must be reg-
 istered with the Government. There are three generally inactive registered trade
 
 
 539
 unions, all of them in the oil sector, with a total membership amounting to less than
 5 percent of that industry's work force. All workers, including civil servants other
 than those serving in the military and police, ma form or join trade unions. Unions
 are independent of the Government. The Trade Unions Act of 1962 permits the for-
 mation of trade union federations in Brunei but forbids affiliation with labor organi-
 zations outside BruneL An individual contract is required between an employer and
 each employee, but legal trade union activities cannot be deemed to violate em-
 ployee contracts. Local legal experts interpret this provision as conferring the right
 to strike, but there have been no strikes. Brunei is not a member of the Inter-
 national Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Government has not pre-
 vented the legal registration of trade unions, nor has it dissolved any. The Govern-
 ment did not interfere with lawful union activity. It is illegal to refuse employment
 or discriminate against an employee on the basis of membership or nonmeibership
 in a trade union. While unions are legal and easy to register, conditions in Brunei
 are not conducive to the development of trade unions. There is little interest on the
 p art of workers in forming trade unions, and existing unions are not very active.
 Brnei law is silent on collective bargaining, and it occurs in only a few industries.
 There are few industries of the kind in which unions have traditionally developed.
 Also, cultural tradition favors consensus over confrontation. Wage and benefit pack-
 ages are based on market conditions and tend to be generous.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Chapter XI of the Labor Enact-
 ment Laws of 1954 prohibits employment of children below the age of 16. Parental
 consent and approval by the Labor Commission is required for those below the age
 of 18. Women under 18 may not work at night or on offshore oil platforms. The De.
 partment of Labor (DOL), which is a part of the Ministry of Home Affairs, effec-
 tively enforces laws on the employment of children. There were no reports of viola-
 tions of the child labor laws in 1994.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.--Skilled labor is in short supply, and market
 forces enable most citizens of Brunei to command good salaries. Brunei has no mini-
 mum wage. The standard workweek is Monday through Thursday and Saturday,
 with Friday and Sunday off, allowing for two 24-hour rest periods each week. Over-
 time is paid for work in excess of 48 hours a week, and double time is paid for work
 performed on legal holidays. Occupational health and safety standards are estab-
 lished by government regulations. The DOL inspects working conditions on a rou-
 tine basis and in response to complaints. The DOL generally enforces labor regula-
 tions effectively. However, in the unskilled labor sector enforcement is lax, espe-
 cially for foreign laborers. The DOL is empowered to close any workplace where
 health, safety, or working conditions are unsatisfactory, and it has done so in the
 past.
