DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional, multi-party
 democracy with an elected president and vice president, an
 elected bicameral legislature, and an independent judiciary
 whose members are appointed by the Senate and headed by a
 Supreme Court. President Salvador Jorge Blanco began a four-
 year term in August 1982, after winning free and fair
 elections held in May. President Jorge has promised to
 promote broader civil and political rights in the tradition
 of his predecessor, Antonio Guzman Fernandez. The Guzman
 administration (1978-1982) achieved significant advances in
 this area. Unfortunately it had less success in improving
 the economic and physical well-being of the populace in the
 face of a world economic crisis which brought the prices of
 most Dominican exports to relative lows and sorely tried both
 the private and the extensive public sector of the nation's
 economy.
 The Dominican Republic has gone through periods of harsh
 tyranny with only occasional interludes of political freedom
 since gaining independence from Haiti in 1844. Although the
 founders of the Dominican Republic set high standards for
 democratic practice and respect for civil liberties, these
 values were systematically violated by many of their
 successors, particularly during the thirty-year dictatorship
 of Rafael Trujillo (1930-61). After Trujillo's assassination
 in 1961, successive Governments began to respect basic human
 rights and the traditions of democracy gained in strength.
 The peaceful transfer of power in 1978, the first to occur
 from one elected Government to another, was a landmark in
 this process of democratization, which was further enforced
 by the holding of free and fair elections in 1982 and another
 peaceful transfer of power. Although the death of President
 Antonio Guzman 40 days before the end of his term was
 potentially destabilizing, all democratic elements, together
 with the armed forces and the Dominican people as a whole
 rallied behind the new president, Guzman's Vice President,
 Jacobo Majluta, and the transition of power occurred without
 incident. The election demonstrated the strength of
 Dominican democracy and the advances it has made in recent
 years.
 Dominicans now enjoy in practice the broad range of human
 rights guaranteed them under the 1966 Constitution.
 Dominicans continue to exercise fully their political rights
 through a multiplicity of parties of the left, right, and
 center. They may express their opinions and hear opinions of
 all shades expressed through the country's numerous competing
 newspapers and magazines, radio stations, and television
 networks. Integrity of the person is also respected by the
 Government. Occasional abuses of authority by the Government
 are documented by the media, and investigation and correction
 of these abuses becomes a matter of public concern. The new
 administration has appointed a special presidential advisor
 for human rights. The administration has stated that reform
 of the judicial and penal systems, which have at times been
 considered.problem areas, is a priority concern.
 The long and short term trends for human rights in the
 Dominican Republic are positive, with the expected continuing
 evolution of the democratic system. Human rights is a major
 item of concern to the Dominican people and the advances made
 in this area under the Guzman administration provided an
 effective campaign issue for his party in the May elections.

 One possible problem is found in the country's deteriorating
 economy. The Dominican economy has been buffeted by the
 world recession and has seen the prices of most of its
 principal exports (sugar, gold, coffee, cacao, bauxite,
 ferro-nickel) decline while its energy costs and the costs of
 other necessary imports of manufactured goods have risen.
 The Jorge administration has committed itself to a policy of
 economic austerity and is attempting to restrict imports and
 curtail government expenditures. There is much optimism that
 this plan, along with assistance from foreign multilateral
 and bilateral sources, will enable the basically strong
 Dominican economy to realize its potential.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Killing for political reasons has occurred only rarely in the
 Dominican Republic and reflects occasional outbursts of
 political passions at the local level. There have been a few
 deaths in election-related violence (approximately ten) in
 1982 but most seem to have been accidental in nature. There
 have also been reported deaths in robberies whose
 perpetrators have been allegedly linked to a terrorist group
 supported by Cuba.  Of concern, however, are several
 unexplained deaths of prisoners, including suspected
 terrorists, either in custody or reported shot by police
 while attempting to escape or resisting arrest. Such
 incidents are isolated, and seem to have ceased in recent
 months. They do not appear to represent government policy.
 These and other reported abuses of police authority are
 extensively reported in the Dominican press. In certain
 instances policemen and soldiers, including some officers,
 have been tried but not formally converted for such abuses of
 authority. Police and army officers have been demoted and
 administratively transferred for human rights violations.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture
 The Dominican Constitution of 1966 specifically prohibits
 torture and severe forms are not practiced. Some beatings of
 prisoners are reported, however.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment is prohibited by the Constitution. The Jorge
 administration, like its predecessor, entered office with a
 commitment to improve a poor prison system. Financial
 constraints may, however, continue to make it difficult to
 correct the unsanitary and overcrowded conditions in the
 Dominican prison system. Prisoners are not discriminated
 against within the prison system with the exception that
 prisoners with extra economic resources may supplement their
 diets and obtain better living arrangements.
 The access of prisoners and their families to the free press
 remains a major deterrent to cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment. Still, periodic reports of maltreatment of
 prisoners (mainly beatings) appear in the press and prisoners
 frequently claim, with some plausibility, that they were
 
 
 475
 physically mistreated while in custody. Senior police
 officials are aware that cases of mistreatment occur and have
 disciplined members of the police force when evidence has
 warranted. Prisoners have sometimes been held incommunicado
 without charges longer than the maximum 48 hours mandated by
 the Constitution. The newly appointed Chief of Police has
 publicly promised to adhere rigidly to the 48-hour maximum
 for holding a prisoner without a charge.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There have apparently been no allegations that any political
 prisoners are held in Dominican jails. The Guzman
 administration passed legislation in its first year in office
 which provided for the release of over 200 political
 prisoners and resulted in the return of many exiles. There
 have been some instances in which strike leaders have been
 arrested and detained for short periods. These incidents are
 fully reported in the media and have at times been the
 subject of major public outcry. The detained persons are not
 formally charged and are, in almost all cases, released
 within 48 hours as required by the constitution.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitutional guarantee of a public trial is respected,
 but the fairness and speediness of some trials have been
 subject to influence and manipulation, including allegations
 that some judges have accepted bribes. Court-appointed
 lawyers are provided free of charge for indigents. The
 defendant is generally charged shortly after arrest and the
 charges are clearly stated and made available to the
 defending counsel.   Judges are selected by the Senate.  They
 are independent of the executive branch but subject to
 removal or transfer by a majority vote in the Senate.
 (Judges are typically transferred in cases of malfeasance
 rather than removed.) Prosecuting attorneys are appointed by
 the execqtive.
 There have been major shifts in the judiciary over the past
 several months because control of the appointing body (the
 Senate) shifted in 1982 from one political party to another
 for the first time since 1966. The Jorge administration has
 proposed constitutional reforms aimed at making the judiciary
 more independent from political pressures. No special
 political or security courts exist and civilians may not be
 tried by a military court or members of the armed forces by
 civilian courts unless they are first dismissed from the
 armed forces. An appeals procedure, including appellate
 jurisdictions and a Supreme Court of Justice, exists and is
 extensively used.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 A residence may not be searched without due process (which
 typically consists of a search made in the presence of a
 prosecutor or assistant prosecutor) except in cases of "hot
 pursuit" or where there exists reason to believe that a crime
 is actually occurring within the residence. Constitutional
 safeguards against invasion of the home are normally observed.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 
 
 476
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and are respected. The
 viewpoints of opposition parties and others are freely aired,
 even when they are critical of the government. The only
 incident of note during 1982 involved the temporary
 suspension of a radio station after a broadcast by a
 political commentator in which certain charges, which were
 considered by objective observers to be totally false, were
 aired against the wife of President Guzman and against the
 Dominican armed forces. The station's suspension was
 extensively protested in the press, and the station was
 permitted to reopen after several months.
 There is no censorship of domestic books on political
 grounds. Although foreign-produced pro-communist literature
 and other material has at times in the past been confiscated
 by customs, such material is reportedly now being passed
 through without incident. Artistic works are not censored
 and academic freedom, although reportedly impinged upon at
 times by university adminstrations, is not restricted by the
 Government.
 The Government has been charged with intervening in both the
 press and in radio and television broadcasting through the
 offering and withholding of advertising revenue, an important
 factor in a country where the state is also a major
 industrial proprietor. This does not seem to have dampened
 press criticism, however, and large amounts of government
 advertising appear in periodicals that regularly criticize
 administration policies.
 Dominican media regularly engage in political commentary.
 The country's newspapers are rated among the most free in the
 hemisphere by the Inter-American Press Association. Eight
 daily newspapers flourish in Santo Domingo and three in
 Santiago, the country's second city. They are distributed
 throughout the country. The numerous privately owned radio
 stations (162 AM stations and 65 FM stations) along with six
 privately owned television stations air almost all political
 points-of view, as does the government-owned radio and
 television network.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Outdoor public meetings require a government permit; indoor
 gatherings are totally unrestricted. Permits for outdoor
 demonstrations have at times been denied to leftist groups
 and such demonstrations have been dispersed. Some leftist
 groups never apply for the permits, however, and have
 reportedly sought to provoke authorities into breaking up
 their demonstrations. During the 1982 political campaign the
 police at times suppressed rallies by leftist parties held
 without permits. This practice was later halted by
 presidential order, and all parties were allowed to hold
 outdoor rallies without applying for a permit. Opposition
 groups still alleged interference in their meetings by
 partisans of the governing party, and confrontations resulted
 in several deaths on both sides during the campaign.
 Government security forces generally maintained a neutral,
 peace-keeping role and electoral violence was condemned by
 all parties.
 The labor movement in the Dominican Republic is still in its
 infancy. While only 12 percent of the work force is
 organized, many labor unions flourish in the manufacturing
 sector, as well as in other key parts of the economy such as
 
 
 477
 sugar processing, transportation, communications, and
 mining. Unions operate under the handicap of a labor code
 enacted during the Trujillo regime that restricts the right
 to organize. For example, there is no protection for
 organizers or union officials. Where unions do exist, they
 have the right to negotiate and to go on strike. The
 platform of the governing party pledges labor code reform and
 some progress may be made in this area. The Labor
 Secretariat has endeavored over the past several years to let
 the unions exercise their rights under the existing law more
 so than in the past. It has also not shown any undue
 favoritism to the labor confederation affiliated with the
 governing party, which itself has at times gone on record
 criticizing the government.
 Professional organizations such as the Lawyers Association
 and the Medical Association also exist and are not restricted
 by the Government. Like the unions, these organizations
 maintain relations with recognized international bodies of
 varying political philosophies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Approximately 95 percent of the population is Roman
 Catholic. That church's preeminent position is recognized by
 the concordat between the Dominican Republic and the Vatican
 and is accepted by the populace. Discrimination on racial,
 religious, and ethnic grounds is prohibited by the
 Constitution. There are no restrictions on the practice of
 other religious faiths. Conversion from Roman Catholicism to
 other faiths is permitted and those belonging to minority
 faiths suffer no discrimination. Adherence to the majority
 faith conveys no special status.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on travel within the country, with
 the exception of a few military reservations to which access
 is controlled.
 Individuals may be prevented from Jeaving the country on
 various legal grounds, such as outstanding tax claims, civil
 suits, or criminal charges. There is no restriction on
 emigration or on repatriation (with the exception of a legal
 prohibition on the entry of certain members of the Trujillo
 family). It is however against the law to leave the country
 without a passport or not to pass through immigration
 controls. Persons caught while attempting to leave the
 country with false documentation are usually fined under the
 law. A Dominican cannot have his citizenship revoked except
 through the voluntary acquisition of another nationality or
 for treason.
 The Dominican Government has expressly stated that it does
 not wish to accept refugees because of local economic
 conditions. Still, a small number of Haitian political
 exiles live in the country within the large Haitian community
 (about 500,000). Some Haitian political refugees have been
 deported for failing to obey the Constitution's prohibition
 that foreigners not engage in political activity on Dominican
 soil. Local pro-Haitian exile groups allege that one Louis
 Samuel Roche, a Haitian permanently residing in the Dominican
 Republic, was returned to Haiti by Dominican authorities and
 allegedly suffered imprisonment there. The Government has
 
 
 478
 denied that Roche was deported and the facts of the case are
 not yet clearly established. In a recent incident where 55
 anti-Duvalier former Haitian residents were arrested by
 police while holding a meeting in the open, although at a
 private residence, 53 were released without charges being
 filed, while two who were US citizens were told to leave the
 country.
 Anti-Duvalier Haitians, when expelled, are sent to countries
 other than Haiti. Some individuals seeking to illegally
 enter Dominican territory via the land border (which is
 legally closed except in a few designated crossing places)
 may have been forcibly returned to Haiti by local
 authorities. Those forcibly returned reportedly have
 included deserting members of the Haitian Armed Forces.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Dominican Republic is a functioning democracy in which
 citizens freely elect their leaders and express their
 opinions. Twelve political parties, ranging from the far
 right to the far left, participated in the 1982 elections in
 which a president, a vice president, a bicameral legislature,
 mayors, and municipal governing bodies were chosen. The 1982
 elections were free and fair and while certain local results
 were subject to challenge and were adjudicated by an
 impartial electoral tribunal, the basic results were accepted
 by all participants. Opposition groups of the left, right,
 and center are allowed to exist freely, and as registered
 political parties receive the same privileges as the
 governing party. The administration makes a point of
 consulting with all of the parties represented in the
 Congress and even members of the governing party feel free to
 vote against administration policy. While certain opposition
 parties do exist illegally (mainly small extreme leftist
 groups), this condition is rooted in the refusal by such
 groups to register with the Central Electoral Board rather
 than in any Government policy of repression.
 All groups within the Dominican population enjoy the right to
 vote. Women are represented among the elective officeholders
 as well as among the Government's high level appointees,
 although not in proportion to their numbers in the general
 population. Women hold only five percent of major elected
 offices and this percentage actually declined as a result of
 the 1982 elections. Still, the Secretary of State for
 Education, Fine Arts, and Worship is a woman, and numerous
 women have received appointments at the subcabinet level and
 as provincial governors.
 There are no problems regarding nationality, citizenship, or
 statelessness. Dominican citizenship, whether acquired by
 birth in the Dominican Republic or from Dominican parents
 abroad or via naturalization, can only be revoked in cases of
 treason, espionage, or conspiracy against the state or by
 voluntary acquisition of another nationality.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Dominican Republic participates actively in international
 and regional human rights bodies and generally gives strong
 support to human rights issues in international fora. The
 status and treatment of Haitians living in the Dominican
 Republic has, however, been the focus of critical attention
 
 
 479
 both in the Dominican Republic. and abroad. The International
 Labor Organization (ILO) is currently studying the situation
 of Haitian workers in the Dominican Republic. A preliminary
 review has led the ILO to conclude that four ILO conventions
 may have been.violated by both Haiti and the Dominican
 Republic in the system of recruitment and the working
 conditions of Haitian migrant workers contracted to harvest
 the Dominican sugar cane crop. A commission of inquiry
 composed of three independent experts was established in
 March 1982. It is expected to visit the country during the
 coming months.
 The Subcommission Working Group on Slavery of the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) in its August meeting
 heard a report prepared by the UK-based Anti-Slavery Society
 which was highly critical of the situation of Haitian migrant
 workers in the Dominican Republic. The report, based on
 on-site investigation, charges that the minimum provisions of
 the contract under which Haitian workers enter the country
 are not enforced, that the Haitian labor inspectors sent to
 monitor the situation of the migrants are not qualified and
 not working in the workers' best interests, and that the
 Dominican army was conducting raids in Haitian communities in
 the Dominican Republic to round up workers for the sugar
 harvest. The Dominican Government and most Dominican
 newspapers denounced the Anti-Slavery Society's report as an
 attempt to discredit the country.
 The status of the Haitian community, both permanent and
 transient, within the Dominican Republic is a very complex
 matter. Haitians constitute the country's largest minority
 and estimates of Haitians permanently residing in the country
 (most of whom are illegal residents) range from 200,000 to
 about 500,000. There is little evidence of systematic
 discrimination against legal Haitian residents, although
 Haitians without legal residence have been subject to
 exploitation by their employers. Haitians, legal and
 illegal, have greatly benefited from government health and
 rural development programs.
 Most criticism of Dominican Government policy regarding the
 Haitian community concentrates on the method by which the
 state-owned (60 percent) segment of the sugar industry
 contracts for the recruitment and admission of approximately
 20,000 cane-cutters each year for the December-to-May sugar
 harvest. The terms of this agreement, which is not public,
 reportedly include.a per capita cash payment to the Haitian
 Government while guaranteeing certain standards of housing
 and health care for the workers and providing for Haitian
 inspectors to supervise the contract's implementation. The
 agreement covers only a quarter of the estimated 80,000
 Haitian agricultural workers who enter the Dominican Republic
 annually as harvest workers. It is generally accepted that
 many Haitian workers, whether under the agreement or not, are
 paid less than four dollars per day on a piece work basis and
 live in very poor conditions. Incidents of brutal treatment
 of cane-cutters by soldiers and guards employed by sugar
 companies have been reported in the local press. The migrant
 cane-cutters, along with other Haitians illegally in the
 country, have at times been rounded up in certain areas by
 the military and sent to work in the canefields, although for
 pay. Despite the difficult working conditions, cane-cutting
 jobs in the Dominican Republic are eagerly sought by
 Haitians.
 
 
 480
 International and domestic organizations interested in human
 rights questions have not been obstructed in their
 investigative efforts in the Dominican Republic. The
 openness of Dominican society allows information about
 alleged abuses to come to the fore. Various local
 organizations are engaged in reporting and commenting on
 human rights violations. They include the Dominican Union of
 Solidarity with Latin America (mainly concerned with Haitian
 and Central American issues), the Ecumenical Center for Human
 Rights (mainly concerned with the treatment of Haitians in
 the Dominican Republic), and the Dominican Union for the
 Defense of Human Rights. All have criticized the Dominican
 Government at various times during the year (for example,
 about the treatment of Haitian workers) and neither they nor
 their leaders have suffered for their human rights
 activities. Non-governmental human rights organizations from
 abroad are also allowed free access into the country and the
 Government has not acted to discourage their investigations,
 even into such sensitive areas as the treatment of Haitian
 migrant workers and exiles. Amnesty International has
 reported its concern about what it alleges to be the
 unacknowledged detention and forcible repatriation of Haitian
 refugees. Preedom House in 1982 rated the country as "free."
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Dominican Republic has a population of approximately
 5,565,000 (1981) that has increased over the past decade at
 an annual growth rate of 2.6 percent (1980). One half of the
 population is under 16 years of age. Unemployment, now
 estimated at over 25 percent, has increased as economic
 growth has slowed and as more individuals enter the labor
 market. At least another 20 percent of the labor force is
 believed to be under-employed. Although the last two
 decades have seen the emergence of a middle class and per
 capita income was estimated in 1980 to be $1,100 per person,
 income distribution remains widely skewed. Over 700,000
 Dominicans live outside of their country, mainly in the
 United States, mostly in order to improve their economic
 opportunities.
 Poverty is endemic. The World Bank estimated that in 1979,
 29 percent of the urban population and 43 percent of the
 rural population were living below the Latin American poverty
 line. Per capita calorie consumption continues to be below
 the minimum requirement, although it increased to 93 percent
 in 1979 from 88 percent in 1970. While only 55 percent of
 the population has access to safe drinking water, according
 to a 1979 study, this is a great improvement from 37 percent
 in 1970. Despite a stated primary school enrollment of 96
 percent in 1975, the literacy rate is estimated at only 62
 percent and has actually declined in recent years.
 Steady improvement in the economic well-being of the
 Dominican people has been frustrated by a number of factors:
 natural disasters, managerial deficiencies, corruption, and
 chronic lack of financial resources. But the most serious
 problem in recent years has been the adverse reversal in the
 terms of trade. World prices of sugar, gold, coffee, and
 cacao -- which together constitute approximately 75 percent
 of the country's exports -- have declined since early 1981,
 and a dramatically increased share of export earnings must be
 used to pay for the country's totally imported petroleum
 supply as a result of the huge jump in world oil prices over
 
 
 481
 the past decade. The Guzman administration attempted to
 improve the lot of the Dominican poor, however, and allocated
 a higher proportion of public resources than previous
 governments to programs designed to meet basic needs. The
 800 million dollars in damages caused by two severe
 hurricanes in 1979 necessitated the diversion of considerable
 international and domestic resources to a recovery and
 reconstruction program. The new Jorge administration is
 attempting to implement a tough austerity program while at
 the same time maintaining social programs and increasing
 employment.
 Life expectancy has been on the rise (from 56.9 years in 1970
 to 61.4 years in 1980) and infant mortality rates have
 dropped steadily to 37.0 deaths per 1,000 births in 1981.
 The Guzman administration gave priority status to preventive
 medicine and paid special attention to extending basic health
 services to the entire rural population through a network of
 283 clinics and over 5,400 "health promoters," who received
 basic training in health care and work in their own
 neighborhoods.
 While sexual, racial, and religious discrimination is
 prohibited by law, some subtle evidence of discrimination
 does exist in Dominican society. Women have not
 traditionally and do not now share equal economic and social
 status with men, although they are allowed to hold property
 in their own names apart from their husbands. There also
 exist certain subtle types of discrimination against
 Dominicans with very negroid physical characteristics,
 although this has not acted to deter several such individuals
 from achieving high positions in government, private
 industry, and intellectual and cultural life. Catholicism's
 status as the state religion has not resulted in
 discrimination againt non-Catholics, or non-practicing
 Catholics, in either the public or private sector.
