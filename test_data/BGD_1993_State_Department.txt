 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is a parliamentary democracy headed by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia
 of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Her BNI attained a plurality of seats
 in the February 1991 election and reached a majority through the nomination of fe-
 male members of Parliament to reserved seats. Opposition parties, including the
 Awami League, former President H. M. Ershad's Jatiya Party, and the Jamaat
 Islami, are represented in Parliament and play an active role in the politic. proc-
 ess.
 The Home Affairs Ministry controls the police and paramilitary forces which bear
 rimary responsibility for maintaining internal security. In a particularly egregious
 reakdown of law and order in 1993, 11 people were killed, over 200 injured, and
 hundreds of shops and homes destroyed when navy personnel attacked a neighbor-
 hood in Chittagong. A number of navy personnel were discharged from the service,
 and several were court-martialed for their role in this incident.
 The army and paramilitary forces also play a significant role in maintaining secu-
 rity in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) where a tribal force has been waging a low-
 level insurgency. Due to a cease-fire, the CHT experienced fewer incidents of vio-
 lence in 1993 than in 1992, although tensions remained high. In November, violence
 erupted in the town of Naniarchar as security forces failed to maintain order when
 a demonstrating tribal group was attacked, apparently by a nontribal settler group.
 The bloody clash left at least 27 tribals dead and almost 100 injured.
 Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest countries; approximately 40 percent of
 the population of 118 million do not have sufficient income to meet minimum daily
 needs. The economy is primarily agricultural, with over 60 percent of the work force
 involved in farming, which represents almost 40 percent of the gross domestic prod-
 uct. The Government has pledged to reform the economy and to open it to market
 forces. However, the process of reform has been seriously hampered by resistance
 from those who fear losing de facto monopolies and guaranteed jobs or those who
 want protection from foreign competition.
 There was little change in the human rights situation in 1993 from the previous
 year. Although less extensively than in 1992, the Government continued to use na-
 tional security legislation such as the Special Powers Act to detain citizens, and in
 some cases political opponents, without formal charges. Thee were credible reports
 of custodial abuse and death, and those responsible generally went unpunished. Vio-
 lence against women is a serious problem, but much of it is not reported and goes
 unpunished. Child labor is also common, with over 3 million children in the work
 force. There were credible reports of some forced repatriation of Rohingya refugees
 to Burma, and one refugee was killed by police fire in 1993.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Although the January elections in
 Bangladesh's 89 municipalities were relatively peaceful, sporadic interparty violence
 resulted in 1 death and over 100 injuries. There was considerable violence involving
 university and secondary school students throughout the year. Much of this violence
 involved clashes both within and between student wings of various political parties.
 These incidents, which included 2 brutal gangland-style slayings, resulted in scores
 of injuries and at least 15 deaths in 1993.
 In January, in a complete breakdown of the command and control structure, doz-
 ens of Bangladesh naval enlisted men, angered by alleged mistreatment of fellow
 troops by local residents, attacked a neighborhood near the Chittagong navy base.
 According to official sources, over 11 civilians were killed over 200 injured, and
 hundreds of residential units and shops burned down. The (dovernment's inquiry re-
 port into the incident has yet to be published, although over 20 naval personnel,
 including officers, were reportedly dismissed from the navy, and several have been
 court-martialed.
 Several incidents involving shootings by security forces resulted in at least 17
 deaths in 1993. In April a contingent of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), a border security
 for.e, opened fire on a crowded cattle market and killed four persons during an at-
 tempt to confiscate cattle allegedly smuggled from India. In another incident in
 July, the BDR fired on a group of villagers trying to break a levee in a flooded area
 of Sylhet District, killing 4 and injuring 50 people. At a rail station in Dhaka in
 November parapolice forces, called Ansars, shot and killed two passengers, alleg-
 edly in a dispute over payment of extortion money for goods they were transporting.
 There is no indication that criminal charges were brought against any of those in-
 volved in these incidents.
 In 1993 human rights monitors reported at least eight deaths of prisoners in
 lice custody. Most or-those deaths occurred while accused criminals were held unger
 police remand, the period between arrest and incarceration in one of the country's
 jails. The Government stated that in 1993, according to its records, no prisoners
 died as the result of mistreatment by police or jail authorities. The Government
 does not, however, routinely investigate deaths in custody. Determinations of the
 cause of death are often based solely on the local government medical officer's re-
 port, a practice that human rights monitors claim prevents an impartial and objec-
 tive review of questionable circumstances of death. While there were reports of o-
 lice transfers and suspensions pending magisterial investigations in 1993, no police
 were tried for abusing persons accused of crimes.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of disappearance resulting
 from official actions in 1S93.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment.
 However, police continue to employ psychological and physical torture and other
 abusive treatment during interrogations, which, as indicated in Section L.a., some-
 times result in death. Torture usually consists of threats and beatings and may in-
 clude the use of electric shock.
 Most prisons in Bangladesh are overcrowded and lack adequate facilities for pris-
 oners. This is especially the case in class "C" cells, which generally hold common
 criminals and low-level political workers. They often have dirt floors, no furnishings,
 and poor quality food, and the use of handcuffs and fetters is common.
 Prisoners in these cells reportedly suffer the most abuse, such as beatings and
 being forced to kneel for long periods. Conditions in "B" and "A" cells are markedly
 better, with the latter reserved for prominent persons. The Government reports that
 independent monitoring of prisons is conducted on a monthly basis by a govern-
 ment-appointed committee of private citizens. The committee's findings are not
 made public.
 Supporters of former President Ershad filed a writ of habeas corpus in the Ban-
 gladesh Supreme Court in 1992 asserting that his prison conditions are inhumane
 and that, among other things, Ershad has not been allowed to leave the jail for what
 they consider necessary medical tests. The Court had not yet rendered judgment at
 year's end. The Government acknowledges that Ershad has been denied these tests,
 claiming that his medical condition is satisfactory.
 In 1993 as in the past, a number of claims were filed with magistrates against
 jail officials involved in alleged cases of abuse. However, human rights monitors re-
 port that none of the magistrates' reports was published and that no legal action
 was taken. In one example reported by human rights monitors, a 13-year-old boy
 was taken into custody and raped by two police officers. After inquiries by human
 
 
 1321
 
 rights activists, the Government dismissed the two officers and reported that it
 planned to prosecute them on criminal charges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government continues to use na-
 tional security legislation to detain citizens without formal charges. The law most
 often used for arbitrary detention is the Special Powers Act of 1974 (SPA). Under
 the SPA, the Government, through the Ministry of Home Affairs, may detain anyone
 deemed "a threat to the security of the country." Initially, the Government can de-
 tain a person for 30 days; by the end of that period, the Government must provide
 the detainee with a specific charge for his detention or release him. In practice, de-
 tainees are sometimes held for longer periods without being charged. From the date
 the charge is made, the Government permits the detainee 15 days to appeal the de-
 tention to the Home Ministry, which may grant early release.
 After 6 months, a review panel that includes two jurists examines the case to de-
 termine if there is sufficient reason to continue the detention. If the Government
 adequately defends its detention order, the detainee remains imprisoned. If the Gov-
 ernment ails to convince the review panel, the detainee is released. Detainees are
 allowed to see lawyers while in detention, although this is not usually permitted
 until a charge is filed. Detainees are allowed to see visitors and are not held incom-
 municado.
 In September the Government reported that just under 900 people were currently
 being detained under the SPA, a decrease from the 3,000 level reported in 1992. The
 Government also reported that during the first 9 months of 1993 a total of 1,690
 people were arrested under the SPA. Of 365 SPA cases that came before the High
 Court for review during this same period, 97 percent were found to be illegal. The
 great majority of those detained were released outright without being charged with
 specific crimes. These statistics do not support the Government's claim that the SPA
 is exclusively used against those facing legitimate criminal charges. In fact, the Gov-
 ernment has used the SPA to harass political opponents, including prominent mem-
 bers of Ershad's Jatiya Party as well as low-level activists of other parties. For ex-
 ample, in April a former minister in Ershad's government and current Member of
 Parliament, Anwar Hussein Monju, was arrested under the SPA. He was released
 in May after the Government failed to file any charges against him. In addition, the
 Government uses the SPA to detain tribal opponents of its policies in the CHT, and
 human rights monitors assert that over 200 tribals are currently detained under the
 SPA.
 In 1992 the Government enacted the Suppression of Terrorist Offenses bill. Under
 this law, commonly known as the "antiterrorism act," special tribunals were set up
 to try specific offenses, including extortion, destruction of property, hijacking, abduc-
 tion, and terrorism, within specified and compressed time periods.  e act specifi-
 cally prohibits bail in the first month of detention; it also provides that tribunal
 udges are chosen by the Chief Justice, that all sentences may be a ppealed to the
 igh Court, and that restitution should be provided for those wrongfully convicted.
 According to the Home Ministry, during the first 9 months of 1993, 2,171 people
 were arrested under the antiterrorism act. Of those people tried during this period,
 approximately 42 percent were convicted; 371 people received prison sentences, most
 for periods of less than 10 years. The majority of the convictions were for extortion,
 hijacking, and terrorism. In November the first death sentence under this law was
 handed down to a man convicted of ransacking a testing hall and fighting with po-
 lice during a national higher secondary school exam. This sentence is subject to
 hi gher review.
 When the antiterrorism law went into effect, opponents of the bill expressed con-
 cern that indiscriminate use of the law would lead to many more cases of arbitrary
 detention on political grounds. However, the consensus among human rights mon-
 itors is that the antiterrorism law has so far been used to arrest criminals and not
 political activists. Nonetheless, concerns remain about the potential for abuse, and
 opposition parties continue to campaign for the law's repeal.
 There were no reports of persons being exiled in 1993.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system is divided into two levels, the
 Low Court and the Supreme Court, both of which hear civil as well as criminal
 cases in public trials. The Low Court consists of magistrates, who are part of the
 administrative branch of government, and session judges, who belong to the judicial
 branch. The type and location of a case determines which of these branches will
 hear it. The Supreme Court has two divisions--the High Court division and the Ap-
 pellate division. The High Court division hears original cases and reviews decisions
 of the Low Court. The Appellate division has jurisdiction to hear appeals of judg-
 ments, decrees, orders, or sentences of the High Court division. Rulings of the Ap-
 pellate division are binding on all other courts.
 
 
 1322
 The upper levels of the Bangladesh judiciary exhibit a high degree of independ-
 ence and often rule against the Government in criminal, civil, and even politically
 sensitive cases. For ex ample, in April a High Court division bench restored the citi-
 zenship of jailed Jamaat Islam leader Golam Azam despite government arguments
 that he did not qualify for citizenship. In July another Highi Court bench rejected
 the Government's arguments and ordered Azam released from incarceration.
 The judicial system is inefficient and has a serious backlog. Acording to Ministry
 of Law staitics, the lower courts have over 218,000 criminal and civil cases on the
 docket, some dating back over a decade. In addition, the High Court division of the
 Supreme Court reports a backlog of over 5,000 cases which  are over 10 years old.
 The Government reports that 26,352 of those awaiting trial are currently  prison.
 Over half have been in pretrial detention for less than 6 months, while 2,263 have
 been awaiting trial in prison for over 2 years. In November a man was released
 from the central prison after 21 years; for the first 13 years he was serving a sen-
 tence, and for the last 8 years he was awaiting trial on a second charge which was
 dismissed upon his release. In 1993 the Ministry of Law announced plans to hire
 more judges and streamline the legal process, but during the year only 13 new
 judges were appointed to the lower court.
 The law provides an accused with the right to be represented by counsel, to re-
 view accusatory material, to call witnesses, and to appeal a judgment. In practice,
 however, these rights are not widely understood by a largely rural, illiterate popu-
 lation and are not always respected bythe authoities, especially outside the main
 urban centers. The law allows judges to release an accused person awaiting trial
 on petition of bail. If bail is not granted, however, there are no legal limits to pre-
 trial detention.
 The time-consuming and expensive process of pursuing cases discourages many
 from seeking redress through the courts. While the right to legal counseisrecog-
 nized, it is not guaranteed. Courts provide state-funded defense attorneys in o y
 a limited number of cases, and there are few legal aid programs to assist litigants.
 In June former President Ershad was convictedof use of undue influence and cor-
 ruptian and sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment. In 1991 and 1992, he was convicted
 on two other charges and sentencedto 13 years in prison. Ershad is appealingall
 of these convictions. He is now in prison, and a number of other cases are pending
 against him. He has been represented by counsel throughout the proceedings. His
 trials have been open to the press and public and conform to standard Bangladesh
 trial pratnice.
 The Government claims to hold no political prisoners. However, some arrests
 under the SPA were for essentially political reasons, including those of members of
 Ershad's Jatiya Party and tribals arrested for allegedly aiding an abetting the in-
 surgent group Shanti Bahini in the CHT.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Ban-
 ladesh legal procedure requires a judicial warrant before authorities may enter a
 home, and the courts may only issue this warrant if the Government provides evi-
 dence of reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed or is being con-
 templated. In practice, human rights monitors assert that warrants are rarely ob-
 tained and there are no sanctions applied against officers violating the stipulated
 procedure. The SPA permits authorities to search premises without a warrant.
 Some opposition and CHT tribal leaders maintin thatti telephones and mail
 are monitored by the Government's civilian and military intelligence services.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violation s of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Since the early 1970's, the Shanti Bahini, a tribal insurgent group, have
 waged a low-level conflict in the CHT. The insurgency grew o ou of a onflict between
 the tribal people, who sought to maintain their traditional way of life and special
 status in the hill areas, and Bengali settlers from the lowlands who sought to ex-
 ploit the CHT's fertile and relatively unppulated land. In the 1960's and 1970's,
 large-scale government settlement programs rapidly increased the number of Ben-
 gali inhabitants in the CHT from only 3 percent in 1947 to an estimated 45 percent.
 In response to tribal grievances, the Government in 1985 began to discourage and
 eventually prohibited further settlement by nontribas in the CHT. Despite this,
 some settlers continue to move into the area.
 In a further attempt to end the insurgency, the Government established elected
 district councils in 1990 which assumed control of local government affairs in June
 1991. However, the military remains in place and continues to exercise veto power
 over any matter that could affect security. Law and order matters and control over
 land, two fundamental issues for the tribal people, have not yet been placed in the
 hands of the district councils.
 Throughout the conflict, all sides-tribals, nontribal settlers, and security forces-
 have accused each other of numerous human rights violations. The details of specific
 
 
 1323
 
 incidents have been difficult to verify because of limited access to the area caused
 by government travel restrictions, tight security, difficult terrain, and unsafe condi-
 tions linked to the insurgency. In November, after over 1 year of relative quiet, vio-
 lence erupted in the remote town of Naniarchar when a tribal group demonstrated
 for removal of a security checkpoint. A group of Bengali settlers reportedly attacked
 the demonstrators as well as other tribals in the town and looted and burned tribal
 homes. Army and police security forces present failed to stop the clash until at least
 27 tribals had been killed and as many as 100 injured. The Government imme-
 diately a pointed a one-man judicial inquiry commission to investigate.
 A simitar incident in April 1992 in the village of Logong, remains a contentious
 issue because of the Government's failure to take more than limited administrative
 action against those involved, as well as complaints about the accuracy of the gov-
 ernment commission's inquiry report. According to that report, security forces and
 Bengali settlers killed 13 tribals (a number disputed by human rights monitors, who
 claim many more died), injured 13 others, and burned 550 huts in retaliation for
 the killing of a Bengali settler by the Shanti Bahini. There is no indication that the
 Government imposed or plans to impose any criminal sanctions on any of those re-
 sponsible for the attack. The Government reports that one junior officer was dis-
 missed from the border security forces, and disciplinary actions are pending against
 two paramilitary soldiers.
 The Government continues to maintain a highly visible presence in the CHT.
 However, a series of short-term cease-fires, initiated by the Shanti Bahini in August
 1992 and formally joined by the Government in May 1993, brought a decrease in
 violence and claims of human rights abuses in 1993. A government-appointed Par-
 liamentary Committee held six meetings with representatives of the Jana Sanghati
 Samity (JSS), the political wing of the Shanti Bahini, to seek a solution to the con-
 flict. The JSS has demanded removal of all Bengali settlers, withdrawal of the mili-
 tary, and regional autonomy, conditions which the Government has rejected. The
 sixth round of talks on November 24 resulted in little more than an agreement to
 meet for round seven and to extend the cease-fire until January 31, 1994.
 In connection with efforts to stem the pattern of violence in the CHT, the Govern-
 ment sought to facilitate the repatriation of tribal refugees from the conflict who
 have sought shelter in India. Concerns about security and return of land were re-
 portedly the primary issues that stalled these efforts (see also Section 2.d.). Despite
 the cease-fire and government-JSS talks, the situation remained fluid and tensions
 were high in the Hill Tracts throughout the year.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, subject only to "reasonable restrictions." In practice, the Government
 gnerally respects freedom of speech and tolerates open criticism of the Government.
 blic rallies and speeches are frequent and often in opposition to government poli-
 cies or actions. The Government sought to impose no new restrictions on speech or
 publications in 1993, although it continued to limit equal access to broadcast media
 and discussed imposing regulations on journalists. Several attacks on newspaper of-
 fices by unknown assailants occurred during the year.
 Bangladesh has a large number of publications containing a wide variety of edi-
 torial views. Newspaper ownership and content are not subject to government re-
 striction. Despite frequent government statements, particularly by the Minister of
 Information, regarding a code of ethics for journalists and required qualifications for
 the position of editor, no actions were taken to impose such restrictions.
 The Government continues to own BSS, one of two national news services, and
 to control a large advertising budget, which reportedly accounts for as much as 75
 percent of all newspaper advertising revenues, Some editors complain that the Gov-
 ernment uses its advertising budget to punish newspapers that criticize it, leading
 to self-censorship. This self-censorship may take the form of muted criticism of the
 Government. In general, however, newspapers publish a wide variety of viewpoints
 and opinions.
 The Government provides some advertising to all newspapers but continues to
 favor some over others. The Information Minister has publicly stated on several oc-
 casions that one of the criteria for the distribution of government advertising is the
 degree of objectivity in the paper's reporting. This is a difficult standard to judge
 and is potentially subject to abuse. In addition, government advertising allotments
 are not distributed in direct proportion to circulation. The two papers owned by a
 government-controlled trust receive the greatest share, while others with higher cir-
 culations lag behind. The ruling party BNP newspaper, Dinkal, receives more gov-
 ernment advertising than its circulation would appear to justify, while opposition
 
 
 1324
 
 papers receive less. For a period in early 1993, the left-leaning Bhorer Kagoj re-
 ceived no government advertising.
 There were several attacks on newspaper offices in 1993. In February the office
 of the daily Banglabazar Patrika was ransacked. The police investigation turned up
 no clues or suspects. The paper had published several stories unfavorable to the rul.
 ing party, but no link between those stories and the attack was established. Also
 in February, the offices of the private news service, United News of Bangladesh,
 were attacked after the agency reported the winner of a parliamentary by-election
 before the election commission had officially released the results. In June unknown
 assailants broke into the offices of The Morning Sun and did extensive damage to
 computers and other equipment, while in September a bomb attack on the office of
 Aiker Kagoj resulted in injury to seven staff members.
 The broadcast media remain under government control and ownership. Broadcast
 news provides noticeably more extensive and favorable coverage of the Government
 than of the opposition. Fallure to provide coverage of events unfavorable to the Gov-
 ernment is sometimes striking. In May this practice was evident in the coverage of
 a serious accident at Dhaka's airport involving an airlane of the government-owned
 Biman Bangladesh airlines. Bangladesh Television (BTV) failed to report the early
 morning accident, a major news story, in its evening broadcasts, reportedly because
 the Government had not yet issued an official statement. In another example, BTV
 coverage of a strike called by the National Trade Union Federation in May to pro-
 test the Government's refusal of concessions failed to mention widespread closures
 of factories and showed only footage of those that remained open.
 In late 1992, the Government began to broadcast Cable News Network and Brit-
 ish Broadcasting Corporation international news for several hours each day on the
 single Bangladesh television station. The Government continued this practice during
 1993, thereby permitting considerably increased access to international news. The
 direct reception of international satellite telecasting services is becoming increas-
 ingly popular in Bangladesh and has not been regulated by the Government.
 sues of staffing and general programming tend to be politicized at BTV. During
 1993, some BTV employees were reportedly transferred to other positions in the
 Ministry of Information after allegedly failing to respond to requests for coverage
 from ministries and high-ranking members of Parliament belonging to the ruling
 BNP party. Some critics claim that the Government removed the Director-General
 of BTV in June because he backed his staff on such questions.
 The Government's Film Censor Board continues to exercise control over the
 screening of films in Bangladesh. It initially banned a film about the war of libera-
 tion on grounds that it distorted the nation's ideals. In response to a public outcry,
 the censors reversed their decision and allowed the film to be shown. The Censor
 Board also bans films it finds pornographic, and the Government continues to ban
 films from South Africa and Israel.
 Foreign publications are generally available in Bangladesh. No foreign journalists
 were arrested, barred from entry, or expelled in 1993. No arrests were reported
 under the clause of the 1991 Penal Code prohibiting the publication or circulation
 of any statement "prejudicial to the interest of security of Bangladesh or public
 order."
 Academic freedoms are respected by the Government. However, faculty and stu-
 dent bodies are deeply politicized, sometimes inhibiting freedom of expression on
 campus. Teachers complain that verbal and physical assaults by students are politi-
 cally motivated. Drama groups need permission-routinely granted-to perform
 plays. In 1993 the Government banned performance of "jatras --bawdy village op-
 eras-on the grounds of obscenity. While the ban is enforced in the rural areas, gov-
 ernment-sanctioned performances are permitted at a government-run academy in
 Dhaka.
 A book entitled "Lajjya" ("Shame"), a fictional account of the plight of a Hindu
 family forced to leave Bangladesh by Muslim neighbors following the destruction of
 the Babri mosque in India was banned by the Government a few months after its
 release in February. The Government justified the ban as necessary to avoid com-
 munal misunderstandings and violence, describing the book as "tantamount to blas-
 phemy" and offensive to the "religious sentiment" of the majority of the population.
 A little known fundamentalist Islamic group from the northeast city of Sylhet issued
 a death threat against the book's author, Taslima Nasreen. Although it later re-
 tracted the death threat, the group continued to organize demonstrations against
 Ms. Nasreen's writings and to demand that the Government prosecute her for them.
 In response to the death threat and verbal attacks, the author sought and obtained
 court-ordered police protection. The Government took no action against the group
 that issued the death threat.
 
 
 1325
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of every citizen to form associations, subject to "reasonable restrictions"
 in the interest of morality or public order. In practice, individuals are free to join
 private organizations and associations. Public meetings require a permit from a
 local district magistrate. Occasionally, the Government prohibits rallies in certain
 areas for security reasons. Sit-ins, hunger strikes, marches, and rallies are common
 forms of political expression in Bangladesh. These occasionally lead to violence,
 sometimes involving the police. In March the police attempted to stop a rally in
 downtown Dhaka by the Nirmul Committee, a group dedicated to prosecuting al-
 leged collaborators for atrocities committed during the war of liberation. In breaking
 up the gathering, the police beat a number of the leaders, including Jahanara Iman,
 a nationally known writer and mother of a freedom fighter killed in the independ-
 ence struggle. The Government received much public criticism for its heavy-handed
 tactics. The authorities frequently prohibited or harassed Jatiya Party meetings.
 Jatiya Party members who attempted to hold marches in Dhaka were forcibly pre-
 vented from doing so by the police. In some cases this led to minor violence between
 police and demonstrators.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the dominant religion in Bangladesh, practiced
 by an estimated 87 percent of the population. The Eighth Amendment to the Con-
 stitution, passed in 1988, recognized it as the state religion. Although it also assures
 the freedom to practice other religions, this constitutional change continues to cause
 concern among Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist minorities. Some minority citizens
 believe it has encouraged hostility toward them and contributed to heightened com-
 munal tensions.
 Following the destruction by Hindu radicals of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya,
 India in December 1992, a backlash occurred in many parts of Bangladesh. Some
 Hindu temples were reportedly looted and destroyed. The Government reacted
 quickly and successfully contained most public demonstrations in the major cities,
 keeping violent actions against Hindu communities and property to a minimum. In
 many rural areas, however, Hindu communities receivedless effective police protec-
 tion. Human rights monitors and Hindu organizations reported some deaths, hun-
 dreds of beatings, and significant property damage. The Government later offered
 to provide approximately $38,000 for the reconstruction of destroyed Hindu temples.
 Proselytizing by Bangladeshi citizens is permitted by the Constitution, although
 in practice it is generally directed only toward such minority groups as Hindus and
 tribal people. There is strong social resistance to conversion from Islam.
 Government policy continues to permit various religions to establish places of wor-
 ship, train clergy, travel for religious purposes, and maintain links with coreligion-
 ists abroad. Foreign missionaries may work in Bangladesh, but, unlike citizens,
 their right to proselytize is not protected by the Constitution, and the issue is ex-
 tremely sensitive. An example of this sensitivity occurred in late 1992 when allega-
 tions of proselytizing and conversions from Islam provoked an attack by local Mus-
 lim residents on the largely Christian village of Chabagan in the Chittagong dis-
 trict. An angry mob attacked villagers, destroyed some homes, and threatened a
 nearby foreign Christian missionary-run hospital. Local authorities successfully de-
 fused tensions without further loss of property.
 Some missionaries and Christian nongovernmental organizations report facing bu-
 reaucratic obstacles in carrying out their activities including the threatened with-
 drawal of their government registrations along with lengthy delays in obtaining or
 renewing security clearances and visas for foreign personnel. Appeals to the Govern-
 ment have sometimes been successful in removing such obstacles.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Except in designated areas of the   T  Bangadeshi citizens are free
 to move about within the country. Travel by foreigners is a so restricted in the CHT
 and some other border areas. Bangladeshis are generally free to visit abroad and
 emigrate, subject to foreign exchange controls. Civil servants must first obtain clear-
 ance from the Prime Minister's office.In some instances, persons considered to be
 security risks are barred from traveling abroad. The rigiht of repatration is ob-
 served.
 After the fall of the Ershad regime, the former President (currently imprisoned)
 and some of his family, as well as several senior members of his regime andpolitical
 party (Jatiya Party), were prevented from leaving the country, and their passports
 were seized. This occurred even though the Supreme Court in Jurst 1990 had de-
 clared illegal the seizure in 1986 of a former Member of Parliaments passport. The
 Acting Secretary General of the Jatia Party and another party official were pre-
 vented from traveling to Saudi Arab.a in 1993, when government officials charged
 they were carrying a letter from jailed former President Ershad to King Fahd. Some
 
 
 1326
 
 of those affected by such restrictions have challenged them in the courts and have
 received ruling allowing them to travel.
 A pproximately 238,000 non-Bengali Muslims, known as Biharis, remain in Ban-
 gladesh pending resettlement in Pakistan. After independence in 1971, these per-
 sons opted for Pakistani citizenship, and Pakistan a d in principle to accept
 them. Despite Pakistani assurances to Prime Minister Zia, during her visit to Paki-
 stan in August 1992, that 3,000 Biharis would soon be accepted, only one small
 transfer of 325 refugees took place in January.
 The Biharis, most of whom still reside in 66 camps throughout Bangladesh, may
 seek employment and conduct other activities, but as noncitizens they do not vote,
 hold seats in Parliament, or hold passports. Biharis may apply for Bangladeshi citi-
 zenship at any time, and those who do are granted full rights of citizenship.
 At the end of 1993, approximately 200,000 Rohingyas, Muslims from Burma's
 Arakan Province, remained refugees in southeastern Bangladesh. Fleeing repression
 of the Burmese security forces, 250,000 Rohingyas crossed the border into Ban-
 gladesh, largely in late 1991 and early 1992. With international assistance, they are
 being housed in 19 camps in the area of Cox's Bazar. The Government restricts
 their movements and frequently arrests those who venture outside the camps. The
 Government is under domestic pressure to repatriate the refugees quickly.
 The presence of the Rohingya refugees continues to spark occasional public pro-
 tests and violent incidents involving security personnel, local residents, and refu-
 gees. There were credible reports that local government authorities abused refugees
 in order to force repatriation at various times during 1993, especially in August and
 September. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in addi-
 tion to providing relief services, has worked to protect the refugees from abuses and
 to ensure that repatriation is voluntary. The repatriation process, which began in
 September 1992, has been slow, sporadic, and marred by government efforts to co-
 erce refugees into returning to Burma. In December 1992, UNHCR announced that
 the Government was preventing it from carrying out its protection mandate, and
 credible reports of forced repatriation by the Government prompted international
 criticism. After extensive negotiations, the Government and UNHCR signed a
 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in May that permits UNHCR to conduct pri-
 vate interviews of returning refugees to determine if their decision is voluntary. It
 also allows UNHCR access to all the refugee camps during daylight hours.
 Due to uncertainty about the life they would face after returning to Burma, most
 Rohingyas were unwilling to volunteer for repatriation in the absence of inter-
 national monitoring in Burma. By the end of 1993 16 months after the process
 began, only about 50,000 had returned. However, the Government of Burma and
 UNHCR reached an areement in November that, when implemented, will permit
 a UNHCR presence in Burma to protect the returning refugees and to provide relief
 and rehabilitation assistance.
 Between 30,000 and 50,000 Bangladesh tribal refugees from the CHT are residing
 in the Indian state of Tripura. It is believed that up to 15,000 may have returned
 to Bangladesh in the last several years. Bangladesh and India reached agreement
 on plans for full repatriation and announced the agreement with promises of the
 return of land to the refugees and extensive resettlement assistance. However, no
 refugees returned on the first scheduled date in June. The Government continues
 to attempt to reassure the refugees of a receptive climate for their return. Despite
 repeated visits to the camps in India by government representatives and a refugee
 delegation visit to Bangladesh for first-hand observation in September, there was
 no official repatriation of tribal refugees in 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 With the fall of the Ershad regime and the holding of free and fair elections in
 1991, Bangladesh's citizens began to enjoy the right to change their government
 through democratic means. Bangladesh has a multiparty parliamentary system in
 which elections by secret ballot are held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Members of Parliament are to be elected at least every 5 years. The Parliament
 has 300 elected members, with 30 additional seats reserved for women who are cho-
 sen after the election by the seated Parliament. Candidates may contest a maximum
 of five seats in any one election but may hold only one. Parliament elects Ban-
 gladesh's president to a 5-year term. The President's duties are largely ceremonial.
 The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, headed by Khaleda Zia, emerged from the elec-
 tion in 1991 with a plurality of seats and formed a government. It currently holds
 a slim majority in Parliament. The parliamentary opposition is led by Sheikh
 Hasina Wajed and her party, the Awami League. Wile there are a number of
 
 
 1327
 minor parties, the only other major opposition parties are former President Ershad's
 Jatiya Party and the Islamic-oriented party, the Jamaat Islami.
 Municipal eleions were held in .anuary throughout the country, and in Feb-
 ruary a by-election was held to fill a vacant parliamentary seat. The by-election was
 won by therui      aladesh Nationalist Party, but the opposition Awami League
 claimed there were irregularities in the vote ounting. The independent Chief Elec-
 tion Commissioner ordered a recount-the first in Bangladesh's history-which con-
 ru-med the original results. Outside observers found th~e election process to be free
 and fair. In the municipal elections, nominally nonpartisan, the right to vote was
 openly, freely, and fairly exercised. Although some scattered violence occurred, its
 incidence was greatly reduced from elections held under the previous regime.
 Tribals in the CHT have full national voting rights and are represented in the
 Parliament by three members. A majority of the seats on the three local district
 councils in the CHT is reserved for tribals.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of domestic human rights nongovernmental organizations operate open-
 ly, actively conducting investigations into allegations of possible human rights viola-
 tions. During 1993, some of these organizations published extensive reports of their
 rimdings, held press conferences, and issued appeals to the Government to take ac-
 tion in specific cases. Local organizations regularly communicated with government
 officials as well as representatives of international human rights organizations and
 foreign governments. They also implemented programs promoting human and legal
 rights awareness among the country's largely uneducated and rural majority. In
 1993 there were no reports of arrests of human rights monitors, confiscation of pub-
 lications or forced suspension of an organization's activities.
 The dovernment continues to be sensitive to international opinion regarding
 human rights issues. On occasion during 1993, the Government restricted access to
 some Rohinya refugee camps by nongovernmental relief organizations and UNHCR
 representatives. However, in the May agreement with UNHCR, the Government
 guaranteed UNHCR access to all camps during daylight hours. Since then, access
 tothe camps has been greatly improved.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Bangladesh is a largely rural and culturally homogeneous society, with deeply in-
 grained cultural and religious traditions. It is also one of the most densely popu-
 lated countries in the world with a developing economy that is barely able to keep
 pace with population growth. In this context, women, children, minority groups, and
 the disabled often confront social and economic disadvantages that the society is un-
 able or unwilling to eliminate. Article 27 of the Constitution states that "all citizens
 are equal before the law, and are entitled to equal protection by the law." In prac-
 tice, legal provisions aimed at eliminating discrimination are not strongly enforced.
 Social programs designed to help disadvantaged groups are often insufficient or not
 fully implemented.
 Women.-Women continue to hold a subordinate place in Bangladesh society.
 While their position has improved in the last decade, progress has been slow. Even
 though some 80 percent of the population lives in rural areas where women's tradi-
 tional role is crucial to the well-being and success of the family and community,
 women are nevertheless generally considered an economic liability and receive infe-
 rior treatment. Most nutrition, health, and educational indicators show that
 Bangladeshi women fare worse than men.
 Article 28 of the Constitution specifically prohibits government discrimination
 against any citizen on grounds of sex. Despite this provision, women do not enjoy
 equal status with men under the law. The 1961 Muslim Family Ordinance, for ex-
 ample, provides for less inheritance for women than for male family members and
 more limited divorce rights. Men are permitted to have up to four wives. Under
 criminal and civil law, women are granted equal status. In practice, however, high
 illiteracy rates (greater among women than men) and unequal educational opportu-
 nities often mean that women are unaware of their rights. Strong social stigmas and
 lack of economic means to obtain legal assistance frequently prevent women from
 seeking redress in the courts, which are in any event heavily backlogged (see Sec-
 tion I.e.). A small number of legal awareness programs targeted at women have had
 limited impact. Women enjoy full voting rights which they exercise openly in at
 least equal numbers with men.
 In education and employment women occupy a measurably weaker position. By
 tradition, and perhaps in response to women's lack of economic opportunities (which
 
 
 1328
 tends to perpetuate the cycle), families tend to invest more in male than female edu-
 cation. Among the majority rural population, only 30 percent of primary school stu-
 dents are female. This figure drops to below 25 percent at the secondary level and
 below 15 percent at the college and university level. While economic opportunities
 for women have grown faster than those for men in the last decade, women still
 occupy only a small fraction of the wage-earning jobs, except in the garment indus-
 try. Less than 5 percent of all government jobs are held by women. A policy of en-
 suring more women among new hires has had limited effect as the Government has
 been unable to reach its stated goal of 15 percent.
 Violence against women is part of, and at the same time overshadowed by, the
 general repression of women in society. Specific acts of violence are difficult to quan-
 tify because of unreliable statistics. Due to the second-class status of women in soci-
 ety, most incidents go unreported because they are either ignored by the authorities
 or suppressed by the family or community. An indication of the level of violence
 against women was revealed in the statistics released by the Government in October
 on reorded cases of suicide in the country for the previous 22 months. According
 to these figures, women had a considerably higher suicide rate (57 versus 42 per-
 cent) than the majority male population. In 1993 human rights monitors reported
 five incidents in which unofficial community councils carried out judgments, usually
 floggings, against women accused of various moral offenses. One woman was report-
 edly stoned to death, and another was burned. The Government, which recognizes
 the role of traditional village councils in resolving local disputes, has said that it
 is seeking criminal prosecution of those involved in the death cases.
 The Government has enacted laws specifically prohibiting certain forms of dis-
 crimination agninst women, including the Anti-Dowry Prohibition Act of 1980 and
 the Cruelty to Women Law of 1983. Enforcement is weak, especially in the rural
 areas where most of the population resides, and the Government usually does not
 vigorously prosecute cases which are filed. While it is clear that dowry deaths do
 occur, there are no reliable statistics on their number or on the prosecution of per-
 petrators. The Government reports that under the Cruelty to Women Law 1,108
 cases were filed in the 12-month period ending in July 1993. By the end of 1993,
 only 14 of those cases had been prosecuted, and in only one case was a conviction
 obtained.
 Children.-The Government undertakes programs in the areas of primary edu-
 cation, health, family planning, and nutrition which target directly or have a direct
 impact on the welfare of children. Some programs have been quite successful. For
 instance, the Government's immunization program has raised childhood immuniza-
 tion rates in the urban areas from 3 percent to 82 percent. However, although reli-
 able expenditure figures are not available, it is clear that current resources are in-
 adequate to meet the needs of this vulnerable and major segment of the population.
 General health and social indicators clearly show that moat children face difficult
 odds in obtainin  ad  uate health care andeducation. Despite improvements made
 in the last decad in ncators such as infant mortaity and child morbidity rates re-
 main relatively high.
 The Government in 1991 made universal rimary education mandatory but stated
 that it could not implement the law in the foreseeable future. Pilot programs in one
 small area of each of Bangladesh's 64 districts were begun. In practice, among chil-
 dren 6 to 10 years of age, only about 50 percent are in school. Of those, approxi-
 mately 65 percent drop out before the age of 10.
 Primary education is currently underfunded in comparison with secondary schools
 and universities which together receive about 70 percent of the Government's ex-
 penditures on education. Recognizing the importance of primary education, the Gov-
 ernment in 1993 created a Division of Primary Education, separate from the Min-
 istry of Education and reporting directly to the Prime Minister's office.
 Human rights monitors have reported problems of children hem  abandoned, kid-
 naped, and sold into bondage, as well as a prwing problem of chid trafficking and
 prostitution schemes. When uncovered by the authorities, these have received wide
 public attention and condemnation. Police and border security forces are alert to
 and routinely check for signs of child trafficking. Government officials acknowledge,
 however, that a lack of resources and training limits their ability to tackle these
 problems.
 Indigenous People.-The issue of property rights for land traditionally held by the
 tribal people of Bangladesh, particularly those of the CHT, continues to cause claims
 of discrimination and to provoke acts of violence. Until 1985 the land of CHT tribal
 peoples, who frequently lacked proof of ownership, was regularly parceled out by the
 Government to Bengali settlers. There were also complaints of false deeds, physical
 attacks, unannounced mortgage foreclosures, and outright confiscation of land from
 suspected tribal insurgents. No reports of similar violations have been received in
 
 
 1329
 recent years, but longstanding complaints continue to be a fundamental factor un-
 derlying the insurgency in the CHT (see Section l.g.). The Government has moved
 toward granting more authority over local matters to the tribal people in the CHT.
 In July 1991, tribal-dominated local government councils assumed control over pri-
 mary education, health, family welfare, and agricultural extension. Government se-
 curity forces, however, continue to control issues of law and order as well as land
 use.
 Tribal peoples in other areas of Bangladesh in the past have also reported loss
 of land to Bengali Muslims through questionable legal practices and other means.
 Religious Minorities.-Religious minorities, principally Hindu, Christian, and
 Buddhist, make up an estimated 13 percent of the population. Although equal under
 the law, these minorities are, in practice, disadvantaged in such areas as access to
 government jobs and political office. Selection boards in the government services are
 often without minority group representation. In the current Parliament there are
 12 members from minority groups, out of a total of 330.
 Property ownership, particularly for Hindus, has been a contentious issue since
 independence, when many Hindus lost land holdings due to unequal application of
 the law. Reported cases of violence directed against religious minority communities
 has resulted in loss of property, most recently in the af math of the destruction
 of the Babri mosque in India in December 1992. These actions are a symptom of
 the communal tensions that have prompted some people belonging to minority
 groups to leave Bangladesh, causing a slow but steady decline in the relative size
 of the countrys minority population, especially Hindus.
 eople~ with Disabilities.-Aocording to government figures, there are approxi-
 mately 3 million disabled people in the countr. Banglades 's laws provide for equal
 treatment and freedom from discrimination or the disabled. The Government has
 not yet enacted specific legislation or otherwise mandated accessibility for the dis-
 abled. It has announced, however, that it is developing a national plan of action to
 address this and other ways of promoting the rights of disabled people.
 In 1993 the Ministry of Social Welfare reported that in the last year approxi-
 mately 100,000 disabled people benefited from programs to teach technical skills. An
 overall lack of resources directed toward the disabled, however, leaves them dis-
 advantaged and unable to benefit fully from legally prescribed rights. The disabled
 are particularly vulnerable to the problems of insufficient employment opportunities
 and inadequate health, education, and social services that affect the society as a
 whole.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Bangladesh Constitution guarantees freedom of
 association, the right to join unions, and, with government approval, the right to
 form a union. With the exception of workers in the railway, postal, telegraph, and
 telephone departments, government civil servants are forbidden to join unions. This
 ban also applies to security-related government employees, such as the military and
 police. Bangladeshi civil servants forbidden to join unions, such as teachers or
 nurses, have joined associations that perform functions similar to labor unions, i.e.,
 providing for members' welfare, offering legal services, and airing grievances. Collec-
 tive bargaining, however, is prohibited. Sme workers have formed unregistered
 unions. Curnt law also prohibits professional and industry-based unions in Ban-
 gladesh's two export processing zones (EPZ's).
 Workers in the two EPZ's have also skirted prohibitions on forming unions by set-
 ting up associations. The Government has stated that labor law restrictions on free-
 dom or association and formation of unions in the EPZ's will be lifted by 1997. In
 the burgeoning garment industry, there have been numerous complaints of workers
 being harassed and fired in some factories for trying to organize workers.
 Approximately 1.6 million members of the country's total work force of about 45
 to 50 million workers belong to unions. Only about 3 million workers are involved
 in the formal industrial sector. (There is a large unreported informal sector, and
 labor statistics are unreliable.)
 Ten to 15 percent of Bangladesh's a pproximately 4,200 labor unions are affiliated
 with 23 officially registered National Trade Union (NTU) centers (there are also sev-
 eral unregistered NTLJs). There are no legal restrictions on political activities by
 labor unions, though the calling of nationwide general strikes or transportation
 blockades by unions is considered a criminal rather than political act and thus for-
 bidden. Some unions have complained that the Government is using its
 antiterrorism law as a means to suppress both opposition political workers and
 union members, rather than bona fide terrorists.
 Unions are not part of the government structure. They are highly politicized, how-
 ever, and virtually all the NTU centers are affiliated with political parties, including
 
 
 1330
 one with the ruling BNP. Some unions are militant and engage in intimidation and
 vandalism. lilegal blockades of public transportation routes by strikers occurred sev-
 eral times in 1993, with scattered violence. Clashes between members of rival labor
 unions occurred in 1993, and at least two union leaders died in such incidents. On
 September 13, 25 workers were injured in clashes between armed Awami League
 and BNP labor front members at the large Adamjee jute mill.
 For a union to obtain and maintain its registration, 30 percent employee partici-
 pation is required. Workers are eligible for membership on the unions' executive
 staff, the size of which is set by law in proportion to the number of union members.
 Registration of a union may only be canceled by the Registrar of Trade Unions with
 the concurrence of the Labor Court, but no such actions were known to have been
 taken in 1993. There are no restrictions on affiliation with international labor orga-
 nizations, and Bangladeshi unions and federations maintain a variety of such links.
 Trade unionists are required to obtain government clearance to travel to Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO) meetings, but no clearances were reported denied
 in 1993.
 The right to strike is not specifically recognized in the law, but strikes are a com-
 mon form of protest. In 1993 university teachers struck over the issue of campus
 violence. Jute, textile, and sugar workers struck over the issues of minimum wages,
 privatization of industry, retrenchment of workers, and the detention of labor offi-
 cials.
 General strikes continue to be used by the political opposition to pressure the
 Government on political demands, causing significant economic and social disrup-
 tion through loss of work hours and production. Wildcat strikes are illegal but occur
 frequently, with varying government response.
 The Essential Services Ordinance permits the Government to bar strikes for 3
 months in any sector it decides is "essential." This ban, which is generally obeyed,
 was applied in 1993 to national airline pilots and water supply workers and pre-
 viously has been applied to shipping operations and electricity supply workers. The
 Government is empowered to prohibit a strike or lockout at any time before or after
 the strike or lockout begins and to refer the dispute to the Labor Court. Mechanisms
 for conciliation, arbitration, and Labor Court dispute resolutions were established
 under the Industrial Relations Ordinance of 1969. Workers have the right to strike
 in the event of a failure to achieve a bipartite settlement. If a strike lasts 30 days
 or longer, the Government may prohibit the strike and refer the dispute to the
 Labor Court for adjudication. This took place in several cases in 1993, but no deci-
 sions were reached by the court. Such delayed decisions are frequent, usually due
 to nonattendance by employers or the union. Both sides use the tactic of delay, em-
 p loyers attempting to keep workers on the job, and union leaders, short of strike
 fund, allowing workers to return to work without calling off the strike.
 There are provisions in the Bangladesh Industrial Relations Ordinance for the im-
 munity of registered unions or officers from civil liability. Enforcement of these pro-
 visions is uneven. In the case of illegal work actions, such as transportation block-
 ades, police arrest union members under either the Special Powers Act, the
 Antiterrorism Law, or regular criminal codes.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-Free collective bargaining is
 legal only for private sector workers in Bangladesh, on condition that the workers
 are represented by unions legally registered as collective bargaining agents by the
 Registrar of Trade Unions. Collective bargaining occurs on occasion in lare private
 enterprises, but, with unemployment in the 30 percent range, workers concerns
 with job security often outweigh wage and other is sues. During three major strike
 calls in 1993, worker attendane at private factories remained high. Collective bar-
 gaining generally does not occur in small private enterprises.
 Pi;bhi~c stor workers' pay levels and other benefits are reommended by the Na-
 tional Pay and Wages Cormnission. The Commission's reommendations are binding
 and may not be disputed except on the issue of implementation.
 Under the Industrial Relations Ordinance, there is considerable leeway for dis-
 crimination against union members and organizers by employers. For example the
 Ordinance allows arbitrary transfer of workers suspected of union activities. dom-
 plaints that employers routinely engage in antiunion discrimination are particularly
 igh in the garment industry. In practice private sector employers tend to discour-
 ape any union activity. The Registrar of Trade Unions rules on discrimination com-
 plamts. In a number of cases, the court has ordered the reinstatement of workers
 fired for union activities. However, the Labor Court's overall effectiveness is dam-
 aged by a serious case backlog, and there have also been allegations that some of
 its deliberations have been corrupted by employers. Unions are prohibited and no
 collective bargaining takes place in the export processing zones. The Government
 has stated that restrictions on unions in these zones will be lifted by 1997.
 
 
 1331
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. The Factories Act and Shops and Establishment Act, 1965, set
 up inspection mechanisms to enforce laws against forced labor but resources for en-
 forcement are few. These laws are not rigorously enforced. While Bangladesh does
 not experience large-scale, bonded labor, there is forced labor to the extent that
 workers are often required to work later than stipulated by law. This is the case
 in the garment industry, which operates in high-volume, short-deadline modes of
 production.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Bangladesh has laws that prohibit
 labor by children. The Factories Act of 1965 bars children under the age of 15 from
 working in factories. This law also stipulates that young workers (i.e., children and
 adolescents) are only allowed to work a maximum 5-hour day and only between the
 hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.
 In reality, enforcement of these rules is inadequate. According to United Nations
 estimates about one-third of Bangladesh's population under the age of 18 is work-
 ing. Children are commonly seen drivg ric-kshaws, breaking bricks at construction
 sites, and working at tea stalls. Children also routinely perform domestic work.
 Cases of children being physically abused and occasionally killed by the head of
 households where they work are reported in the press. Under the law, each child
 must attend school through the ffthl grade. However, the Government continues to
 maintain that it does not have the resources to implement this law immediately in
 the entire country.
 In anticipation of possible U.S. legislation prohibiting the import of products made
 by child labor, thousands of underage children employed in Bangladesh's garment
 industry were fired in 1993. A cooperative effort to rehabilitate the estimated 70,000
 children who will ultimately lose their jobs in the garment industry is being mount-
 ed by the Bangladesh Government, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF),
 the ILO, and nongovernmental organizations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Instead,
 the wage commission sets wages industry by industry. In most cases, private sector
 employers ignore this wage structure, arguing that low labor productivity vitiates
 any argument for a set wage. In 1993 the Confederation of Labor Unions (SKOP)
 won a minimum wage agreement for public sector factory workers that fell slightly
 short of the level recommended by the wage commission. According to the agree-
 ment government factory workers will receive about $24 a month (950 taka) plus
 benefits, effective in July 1993. Private sector wages tend to fall below the total gov-
 ernment wage and benefits package. The average wage of private sector workers in
 similar industries is several hundred taka less.
 The law sets a standard 48-hour workweek with 1 day off mandated. A 60-hour
 workweek, inclusive of a maximum 12 hours of overtime, is allowed. The law is
 poorly enforced in industries such as hosiery and ready-made garments. Relative to
 the average standard of living in Bangladesh the average monthly wage could be
 described as sufficient to support life but not by any means a good wage for a fam-
 ily.
 The Factories Act of 1965 nominally sets occupational health and safety stand-
 ards. The law is comprehensive but appears to be largely ignored by many
 Bangladeshi employers. Workers may resort to legal action for enforcement of the
 law's provisions, but few cases are actually prosecuted. Enforcement by the Labor
 Ministry's industrial inspectorate is weak. Due to high unemployment and inad-
 equate enforcement of the laws, workers demanding correction of dangerous working
 conditions, or refusing to participate in perceived dangerous activities, risk losing
 their jobs.
