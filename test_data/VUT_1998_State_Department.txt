 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, a small South Pacific island nation of approximately 170,000 people
 which was jointly administered by'Britain and France prior to its independence in
 1980, has a parliamentary form of government with a 52-member Parliament, a
 Prime Minister, and a President. The latter's powers are largely ceremonial, except
 when acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Political legitimacy is based
 on majority rule. The courts are normally independent of executive interference.
 The civilian authorities control the small police force and its paramilitary wing,
 the Vanuatu Mobile Force (VMF): Under current regulations, the Police Commis-
 sioner commands the entire force, including the VMF.
 Subsistence and small-scale agricultural production and fishing support more
 than 80 percent of the population. Copra, cocoa, and beef cattle are the main cash
 crops. The service sector-government, tourism, and an offshore financial center-
 provides most formal employment and represents the largest component of the coun-
 try's gross domestic product.
 Reports of police brutality, and extremely poor prison conditions, together with
 discrimination and violence against women, were the country's major human rights
 problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect foF the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Constitutional provisions against torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment usually are observed in practice and enforced by the courts.
 January protests in Port Vila led to widespread rioting, looting, and violence, and
 on January 13, President Jean Marie Leye declared a 2-week state of emergency.
 The police announced "Operation Restore Public Hope" and drew up a list of some
 500 persons to be arrested or detained on charges of looting, unlawful assembly, re-
 ceiving stolen goods, and criminal damage to property. Most of the arrests occurred
 over a 24-hour period, with the majority of the detainees voluntarily turning them-
 selves in.
 However, a number of those arrested complained about their treatment by the po-
 lice and the VMF. There were credible reports that officers repeatedly, deliberately,
 and severely kicked and punched prisoners. Some suspects filed complaints alleging
 that they were beaten in order to force them to reveal the names of other suspects.
 Several dozen persons released from custody reportedly sought medical treatment
 for injuries. The victims claimed to have been punched, kicked, and-hit by rifle butts
 in the face and upper torso. For example, Gregory Gideon stated that, after his ar-
 rest VMF officers repeatedly punched and kicked him, and beat him with the butts
 of their firearms. When he subsequently collapsed in his cell, he apparently was
 taken by police officers to a hospital where they left him at the front door without
 alerting medical staff. Hospital staff report that he was developing shock symptoms
 from massive internal bleeding, and he underwent life-saving, emergency surgery to
 remove his spleen.
 Shortly after these events, police internal investigators opened an investigation
 into the complaints of mistreatment. The Ombudsman's Office also started an inves-
 tigation. As a result of the investigation the Acting Public Prosecutor brought
 charges of "intentional assaultP against 18 VMF and police officers, 2 of senior rank.
 At year's end their trial still is pending.
 A September Amnesty International (Al) report described extremely poor condi-
 tions in the prison system, with deficiencies including buildings made unsafe by
 earthquakes and water seepage, and a lack of safe accommodations for female pris-
 oners.

 The Government permits visits by human rights monitors, and an Al delegation
 visited in February.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Normally there are no reports of arbi-
 trary arrests, however, during the 2-week state of emergency normal safeguards
 were suspended and hundreds of persons were arrested (see Section 1.c.). Arrest is
 by warrant.
 The Constitutional provision that suspects must be informed of the charges and
 given a speedy hearing before a judge is observed in practice. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The courts are normally free of military or execu-
 tive interference. On February 28, apparently with the intention of forestalling any
 political interference stemming from the 2-week state of emergency (see Section
 1.c.), the Supreme Court issued a "joint declaration" of judges and magistrates on
 "the basic principles on the independence of the judiciary., Signed by almost all
 judges and magistrates, the declaration affirmed the principles of judicial independ-
 ence, fair trial, freedom of speech, and freedom from any interference or intimida-
 tion in the operation and jurisdiction of the judiciary.
 Most routine legal matters appear before magistrate's courts. There is also a Su-
 preme Court, and above the Supreme Court an Appeals Court with three judges,
 two of whom are appointed by the President and chosen from among supreme court
 judges in other south Pacific nations as required.
 The judicial system is based on British law. The courts uphold constitutional pro-
 visions for a fair public trial, presumption of innocence until guilt is proven, prohibi-
 tion against double jeopardy, the right of judicial determination of the validity of
 arrest or detention, and appeal to the Supreme Court. However, the executive has
 tried to pressure the largely expatriate judiciary in cases with political implications.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspond-
 ence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press; however, these provisions have not always been honored in practice.
 The Government controls much of the country's media, including a semiweekly
 newspaper, one AM and one FM radio station, and a limited-service television sta-
 tion confined to the capital, Port Vila, which provides English and French news
 service three times a week. There is also a growing independent newspaper, which
 is published semiweekly. Opposition political parties and groupings occasionally
 publish newsletters.
 Throughout the year, both the government-owned and the independent press re-
 ported criticisms of political leaders freely and apparently without hindrance. Cor-
 respondents for international media are also allowed to report without interference.
 The Government respects academic freedom. Vanuatu has three institutions of
 higher education-a teachers college, an agricultural school, and an annex of the
 University of the South Pacific.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Permits must be obtained to
 hold public demonstrations and rallies; they are routinely granted.
 The Government does not restrict the forming of political parties and other
 groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment respected it in practice. Missionaries of various Christian denominations work
 without restriction. The 1995 Religious Bodies Act, which required religious organi-
 zations to register with the Government, was repealed in 1997. There is no evidence
 that it was ever enforced, although some churches registered under the act volun-
 tarily.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-All citizens are free to travel internally and externally and to return
 from abroad without restrictions.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum. The issue of the provision of first asylum has never arisen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for parliamentary elections every 4 years, through
 which citizens can freely change their government. Parliamentary majorities have
 been unstable, with legislators spending much time and energy accumulating sup-
 port for votes of no confidence on the one hand and fending them off on the other.
 Faced with a threatened motion of no confidence against the sitting Government
 
 
 1088
 
 and the possibility of a new government arising from a realignment of Members of
 Parliament (which would have been the fourth such realignment since the 1994
 elections), the President dissolved Parliament in November 1997. In January the
 Appeals Court confirmed the President's action. New elections were held on March
 6, and on March 30, Donald Kalpokas, the leader of the Vanu'aku Party, was elected
 Prime Minister with the support of 35 of the 52 members of Parliament.
 Outside observers consider the 1998 elections to have been generally free and fair.
 A total of 216 candidates contested 52 seats. Average voter turnout was 63.6 per-
 cent.
 Traditional attitudes, in which men are dominant and women are frequently lim-
 ited to customary family roles, hamper women from taking a more active role in eco-
 nomic and political life. Six women, including the sole sitting female member, ran
 for parliament in 1998; none were elected. The Ombudsman is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on the formation of local human rights organizations.
 The Vanuatu Human Rights Education Association runs programs that educate citi-
 zens regarding their rights. It has a special focus on women's rights.
 Angered over her vigorous investigations of corruption allegations, in 1997 Par-
 liament repealed the 1995 Ombudsman's Act, and, on June 26, the Supreme Court
 upheld the repeal and the President signed the legislation. A new Ombudsman's Act
 was passed by Parliament in November.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1980 Constitution provides fundamental rights and freedoms to "all persons
 . . . without discrimination on the grounds of race, place of origin, religious or tradi-
 tional beliefs, political opinions, language, or sex." Despite constitutional and legal
 protections, women remain victims of discrimination in this tradition-based society.
 Due to high rates of unemployment, there are few jobs available to the disabled.
 Women.-Violence against women, particularly wife beating, is believed to be com-
 mon, although no accurate statistics exist. Courts occasionally prosecute offenders
 using common law assault as a basis for prosecution since there are no specific laws
 against wife beating. However, most cases of violence against women, including
 rape, go unreported because women, particularly in rural areas, are reluctant to re-
 port them for fear of further abuse. In addition police are frequently reluctant to
 intervene in what are considered to be domestic matters.
 While women have equal rights under the law, they are only slowly emerging
 from a traditional culture characterized by male dominance, a general reluctance to
 educate women, and a widespread belief that women should devote themselves pri-
 marily to childbearing. In announcing Vanuatu's ratification of the United Nations
 Convention on Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)
 at the 1995 U.N. Conference on Women in Beijing, the then-Deputy Prime Minister
 stated that it would take time to implement the laws giving equal rights to women.
 The majority of -women enter into marriage through "bride-price payment," a prac-
 tice that encourages men to view women as property. Women are also inhibited by
 tradition from owning land, and at least one women's advocate believes this limita-
 tion serves to underpin their secondary status. Many female leaders view village
 chiefs as a major obstacle to attaining social, political and economic rights for
 women. Women interested in running for public office get encouragement and help
 from  a  nongovernmental organization   (NGO), Vanuatu    Women    in  Politics
 (VANWIP). Four of the six women who ran for Parliament in the 1998 election ran
 under the VANWIP banner.
 Children.-Although the Government has made education a priority, access to
 education is limited and school attendance is not compulsory. Children are protected
 within the traditional extended-family system. Members of the extended family, par-
 ticularly paternal uncles, play an active role in a child's development. As a result,
 virtually no children are homeless or abandoned. There is no societal pattern of
 abuse, although cases of child abuse are occasionally reported.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no known governmental or national policy on
 the disabled and no legislation mandating access for them. Their protection and care
 is left to the traditional extended family and to voluntary NGO's.
 National/ Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Most of the population is made up of Mela-
 nesians. Small minorities of Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese, Tongans, and Europeans
 are generally concentrated in two towns and on, a few plantations; they experience
 discrimination with regard to land ownership. There is no evidence to suggest a pat-
 
 
 1089
 
 tern of ethnic discrimination in the provision of the limited basic services that the
 Government provides.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides workers with the right to organize
 unions.
 ApDroximately 29,000 persons participate in the formal economy as wage earners.
 There are five trade unions. The unions are grouped under an umbrella organiza-
 tion, the Vanuatu Council of Trade Unions (VCTU). The trade unions are independ-
 ent of the Government.
 The high percentage of the population still engaged in subsistence agriculture and
 fishing deters extensive union activity. In addition membership in the Vanuatu Pub-
 lic Servants Union fell dramatically following the Government's wholesale dismissal
 of hundreds of full-time public servants during a protracted general strike in 1994.
 The Supreme Court in 1994 ruled that the union had not complied with its own
 rules when it undertook the general strike and declared the strike illegal. Combined
 union membership in the private and public sectors reportedly has fallen from more
 than 4,000 to less than 1,000 in the aftermath of the 1994 strike.
 The law prohibits retribution if the strike is legal. In the case of private-sector
 employees, violations would be referred to the Labor Department for conciliation
 and arbitration. In the public sector, the Public Service Commission would handle
 violations.
 In 1995 Parliament passed a law requiring unions to give 30 days' notice of intent
 to strike, with a list of the names of intending strikers.
 There was no significant strike activity during the year.
 Unions may not affiliate with international labor federations without government
 permission. The VCTU is a member of the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions exercise the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. Labor unions negotiate wages and conditions di-
 rectly with management. If the two sides cannot agree, the matter is referred to a
 3-member arbitration board appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs. The board
 consists of one representative from organized labor, one from management, and the
 senior magistrate of the magistrate's court. While a dispute is before the board,
 labor may not strike and management may not dismiss union employees. Unions
 and management, however, generally reach agreement on wages without having to
 refer the matter to arbitration. Complaints of antiunion discrimination are referred
 to the Commissioner of Labor. While the law does not require union recognition,
 once a union is recognized, it does prohibit antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including forced and bonded labor by children, and there were no re-
 ports that either adults or children were subject to conditions of forced, bonded, or
 compulsory labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits children under 12 years of age from working outside of family-owned agri-
 cultural production, where many children assist their parents. There were no re-
 ports of forced or bonded labor by children, which is prohibited by law (see Section
 6.c.). Employment of children from 12 to 18 years of age is restricted by occupational
 category and conditions of labor, for example, restrictions on employment in the
 shipping industry and on nighttime employment. The Labor Department effectively
 enforces these laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Vanuatu has a legislated minimum wage, ef-
 fectively enforced by the Labor Department. In 1995 it was raised to a flat rate of
 approximately $143 (16,000 vatu) per month for both urban and rural workers. The
 previous minimum wage was approximately $93 for rural workers and $107 (13,200
 vatu) for urban workers. The minimum wage would not support an urban family
 living entirely on the cash economy. Most families are not dependent solely on
 wages for their livelihoods.
 Various laws regulate the rights to sick leave, annual vacations, and other condi-
 tions of employment, including a 44-hour maximum workweek, with at least one 24-
 hour rest period weekly. Vanuatu's Employment Act, enforced by the Labor Depart-
 ment, includes provisions for safety standards. However, the 1987 safety and health
 legislation is inadequate to protect workers engaged in logging, agriculture, con-
 struction, and manufacturing, and the single inspector attached to the Labor De-
 partment is hard pressed to enforce the act fully. Workers have the right to remove
 themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued em-
 ployment.
