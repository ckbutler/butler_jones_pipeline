 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic, a democratic state built
 upon the principle of the rule of law. The sovereign power in
 Finland rests with the people as represented by their delegates
 assembled in Parliament. Legislative power is exercised by
 Parliament. Supreme executive power is vested in the
 President. A Council of State. consisting of a Prime Minister
 and sixteen Cabinet Ministers and responsible to Parliament,
 works with the President in governing the country. Judicial
 power is exercised by an independent judiciary consisting of
 the Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court. The
 Finnish people freely elect a 200-member unicameral Parliament
 every four years, and the President every six years. At
 present, there are eight political parties represented in the
 Parliament, four of which form a center-left coalition
 government.
 During 1983, there were no reported violations in Finland of
 fundamental human rights. In April 1983, the Parliament passed
 a new aliens act which will permit aliens in Finland to appeal
 an expulsion order of the Ministry of Interior to the Supreme
 Administrative Court. A general equal rights act, which would
 bring Finnish laws into conformity with the 1980 U.N.
 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
 Against Women, is presently being discussed in legislative
 committee, and could be enacted in 1984. During 1983,
 Parliament postponed enactment of a family name act which would
 have permitted women in Finland to retain their maiden names
 while married. However, this bill may be incorporated in the
 general equal rights act in 1984. There have been no cases of
 armed conflict or terrorist activity in Finland during 1983.
 Finland has a mixed economy with state-owned, privately owned,
 and publicly owned companies. Individuals are free in Finland
 to pursue their religious beliefs. They are also free to
 pursue without government interference their legitimate private
 interests, hold private property, and engage in economic
 activity. Non-Nordic aliens are prohibited in most cases from
 owning real property, joining trade unions and engaging in
 political activity. The security apparatus is controlled by
 elected officials and supervised by the courts. National
 minorities and women enjoy the same economic and political
 rights as the Finnish majority and men respectively. Finnish
 society is highly educated and 100 percent literate.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Killing for political motives by the Government or opposition
 political organizations is regarded as illegitimate,
 unwarranted, and indefensible. There have been no allegations
 of such conduct in Finland since World War II.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearances occurring in
 Finland in 1983 as a result of action by the Government or by
 elements of opposition political groups. There were no cases
 of abduction or clandestine detention by official,
 quasi-official, or opposition forces.

 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice. By
 law, prisoners must be treated justly with respect for their
 human dignity and without distinction made on the basis of
 race, color, sex, language, nationality, religious or political
 conviction, social position, wealth, or on any other grounds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment or exile is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. A suspect may be
 detained by the police for questioning for three days, but for
 special reasons this period may be extended for 14 additional
 days. The suspect may then be declared under arrest by certain
 superior police officers only, and immediate notice must be
 given to the court. During this investigative period, the
 accused may be denied access to a lawyer. Following formal
 arrest, the accused is permitted free access to the lawyer of
 his choice. The state will pay legal fees for the indigent.
 The court then sets the date for the hearing, which must take
 place within eight days of notification of the arrest (if in a
 city; within 30 days in rural areas). The circumstances of the
 arrest are subject to judicial review only when the accused is
 brought to trial. However, should the arrest be shown to have
 been incorrect, or should the accused be found innocent, he may
 apply to the same court for civil damages for loss of freedom.
 At present there is no pretrial judicial examination of an
 arrest, although a proposal to change pretrial procedures,
 including the institution of pretrial judicial examination, is
 being considered in Parliament.
 The institutions of habeas corpus and bail do not exist per se
 in Finland. Those accused of serious crimes must remain in
 custody by law. Those accused of minor offenses may be
 released on personal recognizance at the court's discretion.
 Preventive detention is authorized only during a declared state
 of war for narrowly defined offenses such as treason, mutiny,
 and trafficking in weapons. Supervisory personnel from the
 Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Interior, the
 parliamentary Ombudsman or the Chancellor of Justice have
 authority to enter prisons and order the release of prisoners
 held without charges. There have been no cases of exile being
 used as a punishment in Finland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Finnish citizens and aliens have the right to
 effective counsel. Charges must be clearly stated. Civilians
 may not be tried by military courts except in time of war.
 There are no separate "security" courts in Finland, although
 local courts may decide to conduct a trial behind closed doors
 in juvenile, matrimonial, and guardianship cases, or when the
 publicity would offend morality or endanger the national
 security of the state. In "national security" cases, the judge
 may withhold any or all information pertaining to charges
 against individuals, verdicts, and sentencing. Sanctions may
 be imposed if such information is made public. Provisional
 tribunals are constitutionally prohibited.
 
 
 975
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, including
 prohibition of eavesdropping and mail tampering, are guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. The Security Police is
 legally subject to judicial scrutiny.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Law and practice, an effective judiciary, an independent press,
 and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press. There have been no instances of
 abuse or legal decisions adversely affecting freedom of the
 press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is
 constitutionally guaranteed in Finland. However, if the
 purpose of the association is to influence political issues,
 only Finnish citizens may belong. Trade unions are
 constitutionally guaranteed the right to organize, assemble
 peacefully, and strike. Trade unions enjoy a protected status
 in Finland and play an important role in the political and
 economic life of the society. The trade union movement is
 dominated by a one-million-member, blue-collar confederation
 which plays an important political role within Finland,
 although its allegiances are organizationally divided between
 two political parties representing workers' interests. Three
 other confederations dominate the white collar and professional
 employees and play exclusively an economic role in the
 society. All trade unions are democratically organized and
 managed and are independent of both government and political
 parties. Most trade unions, as well as employers' bargaining
 units, maintain relations with their Nordic counterparts and
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Union (ICFTU)
 International Trade Secretariats. The four trade union
 confederations representing blue collar, white collar,
 professional, and technical personnel also maintain contact
 with the Soviet All Union Central Council of Trade Unions.
 Finnish trade unions freely participate in the International
 Labor Organization and the ICFTU as well as the World
 Federation of Trade Unions. The Finnish Government encourages
 voluntary organizations and subsidizes many private groups
 formed to achieve a public purpose. There are no restrictions
 on these organizations and they are permitted to maintain
 relations with other international groups in both Communist and
 Western countries.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Finland has two state religions: Evangelical Lutheran and
 Orthodox. Voluntary taxes are collected by the Government from
 church members to support these churches. In addition, Finland
 has Christian, Muslim and Jewish populations who enjoy
 unrestricted freedom of worship. About 93 percent of the
 population of Finland belongs to the Lutheran church.
 Membership in that church, however, confers no special or
 privileged status, but rather reflects the high degree of
 homogeneity of the population.
 
 
 976
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Finns are free to travel within the Nordic countries of
 Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden without passports
 and need not apply for exit visas for travel to other
 countries. For economic reasons over the last two decades, a
 large emigration of Finns to Sweden occurred, but many have
 since repatriated themselves and now net emigration is close to
 zero. No restrictions have been placed on emigration or
 repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Finland is a multiparty constitutional democracy in which the
 citizens freely elect their representatives from among multiple
 candidates representing a wide spectrum of political ideology
 and dogma. Democratic procedures also apply to legislation.
 Members of Parliament are bound only by their conscience in
 voting for bills proposed by their colleagues or more formally
 by the Cabinet. All Finnish citizens over age 18 have the
 right to participate in the election of their representatives.
 Women have held the right of suffrage since 1906, the first
 women in Europe to win this right. At present there are 62
 women in the unicameral 200-member Parliament and three women
 in the cabinet. Finland has a stable functioning parliamentary
 system, but until most recently, votes of no-confidence in the
 Finnish Parliament limited the average life of a government to
 about eight months. Finland has a proportional representation
 system that ensures that all political parties or factions with
 no more than five percent of the vote can obtain a
 representative in the Parliament. Finland is ethnically a
 homogeneous society with less than one percent of the
 population either foreign born or belonging to one of the
 national minorities: Gypsies, Sami (Lapps), Jews, and Turks.
 A large (six percent) Swedish-speaking minority is fully
 integrated in the society.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Finland participates actively in international human rights
 organizations and was a member of the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission during 1983. Finland has not been a subject
 of an international investigation of alleged human rights
 violations. Within Finland, several organizations monitor
 human rights performance, including the Finnish Red Cross, the
 government-sponsored Equality Council, the Women's Rights
 Union, and Amnesty International. Amnesty International did
 not discuss Finland in its 1983 report.
 Freedom House rates Finland "free," but adds that the Finnish
 media practice self-censorship in criticizing the Soviet
 Union. According to the report, those who cross the line are
 "admonished" by the Government to act with greater restraint.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Finland is a prosperous industrial market economy where private
 property is protected by law within a mixed economy of private
 owned, cooperative public, and state-owned enterprises.
 
 
 977
 Finland has a population of 4.85 million and produces 0.3
 percent of the world's output. Finland has a comprehensive
 social welfare system available to all citizens without regard
 to race, religion or sex. Its population is small and growing
 slowly at a rate of 0.5 percent. Life expectancy at birth is
 72.99 years with an infant mortality rate of seven per 1,000 in
 the first 12 months of life. In education, the World Bank
 reports that in Finland over 85 percent of the population in
 the relevant age group was enrolled in primary schools in
 1979. Finland enjoys a virtual 100 percent literacy rate. In
 1981 the World Bank data for gross national product (GNP) per
 capita placed Finland among the world's 20 richest countries
 with a per capita income of $10,369. Most Finns enjoy a healthy
 environment and most of the Finnish population has access to
 safe water. In 1979, the World Bank reported that Finns took
 in 115.6 percent of their calorie requirements.
 Although unemployment and inflation were problems in 1983,
 Finland reduced the level of unemployment from over 6 percent
 to 5.7 percent and decelerated the rate of inflation to an
 estimated 9 percent.
 According to the official national program for promoting
 equality, "The Government of Finland regards the prevailing
 inequality between men and women in society as a serious
 shortcoming." To redress existing inequities, Finland
 established a government sponsored Council for Equality which
 coordinates and sponsors legislation to meet the needs of women
 as workers, mothers, widows and retirees. According to
 spokesmen from Unioni, the leading women's rights group in
 Finland, the Equality Council has sponsored two bills designed
 to improve the status of women in Finland. The first, a
 comprehensive equal rights bill, was to ensure equal treatment
 for women in the workplace; and, the second, a family name
 bill, was to permit women to retain legally their maiden names
 after marriage. According to the Foreign Ministry's Legal
 Department, the family name bill is expected to be incorporated
 into the equal rights bill which may be passed into law in 1984.
 Goivernment statistics indicate that women's salaries as a
 percentage of their male counterparts rose in 1982 to 77
 percent in industry and 85 percent in government. Finnish
 female labor participation rate in 1982 was 61.7 percent.
 Finnish male labor force participation rate was 71.4 percent.
