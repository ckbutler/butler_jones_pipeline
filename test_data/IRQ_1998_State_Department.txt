 IUAQ*
 Political power in Iraq lies exclusively in a repressive one-party apparatus domi-
 nated by Saddam Hssein and members of his extended family. The provisional
 Constitution of 1968 stipulates that the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) governs
 Iraq through the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), which exercises both exec-
 utive and legislative authority. President Saddam Hussein, who is also Prime Min-
 ister, Chairman of the RCC, and Secretary General of the Regional Command of the
 ABSP, wields decisive power. Saddam Hussein and his regime continued to refer to
 an October 1995, nondemocratic "referendum" on his p residency in which he re-
 ceived 99.96 percent of the vote. This "referendum" included neither secret ballots
 nor opposing candidates, and many credible reports indicated that voters feared pos-
 sible reprisal for a negative vote. Ethnically and linguistically, the Iraqi population
 includes Arabs, Kurds, Turkomen, Assyrians, Yazidis, and Armenians. Historically,
 the religious mix is likewise varied: Shi'a and Sunni Muslims (both Arab and Kurd-
 ish), Christians (including Chaldeans and Assyrians), and Jews (most of whom have
 emigrated). Civil uprisings have occurred in recent years, especially in the north
 and the south. The Government has reacted against those who resist it with ex-
 treme repression The judiciary is not independent, and the President can override
 any court decision.
 The Government's security apparatus includes militias attached to the President,
 the Ba'ath Party, and the Interior Ministry. The security forces play a central role
 in maintaining the environment of intimidation and fear on which government
 power rests. Security forces committed widespread, serious, and systematic human
 isht                                            albusese.in
 -The Government owns all major industries and controls most of the highly cen-
 tralized economy, which is based largely on oil production. The economy was dam-
 aged by the Iran-Iraq and Gulf Wars, and Iraq has been subjected to United Na-
 tions sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. As a result, the economy has been
 stagnant. Sanctions ban all exports, except for oil sales under U.N. Security Council
 Resolutions (UNSCR's) 1153 and 1210 (the "oil-for-food" program), and allow im-
 ports, primarily food, medicine, and other humanitarian goods for essential civilian
 needs. The Government's failure to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions
 has resulted in the maintenance of the sanctions. In March, the ceiling on Iraq's
 oil exports was raised to $5.2 billion every 6 months and provision has been made
 for the import of approved spare parts to facilitate expansion of U.N.-controlled oil
 exports.
 The Government continued to interfere routinely with the international commu-
 nity's provision of humanitarian assistance to the populace by placing a higher pri-
 ority on importing industrial items than on food and medicine, diverting goods to
 benefit the regime, and restricting the work of U.N. personnel and relief workers.
 U.N. and European Union observers attribute the country's poor economic cendi-
 tions to the Government's actions, not to the sanctions regime. In response to an
 increase in international humanitarian aid, the Government announced on June 6
 that it would refuse to accept shipments of humanitarian aid from other govern-
 ments and nongovernmental agencies (NGO's). The Government stated that it pre-
 *The United States does not have diplomatic representation in Iraq. This report draws to a
 large extent on non-U.S. Government sources.

 viously had accepted such aid only to effect contacts with organizations and nations
 that might support Iraq politically. Some humanitarian aid was allowed into the
 country after June, but only on a case-by-case basis and with clear political over-
 tones. For example, aid from Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia
 was refused consistently- The Iraqi opposition reports that the Government ordered
 the confiscation of all aricultural crops in February in order to maintain its monop-
 oly on the supply of fod. Later, in what appeared to be a further attempt to
 strengthen political power by controlling food supplies, the Government imposed a
 tax on all imported goods.
 There was no improvement in the Government's extremely poor human rights
 record. Citizens do not have the right to change their government. The Government
 continued to execute summarily perceived political opponents and leaders in the
 Shi'a religious community. Reports suggest that persons were executed merely be-
 cause of their association with an opposition group or as part of an effort to clear
 out of the prisons anyone with a sentence of 15 to 20 years or more. The Govern-
 ment continued to kill and torture persons accused of economic crimes, military de-
 sertion, and a variety of other charges. Iraqi military operations continued to target
 Sh'a Arabs living in the southern marshes Security forces routinely tortured de-
 tainees. Prison conditions are poor. The authorities routinely used arbitrary arrest
 and detention. The judiciary is not independent, the President can override any
 court decision, and the Government continues to deny citizens the right to due proc-
 ess. The Government continues to infringe on citizens' privacy rights. The Govern-
 ment has made use of civilians, including small children, as "human shields"
 against military attacks. The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Iraq confirmed in his Sep-
 tember report that freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and association do not
 exist, except in some parts of the north under the control of Kurdish factions. The
 Government severely limits freedom of religion and movement. The Government
 prohibits the establishment of independent human rights organizations. Human
 rights abuse remained difficult to document because of the Government's efforts to
 conceal the facts, including its persistent refusal to grant visits to human rights
 monitors and continued restrictions designed to prevent dissent. Denied entry to
 Iraq, Max Van der Stoel, the Special Rapporteur for Iraq of the U.N. Commission
 on Human Rights, based his reports on the Government's human rights abuses on
 interviews with recent emigres from Iraq, interviews with opposition groups with
 contacts in Iraq, and other interviews, and on published reports. Violence against
 women occurs, and the Government discriminates against women. The Government
 neglects the health and nutritional needs of children, and discriminates against reli-
 gious minorities and ethnic groups. The Government restricts worker rights, and
 child labor persists.
 The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) committed numerous abuses against civil-
 ians in the north.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Klling.-The Government has a long record
 of executing perceived opponents. The U.N. Special Rapporteur, the international
 media, and other groups all report a heightened number of summary executions in
 Iraq since 1997, assertions which are supported in detail by several sources in Iraq.
 The Special Rapporteur has stated that "the country is run through extrajudicial
 measures." The list of offenses requiring a mandatory death penalty has grown sub-
 stantially in recent years and now includes anything that could be characterized as
 "sabotaging the national economy," including forgery, as well as smuggling cars,
 spare parts, material, heavy equipment, and machinery. The Special Rapporteur
 also noted that membership in certain political parties is punishable by death, that
 there is a pervasive fear of death for any act or expression of dissent, and that there
 are recurrent reports of the use of the death penalty for such offenses as "insulting"
 the President or the Ba'ath Party. These killings occured with total impunity and
 without due process.
 The regime periodically eliminated large numbers of political detainees en masse.
 During the year the Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports referring to an
 execution campaign taking place in Abu Ghraib and Radwaniyah prisons. Opposi-
 tion groups alleged that all political prisoners with sentences of more than 15 to 20
 years were subject to summary execution. Those few citizens able to protest the exe-
 cution campaign have persisted in attempts to document the killings. Opposition
 groups, including the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI),
 the Iraqi Communist Party (ICP), and the Iraqi National Congress (INC) provided
 detailed accounts of summary executions, including the names of hundreds of per-
 
 
 1675
 sons killed. In their joint statement in September, Iraqi Kurdish leaders pointed to
 the continuing reports of summary executions as evidence of Iraqi non-compliance
 with U.N. Security Council Resolution 688.
 Specifically, sources in Iraq reported that 400 prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison
 were executed summarily in February, with 60 more killed in March and 62 in
 June. In March the Shi'a opposition reported that 60 Iraqis from al Nasiriyah prov-
 ince were executed. In April 100 detainees from Radwaniyah Prison reportedly were
 taken to Ramadi province where they were buried alive in a pit. In May opposition
 sources released the names of 38 individuals who were executed summarily. Lists
 of more than 170 detainees executed between mid-December 1997 and July 1998
 were provided to the Special Rapporteur. In July and August, 13 more summary
 executions reportedly took place.
 In October the London-based Center for Human Rights of the Iraqi Communist
 Party reported the execution of 125 political prisoners held since the 1991 Gulf War
 in the Abu Ghraib prison. The group listed the names of the executed prisoners, in-
 cluding 3 Egyptians and 29 military officers and enlisted men, some in the elite Re-
 publican Guard and the air force. In November, 122 political prisoners reportedly
 were killed at Radwaniya and more than 150 in the southern city of Amara report-
 edly were ordered killed by Qusay Hussein (Saddam Hussein's son). A possible 39
 more reportedly were killed in December in the city of Karbala. The opposition re-
 ports that an additional 81 political prisoners were killed in December at the Abu
 Ghraib prison and that the bodies of 15 of the victims were returned to their fami-
 lies. Along with the reported killings of 25 or more military officers during Oper-
 ation Desert Fox, the total summary execution toll attributable to the regime for Oc-
 tober through December amounted to nearly 500 persons.
 Although international monitors still were refused entry to the prisons, an indica-
 tion of their extraordinarily overcrowded state came in May, when Labor and Social
 Affairs Minister Abdul Hamid Aziz Sabah stated in an interview in the weekly
 newspaper Nabath al Shabab that "the prisons are filled to five times their capacity
 and the situation is serious." After the interview, Sabah was dismissed from his post
 and the government-owned daily newspaper Babel reiterated the Government's
 long-standing claim that it holds virtually no prisoners, and that Sabah's statements
 had "undermined the national interest."
 The Government's motive for so many summary executions-probably more than
 2,000 to 3,000 since 1997-is not known. Some observers believe that it is simply
 a inhuman effort to clear out overcrowded prisons. Others (noting the abusive na-
 ture of some of the killings and that, in some cases, bodies are released to family
 members bearing clear signs of torture) believe that this is an attempt to intimidate
 anyone considering protesting against or working to change the present Govern-
 ment. There are persistent reports that Uday Hussein, Saddam Hussein's oldest
 son, has remained active in carrying out extrajudicial killings. As in previous years,
 there also were numerous credible reports that the regime executed persons alleg-
 edly involved in plotting- against Saddam Hussein or the Ba'ath Party, including
 high-ranking civilian, military, and tribal leaders.
 The Special Rapporteur also has received detailed information concerning what he
 has called "political killings," which he previously described as the preplanned
 killings of individuals carried out by government agents. In July the Special
 Rapporteur expressed concern about the killings of two internationally respected re-
 ligious scholars, Grand Ayatollah Shaykh Mirza Ali al-Gharawi, age 68, and Aya-
 tollah Shaykh Murtada al-Burujerdi, age 69, which he fears are part of a systematic
 attack by Iraqi officials on the independent leadership of Shi'a Muslims in Iraq (see
 Section 2.c.).
 Economic crimes also may be punishable by death. In December 1997, four Jor-
 danian students were executed for smuggling $850 worth of car parts. In response
 to an inquiry from the Special Rapporteur, the Government replied that the four
 Jordanians had been tried in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure and
 that they had been sentenced to death on charges of smuggling spare parts, mate-
 rial, heavy equipment and machinery after it had been dismantled.
 There continued to be reports of death due to poor prison conditions (see Section
 1.c.). Many persons who were displaced forcibly still live in tent camps under harsh
 conditions, which results in many deaths (see Section 2.d.).
 As in previous years, the regime continued to deny totally the widespread killings
 of Kurds in northern Iraq during the "Anfal" Campaign of 1988 (see Sections 1.b.
 and 1.g.). Both the Special Rapporteur and Human Rights Watch have concluded
 that the Government's policies against the Kurds raise issues of crimes against hu-
 manity and violations of the 1948 Genocide Convention.
 
 
 1676
 Political killings and terrorist actions continued in northern Iraq. Throughout the
 year, elements of the PKK remained active there, reportedly killing local residents
 in an effort to control a territorial base.
 b. Disappearance.-The Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports of wide-
 spread disappearances. The Government continued to ignore the more than 15,000
 cases conveyed to it in 1994 and 1995 by the U.N., as well as requests from the
 Governments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on the whereabouts of those missing from
 the 1990-91 occupation of Kuwait and from Iran on the whereabouts of POW's Iraq
 captured in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
 The United Nations has documented over 16,000 cases of persons who have dis-
 appeared. According to the Special Rapporteur, most of these cases occurred during
 the Anfal Campaign. He estimates that the total number of Kurds who disappeared
 during Anfal could reach the tens of thousands. Human Rights Watch estimates the
 total at between 70,000 and 150,000, and Amnesty International (AI) at more than
 100,000.
 In a 1997 report, Amnesty International documented the repeated failure by the
 Government to respond to requests for information about persons who have dis-
 appeared. The report detailed unresolved cases dating from the early 1980's through
 the mid-1990's, particularly the disappearances of Aziz al-Sayyid Jassem, Sayyid
 Muhammad Sadeq Muhammad Ridha al-Qazwini, Mazin Abd al-Munim al-
 Samarra'i, the six al-Hashimi brothers, the four al-Sheibani brothers, and numerous
 persons of Iranian descent or of the Shi'a branch of Islam. The report concludes that
 few of these victims became targets of the regime for any crime; rather, they were
 arrested as "hostages" in order to force a relative who may have escaped abroad to
 surrender, because of their family link to a political opponent, or simply for their
 ethnic origin (also see Section 1.f.).
 In other cases, individuals arrested or taken prisoner in specific circumstances
 have disappeared while in government custody. For example, the status of six mem-
 bers of the Assyrian community of Baghdad, arrested in October 1996, is unknown.
 Hundreds still are missing in the aftermath of the brief Iraqi military occupation
 of Irbil in August 1996. Many of these persons may have been killed surreptitiously
 late in 1997 and throughout 1998, in the reported regime campaign to "cleanse the
 prisons" (see Section L.a.). Thirty-three members of the Yazidi community of Mosul,
 who were arrested in July 1996, are still unaccounted for.
 The Special Rapporteur and several, human rights groups continued to request
 that the Government provide information about the arrest in 1991 of the late Grand
 Ayatollah Abdul Qasim Al-Khoei and 108 of his associates. The Ayatollah died while
 under house arrest in Al-Najaf. Others arrested with him have not been accounted
 for, and the Government refuses to respond to queries regarding their status.
 The Government failed to return, or account for, a large number of Kuwaiti citi;-
 zens and citizens of other countries detained during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
 Government officials, including military leaders known to have been among the last
 to see the persons who disappeared during the occupation, have refused to respond
 to the hundreds of outstanding inquiries about the missing. Of 609 cases of missing
 Kuwaiti citizens under review by the Quadrilateral Commission on Gulf War Miss-
 ing, only 2 have been resolved. The Government denies having any knowledge of
 the others and claims that any relevant records were lost in the aftermath of the
 Gulf War. Iran reports that 5,000 Iranian prisoners of war (POW's) from the Iran-
 Iraq War are unaccounted for by Iraq.
 In addition to the tens of thousands of reported disappearances, human rights
 groups reported during the year that the Government continued to hold thousands
 of other Iraqis in incommunicado detention (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, however, the security services routinely tortured
 detainees. According to former detainees, torture techniques included branding, elec-
 tric shocks administered to the genitals and other areas, beating, burning with hot
 irons, suspension from rotating ceiling fans, dripping acid on the skin, rape, break-
 ing of limbs, denial of food and water, and threats to rape or otherwise harm family
 members and relatives. The security forces killed many of their torture victims and
 mutilated their bodies before returning them to the victims' families. There are per-
 sistent reports that the families are made to pay for the costs of the execution. Iraqi
 refugees arriving in Europe often reported instances of torture to receiving govern-
 ments and displayed scars and mutilations to-substantiate their claims. Amnesty
 International notes that Iraqi authorities have failed to investigate these reports.
 The Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports that persons arrested rou-
 tinely are subject to mistreatment including prolonged interrogations accompanied
 by torture, beatings, and various deprivations. For some years, the Special
 Rapporteur has expressed concern about cruel and unusual punishments prescribed
 
 
 1677
 by the law, including amputations and brandings. The government has argued in
 the past few years that these punishments have not been imposed. However, the
 Special Rapporteur received a report that indicated that amputations were reim-
 posed as penalties in August. According to this report, Uday Hussein ordered six
 members of a commando unit accused of looting to be punished by having their
 hands amputated. An army deserter also involved in the alleged banditry was or-
 dered to be punished in a similar way.
 The Special Rapporteur, human rights organizations, and opposition groups con-
 tinued to receive numerous reports of women suffering severe psychological trauma
 after they were raped while in custody. The security forces allegedly raped women
 captured during the Anfal Campaign and during the occupation of Kuwait. The Gov-
 ernment has never acknowledged these reports of rape or conducted any investiga-
 tion. The Government reportedly took no action against those who committed this
 abuse.
 Prison conditions are poor. Overcrowding is a serious problem. According to the
 Labor and Social Affairs Minister, prisons hold five times their designed capacity
 (see Section L.a.). Certain prisons are notorious for routine mistreatment of pris-
 oners. Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad may hold as many as 15,000 persons,
 many of whom reportedly are subjected to torture. Al-Rashidiya prison, on the Ti-
 gris River north of Taji, reportedly has torture chambers. The A1-Shamma'iya pris-
 on, located in east Baghdad, holds the mentally ill and reportedly is the site of both
 torture and disappearances (also see Section L.a.). The Radwaniyah detention center
 is a former prisoner-of-war facility near Baghdad and reportedly the site of torture
 as well as mass executions. This prison was the principal detention center for per-
 sons arrested following the civil uprisings of 1991. Human Rights Watch and others
 have estimated that Radwaniyah holds more than 5,000 detainees; Iraqi opposition
 groups state that the prison is located within a "presidential" compound; the regime
 prevents inspections of such facilities by the U.N. Special Commission charged with
 eliminating Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
 The Special Rapporteur received a report in May that indicated that hundreds of
 Fayli (Shi'a) Kurds and other citizens of Iranian origin who had disappeared in the
 early 1980's during the Iran-Iraq war are being held incommunicado at the Abu
 Ghraib prison. According to the report, these persons have been detained for 17 to
 18 years in extremely harsh conditions without specific charges or trials. The report
 alleged that many of these detainees had been used as experimental subjects in
 Iraq's outlawed chemical and biological weapons programs.
 Reports of deaths due to poor conditions in prisons and detention facilities also
 continued during the year. According to the U.N. Special Rapporteur, many pris-
 oners in Amarah province were reportedly near death because of lack of adequate
 food and health care. The Iraqi Communist Party reported that 17 prisoners died
 at Abu Ghraib prison in November after blood was drawn from them forcibly, de-
 spite their malnourishment and weakened physical state.
 The Government does not permit prison visits by human rights monitors.
 There were no details on the condition of prisoners in northern Iraq. Iraqi Kurd-
 ish regional officials reported that prisons in the three northern provinces were open
 for inspection by the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) and other
 international monitors. Throughout the year, as part of their reconciliation effort,
 the regional officials reported the release of political prisoners.
 Assyrian groups reported several instances of mob violence by Muslims against
 Christians in the north (see Section 5).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and the Legal Code ex-
 plicitly prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, however, the authorities routinely
 engaged in these practices. The Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports of
 widespread arbitrary arrest and detention, often for long periods of time, without
 access to a lawyer or the courts.
 The military and security services, rather than the ordinary police, carried out
 most cases of arbitrary arrest and detention. During the year, security forces report-
 edly arrested hundreds of persons perceived as security threats, mainly on the basis
 of an individual's personal association or fanifily connection with opponents of the
 Government. The Special Rapporteur received three lists of 172 detainees whose
 cases were processed by the Public Security Directorate of Ta'mim (Kirkuk) during
 the year, on charges of spying, belonging to the opposition, criticizing the Govern-
 ment, smuggling food items, stealing, forging documents (passports), and fleeing the
 country or to northern Iraq. Sometimes those arrested reportedly were killed while
 in custody (see Section L.a.). In the large-scale assaults against Shi'a reported by
 several sources in September (see Section 1.g.), an estimated 20,000 persons report-
 edly were detained arbitrarily detained and trucked to tent-camp holding facilities
 
 
 1678
 in the desert region of al Rifa'i about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of the marshes
 in southern Iraq.
 According to international human rights groups, numerous foreigners arrested ar-
 bitrarily in previous years also remain in detention.
 There were also reports of the widespread practice of holding family members and
 close associates responsible for the alleged actions of others. The Special Rapporteur
 notes that "guilt by association" is facilitated by administrative requirements im-
 posed on relatives of deserters or other perceived opponents of the regime. For ex-
 ample, relatives who did not report deserters could lose their ration cards for pur-
 chasing government-controlled food supplies or be evicted from their residences. Am-
 nesty International reported in October 1997 that relatives often do not inquire
 about the whereabouts of arrested family members due to fear of being arrested
 themselves.
 In the fall, the Special Security Office reportedly stepped up efforts to intimidate
 the relatives of Iraqi opposition members. Relatives of expatriates suspected of sym-
 pathizing with the opposition were arrested and interrogated. Many were forced to
 call their relatives outside the country to warn that if they became active in opposi-
 tion political activities the callers and other family members could be harmed. Mid-
 dle school students with expatriate relatives suspected of opposition sympathies re-
 portedly were denied entry to universities systematically.
 The Government reportedly continued to target Shi'a Muslim clergy and their
 supporters for arbitrary arrest and other abuses. It also reportedly continued forc-
 ibly to move Shi'a populations from the south to the north, and other minority
 groups such as Assyrians and Turkomen from the north to government-controlled
 territory (also see Sections 1.f., 2.d.; and 5).
 Although no statistics are available, observers estimate the number of political de-
 tainees to be in the tens of thousands, some of whom have been held for decades.
 The Government is not known to practice forced exile. However, 1 to 2 million
 self-exiled citizens are fearful of returning to Iraq.
 e- Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent, and there is no
 check on the President's power to override any court decision., The -Special
 Rapporteur and international human rights groups all observed during the year
 that the repressive nature of the political and legal systems precludes any concept
 of rule of law. Numerous laws lend themselves to continued repression, and the
 Government uses extrajudicial methods to extract confessions or coerce cooperation
 with the regime.
 There are two parallel judicial systems: The regular courts, which try common
 criminal offenses, and the special security courts, which generally try national secu-
 rity cases but also may try criminal cases. There is a Court of Appeal and the Court
 of Cassation, which is the highest court.
 Procedures in the regular courts theoretically provide for many- protections. How-
 ever, the regime often assigns to the security courts cases which, on their merits,
 would appear to fall under the jurisdiction of the regular courts. Trials in the regu-
 lar courts are public, and defendants are entitled to counsel, at government expense
 in the case of indigents. Defense lawyers have the right to review the charges and
 evidence brought against their clients. There is no jury system; panels of three
 judges try cases. Defendants have the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal and
 then to the Court of Cassation.
 The Government shields certain groups from prosecution for alleged crimes. A
 1992 decree grants immunity from prosecution to members of the Ba'ath Party and
 the security forces who kill anyone while in pursuit of army deserters. Unconfirmed
 but widespread reports indicate that this decree has been applied to prevent trials
 or punishment of government officials. Nevertheless, Saddam Hussein's personal de-
 cree clearly supersedes any legal proceedings-including those designed to shield his
 family. A 1990 decree gants immunity to men who commit "honor crimes," i.e., kill-
 ing female family members for a perceived lack of chastity.
 Special security courts have jurisdiction in all cases involving espionage and trea-
 son, peaceful political dissent, smuggling, currency exchange violations, and drug
 trafficking. According to the Special Rapporteur and other sources, military officers
 or civil servants with no legal training head these tribunals, which hear cases in
 secret. Authorities often hold defendants incommunicado and do not permit contact
 with lawyers. The courts admit confessions extracted by torture, which often serve
 as the basis for conviction. There are reports that individuals who have cooperated
 with U.N. weapons inspectors have been subjected to secret trials.
 Many cases appear to end in summary execution, although defendants may ap-
 peal to the President for clemency. Saddam Hussein may grant clemency in any
 case that apparently suits his political goals. There are no Shari'a, or Islamic law,
 
 
 1679
 
 courts as such. Regular courts are empowered to administer Islamic law in cases
 involving personal status, such as divorce and inheritance.
 Because the Government rarely acknowledges arrests or imprisonments and fami-
 lies are afraid to talk about arrests, it is difficult to estimate the number of political
 pf ioners. Many of the tens of thousands of persons who have disappeared or been
 ied in recent years originally were held as political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government frequently infringed on citizens' constitutional right to privacy, particu-
 larly in cases allegedly involving national security. The law defines security offenses
 so broadly that authorities virtually are exempt from the legal requirement to ob-
 tain search warrants. The authorities frequently conduct searches without warrants.
 The regime routinely igored constitutional provisions safeguarding the confiden-
 tiality of mail, telegraphic correspondence, and telephone conversations. The Gov-
 ernment periodically jammed news broadcasts from outside Iraq, including those of
 op oition goups.
 In Kirkuk the regime periodically sealed off whole districts and conducted day-
 long, house to house searches, evidently as part of its campaign to harass and expel
 ethnic Kurds and Turkomen from the city (see Section 2.d.). Government forces met
 with resistance in August when 300 more Kurds were ordered expelled from Kirkuk
 province. Two civilians reportedly were killed in the clashes.
 In July Ba'ath Party organizers reportedly ordered citizens to display decorations
 and pictures of Saddam Hussein in celebration of the 1968 coup that brought the
 Ba'ath Party to power, and threatened to confiscate the food ration cards of those
 who did not comply.
 The security services and the Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive networks of in-
 formers to deter dissident activity and instill fear in the public. For example, the
 Special Rapporteur reported that an operator was arrested and executed in 1993 for
 having warned a person not to use a wiretapped telephone line. The authorities also
 hold family members and close associates responsible for the alleged actions of oth-
 ers (see Sections 1.b. and 1.d.). Government officials also may take children from
 minority groups hostage in order to intimidate their families to leave their home re-
 gions (see Sections 1.d., 2.d., and 5).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-As in previous years, the armed forces conducted deliberate artillery attacks
 against Shi'a civilians and large-scale burning operations in the southern marshes.
 In 1991 and 1992, the Gulf War allies imposed "no-fly zones" over northern and
 southern Iraq respectively. The no-fly zones continued to deter aerial attacks
 against the marsh dwellers in southern Iraq and residents of northern Iraq, limiting
 the Government to ground-based assaults.
 Military operations against Shi'a civilians, particularly in southern Iraq, contin-
 ued throughout the year, increasing in the summer after the killings of Ayatollah
 All al Gharawi and Shaykh Borojourdi (see Section L.a.). In January villages near
 Sayed Yoshi lake in Nasiriyah province were surrounded by government troops and
 bombarded with heavy artillery and mortars, the 14th Division bombarded fisher-
 men in the Am al Ni'aj marsh in Amara province, and scores of villagers in the Am
 al Ghizlan area of Amara province were arrested and their crops were burned. In
 February the Government cut off food rations and attacked the al Fuhood district
 of Nasariyah province and the Hamyan, al Azair, and Nahr al Iz districts of Amara
 province, with dozens of civilians reportedly killed and hundreds arrested. In March
 the 11th Division bombarded many areas in Nasiriyah, and Ba'ath Party militia fol-
 lowed with sweeps against the Amarya tribe, which included incidents of looting.
 In May the Government launched a mass arrest campaign in the al Alam, al
 Dawara, and Nahr al Iz areas. In June Saddam Hussein's commandos attacked vil-
 lages between Qala'at Salih and al Kahla in Amara province and arrested and tor-
 tured a Shi'a businessman in Amara as a pretext for confiscating his savings.
 In July security services resumed arrest sweeps in the al Thawra district of Bagh-
 dad, rounding up young men, assaulting residents, and looting money and personal
 property. In August the Third Army Corps, in conjunction with Ba'ath Party offi-
 cials led by Abdul Baqi al Sa'doon, conducted large-scale operations against settle-
 ments of the al Juwaisid, al Rahma, al Bu Salim, and Asakira tribes in Nasiriyah
 province; most of the inhabitants, including women, children, and the elderly, were
 forced to flee after dozens were wounded in heavy artillery bombardments. In Sep-
 tember security forces launched an attack on al Nibron village in the Rifa'ee Dis-
 trict; the troops burned houses, confiscated land, and arrested entire families. In Oc-
 tober government troops attacked villages in the Fuhood and I'gaga districts of
 Nasariyah province. In November security forces, the Third and Fourth Army Corps,
 and Ba'ath Party militia staged a 5-day assault, including heavy artillery bombard-
 ment, in the Bani Malik area and the al Suwaib district of Basra province, and
 
 
 1680
 
 widespread areas of Nasiriyah and Amara provinces, nearly to the Iranian border.
 Hundreds of persons reportedly were killed in late November in Amara, as part of
 a security sweep personally directed by Qusay Hussein.
 In December, commandos' arrested 39 persons in the aftermath of an alleged at-
 tempt in Karbala to kill. Revolutionary Command Council Vice President Izzat al-
 Douri. Some sources in the opposition claimed that the attempt on al-Douri's life
 was staged in order to justify the crackdown. Others indicate that the 39 persons
 arrested were executed summarily. ....
 During the year, the Government also continued its water-diversion and other
 projects in the south, continuing the process of large-scale environmental destruc-
 tion. The Government claimed that the drainage is part of a land reclamation plan
 to increase the acreage of arable land, spur agricultural production, and reduce salt
 pollution in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. However, the evidence of large-scale
 human and ecological destruction appears to belie this claim, and other credible re-
 ports confirmed the ongoing destruction of the marshes. The opposition group the
 Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq claimed to have obtained govern-
 ment documents describing its long-range plans to drain the marshes completely.
 The army continued to construct canals, causeways, and earthen berms to divert
 water from the wetlands. Hundreds of square kilometers have been burned in mili-
 tary operations. Moreover, the regime's diversion of supplies in the south limited the
 population's access to food, medicine, drinking water, and transportation.
 According to the U.N. Special Rapporteur 'and opposition sources, .thousands of
 persons in Nasseriyah and Basrah provinces were denied rations which should have
 been supplied under UNSCR 986. In these provinces and in Amarah province, ac-
 cess to food allegedly is used to reward regime supporters and silence opponents.
 Shi'a opposition groups report that, due to this policy, the poor humanitarian condi-
 tion of the Shi'a in-the south continued despite a significant expansion of the U.N.'s
 "oil for food" program.
 A multinational coalition continued enforcement of a "no-fly zone" to inhibit gov-
 ernment aerial activity to repress citizens in northern Iraq. The Government contin-
 ued to Arabize certain Kurdish areas, such as the urban centers of Kirkuk and
 Mosul, through the forced movement of local residents from their homes and vil-
 lages and their replacement- by Arabs from outside the area (see Sections 1.d., 1.f.,
 2.d., and 5).
 Until May 14, Iraqi citizens who had moved from the three northern governorates
 of Dohuk, Irbil, and Sulemaniyah to new domiciles in the center and south were
 not eligible to receive the rations provided under, Security Council Resolution 986.
 Since May 14, the Special Rapporteur reports that-these citizens reportedly are eli-
 gible to receive the food rations; however, he believes that the established registra-
 tion procedure is discriminatory, as these citizens must prove that they have resided
 in the new location for at least 6 months.
 Land mines in the north, mostly planted by the Government before 1991, contin-
 ued to kill and maim civilians. Many of the mines were laid during the Iran-Iraq
 War, but the army failed to clear them before it abandoned the area. The mines
 appear to have been planted haphazardly in civilian areas. Land mines are also a
 problem all along the Iraq-Iran border throughout central and southern Iraq, but
 there is no information on civilian casualties or the efforts, if any, to clear old mine-
 fields in areas under the central Government's control. The Special Rapporteur re-
 peatedly has reminded the Government of its obligation under the Land Mines Pro-
 tocol to protect- civilians from the effects of mines. Various NGO's continued efforts
 to remove mines from the area and increase mine awareness among local residents.
 In December the Government declared that mine-clearing activity was subversive
 and ordered the NGO workers to leave Iraq.
 After the 1991 Gulf War, victims and eyewitnesses described war crimes per-
 petrated by the Iraqi regime--deliberate killing, torture, rape, pillage, hostage-tak-
 ing, and associated acts-wdirectly related to the Gulf War. Many governments con-
 tinue to urge the U.N. Security Council to establish an international commission to
 study evidence of a broader range of war crimes, as well as crimes-against humanity
 and possible genocide. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other organizations have
 worked with various governments to bring a genocide case at the International
 Court of Justice against the Government for its conduct of the Anfal campaign
 against the Kurds in 1988.
 In September the leaders of the two major Iraqi Kurdish parties, Massoud
 Barzani of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Jalal Talabani of the Patri-
 otic Union of Kurdistan (P13K), met for the first time in several years. They agreed
 to increase their efforts to implement the 1996 Ankara Accords. This consolidated
 the cease-fire that the two parties established in November 1997.
 
 
 1681
 
 The PKK also committed numerous abuses against civilians in the north through-
 out the year. Many villagers in Dohuk and Irbil provinces, particularly those from
 isolated areas, reportedly to abandoned their homes and temporarily relocated to cit-
 ies and larger towns to escape PKK attacks.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, but also stipulates that "the State ensures the considerations nec-
 essary to exercise these liberties, in compliance with the revolutionary, national and
 progressive trend;" in practice, freedom of speech and of the press do not exist, and
 political dissent is not tolerated in areas under the Governmenifs control. The Spe-
 cial Rapporteur noted that "the people live in a climate of fear in which whatever
 they or their family members may say or do, particularly in the area of politics, in-
 volves the risk of arrest and interrogation by the police or military intelligence."
 The Government and the Ba'ath Party own all print and broadcast media and op-
 erate them as propaganda outlets. They generally do not report opposing points of
 view that are expressed either domestically or abroad. According to the Special
 Rapporteur, journalists are under regular pressure to join the Ba'ath party and
 must follow the recommendations of the Iraqi Union of Journalists, headed by Uday
 Hussein. In July a journalist was arrested in Baghdad, possibly in connection with
 articles that he wrote about the corrupt practices of the Iraqi regime. Reporteur
 sans Frontieres concluded that Iraq's record on press freedom was extremely poor.
 The Special Rapporteur reported that the Ministry of Culture and Information pe-
 riodically holds meetings at which general guidelines for the press are provided.
 Foreign journalists must work from offices located within the ministry building and
 are accompanied everywhere they go by ministry officers, who reportedly restrict
 their movements and make it impossible for them to interact freely with the popu-
 lace. Many Western news services are represented in Baghdad by Iraqi staffers who
 are based in the Ministry of Information and Culture.
 Several statutes and decrees suppress freedom of speech and of the press. These
 include Revolutionary Command Council Decree Number 840 of 1986, which penal-
 izes free expression and stipulates the death penalty for anyone insulting the Presi-
 dent or other high government officials; Section 214 of the Penal Code, which pro-
 hibits singing a song likely to cause civil strife; and the 1968 Press Act, which pro-
 hibits the writing of articles on 12 specific subjects, including those detrimental to
 the President, the Revolutionary Command Council, and the Ba'ath Party.
 Books may be published only with the authorization of the Ministry of Culture
 and Information. The Ministry of Education often sends textbooks with pro-regime
 propaganda to Kurdish regions; the Kurds routinely remove propaganda items from
 the books. In October 1997 the Minister of Education "warned these cliques that we
 hold them responsible" for altering the books.
 The Government regularly jammed foreign news broadcasts (see Section 1.f.). In
 an effort to interdict further any foreign reports on Iraq, the Government also
 banned satellite dishes. The penalty for possessing a satellite dish reportedly is an
 indefinite term of imprisonment in solitary confinement and confiscation of all
 household effects.
 In northern Iraq, many independent newspapers have appeared over the past 6
 years, with a noticeable increase in 1998, as have opposition radio and television
 broadcasts. The absence of central authority permits significant freedom of expres-
 sion, including criticism of the regional Iraqi Kurdish authorities, although most
 journalists are influenced or controlled by various political organizations.
 The Government does not-respect academic freedom and exercises strict control
 over academic publications. University staff are hired or fired depending on their
 support for the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, however, the Government restricts this right in practice. Ex-
 cept in Kurdish-controlled northern areas, citizens may not assemble legally other
 than to express support for the regime. The Government regularly orchestrates
 crowds to demonstrate support for the regime and its policies through financial in-
 centives for those who participate and threats of violence against those who do not.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, but the Government restricts
 this right in practice. The Government controls the establishment of political par-
 ties, regulates their internal affairs, and monitors their activities. Several parties
 are specifically outlawed, and membership in them is a capital offense. A 1974 law
 prescribes the death penalty for anyone 'infiltrating" the Ba'ath Party. In contrast,
 in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, numerous political parties and social and cul-
 tural organizations exist.
 
 
 1682
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; how-
 ever, the Government severely limits this freedomn. The Ministry of Endowments
 and Religious Affairs monitors places of worship, appoints the clergy, and approves
 the publication of religious literature.
 Although Shi'a Arabs, who constitute between 60 and 65 percent of the popu-
 lation, are the largest religious group, Sunni Arabs (who constitute only about 12
 to 15 percent of the population) traditionally have dominated economic and political
 life. -Despite legal protection of religious equality, the regime in recent years has re-
 pressed the Shi'a clergy and those who follow the Shi'a faith. Security forces have
 desecrated Shi'a mosques and holy sites, particularly in the aftermath of the 1991
 civil uprisings.
 The following government restrictions, on religious rights remained in effect
 throughout the year. A ban on the Muslim call to prayer in certain cities; a ban
 on the broadcast of Shi'a programs on government-controlled radio or television; a
 ban on the publication of Shi'a books, including prayer books; a ban on funeral pro-
 cessions other than those organized by the Government; and the prohibition of cer-
 tain processions and public meetings commemorating Shi'a holy days.
 The late Grand Ayatollah Abul Qasim A-Khoei, formerly the highest ranking
 Iraqi Shi'a clergyman, died in government custody in 1992 (see Section 1.b.). The
 Government continued to harass and threaten members of the late Ayatollah Al-
 Khoei's family (see Sections L.a. and 1.b.). The assassinations of two internationally-
 respected Shi'a clerics were widely attributed to government agents- In April Sheikh
 Borojourdi and two of his followers were killed in Najaf after finishing the collective
 Friday prayers. In June Ayatollah-Ali al Gharawi, his son, and son-in-law were shot
 on the road from Karbala to Najaf. Neither religious leader was a political activist.
 The killings were apparently the result of the clerics' refusal to stop carrying out
 their religious duties, as dictated by the regime, and followed progressively harsh
 attacks against them. Borojourdi, for example, reportedly had been beaten by secu-
 rity forces in 1996. Subsequently, a hand grenade was thrown at him. In 1997 gov-
 ernment agents reportedly threatened to kill him if he did not cease holding morn-
 ng prayers and giving sermons at the Imam All Mosque in Najaf. A month before
 Gharawi's was killed, Shi'a sources reported that he had been harassed by govern-
 ment officials and warned to cease leading prayers.
 The Government's initial claim that forces from outside Iraq perpetrated the at-
 tacks and its subsequent assertion that a gang led by Shi'a religious students killed
 the clerics to rob them were criticized by Shi'a authorities outside Iraq as trans-
 parent lies. In the aftermath of the killings, the Government stepped up repressive
 activities in the south and in other predominantly-Shi'a areas to prevent popular
 demonstrations. As part of this campaign, two Shi'a scholars in Baghdad, Sheikh
 Hussain Suwal'dawi and Shaikh Ali alFraijawi reportedly were executed in July.
 Shi'a sources also report that Ba'ath Party militia forces clashed with Shi'a pil-
 grims attempting to commemorate Ashora in May. The interference reportedly was
 to have been especially severe at Karbala; Basra, and the al Thawra district of
 Baghdad.
 As far as is known, the security forces still were encamped in the shrine to Imam
 Ali at al-Najaf, one of Shi'a Islam's holiest sites, and the former Shi'a theological
 school in al-Najaf.
 The Special Rapporteur and others reported that the-Government has engaged in
 various abuses against the country's 350,000 Assyrian Christians. Most Assyrians
 traditionally live in the northern governorates, and the Government often has sus-
 pected them of "collaborating" with Kurds. Military forces destroyed numerous As-
 syrian churches during the 1988 Anfal Campaign and reportedly tortured and exe-
 cuted many Assyrians (see Section 4). In October Assyrian sources reported that re-
 gional Iraqi Kurdish authorities refused to allow secondary school classes in the As-
 syrian language. However, details of the practice were not available and regional
 authorities denied engaging in this practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation-The Government controls the movement within the country of citizens
 and foreigners. Persons who enter sensitive border areas and numerous designated
 security zones are subject to arrest. Police checkpoints are common on major roads
 and highways.
 The Government requires citizens to-obtain specific government authorization and
 expensive exit visas for foreign travel. Citizens may not make more than two trips
 abroad annually. Before traveling abroad, citizens are xequired to post collateral,
 which is refundable only upon their return. There are restrictions on the amount
 of currency that may be taken out of the country. Women are not permitted to trav-
 el outside the country alone; male relatives must escort them. Each student who
 wishes to travel abroad must provide a guarantor who is liable if the student fails
 
 
 1683
 to return. Students abroad who refuse to return are required to reimburse any of
 their expenses that were p aid by the authorities.
 *The Government prohibits foreign travel by journalists, authors, and all employ-
 ees of the Information Ministry. Security authorities interrogate all media employ-
 ees, journalists, and writers who travel outside the country.
 Foreign spouses of citizens who have resided in Iraq for 5 years (1 year for
 spouses of government employees) are required to apply or naturalization as Iraqi
 citizens. Many foreigners thus become subject to travel restrictions. The penalties
 for noncompliance include, but are not limited to, loss of the spouse's job, a substan-
 tial financial penalty, and repayment of any governmental educational expenses.
 The Government prevents many citizens who also hold citizenship in another coun-
 try-especially the children of Iraqi fathers and foreign-born mothers-from visiting
 the country of their other nationality.
 The U.N. Secretary General estimates that there are more than half a million in-
 ternally displaced persons remaining in the three northern provinces (Irbil, Dohuk,
 and Suleymaniyah, most having fled government controlled areas in early 1991
 during the uprising that foliowed the Gulf War. In addition, the Government contin-
 ued to pursue its discriminatory resettlement policies, including demolition of vil-
 lages and forced relocation of ethnic Kurds, Turkomen, Assyrians, and other minori-
 ties. Human rights monitors reported that the Government continued to force Kurd-
 ish and Turkomen residents of Kirkuk to move to other areas in the north or to
 the south. In their place, ethnic Arab families were moved into this oil-rich city. Re-
 gional Kurdish authorities report that, during the year, 394 families were deported
 from Kirkuk and settled in Sulemaniyah Province. They calculate that since 1991
 a total of 15,258 households (90,574 persons) have been displaced. According to the
 Special Rapporteur, many of these families still live in tent camps under extremely
 harsh conditions, which result in many deaths, particularly among the elderly and
 young children. These figures do not reflect the numbers of deportees who settled
 in southern Iraq, in the Irbil province, or elsewhere.
 In April Amnesty International reported that 1,468 Iraqi Kurdish families were
 scheduled to be displaced from the IKirkuk area. In p reparation for tis, as in pre-
 vious displacements, the Government reportedly had begun to arrest family mem-
 bers as hostages and to seize food ration cards to ensure that targeted families
 would not resist.
 The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) further documented these practices in a
 detailed report released in October. The PUK placed the recent expulsions in the
 context of a decades-long government effort to ' Arabize" Kirkuk province and other
 areas. During this period, besides the direct, overt, and forced relocation of more
 than half a million Iraqi Kurds, the Government has denied non-Arabs employment
 opportunities in the civil service and the petroleum industry; reassiged Kurdish
 grade school teachers to areas outside Kirkuk province; begun demolishing the 5,000
 year-old Kurdish citadel of Kirkuk; and set up numerous military check-points to
 harass ethnic Kurds. The Government has changed the name of Kirkuk province to
 Ta'mim ("Nationalization") province.
 Another motive for the expulsions may be simple theft. For example, dozens of
 farmers in al Kut province saw their land confiscated by order of the Ministry of
 Agriculture. The land reportedly was turned over to high-ranking officials of the se-
 curity and intelligence services.
 Typically, the displaced persons reported that they were given at most 1 week to
 leave, and that they often were not allowed to bring their belongings with them. In
 many cases, security officials reportedly seized food coupons issued to displaced per-
 sons under the U.N. "oil-for-food" program. Amnesty International has reported pre-
 viously that family members, including children, are sometimes taken hostage by
 the Government to ensure that families do not resist the order to move (also see
 Sections .d., 1.f., and 5).
 According to the Special Rapporteur, security forces continued to relocate Shi'a in-
 habitants of the southern marshes to major southern cities. Many have been trans-
 ferred to detention centers and prisons in central Iraq, primarily in Baghdad, or
 even to northern cities like Kirkuk as part of the Government's attempt to "Arabize"
 traditionally non-Arab areas.
 The Government does not provide first asylum or respect the rights of refugees.
 According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), hun-
 dreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees remain abroad. Apart from those suspected of
 sympathizing with Iran, most fled after the Government's suppression of the civil
 uprising of 1991; others are Kurds who fled the Anfal Campaign of 1988. Of the
 1.5 million refugees who fled following the 1991 uprisings, the great majority, par-
 ticularly Kurds, have repatriated themselves to northern Iraq in areas where the
 allied coalition has prohibited overflights by Iraqi aircraft.
 
 
 1684
 
 In September Iraqi Kurdish officials agreed to begin returning to their rightful
 homes over 100,000 individuals displaced as a result of intra-Kurdish-fighting in the
 three northern provinces.
 Approximately 12,000 Turkish Kurds who have fled civil strife in southeastern
 Turkey remain in the north. The UNHCR is treating these displaced persons as ref-
 ugees until it reaches an official determination of their status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Although the Govern-
 ment has taken steps to increase the perception of democracy, the political process
 still was controlled firmly by the State. The 1995 "referendum" on Saddam Hus-
 sein's presidency was not free and was dismissed as a sham by most international
 observers. It included neither voter privacy nor opposing candidates, and many cred-
 ible reports indicated that voters feared possible reprisal for a negative vote. A total
 of 500 persons reportedly were arrested in Karbala, Baghdad, and Ramadi provinces
 for casting negative ballots, and a member of the intelligence services reportedly
 was executed for refusing to vote for the President.
 There are strict qualifications for electoral candidates; the candidates for the Na-
 tional Assembly, by law, must be over 25 years old and "believe in God, the prin-
 ciples of the July 17-30 revolution, and socialism." Out of the 250 seats, -160 depu-
 ties reportedly belong to the Ba'ath Party, 60 are independent, and Saddam Hussein
 appointed 30 deputies to represent the northern provinces. According to the Special
 Rapporteur, the Ba'ath Party allegedly instructed a number of its members to run
 as nominally "independent" candidates.
 Full political participation at the national level is confined to members of the
 Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, estimated at about 8 percent of the population. The po-
 litical system is dominated by the party, which governs through the Revolutionary
 Command Council (RCC), headed by President Saddam Hussein. However, the RCZ
 exercises both executive and legislative authority. It overshadows the National As-
 sembly, which is completely subordinate to it and the executive branch.
 The President wields decisive power over all instruments of government. Almost
 all important officials are either members of Saddam Hussein's family or are family
 allies from his home town of Tikrit.
 Opposition political organizations are illegal and severely suppressed. Member-
 ship in certain political parties is punishable by death (see Section 2.b.). In 1991
 the RCC adopted a law that theoretically authorized the creation of political parties
 other than the Ba'ath Party; in practice the law is used to prohibit parties that do
 not support Saddam Hussein and the Government. New parties must be based in
 Baghdad and are prohibited from having any ethnic or religious character.
 The Government does not recognize the various political groupings and parties
 that hav  been formed by Shi'a Muslims, as well as Kurdish, Assyrian, Turkomen,
 and other Iraqi communities. These political groups continued to attract support de-
 spite their illegal status.                                    _     _
 Women and minorities are underrepresented in government and politics. The law
 provides for the election of women and minorities to the National Assembly, but
 they have only token representation.
 In northern Iraq, all central government functions have been performed by local
 administrators, mainly Kurds, since the Government withdrew its military forces
 and civilian administrative personnel from the area after the 1991 uprising. A re-
 gional parliament and local government administrators were elected in 1992. This
 parliament last met in May 1995. In September, the two major Kurdish parties
 agreed to hold new elections to include participation by other parties in July 1999.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit the establishment of independent human rights
 organizations. Citizens have established several human rights groups abroad and in
 northern areas not under government control. Monitors from foreign and inter-
 national human rights groups are not allowed in Iraq. The Government operates an
 official human rights group that routinely denies allegations of abuses.
 As in previous years, the Government did not allow the U.N. Special Rapporteur
 to visit Iraq, nor did it respond to his requests for information. The Government
 continued to defy various calls from U.N. bodies. to allow the Special Rapporteur to
 visit the southern marshes and other regions.
 For the 6th consecutive year, the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) called on the U.N. Secretary General to send human rights monitors to
 "help in the independent verification of reports on the human rights situation in
 
 
 1685
 Iraq." The U.N. Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
 Minorities made a similar request. The Government continued to ignore these calls
 for the entry of monitors.
 The Special Rapporteur nonetheless was able to gather more evidence, in part due
 to interviews with current and past government officials, which shed new light on
 the systemic nature of human rights violations. He dispatched members of his staff
 to Kuwait, Jordan, and other locations to interview victims of government human
 rights abuses.
 The Government harassed and intimidated relief workers and U.N. personnel
 throughout the country, maintained a threat to arrest or kill relief workers in the
 north, and staged protests against U.N. offices in the capital (see Sections l.g. and
 2.a.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and the legal system provide for some rights for women, chil-
 dren, and minorities. However, in practice the Government systematically violates
 these rights.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women occurs but little is known about its ex-
 tent. Such abuse customarily is addressed within the tightly knit family structure.
 There is no public discussion of the subject, and no statistics are published. Spousal
 violence constitutes grounds for divorce and criminal charges, but suits brought on
 these charges are believed to be rare. Men who kill female family members for "im-
 moral deeds" may receive immunity from prosecution under a 1990 law (see Section
 1.d.).
 The Special Rapporteur has noted that there is an unusually high percentage of
 women in the Kurdish areas, purportedly caused by the disappearances of tens of
 thousands of Kurdish men during the Anfal Campaign. The Special Rapporteur has
 reported that the widows, daughters, and mothers of the Anfal Campaign victims
 are economically dependent on their relatives or villages because they may not in-
 herit the property or assets of their missing family members.
 Evidence concerning the Anfal Campaign indicates that the Government killed
 many women and children, including infants, by firing squads and in chemical at-
 tacks.
 The Government claims that it is committed to equality for women, who make up
 about 20 percent of the work force. It has enacted laws to protect women from ex-
 ploitation in the workplace and from sexual harassment; to permit women to join
 the regular army, Popular Army, and police forces; to require education for girls;
 and to equalize women's rights in divorce, land ownership, taxation, and suffrage.
 It is difficult to determine to what extent these protections are afforded in practice.
 However, reports indicate that the application of these laws has declined as Iraq's
 poitical and economic crisis persists. Women are not allowed to travel outside the
 country alone (see Section 2.d.).
 Children.-No information is available on whether the Government has enacted
 specific legislation to promote the welfare of children. However, the Special
 Rapporteur and several human rights groups have collected a substantial body of
 evidence pointing to the Governmentfs continuing disregard for the rights and wel-
 fare of children. This may include government officials taking children from minor-
 ity groups hostage in order to intimidate their families to leave cities and regions
 where the regime wishes to create a Sunni Arab majority (see Sections l.d., 1.f., and
 2.d.).
 The Government's failure to comply with relevant U.N. Security Council resolu-
 tions has led to a continuation of economic sanctions. There are widespread reports
 that food that should have been made available for the general public was in fact
 stockpiled in warehouses to replenish stocks held by the military. The Government
 management of the "oil-for-food" program did not take into account the special re-
 quirements of children ages 1 to 5, despite the U.N. Secretary General's specific in-
 junction that the Government modify its implementation procedures to address the
 needs of this vulnerable group.
 There were credible press reports that pharmaceutical supplies that should have
 been directed to sick children instead were exported or reexported for sale in Jor-
 dan, and that medicine an~d medical sup plies that the Government stated was need-
 ed desperately by children had been delayed because of regime members' demands
 for bribes from suppliers. As a result, children other than those of regime supporters
 have been particularly susceptible. There are persistent, although unconfirmed, re-
 ports of heightened child-mortality in the southern provinces due to the Govern-
 ment's intentional maldistribution of medicines. In April tons of contaminated beef
 were allegedly smuggled into Iraq at the direction of Saddam Hussein's son, Uday.
 
 
 1686
 Tne beef, which reportedly was purchased cheaply in Europe just prior to its sched-
 uled destruction, reportedly was sold at inflated prices on the black market.
 For the 5th year, the Government held 3-week training courses in weapons use,
 hand-to-hand fighting, rappelling from helicopters and infantry tactics for children
 10 to 15 years of age. Camps for these "Saddam Cubs" operated throughout the
 country, with 8,000 children participating in Baghdad alone. Senior military officers
 who supervised the course noted that the children held up under the "physical and
 psychological strain" of tough training for as long as 14 hours each day. Sources in
 the Iraqi opposition report that the army found it difficult to recruit enough children
 to fill all of the slots in the program. Families reportedly-were threatened with the
 loss of their food ration cards if they refused to enroll their children in the grueling
 course.
 People With Disabilities.-No information is available on the Government's policy
 towards the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-Iraq's cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity are not re-
 flected in the country's political and economic structure. Various segments of the
 Sunni Arab community, which itself constitutes a minority of the population, effec-
 tively have controlled the Government since independence in 1932. Shi'a Arabs, the
 religious majority of the population, have long been economically, politically, and so-
 cially disadvantaged. Like the Sunni Kurds and other ethnic and religious groups
 in the north, the Shi'a Arabs of the south have been targeted for particular discrimi-
 nation and abuse, ostensibly because of their opposition to the Government.
 Assyrian groups reported several instances of mob violence by Muslims against
 Christians in the north (see Section 1.c.).
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Kurds, who make up approximately 20 per-
 cent of the population, historically have suffered political and economic discrimina-
 tion, despite the token presence of a-small number of Kurds in the national Govern-
 ment (see Sections l.a., 1.b., and 1.g.).
 Assyrians are an ethnic group as well as a Christian community. They speak a
 distinct language-Syriac. Public instruction in Syriac, which was to have been al-
 lowed under a 1972 decree, has never been implemented (see Section 2.c.). Numer-
 ous reports indicated continued systemic discrimination against Assyrians through-
 out the year, especially in terms of forced movements from northern areas and re-
 pression of political rights there.
 Multiple sources in the Turkomen community reported a brief outbreak of fighting
 between Turkomen and Iraqi Kurds in Irbil in August and September. The incidents
 apparently were related to Turkomen political and cultural activity with dozens of
 Turkomen offices temporarily closed by local Kurdish authorities. Turkomen and
 Kurdish officials disagreed about responsibility for the incidents. Kurdish officials
 claimed that they closed the Turkomen offices to prevent spontaneous violence.
 However, Turkomen sources claimed that the violence was instigated by the local
 Kurdish authorities. Initial reports that the clashes resulted in several deaths ap-
 parently were exaggerated and, by late October, the situation was calm.
 Citizens considered by the Government to be of Iranian origin must carry special
 identification and often are precluded from desirable employment. Over the years,
 the Government has deported hundreds of thousands of citizens of Iranian origin.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions independent of government control do
 not exist. The Trade Union Organization Law of 1987 established the Iraqi General
 Federation of Trade Unions (IGFTU), a government-dominated trade union struc-
 ture, as the sole legal trade federation. The IGFTU is linked to the Ba'ath Party,
 which uses it to promote party principles and policies among union members.
 Workers in private and mixed enterprises-but no public employees or workers
 in state enterprises-have the right to join local union committees. The committees
 are affiliated with individual trade unions, which in turn belong to the IGFTU.
 The 1987 Labor Law restricts the right to strike. No strike has been reported over
 the past two decades. According to the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions, the severe restrictions on the right to strike include penal sanctions.
 The IGFTU is affiliated with the International Confederation of Arab Trade
 Unions and the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively is not recognized. Salaries for public sector workers (the majority of the em-
 ployed) are set by the Government. Wages in the much smaller private sector are
 set by employers or negotiated individually with workers. Government workers fre-
 quently are shifted from one job and work location to another to prevent them from
 forming close associations with other workers. The Labor Code does not protect
 
 
 1687
 workers from antiunion discrimination, a failure that has been criticized repeatedly
 by the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor theoretically is
 prohibited by law. However, the Penal Code mandates prison sentences, including
 compulsory labor, for civil servants and employees of state enterprises accused of
 breaches of labor "discipline," including resigning from a job. According to the ILO,
 foreign workers in Iraq have been prevented from terminating their employment to
 return to their native countries because of government-imposed penal sanctions on
 persons who do so. There is no information available on forced and bonded labor
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The em-
 ployment of children under age 14 is prohibited except in small-scale family enter-
 prises. Children reportedly are encouraged increasingly to work in order to support
 their families because of the country's harsh economic conditions. The law stipulates
 that employees between the ages of 14 and 18 work fewer hours per week than
 adults. Each year the Government enrolls children as young as 10 years of age in
 a paramilitary training program (see Section 5). There is no information available
 on forced and bonded labor by children (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Theoretically, most workers in urban areas
 work a 6-day, 48-hour workweek. Hours for government employees are set-by the
 head of each ministry. Working hours for agricultural workers vary according to in-
 dividual employer-employee agreements. Occupational safety programs are in effect
 in state-run enterprises. Inspectors theoretically inspect private establishments, but
 enforcement varies widely. There is no information on workers' ability to remove
 themselves from work situation that endanger their health or safety, or on those
 who complain about such conditions.
