 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 In the Republic of Korea President Chun Doo Hwan, with the
 support of the country's military establishment, holds most of
 the power. The elected legislature has some influence but
 continues to be dominated by the executive branch. The Govern-
 ment is organized under a Constitution adopted by referendum in
 October 1980. Governmental legitimacy in Korea derives from
 the ruler's ability to preserve national security, promote
 prosperity, maintain domestic harmony, and, increasingly, to
 reflect the popular will in questions of public policy. The
 current Government, which assumed power with primarily military
 support in 1980, has had problems with the last two points;
 hence to many Koreans the degree of legitimacy that it enjoys
 is still open to question. Because of the threat from an
 aggressive Communist regime in North Korea, all Korean govern-
 ments since the Republic's founding in 1948 have felt it neces-
 sary to give priority to maintaining external and internal
 security; their policies in this respect, as implemented in
 part by the well-developed security services, have brought
 charges of suppression of dissent and peaceful opposition
 political activity.
 The Republic of Korea has a mixed economy with extensive
 government intervention to stimulate and influence the direc-
 tion of the free market system. The current economic leader-
 ship has emphasized the need to move to a more open, freer
 market situation. Over the past two decades the Republic of
 Korea, with one of the highest real growth rates in the world,
 has achieved middle income, "middle power" status.
 Korea is an ethnically homogeneous nation which for many
 centuries existed as a distinct and usually unified national
 entity. Surrounded by great powers--China, Japan, and in
 modern times the U.S.S.R.--Korea historically focused its
 foreign policy on the single objective of avoiding subjugation
 by these neighbors. This led to a degree of voluntary national
 isolation sufficient to earn Korea the title of "Hermit King-
 dom." In 1910 Korea was annexed by the Japanese Empire.
 Liberated in 1945, it was then divided into temporary Soviet
 and American zones of military administration. In 1948 these
 zones were organized as, respectively, the Democratic People's
 Republic of Korea, or North Korea, and the Republic of Korea,
 or South Korea.
 Since the division of the peninsula in 1945, reunification has
 been a major goal of Koreans on both sides of the dividing
 line. North Korea, however, has insisted on reunifying the
 nation on its own terms and through any means, including the
 use of military force as in the invasion of South Korea in June
 1950. Despite recent diplomatic initiatives by North Korea to
 open discussions on the future status of the peninsula, mili-
 tary activities against the South have continued, including
 land and sea infiltration attempts by armed commando teams, the
 digging of tunnels under the Demilitarized Zone separating
 North from South Korea, and an October 9, 1983, attack in
 Rangoon, Burma, which killed 17 Koreans, including six senior
 government officials. The area on either side of the Demili-
 tarized Zone is one of the most heavily armed regions in the
 world. Over the years unremitting North Korean propaganda,
 overt and covert, has been directed at South Korea, calling for
 
 (812)
 
 
 813
 the destruction of American and South Korean installations,
 violence against South Korean leaders, and the overthrow of the
 South Korean Government.
 Fear of another invasion from the North is a fundamental factor
 in South Korean thinking, and successive governments have held
 that for security reasons the Republic cannot afford the
 "luxury" of conpletely unfettered dissent and discord which
 would be permitted in an open political system. The North
 Korean attack in Rangoon heightened anxieties in South Korea
 about North Korean intentions, but the Government did not
 respond to these anxieties by tightening limits on political
 freedom.
 Korea's traditional sociopolitical ideology, Confucianism, with
 its emphasis on order and filial piety, retains great strength,
 coexisting uneasily with the Western democratic ideals and
 industrial age values to which Koreas have been exposed in this
 century.
 Koreans of both sexes participate in politics. Constitutional
 safeguards against ex post facto laws and double jeopardy con-
 tinue to be generally observed. Although the Constitution
 guarantees freedom of speech and the press, in practice both
 are abridged. Politicians and others who publicly criticize
 the Government are aware that there are limits beyond which
 they may be subject to some form of government action. News-
 papers are expected to practice self-censorship, and failure to
 comply with this requirement has led to interrogation and
 threats of dismissals of reporters and editors. The law limits
 the freedom to assemble and demonstrate, and violators, most of
 whom are students, are often warned and detained and sometimes
 charged and imprisoned. Religious freedom, though otherwise
 complete, does not extend to churches' involvement in political
 and some forms of social action. There is freedom of movement
 within the country and freedom to travel abroad, except that
 persons with a history of political opposition are considered
 on a case-by-case basis and some are not allowed to leave the
 country.
 In August and December the Government declared the largest
 political prisoner amnesties since 1979. Over 300 persons
 jailed in politically-sensitive cases were freed. These
 included a Catholic priest convicted of harboring a fugitive
 from the 1982 arson attack at the Pusan American Cultural
 Center, persons convicted in the Control Data and Won Poong
 cases involving proscribed labor union activities, members of
 various political youth groups, and at least 131 students
 jailed for demonstrating. Civil rights were restored to almost
 700 former prisoners in political cases, and the sentences of
 10 prisoners were reduced. In addition, the government in
 December promised that a large number of students (probably
 over 100) then standing or awaiting trial for demonstrating
 would be freed once their cases were adjudicated. In the
 December amnesty, the Government also promised to allow nearly
 1,400 students expelled from colleges for political activism to
 return to campus as well as to permit 83 dissident professors
 to resume teaching for the first time since 1980. At the end
 of 1983, following the December releases, there were an
 estimated 325 political prisoners in Korea, about a 15 percent
 decrease from the comparable 1982 figure, with the number
 expected to decline further in early 1984 upon release of the
 students whose cases were awaiting final adjudication.
 
 
 814
 In 1980, the Government imposed an eight-year ban on political
 activities of 550 former politicians; in 1983 it lifted the ban
 from 250 of them. However, the approximately 300 persons still
 affected by this ban include most of Korea's major former
 opposition leaders.
 Also in March, the President commuted to life imprisonment the
 death sentences of two persons convicted in the 1982 Pusan
 arson attack. Although one innocent person died in this attack
 and another was disfigured, Korean human rights activists, and
 many other less-politicized Koreans, regarded the sentences as
 excessive, because the defendants' stated intent was to express
 political beliefs. They also claimed that they had been
 tortured before their trial.
 Torture by the police occurred in 1983, but there were fewer
 reports of this than in 1982 and none in politically sensitive
 cases. The Government has said that it is trying to eliminate
 the deeply-rooted problem of abusive treatment by police, espe-
 cially beatings of suspects during interrogation. This effort
 apparently has high-level support within the Government, as
 indicated by the passage in December 1983 of a law providing
 penalties up to life imprisonment for officials committing acts
 of torture. However the problem, though apparently diminished,
 has not disappeared. In 1983, a businessman died after being
 beaten by police in a nonpolitical investigation, and there
 were continuing reports as well of police beating students in
 interrogation and also while breaking up demonstrations. But
 official policy continues to prohibit excessive use of force by
 the police, and on occasion policemen are punished, as was the
 police officer who beat the businessman. In addition to the
 police, there are two other security services whose agents have
 reportedly mistreated suspects in the past; such allegations
 have not ceased, but, as with the police, appear to have
 diminished.
 Prison conditions remain spartan, and there are reports of
 hunger strikes and other protests, especially by students.
 There were no allegations of murder against the Government in
 1983.
 A hunger strike launched in May 1983 by a former opposition
 leader was not reported in the press until he ended his strike.
 This focused attention on limitations on the press and on other
 restrictions of civil and political rights. Conversely, a
 successful attempt by farmers to lobby a crop-purchase bill
 through the National Assembly against the Government's wishes
 suggested that Korea's only directly-elected political
 institution may have gained somewhat in perceived independence.
 Progress in human rights and democratic development remains
 both a high priority and a formidable challenge to Korea. The
 country's rapid economic growth in the last two decades has
 been matched by the growth of an educated and assertive middle
 class which increasingly wants a voice in the running of the
 society. But, while many observers believe that continued
 economic progress and the maintenance of social stability will
 require some measure of liberalization, Korea's hierarchial
 traditions, the absence of the concept of loyal opposition, and
 the lack of enthusiasm for Western-style democracy on the part
 of Korea's powerful military officer corps pose great
 
 
 815
 challenges to modernizers. Moreover, the need for unanimity in
 the face of the North Korean threat has historically inhibited
 efforts at political change which in the short run might affect
 social stability.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no reports in 1983 of deliberate killings by the
 Government, although there continued to be accusations that
 mistreatment had led to the deaths of at least one and possibly
 other persons in custody. On September 26, 1983, the American
 Cultural Center at Taegu was bombed, with the loss of one life.
 The perpetrators have not been identified, but the evidence
 points to North Korea. In an incident which occurred outside
 Korea but had considerable domestic impact, North Korean army
 officers on October 9 carried out the bombing attack on Presi-
 dent Chun and his advisors in Rangoon, Burma, which killed 17
 Koreans, including six senior officials, and four Burmese.
 During the period preceding President Reagan's visit to Korea,
 North Korean broadcasts called for the destruction of the U.S.
 Embassy, cultural centers, and military installations; and made
 implied threats against President Reagan's life.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of permanent disappearance in 1983, al-
 though the police sometimes waited for more than the legal
 maximum of 40 days before notifying the families of arrested
 persons.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture. Confessions determined to
 have been induced by duress are inadmissible in the courts, and
 a confession alone is not legally sufficient to secure a con-
 viction. The Government insists that it has issued injunctions
 against torture and that these are strictly enforced and vio-
 lations of them are sternly punished. Recognizing however that
 a potential problem still exists, the National Assembly in
 December 1983 adopted a measure toughening sentences for those
 convicted of killing or injuring through torture. The new law
 sets a term of three years to life for causing death and one to
 five years for causing injury.
 Accusations of torture diminished in 1983 compared to past
 years. There were no allegations of torture in politically-
 sensitive cases in 1983, although there were continuing reports
 of beatings during police action against student demonstrators
 and in interrogations of students considered to be instigators
 of demonstrations. The use of excessive force by the police,
 despite high-level efforts to reduce or eliminate it, has
 proven to be a pervasive and ingrained problem. The most
 notable case in 1983 was the death in March of a business
 
 
 816
 executive in Pusan, following a beating by a police lieutenant
 who was interrogating him in a non-political case. The lieu-
 tenant was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, and the Home
 Affairs Minister apologized and vowed to fire any policeman
 using similar tactics. Accusations of police beatings in non-
 political cases occur fairly frequently and are sometimes
 reported in the press.
 Students drafted into the army as punishment for demonstrating
 have also reportedly been mistreated by fellow soldiers in
 their units. Human rights groups claim that some student
 draftees have committed suicide as a result of this mistreat-
 ment. Certain details of these reports, coupled with the
 Korean tradition of harshness toward nonconformists, lend these
 claims credibility.
 Conditions in Korean correctional institutions are spartan, and
 discipline is strict. While prisoners who break rules or pro-
 test conditions are sometimes beaten, under normal
 circumstances convicts are not subjected to physical punish-
 ment. Prisoners may not receive visits except from their law-
 yers and immediate families. There does not seem to be a dif-
 ference between the treatment of political and nonpolitical
 prisoners, although the authorities have occasionally allowed
 special provisions for political prisoners, such as heaters
 during the winter or examination by outside physicians. There
 is no apparent difference in the treatment of prisoners on the
 basis of wealth, social class, race, or sex.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 From time to time, the security services have not only detained
 persons accused of violating laws on political dissent but have
 also increased surveillance of, or put under house arrest,
 those they think intend to violate the laws. In one instance
 which received a good deal of foreign media attention, a number
 of dissidents were put under "house arrest" during President
 Reagan's visit to Seoul in November. These 'house arrests'
 were enforced unevenly, with some persons enjoying the right to
 go to work and even access to foreign reporters. The Korean
 Government denies that the people were put under house arrest,
 insisting rather that their surveillance was merely part of
 heightened security for the-Presidential visit. Dissidents who
 openly criticize the Government are often picked up for short
 periods and then released. Arrest warrants are required by law
 but are sometimes not produced at the time of arrest in
 politically-related cases.
 Korean law requires that, within 40 days after making an
 arrest, the police notify an arrested person's family of his
 detention and whereabouts. The police normally wait at least
 several days, and occasionally more than 40 days, before making
 this notification. The Constitution guarantees the right of
 prompt legal assistance, and the right to request court review
 in case of arrest. For persons deemed *socially dangerous,*
 the law allows preventive detention under provisions of the
 social protection and social stability laws. Preventive deten-
 tion is for a fixed term, which, however, a judicial review
 panel may extend for periods of up to 10 years. Human rights
 activists and foreign observers are aware of two persons now in
 preventive detention for political offenses.
 
 
 817
 The Government declared two major amnesties--the largest since
 1979--in August and December 1983. A total of 306 'security-
 related' prisoners were freed. These included a priest con-
 victed of harboring a fugitive from the 1982 Pusan American
 Cultural Center arson case; the defendants in the Control Data
 and Won Poong labor cases, arrested for illegal union activi-
 ties and the object of particular attention by human rights
 groups; members of youth groups accused of plotting subversive
 activities; and at least 131 students jailed for taking part in
 demonstrations. The Government restored civil rights to almost
 700 former political offenders and in December announced plans
 to free, as soon as their cases were adjudicated, many (prob-
 ably over 100) students then awaiting or standing trial for
 demonstrating. The Government also promised to allow the
 return to campus of nearly 1,400 students previously expelled
 (and in many cases jailed) for demonstrating.
 Before the December 1983 amnesty, the number of prisoners in
 politically-related cases had been increasing: the Korean
 National Council of Churches Human Rights Commission on
 November 25 listed 457 "prisoners of conscience," as compared
 to 417 in November 1982 and 272 in November 1981. Four-fifths
 of the names on the list in November 1983 were students arrest-
 ed for taking part in anti-Government demonstrations; nearly
 200 of these had been arrested in October and November 1983, a
 period of heightened tension between students and the govern-
 ment. With the December amnesty, however, the number of pri-
 soners on the Commission's list dropped to about 325. Of
 these, it is estimated that about 20 have committed or advocat-
 ed acts of violence. Some opposition and human rights groups
 think that there are significantly more political prisoners
 than those listed by the Human Rights Commission, although
 evidence to substantiate such a claim has not been reported.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees many rights of defendants: the
 right to presumption of innocence; the rights against self-
 incrimination, ex post facto laws, and double jeopardy; the
 right to a speedy trial; and the right to legal counsel. These
 rights are generally observed, although there have been cases
 in the past in which defendants in politically-sensitive trials
 have not been able to obtain lawyers, reportedly because of
 lawyers' reluctance to accept such cases in the face of actual
 or potential government pressure.
 The President appoints the members of the Supreme Court, whose
 Chief Justice in turn appoints lower level judges. The judici-
 ary is considered independent in ordinary criminal and civil
 cases but much less so in politically-sensitive cases. For
 example, the Supreme Court in June 1983 overturned an appellate
 court's acquittal of a Christian activist charged with slander-
 ing Korea in contacts with foreign journalists. The appeals
 court judge resigned.
 Trials are open. Charges against defendants in the courts are
 clearly stated, with the exception that, in lengthy and complex
 indictments, the relationship between specific acts alleged and
 violations of specific sections of the penal code may not
 always be clearly drawn. In cases involving a mix of political
 
 
 818
 and criminal charges, this can bring into question the fairness
 of proceedings. Trial - are usually open to the public, but
 trial documents are not part of the public record. A leading
 defense attorney was suspended from the Seoul Bar Association
 in may by a committee chaired by the Minister of Justice,
 allegedly because the attorney passed copies of records of an
 open trial to an embassy in Seoul interested in the case, which
 involved a Korean resident of Japan convicted for spying.
 The same courts try political and ordinary criminal cases. The
 military courts do not try civilians. Defendants have the
 right of appeal in felony cases, a right which is often exer-
 cised and frequently results in substantial reductions in
 sentences. Death sentences are automatically appealed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Because of the Government's emphasis on the need for external
 and internal security, the security apparatus is large and
 highly developed. For most Koreans this entails no significant
 impact on their daily lives. However, many opposition figures
 and political and religious dissidents are periodically sub-
 jected to surveillance. There have also been charges of tele-
 phone tapping and opening of correspondence. Koreans who meet
 with foreigners, particularly with journalists and embassy
 officials, are often questioned afterwards. While the Consti-
 tution requires a warrant, issued by a judge upon request of a
 prosecutor, for search and seizure in a residence, the police
 have at times forced their way into private homes without
 warrants.
 Korean police practice requires police commanders to know a
 good deal about the personal and business affairs of all
 residents in their jurisdictions. This system is effective in
 crime control, and urban residents generally credit it with
 keeping their streets safe. By contrast, the police deploy
 extensive informer networks on college campuses with the pri-
 mary purpose of keeping track of political activities there;
 removal of campus informers is a priority demand among students
 including those who are not politically active.
 In most other respects the Government honors the right of per-
 sonal privacy and the integrity of the home and family. Par-
 ental rights to educate children are broad, and restrictions on
 study in foreign-administered schools (whether in Korea or
 overseas), originally imposed to force wealthy Koreans to
 involve themselves in the nation's social and educational
 development, have been relaxed in recent years. The state
 rarely seeks to intervene in such inherently personal decisions
 as marriage, choice of vocation, and formation of social and
 familial ties.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by the
 Constitution, in practice the expression of opposition view-
 points is severely limited. Dissidents are sometimes restrict-
 ed in their meetings and movements in periods judged volatile
 by the Government. Members of the National Assembly frequently
 
 
 819
 criticize particular Government actions or policies but are
 careful to stop short of fundamental criticism of the Govern-
 ment itself, such as attacks on its legitimacy, or personal
 attacks on the President. No overt actions were taken against
 assemblymen in 1983 for expressing their opinions. Public
 meetings expected to generate criticism of the Government are
 closely watched and, in some cases, disbanded or interrupted.
 Approved books on Communist and Socialist theory are studied in
 universities and can be found in bookstores, but many books and
 artistic works with "socialist' themes are banned. Academic
 freedom is subject to some political limitations, and about 86
 professors who lost their jobs in the political upheavals of
 1980 remained out of work; however the Government in December
 1983 promised to allow them to return to teaching at schools
 other than those at which they had last taught.
 The domestic media engage in self-censorship, according to
 guidelines the Government regularly issues to editors.
 Journalists who ignore these guidelines or go too far in their
 criticism have been picked up for questioning, and there has
 occasionally been government pressure on their employers to
 fire them.
 The extent of journalistic self-censorship varies. For
 example, when the National Assembly is in session, opposition
 viewpoints have been rather fully reported in the press. There
 was also a flurry of editorial comment in December 1983 sharply
 critical of the "half loaf" extended by the Ministry of Educa-
 tion to previously banned university professors. On-the other
 hand, in 1983, a former opposition leader, still under the
 political ban and house arrest, staged a hunger strike. This
 strike went unreported in Korean media except for vague and
 veiled references for more than three weeks until the man con-
 cerned was released from house arrest and ended his hunger
 strike. When the press finally did carry the story, it was
 done just once in all papers, under very specific guidelines.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are thousands of private organizations in Korea, and most
 peaceful assemblies take place entirely without official super-
 vision or restriction. However, under the Law on Assemblies
 and Demonstrations, specified categories of assembly, including
 those considered most likely to undermine public order or cause
 social unrest, are forbidden. Under this law, police have at
 times intervened, as in June 1983 when they entered a Protest-
 ant church at the end of a student meeting, maltreated parti-
 cipants, and damaged the church. The Government later apolo-
 gized. The law also requires that demonstrations of all types
 and outdoor political assemblies be reported in advance to the
 police. Violation of the law carries a maximum sentence of
 seven years or a fine of about $3,750. Prior to the December
 1983 amnesty, approximately 250 persons, or more than half of
 all Korea's *prisoners of conscience* were imprisoned for
 violation of this law; typically, such persons were students
 arrested for taking part in campus demonstrations. (Several
 hundred students were also punished in 1983 by being drafted
 into the army before their normal conscription dates.) In
 1983, the courts grew harsher in punishing violations of the
 Law on Assemblies and Demonstrations; whereas in 1982 most
 
 
 820
 violators received 12 to 18 month sentences, in 1983 sentences
 of two to three years were more common.
 The single national labor federation, the Federation of Korean
 Trade Unions and its 16 national affiliate unions are not con-
 trolled by the Government. Their freedom of action, however,
 is severely circumscribed by law. Labor organizations are
 forbidden to support politicians or political parties. All
 local unions must be organized within individual enterprises,
 creating a structure of thousands of individual unions, most of
 them small and weak. Outside agencies, including foreign labor
 organizations (such as the American Federation of Labor and
 Congress of Industrial Organizations, whose American-Asian Free
 Labor Institute maintains an office in Korea), religious labor
 ministries such as the Catholic Working Youth and the (Protest-
 ant) Urban Industrial Mission, and even the Federation of
 Korean Trade Unions and the national unions which comprise it,
 are forbidden to participate directly in local unions' bargain-
 ing activities and are severely limited in assisting indirectly
 or even offering advice. Collective actions and strikes,
 though technically legal, are to all intents and purposes for-
 bidden. Under these circumstances, government and employer
 influence has greatly exceeded that of unions in setting wages
 and resolving other major labor issues.
 According to Federation of Korean Trade Union figures, dues-
 paying union membership declined in 1983 by about nine percent,
 and the proportion of unionized employees in nonagricultural
 sectors dropped to about 7.5 percent. However, international
 contacts by the unions increased, with the Federation and its
 member unions participating in a record number of international
 labor conferences, including sending observers to the annual
 International Labor Organization conference. The Federation of
 Korean Industrial Unions is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and its member unions
 are affiliated with recognized international trade union
 federations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state-favored religion in Korea. There is complete
 freedom of proselytizing, doctrinal teaching, and conversion.
 Minority sects are not discriminated against, and adherence to
 a faith confers neither advantages nor disadvantages in civil,
 military, or official life. Churches and religious groups are
 subject to the same restrictions on political activity and
 criticism of the Government as are all institutions in Korea.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is essentially complete freedom of movement and freedom to
 change employment in Korea. The Government encourages a modest
 level of emigration and does not discriminate against prospect-
 ive emigrants. Most people can obtain passports, except for
 criminals or, in some cases, persons considered politically
 suspect. However, a number of dissidents, former political
 prisoners, and persons banned from political activity have been
 allowed to travel abroad.
 A small continuing influx of Vietnamese boat refugees is
 admitted to first asylum in Korea. They are cared for at a
 
 
 821
 camp in Pusan by the Korean Red Cross until they can be resettl-
 ed abroad. Over 600 such refugees have passed through Korea in
 the last several years.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change their Government
 Korea's Constitution and statutes, as well as its traditions,
 concentrate most political power in the President, a concentra-
 tion further intensified by the support the President enjoys
 from the military establishment. The President and the members
 of the National Assembly are the only elected officials in
 Korea. Under the 1980 Presidential Election Law, the President
 is chosen by an electoral college of about 5,000 members. By
 law, presidential campaigns are brief, and candidates are se-
 verely restricted in campaigning, including both the amount
 they may spend and the methods they may use to appeal to the
 voters. In the 1981 presidential election these restrictions,
 together with the authorities' careful screening of electoral
 college candidates and the reluctance of several strong poten-
 tial Presidential candidates to run, resulted in the virtual
 absence of effective opposition to incumbent President Chun Doo
 Hwan, who won by a nearly unanimous electoral vote. The Con-
 stitution limits the president to a single seven-year term, and
 cannot be amended to allow the incumbent president to continue
 in office.
 The next presidential election is scheduled for 1988. Presi-
 dent Chun has stated that he intends to step down at that time
 and allow a peaceful and constitutional transfer of power.
 The National Assembly, although politically weak, is important
 as a forum for the expression of divergent views of the Govern-
 ment's programs. Legislation normally originates with the
 executive branch, although the Assembly has at time passed or
 blocked laws contrary to the President's wishes. Members of
 the Assembly, who serve a four-year term, are Korea's only
 directly-elected public officials. The election laws passed in
 1981 provide for a proportional representation system that
 reserves 92 of the Assembly's 276 seats for members appointed
 by the parties, with two-thirds of those seats awarded to the
 party which gains a plurality of the popular vote. In the
 Assembly elections of March 1981, the authorities brought
 various forms of pressure to bear to discourage some potential
 candidates but did not interfere in the voting. Of the 184
 Assembly seats to be filled by election, the Government party
 ran candidates for 92, of which it won 90, along with a 38 per-
 cent plurality of the popular vote. The Government party was
 accordingly awarded 61 proportional representation seats, giv-
 ing it a comfortable majority in the National Assembly. Oppo-
 sition parties and independent candidates divided the remaining
 seats.
 The laws governing participation in the political process were
 enacted in 1981 just prior to the lifting of martial law. All
 existing parties were disbanded and new ones were formed. At
 that time a law was enacted barring a list of 567 persons,
 mainly leaders of or prominent persons associated with the old
 opposition parties, from taking part in any political activity
 for eight years. The Government in 1983 reduced the number of
 banned politicians to about 300 and said that it was consider-
 ing further reductions. The most prominent persons affected by
 
 
 822
 this ban remain covered by it. Koreans, other than those under
 this political ban, are free to belong to and participate in
 the activities of political parties. However, these parties
 have had difficulty attracting mass followings for a number of
 reasons. The Government can and does veto their choices of
 leaders, candidates, and policy positions; the Government may
 dissolve any party it deems contrary to 'basic democratic
 order"; and the electoral laws put time and fiscal constraints
 on campaigning which cause all parties, and particularly the
 opposition, significant difficulties in publicizing their pro-
 grams. Limitations on freedom of the press also cause
 opposition parties particular difficulties.
 Women are free to vote, become government officials, and run
 for the National Assembly; they hold eight Assembly seats (all
 but one appointed by their parties). In practice, the power
 structure remains male dominated.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 The Republic of Korea does not belong to any international
 human rights bodies and usually does not welcome outside
 involvement in the human rights area. However, in October
 1983 it admitted two members of the International Human Rights
 Law Group, an organization which in the past had been sharply
 critical of Korea, to study Korea's current situation. The
 Group's report, while noting improvements over past years,
 concluded that serious problems remained in such important
 areas as press freedom and treatment of prisoners. It urged
 President Reagan to address human rights and democratic devel-
 opment in his November 1983 visit to Seoul. (The President in
 fact did do so.) The Government tolerates the existence of
 domestic human rights groups but closely monitors their
 operations.
 There are no government agencies charged with the protection
 of human rights, although political parties and the National
 Assembly have committees which are concerned with oversight of
 some aspects of the issue. A number of private organizations
 are also active in this area, chiefly the Human Rights
 Committee of the Korean National Council of Churches, the
 Catholic Justice and Peace Committee, and the Korea Legal Aid
 Center in Seoul. The Human Rights Committee has ties with the
 World Council of Churches. The Committee and other human
 rights organizations submit petitions to the Government and
 make their views known both inside and outside Korea. Most
 observers believe that these organizations have been relatively
 effective in furthering their aims, depending on the issue.
 People working with these groups are sometimes questioned and,
 on occasion, visited or detained by the security services,
 though apparently none have been arrested in the past several
 years. Amnesty International in its 1983 report stated that it
 remained concerned in 1982 about the detention of prisoners of
 conscience and reports of torture. Freedom House in 1983
 described Korea as *partly free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Republic of Korea is one of the most densely populated
 countries in the world, with 7.4 persons per acre of arable
 
 
 823
 land. Only 22 percent of its 24.4 million acres are arable.
 The nation's physical wealth is sparse; most of the natural
 resources of the Korean Peninsula are found in North Korea.
 The Republic's major economic asset is its well-educated and
 productive work force. The population surpassed 40 million in
 1983, but the growth rate dropped to 1.5 percent owing to
 concerted efforts by the Government to popularize voluntary
 family planning.
 Skillful management by economic technocrats, many of them
 graduates of leading Western universities, has given Korea one
 of the world's most dynamic economies. Since 1967, economic
 growth in real terms has averaged almost 10 percent per year;
 in 1983 it was estimated at 8.8 percent. Per capita income in
 nominal terms has grown to about $1,750 in 1983. The
 widespread distribution of income gains and the approximate
 parity between rural and urban incomes has increased
 dramatically the nutrition, health, living conditions, and
 economic choices of the entire population.
 The economy, which is managed by public sector technocrats
 through control of the allocation of credit, is a blend of
 private sector firms and individuals and public sector enter-
 prises. As the Gross National Product has grown to almost $70
 billion, the Government has begun to rely increasingly on
 market forces to allocate resources and is beginning to
 liberalize its tight control over imports, foreign investment,
 and the domestic financial sector.
 Participation in the economy and a share of its benefits are
 effectively open to all. The right to own property, alone and
 in association with others, is recognized in law and practice.
 There is no economic discrimination based on race or reli-
 gion. Discrimination against women is declining, although as
 in most traditional Asian societies men still tend to be the
 primary income earners and property owners.
 A series of major revisions to the legal code in recent years
 has given women rights in inheritance, child custody, family
 headship, and other areas which law and Confucian tradition had
 long denied them. Women enjoy full access to educational
 opportunities at all levels. They are increasingly represent-
 ed, though still largely at entry levels, in the military, the
 police, the civil service, the professions, and private indus-
 try. They are not legally protected against discrimination in
 hiring, pay, or advancement, and these remain problem areas.
 Korea has not developed a politically powerful feminist move-
 ment, but consciousness of women's issues has been increasing,
 as reflected, for example, by the results of a public opinion
 poll printed in late 1983 by a major Seoul newspaper which
 regularly reflects government thinking. Late in 1983 the
 Cabinet approved a draft bill to organize a commission under
 the Prime Minister to promote women's rights.
 Improved health care and nutrition were responsible for
 increasing Korean life expectancy at birth to 65.4 years in
 1983. By 1983, infant mortality declined to 31.4 deaths per
 1,000 live births. Access to safe drinking water increased
 to 71 percent of the population in 1979. Caloric intake was
 119 percent of minimum nutritional requirements in 1977.
 Education receives high priority in government policy. The
 adult literacy rate increased to 93 percent in 1978. Primary
 school education is universal for both sexes, and over
 90 percent of elementary students enter secondary school.
 Entrance to institutions of higher education is highly
 competitive, and only about 50 percent of those who wish to
 attend are able to do so. There is a substantial measure of
 social mobility based on the merit system in education and
 employment.
