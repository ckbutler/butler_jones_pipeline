 KUWAIT
 Anirs, or princes, from the AI-Sabah family have ruled Kuwait in consultation
 with prominent community figures for over 200years. The Constitution, adopted in
 1962 shortly after Kuwait's independence from British protectorate status, provides
 for an elected National Assembly and enumerates the powers of the Government
 and the rights of citizens. It also permits the Amir to suspend its articles during
 periods of martial law. The Amir twice suspended constitutional provisions from
 1976 to 1981 and from 1986 to 1992 and ruled extraconstitutionaily during these
 periods. Iraq occupied Kuwait from August 1990 until its forces were expe~led in
 February 1991. The National Assembly resumed functioning after the 1992 elec-
 tions, and elections were held again in October. New legislation in October granted
 the judiciary greater administrative and financial independence, but the Amir ap-
 points all judges.
 The Ministry of Interior supervises the security apparatus, including the Criminal
 Invetigation Department (CID) and Kuwait State Security (KSS), two agencies
 that, in addition to the regular police, investigate internal security-related offenses.
 Some members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 Richly endowed with oil, the country's estimated per capita gross national product
 is approximately $20,600. Costly reconstruction undertaken to recover from the de-
 struction caused by the Iraqi occupation led the Government to incur a cumulative
 fiscal deficit of apprximately $70 billion, which it covered by liquidating govern-
 ment-owned foreign assets and increasing the public debt. The Government is
 gradually reducing the deficit and plans to eliminate it by the year 2000. Despite
 its emphasis on an open market, the Government continues to dominate the local
 economy through direct expenditures and government-owned companies and equi-
 ties. The Government has initiated a program of disposing of its holdings of stock
 tio etompaniers human rights record improved, although problems remain in
 certain areas. Police abuse detainees during interogation, and guards beat a large
 number of prisoners after a January prison riot. Citizens cannot change their head
 of state. The Government bans formal political parties, and women do not have the
 right to vote. The Government restricts freedom of assembly and association, and
 places some limits on the freedom of religion. Journalists practice self-censorship.
 The Government prevents the return to Kuwait of stateless persons who have
 
 
 1317
 
 strong ties to the country. Deportation orders may be issued by administrative
 order, and hundreds of persons are being held in detention facilities pending depor-
 tation. Many have been held for a year or more. Discrimination and violence against
 women are problems. The Government restricts the rights of women, e g. women
 do not have the right to vote. Domestic servants are not protected by labor law, and
 unskilled foreign workers suffer from lack of a minimum wage in the private sector
 and from failures to enforce labor law.
 However, for the first time, sons of naturalized male citizens and citizens natural-
 ized between 20 and 30 years ago were eligible to vote in the October National As-
 sembly elections. Although the Government continues to be indifferent to the human
 rights problems of the more than 100,000 stateless people residing in Kuwait known
 as the "bidoon," the Government naturalized a small fraction of the bidoon, and
 made some efforts to address their status. The Amir commuted the sentences of four
 individuals who were convicted of security offenses in 1991 by the Martial Law
 Court. During the year the National Assembly passed laws granting the judiciary
 greater administrative and financial independence and providing for increased ac-
 cess and employment opportunites for the disabled.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There were no developments in the investigations into the extrajudicial killings
 that occurred during the chaotic period after Kuwait's liberation in 1991.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There have been no developments since 1994 in the cases of disappearance that
 occurred following Kuwait's liberation in 1991.
 According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Iraqi authori-
 ties have not yet accounted for 602 Kuwaitis and residents of Kuwait, including 8
 women, who were taken prisoner during Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. Iraq repatri-
 ated one woman in May. The Government of-Iraq has refused to comply with U.N.
 Security Council Resolution 687, which stipulates the release of the detainees. Iraq
 denies that it holds Kuwaiti detainees.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, however, there continue to be credible reports
 that the plice physically abuse detainees during interrogation. The police were
 more likely to inflict such abuse on non-Kuwaitis than on citizens. Reported abuse
 includes blindfoldings, verbal threats, slaps, and blows.
 The Government says that it investigates all allegations of abuse and that it has
 punished at least some of the offenders. However, the Government does not make
 public the findings in its abuse investigations or what, if any, punishments are im-
 posed. This omission creates a climate of impunity, which diminishes deterrence
 against torture and abuse. Prison guards beat a large number of prisoners following
 a prison riot in January. Although authorities apparently put an end to the abuse,
 it is not known if the guards involved in the beatings were disciplined.
 Defendants have the right to present evidence in court that they have been mis-
 treated during interrogation. However, the courts frequently dismiss abuse com-
 plaints because defendants are often unable to substantiate their complaints with
 physical evidence. Members of the security forces deliberately hide or misrepresent
 their identity, a practice that further complicates confirmation of abuse.
 Prison conditions, including conditions for those held for security offenses, meet
 minimum international standards, in terms of food, access to basic health care,
 scheduled family visits, cleanliness, and opportunities for exercise and work. Con-
 tinuing problems include overcrowding and the lack of specialized medical care. In
 addition, some minor children of female prisoners stay in the prison with their
 mothers. The Government is taking steps to improve prison conditions.
 The National Assembly's Human Rights Committee continued to monitor prison
 conditions, and the Government allows the ICRC access to all detention facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for freedom
 from arbitrary arrest and detention. There were no reports of arbitrary arrest dur-
 ing the year.
 Police officers must obtain an arrest warrant from state prosecutors before mak-
 ing an arrest, although in misdemeanor cases the arresting officer may issue them.
 Security forces occasionally detain persons at checkpoints in Kuwait City (see Sec-
 tion 2.d).
 Under the Penal Code, a suspect may not be held more than 4 days without
 charge. Security officers sometimes prevent families from visiting detainees during
 
 
 1318
 this confinement. After 4 days, prosecutors must either release the suspect or file
 charges. If charges are filed, prosecutors may remand a suspect to an additional 21
 days in detention. Prosecutors may also obtain court orders for further detention
 pending trial.
 Approximately 1,900 persons are serving sentences at the central prison of Ku-
 wait. Although the number of persons in detention awaiting deportation reached al-
 most 1,000 during the year, the Government granted temporary conditional releases
 to many detainees during the second half of the year, significantly lowering this fig-
 ure. Many deportation orders are issued administratively, without benefit of a trial
 The Government may expel noncitizens (including bidoon, i.e., stateless residents of
 Kuwait), even if they are native-born or long-term residents, if it considers them se-
 curity risks. The Government may also expel foreigners if they are unable to obtain
 or renew work or residency permits. About 10 percent of the detainees awaiting de-
 portation, especially Iraqis and bidoon, have been in detention for more than 1 year,
 some for up to 5 years. However, the Government does not deport such detainees
 to their country of origin against their will.
 The law protects citizens from exile, and there were no reports of this practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution states that "judges shall not be
 subject to any authority;" however, until April the Ministiy of Justice controlled the
 judiciarys admnistrative and inancial matters. In April the National Assembly
 passed a law that regulates the Government's ability to appoint, transfer, discipline,
 or dismiss both Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti judges. The law also requires the Ministry
 of Justie to disclose the judiciary's appropriation reommendations to the National
 Assembly.
 One court system tries both civil and criminal cases. The Court of Cassation is
 the highest level of judicial appeal. Sunni and Shi'a Muslims have recourse to courts
 of their respective denominations for family law cases; however, there is no Shi'a
 appellate court. Shi'a cases are referred to the Sunni court on appeal.
 Defendants have the right to confront their accusers and appeal verdicts. The
 Amir has the constitutional power to pardon or commute all sentences. Defendants
 in felony cases are required by law to be represented in court by legal counsel,
 which the courts will provide in criminal cases. In misdemeanor cases, defendants
 have the right to waive the presence of legal counsel, but the court is not required
 to provide counsel to indigent defendants.
 Both defendants and prosecutors may appeal court verdicts to the High Court of
 Appeal, which may rule on whether the law was properly applied, as well as on guilt
 or innocence of the defendant. Decisions of the High Court of Appeal may be pre-
 sented to the Court of Cassation, which conducts a limited, formal review of cases
 to determine only whether the law was properly applied.
 In the regular court system there are no groups, including women, who are barred
 from testifying or whose testimony is given lesser weight. However, the Islamic
 courts, which have jurisdiction over family law, apply Islamic law, which states that
 the testimony of two women equals that of one man.
 There are no reported political prisoners. The Government continues to incarcer-
 ate persons convicted of collaboration with Iraq during the occupation. By law such
 collaortion is a felony. Most of the people cnvictdin the Martial Law Court in
 1991, and the Special State Security Court, which was abolished in 1995, did not
 receive fair trials. In 1996 the Amir commuted the sentences of four individuals con-
 victed by the Martial Law Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for individual privacy and sanctity of the home. The police
 must obtain a warrant to search both public and private property, unless they are
 in hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime or if alcohol or narcotics are
 suspected on the premises. The warrant can be obtained from the state prosecutor
 or, in the case of private roperty, from a judge. The security forces occasionally
 monitor the activities of individuals and their communications.
 By law males must obtain government approval to marry foreign-born women.
 Many citizens comply with this law by validating there foreign marriage certificate
 at a Kuwaiti embassy or consulate. Although the Government may advise against
 marriage to a foreign national, there are no known cases of the Government refus-
 ing permission to marry. The Government also advises women against marrying for-
 eign nationals.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution states that "freedom of the
 press, printing, and publishing shall be guaranteed in accordance with the condi-
 tions and manner specified by law." With a few exceptions, citizens are free to criti-
 cize the Government at public meetings and in the media. However, journalists
 
 
 1319
 
 practice self-censorship. Several laws empower the Government to impose restric-
 tions on freedom of speech and the press, but they are rarely invoked.
 Newspapers are privately owned and free to publish on many social, economic,
 and political issues and frequently criticize government policies and officials, includ-
 ing the Crown Prince, who is also the Prime Minister.
 The Government ended prepublication censorship in 1992, but journalists still
 censor themselves. The Press Law prohibits the publication of any direct criticism
 of the Amir, official government communications with other states, and material
 that serves to "attack religions" or "incite people to commit crimes, create hatred,
 or spread dissension among the populace." In 1995 the Government banned publica-
 tion of one newspaper, Al Anba, for 5 days under a law that the media and opposi-
 tion parliamentarians alleged was unconstitutional. The paper took the Government
 to court and has appealed an initial court ruling in favor of the Government. In
 1996 six armed individuals threatened the employees of a newspaper that published
 a cartoon deemed offensive to Islam. No one was hurt in the attack, and the police
 arrested those involved.
 In order to begin publication of a newspaper, the publisher must obtain an operat-
 ing license from the Ministry of Information. Publishers may lose their license if
 their publications do not appear for 6 months. This 6-month rule prevents publish-
 ers from publishing spradically-it is not used to suspend or shut down existing
 newspapers. Indivduals must also obtain     Is    from the Ministry of Informa-
 tion   ore publishing any printed material, including brochures and wall posters.
 The Government does not censor foreign journalists and permits them open access
 to the country.
 The Government owns and controls the radio and television companies. The Mid-
 die East Broadcasting Company and Egyptian television transmit to Kuwait without
 censorship. The Government does not inhibit the purchase of satellite dishes. Citi-
 zens with such devices are free to watch a variety of programs, including those
 broadcast from Israel.
 The Ministry of Information censors all books, films, videotapes, periodicals, and
 other imported publications deemed morally offensive. However, the Ministr has
 censored political topics as well. The Gneral Organization of Printing and Pulish-
 ing controls the printing, publishing, and distribution of informational materials in
 Kuwalt.
 There is no government censorship of university teaching, research, or publica-
 tion. However, academics are subject to the same restraints as the media with re-
 gard to criticism of the Amir or Islam. In October Ahned al-Baghdadi, a Kuwaiti
 University political science professor, received a death threat in response to a brief
 article he wrote for a university magazine. Both legislators and the Islamic move-
 nent were angered by a reference in the article to the Prophet that they viewed
 as critical of the Prphet. The Islamic magazine A-Mojtama called for al-Baghdad-
 to be fired from the University. Al-Baghdadi has sued the magazine for libel During
 the year, parliamentarians and university organizations publicly criticized several
 university professors for writings deemed critical of Islam and inconsistent with so-
 cial mores. Some of the professors were subject to inquires by the university and
 the Ministry of Education, and some were referred to the Public Prosecution Depart-
 ment for investigation into possible criminal violations. None of the professors was
 suspendor       rgeortcard with any criminal wrongdoing; however, investigations were
 stil pending at years end. Private citizens fieuapostasy or blasphemy suits against
 two of the professors in Islamic (Personal Status) Court.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Athough the Constitution af-
 inms the right to assembly, the Gove ment restrict  s right, as e   as that of
 association, and bans political parties. Several informal blocs, acting much like ar
 ties, exist and were active during the October National Assembly elections. The  v-
 enment has made no effort to constrain these groupings, wich are organized on
 the basis of commen ideological goals. Many may be categorized as opposition
 groups. Public gatherings, however, must receive prior government approval, as
 must private gatherings of more than five persons that result in the issuance of a
 public statement.
 Political activity ids its outlet in informal, family-based, almost exclusively
 male social gatherings known as diwaniyas. Practically every male adult, including
 the Amir, hosts and attends diwaniyas at which every possible topic is discussed.
 The diwaniya contributes to the development of political consensus and official deci-
 sionmaking.
 All nongovernmental organizations NGO's) must obtain a license from the Min-
 istry of Social Affairs and Labor. The Government uses is  power to license as a
 means of political control. The Ministry has licensed over 55 NGO's, including pro-
 fessional groups, a bar association, and scientific bodies. These groups receive Gov-
 
 
 1320
 
 ernment subsidies for their operating expenses. They must obtain permission from
 the Ministry before attending international conferences. However, since 1985 the
 Ministry has issued only two licenses. The Ministry has disapproved other license
 requests on the grounds that previously established NGO's already provide services
 similar to those proposed by the petitioners.
 By banning unregistered NGO's, the Government mainly sought to dissolve
 groups whose efforts were not coordinated with an official government committee
 working for the release of the missing persons presumed held in Iraq. The ban dis-
 courages these groups from fundraising and recruitment, and prevents them from
 holding public meetings and making their views known in the press. Nevertheless,
 the Government overlooks the activities of many unregistered N's, despite a 1993
 decree ordering them to cease activities. No organization has challenged the 1993
 decree in court.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. The Constitution states that
 Islamic law, Shari'a, is "a main source of legislation." The ruling family and many
 prominent Kuwaiti families belong to the denomination of Sunni Islam. However,
 30 to 40 percent of the population belong to the Shi'a denomination. They are free
 to conduct their tradtinal forms of worship without government interference.
 The Constitution states that "all people are equal in * * * public rights and du-
 ties before the law, without distition as to * *  religion," and that "freedom of
 belief is absolute. The State protects the freedom to practice religion in accordance
 with established customs, provided that it does not conflict with pubic poicy or
 morals." There are several legally recognized expatriate congregations and churches,
 including a Catholic diocese and several Protestant churches. Expatriates who are
 members of religions not sanctioned in the Koran, e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Bud-
 dhists, may not build places of worship but may worship privately in their homes.
 The Government prohibits missionaries to proselytize among Muslims; however,
 they may serve expatriate congregations. The Government prohibits Muslims from
 converting to other religions. The law prohibits religious education for religions
 other than Islam, although this law does not appear tobe rigidy enforced. The Gov-
 ernment does not permit the establishment of non-Islamic publishing companies or
 training institutions for clergy.
 The [aw prohibits non-Muslims from becoming citizens. A non-Muslim male must
 convert to I slam when he marries a Muslim woman, if the wedding is to be legal
 in Kuwait. A non-Muslim female does not have to convert to Islam to marry a Mus-
 lim male, but it is to her advantage to do so, i.e., failure to do so may ultimately
 place custody of children in the hands of the Muslim father, should the couple later
 divorce.
 In May a family law court applying Shari'a law convicted former Muslim Robert
 Hussein of apostasy for converting to Christianity in a case filed by a group of pri-
 vate Muslims citizens. The verdict ordered Hussein to pay all legal costs and af-
 fected certain personal rights, such as child custody and property inheritance, but
 did not carry a criminal penalty or affect his civil rights. The judge and some pri-
 vate citizens publicly quoted a Koranic reference to death being the punishment for
 apostasy. The Government later publicly affirmed Hussein's civil tights and stated
 that he would be protected. Hussein did not attend a scheduled appellate court ses-
 sion. Since that date, the court has not taken any action on his appeal.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have the right to travel freely within the country and to
 change their workplace as desired. Unmarried women the age of 21 and over are
 free to obtain a passport and travel abroad at any time. However, married women
 who apply for passports must obtain their husband's signature on the application
 form. Once she has a passport, a married woman does not need her husband's per-
 mission to travel, but he may prevent her departure from the country by placing
 a 24-hour travel ban on her. He can do this by contacting the immigration authori-
 ties. After this 24-hour period, a court order is required if the husband still wishes
 to prevent his wife from leaving the country. All minor children must have their
 father's permission to travel outside of the country. Citizens are free to emigrate
 and to return.
 A serious problem exists in the case of the bidoon, who are stateless persons,
 many of Iraqi or Iranian descent, who resided in Kuwait prior to the Iraqi invasion.
 The Government argues that many bidoon (the term means "without") are conceal-
 ing their true citizenship in order to remain in Kuwait, become citizens, and enjoy
 the generous benefits provided to citizens. Some bidoon have had residency ties to
 Kuwait for generations. Others immigrated to Kuwait during the oil boom years.
 There are approximately 117,000 stateless persons in Kuwait, down from a prewar
 level of about 220,000. The Government does not wish the return of the bidoon who
 
 
 1321
 departed Kuwait during the Gulf War and frequently delays or denies issuing them
 entry visas. This policy imposes serious hardships and family separations.
 The Government continued its postwar policy of reducing by deportation the num-
 ber of nationals from those countries that supported Iraq during its invasion of Ku-
 wait. The number of such residents is now only about 10 percent of its prewar total.
 The Government permits the ICRC to verify if a deportee objects to returning to his
 country of origin. The Government detains those deportees who have objections at
 the main deportation center. Many have been held for 1 year or more; some have
 been held for 5 years.
 Security forces in Kuwait city occasionally set up checkpoints where they may de-
 tain individuals. The checkpoints are mainly for immigration purposes andare used
 to apprehend undocumented aliens.
 There is no legislation governing refugees, asylees, or first asylum, and no clear
 or standard procedure for processing a person's claim to be a refugee. The Constitu-
 tion prohibits the extradition of political refugees. The Ministry of Interior may
 issue residency permits to persons granted political asylum, although this is not a
 frequent occurrence. The Government states that it does not deport anyone who
 claims a fear of persecution in his home country, but it will often keep such persons
 in detention rather than grant them permission to live and work in Kuwait. The
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) maintains an office in
 Kuwait and has access to refugees in detention.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens cannot change their head of state. Women and citizens naturalized less
 than 20 years ago may not vote. In addition members of the armed forces, police,
 and other uniformed personnel of the Ministry of Interior are prohibited from vot-
 n der the Constitution, the Amir holds executive power and shares legislative
 power with the National Assembly. The Prime Minister presides over a 14-member
 cabinet. In accordance with the practice of the ruling family, the Prime Minister is
 always the Crown Prince. The Constitution empowers the Amir to suspend its provi-
 sions and to rule by decree. The Amir dissolved the National Assembly from 1976
 to 1981, and in 1986 the Amir effectively dissolved the Assembly by suspending the
 constitutional provisions on the Assembly's election. The Assembly remained dis-
 solved until 1992, when elections were held. Members serve 4-year terms, and Na-
 tional Assembly elections were held on in October. The elections were conducted
 freely and fairly among the minority of citizens who are permitted to vote; 229 can-
 didates ran for the Assembly's 50 seats. Since the Government prohibits political
 parties, assembly candidates must nominate themselves. Nonetheless, informal po-
 litical groupings are active in the Assembly. The Constitution empowers the Na-
 tional Assembly to overturn any Amiri decrees made during the dissolution, and the
 Assembly has done so in some cases.
 Approximately 107,000 male citizens, almost the entire franchised population, reg-
 istered to vote in the 1996 elections, and 80 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
 For the first time sons of naturalized citizens and Kuwaiti citizens naturalized 20
 to 30 years ago were eligible to vote. Some women demonstrated at polling booths
 to demand that they be given voting rights before the next election.
 Women are disenfranchised and have little opportunity to influence government.
 In the past, a majority of the members of the National Assembly have expressed
 opinions favoring women's right to vote; however, a draft law on this issue remained
 in committee for over a year, and was never put to a vote. No strong parliamentary
 support currently exists for this law, and the Government has made no effort to per-
 suade the National Assembly to pass the legislation. Women's groups are divided
 on this issue.
 Members of Kuwait's Shi'a minority are generally underrepresented in high gov-
 ernment positions, although in recent years two Shi'a Muslims were appointeg to
 the Cabinet and one was named to a high-ranking military post.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government has prevented the establishment of local human rights groups
 by not approving their requests for licenses (see Section 2.b.). The Government per-
 mits international human rights organizations to visit Kuwait and to establish of-
 fices. Several organizations conduct field work and report excellent communication
 with and reasonable cooperation from the Government.
 
 
 1322
 
 The National Assembly has a human rights committee, which takes testimony
 from individuals about abuses, investigates prison conditions, and has made non-
 binding recommendations for redress.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, national origin, lan-
 guage, or religion. However, laws and regulations discriminate against women, and
 non-Kuwaitis face widespread social, economic, and judicial discrimination.
 Women.-According to some local experts, domestic abuse of women occurs in an
 estimated 15 percent of all marriages. Each of the country's 50 police stations re-
 ceives approximately one to two complaints of spousal abuse each week. Women in
 such cases usually take refuge in the homes of relatives. The police and the courts
 generally seek to resolve family disputes informally and may ask the offending
 spouse to sign a statement affirming that he will end the abuse. The police refer
 serious cases to the Psychiatric Department at the Ministry of Health. The courts
 have found husbands guilty of spousal abuse. Although it is not common, there are
 reports of rape of female domestic servants by male employers.
 A significant number of employers physically abuse expatriate women working as
 domestic servants, and sexual abuse is also a problem. The local press gives the
 problem considerable attention. Foreign-born servants have the right to sue their
 employers for abuse, but few do so owing to both fear of deportation and fear that
 the judicial system is biased against them. The Government has designated a police
 station to investigate complaints and provide some shelter for runaway maids. Both
 the police and the courts have taken action against employers when presented with
 evidence of serious abuse.
 Runaway servants seek shelter at their country's embassy where they seek repa-
 triation or a change in employers. On several occasions, the Philippine embassy has
 sheltered nearly 300 women at once. Although most of these women sought shelter
 due to contractual or financial problems with their employers, many also had suf-
 fered physical and sexual abuse.
 Women experience legal and social discrimination. They are denied the right to
 vote (see Section 3); their testimony is not given equal weight to that of males in
 the Islamic courts (see Section i.e.), and married women require their husband's
 permission to obtain a passport (see Section 2.d.). By law only males are able to con-
 fer citizenship, which means that children born to Kuwaiti mothers and stateless
 fathers are themselves stateless. Inheritance is governed by Islamic law, which dif-
 fers according to sects. For example, Sunni female heirs receive half the male heirs'
 ---inheritance, while a sole Shi'a female heir may receive the whole of her parents' or
 brother's estate.
 Women are traditionally restrained from choosing certain roles in society, and the
 law restricts women from workiag in "dangerous industries" and trades "harmful"
 to health. Educated women maintain that an Islamic fundamentalist trend limits
 career opportunities. Nonetheless, an estimated 28 percent of women of working age
 are employed. The law promises "remuneration equal to that of a man provided she
 does the same work." This promise is respected in practice. Women work as doctors,
 engineers, lawyers, and professors. A few have reached senior government positions
 in the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Education, and the state-owned Kuwaiti Pe-
 troleum Corporation. However, there are no female judges or prosecutors, and
 women may not run for election to the National Assembly.
 In case of divorce, the Government makes family entitlement payments to the di-
 vorced husband, who is expected by law and custom to provide for his children even
 though custody of minor children is usually given to the mother. The law discrimi-
 nates against women married to foreign men. These women are not entitled to gov-
 ernment housing subsidies that are available to male citizens. The law also requires
 women to pay residence fees for their husbands and does not recognize marriage as
 the basis for granting residency to foreign-born husbands. Instead, the law grants
 residency only if the husband is employed. By contrast, men married to foreign-born
 women do not have to pay residency fees for their spouses, and their spouses' right
 to residency derives from marriage. A gender segregation bill passed the National
 Assembly in July, however the Aniir has not signed it, and it was not in force by
 year's end.
 Polygymy is legal. A husband is obliged to inform his first wife that he is taking
 a second wife. The husband is obligated to provide the first wife a separate house-
 hold if that is her preference. It is the second wife's choice to get married. A first
 wife who objects to a second marriage can request a divorce, but the court's deter-
 mination of divorce and child custody would be made on grounds other than the fact
 of the second marriage itself.
 
 
 1323
 Children.-The Government is committed to the welfare of children. Children re-
 ceive a free education. The Government provides free health care and a variety of
 other services to all children. There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 Marriage of girls under the age of 17 is uncommon among the urban population
 but remains a practice of Bedouins in outlying areas.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no institutionalized discrimination against
 physiclly disabled persons in housing, employment, education, and in the provision
 of state services. In addition to extensive government benefits for the disabled that
 cover transportation, housing, job training, and social welfare, the National Assem-
 bly passed a law mandating accessibility or the disabled to all facilities frequented
 by the public. The law also provides an affirmative action employment program for
 the disabled.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Governments failure to improve the
 plight of the 117,000 bidoon remains a significant human rights abuse. The bidoon
 have been the objects of hostile government policy since the late 1980's. Since then
 the Government has eliminated the bidoon from the census rolls, discontinued their
 access to government jobs and free education, and sought to deport many bidoon.
 In 1993 the Government decreed that bidoon males would no longer be allowed to
 enlist in the military service. Those presently in the armed forces are being gradu-
 ally replaced. The Government does not routinely issue travel documents to bidoon,
 and if bidoon travel abroad, they risk being barred from returning to the country
 unless they receive advance permission from the immigration authorities. Marriages
 pose special hardships because the offspring of male bidoon inherit the father's un-
 determined legal status.
 In 1996 the Government naturalized a small fraction of the bidoon, primarily
 bidoon who have served in the military and security forces, and children born to
 marriages between bidoon males and Kuwaiti women. As a step towards resolving
 the bidoon issue, the Government required all bidoon to register, and issued a card
 to each person that identifies whether the individual's family came to Kuwait before
 or after the 1965 census. The card does not accord the holder any legal status, nor
 is it an official identity document, but anyone who did not register is considered an
 illegal resident subject to deportation. The Government says that it will review the
 registrations; however, the Government has not announced the goal of the process,
 or its standards for review. The Government claims that it will issue a residency
 visa, and legal status to any bidoon who can present a passport, regardless of the
 country of issuance. his has led some bidoon to acquire passports from countries
 with which they have no tie, but which have liberal "economic citizenship" pro-
 gr as. There are reports that the Government has denied residency visas to some
 bidon who obtained passports, particularly Iraqis. In some cases the Government
 has unilaterally decided the "real" nationalities of bidoon without a hearing and
 without possibility of review.
 Since the end of the Gulf War, government policy has been targeted against work-
 ers from those nations that supported Iraq, especially Jordanians and Yemenis, and
 also against Palestinians. The Government ares that during the Iraqi occupation
 many residents from these places sided with the Iraqi forces. The Government has
 delayed or denied the issuance of work and residency permits to persons in these
 groups and in many cases has hindered those workers that are permitted to reside
 in the country from sponsoring their families to join them.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right, but are not required, to join
 unions. Nonetheless, the Government restricts the right of association by prohibiting
 all workers from freely establishing trade unions. The law stipulates that workers
 may establish only one union in any occupational trade and that the unions may
 establish only one federation. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has long
 criticized such restrictions.
 Approximately 50,000 people are organized in 14 unions, 12 of which are affiliated
 with the Kuwait Trade Union Federation (KTUF), the sole, legal trade union federa-
 tion. The Bank Worker's Union and the Kuwait Airways Workers Union are inde-
 pendent. The Government has shown no sign that it would accept the establishment
 of more than one legal trade union federation. The law stipulates that any new
 union must include at least 100 workers, of whom at least 15 are citizens. Both the
 ILO and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) have criti-
 cized this requirement because it discourages unions in sectors employing few citi-
 zens such as the construction industry and domestic sectors.
 The Government's pervasive oversight powers further erode union independence.
 The Government subsidizes as much as 90 percent of most union budgets, may in-
 spect the financial records of any union, and prohibits any union from engaging in
 
 
 1324
 political or religious activities, which the law does not clearly define. The law em-
 powers the courts to dissolve any union for violating labor laws or for threatening
 "public order and morals." Such a court decision may be appealed. The Amir may
 also dissolve a union by decree. By law, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor
 is authorized to seize the assets of any dissolved union. The ILO has criticized this
 aspect of the law. Although no union has been dissolved, the law subordinates the
 legal existence of the unions to the power of the State.
 Foreigners constitute most of the work force and about a third of its unionized
 work orce. Yet the law discriminates agaist foreign workers by permitting them
 to join unions oly aftr 5 years of residence and only as nonvoting members. Un-
 like union members who are citizens, foreign workers do not have the right to elect
 their leadership. The law requires that union officials be citizens. The ILOhas criti-
 cized the 5-year residency requirement and the denial of votin rights for foreign
 workers. KTUF administers an Expatriate Labor Office which is authorized to in-
 vestigate complaints of foreign laborers and provide them with free legal advice.
 Any foreign worker may submit a grievance to the Labor Office regardless of union
 status.
 The law limits the right to strike. It requires that all labor disputes be referred
 to compulsory arbitration if labor and management cannot reach a solution (see Sec-
 tion 6.b.). The law does not have any provision guaranteeing strikers that they will
 be free from any legal or administrative action taken against them by the State.
 Unions may ailiate with international bodies. The K     belongs to the Inter-
 national Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the formerly Soviet-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively, subject to certain restrictions (see Section 6.a.).
 These rights have been incorporated in the Labor Law and have, according to all
 reports, been respected in practice.
 The Labor Law provides for direct negotiations between employers and "laborers
 or their representatives" in the private sector. Most agrements are resolved in such
 negotiations; if not, either party may petition the Ministry of Social Affairs and
 Lor for mediation. If mediation fails, the dispute is referred to a labor arbitration
 board composed of officials from the High Court of Appeals, the Attorney General's
 office, and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
 The Civil Service Law makes no provision for collective bargaining between gov-
 ernment workers and their employer. Technically, wages and conditions of employ-
 ment for civil service workers are established by the Government, but in practice,
 the Government sets the benefit scales after conduc tin informal meetings with offi-
 cials from the civil service unions. Union officials resolve most issues at the working
 level and have regular access to other senior officials.
 The Labor Law prohibits antiunion discrimination. Any worker who alleges
 antiunion discrimination has the right to appeal to the judiciary. There were no re-
 ports of discrimination against employees, based on their affiliation with a union.
 Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination must reinstate workers fired for
 union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor "except in cases specified by law or national emergency and with just remu-
 neration.e
 Foreign workers may not change their employment without permission from their
 originalsponsors unless they have been in the country for over 2 years. Domestic
 servants are particularly vulnerable to abuses from this practice because they are
 not protected by labor law. In many cases employers exercise some control over their
 servants by holding their passports, although the Government prohibits this prac-
 tice and has acted to retrieve passports of maids involved in disputes.
 Domestic servants who run away from their employers may be treated as crimi-
 nals under the law. However, the authorities usually do not enforce this prvision
 of the law. In some reported cases, employers illegally withheld wages from domes-
 tic servants to cover the costs involved in bringing them to Kuwait. The Government
 has done little, if anything, to protect domestics in such cases.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age is 18
 years for all forms of work, oth full- and part-time. Employers must obtain permits
 from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Lsaor to employ juveniles between the ages
 of 14 and 18 in certain trades. Education is compulsory for children between the
 ages of 6 and 15. These laws are not fully observed in the nonindustrial sector, al-
 though no instances involving children have been alleged. Some small businessmen
 employ their children on a part-time basis, and there have been unconfirmed reports
 
 
 1325
 that some south Asian domestic servants are under the age of 18, but falsified their
 age in order to enter Kuwait.
 Juveniles may work a maximum of 6 hours a day on the condition that they work
 no more than 4 consecutive hours followed by a 1-hour rest period.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministr of Socia Affairs and Labor is re-
 sponsible for enforcing all labor laws. A two-tiered labor market ensures high wages
 for Kuwaiti employees while foreign workers particularly unskilled laborers, receive
 substantially lower wages. There is no lega minimum wage in the private sector.
 In the public sector, the effective minimum wage is approximately $757 (226 dinars)
 per month for citizens and approximately $301 (90 dinars) per month for nonciti-
 zens. The public sector minimum wage provides an acceptable standard of living for
 a worker and family. Wages of unskilled workers in the private sector do not always
 permit a decent standard of living.
 The Labor Law establishes general conditions of work for both the public and the
 private sectors, with the oil industry treated separately. The Civil Service Law also
 prescribes additional conditions for the public sector. The Labor Law limits the
 standard workweek to 48 hours with 1 full day of rest per week, provides for a mini-
 mum of 14 workdays of leave each year, and establishes a compensation schedule
 for industrial accidents. Domestic servants who are specifically excluded from the
 Private Sector Labor Law, frequently work long hours, greatly in excess of 48 hours.
 The ILO has urged the Government to guarantee the weekly 24-consecutive-hour
 rest period to temporary workers employed for a period of less than 6 months and
 workers in enterprises employing fewer than five persons. The law pertaining to the
 oil industry provides for a 40-hour workweek, 30 days of annual leave, and sick
 leave. Laws establishing work conditions are not always applied uniformly to foreign
 workers. Labor law also provides for employer-provided medical care and compensa-
 tion to workers disabled by injury or disease due to job-related causes. The law also
 requires that employers provide periodic medical examinations to workers exposed
 to environmentalhazards on the job (i.e., chemicals, asbestos, etc.). The Government
 has issued occupational health and safety standards; however, corn liance and en-
 forcement appear poor especially with respect to unskilled foreign laborers. Employ-
 ers often exploit workers' willingness to accept substandard conditions. Foreign
 workers, especially unskilled or semiskilled south Asian workers, frequently face
 contractual disputes, poor working conditions, and some physical abuse.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to their continued employment, and legal protections exist for
 workers who file complaints about such conditions. The latest available figures for
 occupational injuries show 1,472 such occurrences in 1994, primarily in the sectors
 of construction and building, manufacturing, hotels and restaurants, and transpor-
 tation. To cut accident rates, the Government periodically inspects installations to
 raise awareness among workers and employers and ensure that they abide by the
 safety rules, control the pollution resulting from certain dangerous industries, train
 workers in specialized institutes to use new machines, and report violations.
