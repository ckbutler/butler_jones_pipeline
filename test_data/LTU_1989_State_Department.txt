 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania, the largest of the three Baltic states, was an
 independent state between the two World Wars. It was forcibly
 annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as a constituent republic
 of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.). The
 United States does not recognize the forcible incorporation of
 Lithuania into the U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Lithuania has generally been
 subjected to the same centralized rule, the same constitution
 and judicial system, and'the same restrictions on civil and
 political liberties as in the Soviet Union. Political power
 has been exercised by the leadership of the Communist Party of
 the Soviet Union, which tightly controlled the activities of
 local government and Communist Party structures in Lithuania.
 Since 1988 Lithuanians have taken advantage of liberalization
 in the Soviet Union to seize greater control over their own
 affairs. Responding to mass public pressure demanding
 political democracy and respect for human rights, the
 Lithuanian Supreme Soviet (parliament) adopted a "Declaration
 of State Sovereignty" and constitutional amendments in May
 1989, declaring that its laws superseded those of the U.S.S.R.
 Supreme Soviet.' In response to both the Lithuanian
 declaration and related developments in other Republics, the
 U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet Presidium voted on November 10 to
 instruct all 15 Republic Supreme Soviets to bring their laws
 into conformity with all-Union law and the Soviet
 Constitution. By year's end, however, no action had been
 taken to enforce this declaration.
 A commission of the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet approved a
 report which characterized the 1940 incorporation of Lithuania
 into the.Soviet Union as illegal. The Supreme Soviet also
 repealed the constitutional provision which provided for the
 "leading role".of the Communist Party, paving the way for a
 multiparty political'system, and the Lithuanian Communist
 Party declared itself to be independent of the Communist Party
 of the poviet Union. Two competing political parties, the
 independent Lithuanian Communist party and the Lithuanian
 Democratic Party, were officially registered by year's end.
 The primary law enforcement organization in Lithuania is the
 militia (police), the officers of which are predominantly
 Lithuanian. The powerful Committee for State Security
 (K.G.B.), special troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs
 (M.V.D.), and the regular Soviet armed forces, which maintain
 a significant presence in Lithuania, can be assumed to take
 orders from authorities in Moscow. Although K.G.B.
 surveillance continues, there were few reports of human rights
 violations in 1989 by the security and military apparatus.
 The standard of living in Lithuania is higher than the Soviet
 average, but the margin is shrinking. Lithuanians resent the
 fact that much of the national income they create is
 transferred to other republics and that most major economic
 enterprisbs are controlled by central ministries in Moscow.
 They also complain 6bout a continuing decline in the quality
 and quantity of food supplies and consumer goods. In May the
 Lithuanian Supreme Soviet adopted a plan for a transition to
 economic autonomy to begin on January 1, 1990, with future
 relations between the Lithuanian and Soviet economies to be
 based upon mutually acceptable agreements. The U.S.S.R.
 Supreme Soviet in November voted to grant Lithuania control
 over its land, resources, banks, and a portion of state-run
 industries.

 LITHUANIA
 The human rights situation in Lithuania improved markedly for
 the second year in a row in 1989. As in the latter part of
 1988, the authorities tolerated public expressions of
 Lithuanian national sentiment and independent political views
 which previously had been repressed. For the first time since
 annexation by the Soviet Union, relatively free multicandidate
 elections to the U.S.S.R. Congress of People's Deputies were
 held. The Lithuanian Popular Front, Sajudis, a mass,
 prodemocratic organization, swept the elections after
 declaring that its goal is to restore the independence of
 Lithuania. Limited progress was made, both in Lithuania and
 the Soviet Union, toward legislative reforms that would serve
 to institutionalize human rights improvements.
 RESPECT FOR HUI-TAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known cases of such killings in 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In Lithuania, as in the Soviet Union, harsh treatment of
 prisoners occurs during both interrogation and confinement in
 labor camps, prisons, or psychiatric hospitals. Physical and
 psychological abuse of prisoners, as well as detention under
 extremely unhealthful conditions, are common. Lithuanians
 remained concerned in 1989 about allegations that Lithuanian
 youths are subjected to brutal and degrading treatment in the
 Soviet armed forces, leading in some cases to physical
 injuries, psychological trauma, and even suicide.
 -   d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet laws are written and interpreted so broadly that
 persons may be arrested and convicted for trying to exercise
 their basic human rights. During 1989, however, the
 authorities in Lithuania did not use these laws to arrest
 political activists.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Lithuanian Communist Party and Government in the past
 frequently subverted constitutional provisions for the
 objectivity and independence of the judicial process.
 Procedural safeguards, such as the right to a public trial and
 to a defense attorney, are generally respected but are not
 sufficient to guarantee fair trials. Reforms to strengthen
 the rights of defendants have been proposed but were not
 implemented in 1989. There were no known trials on purely
 political charges in 1989, and no Lithuanians were known to be
 imprisoned for purely political reasons at year's end. Many
 Lithuanians were juridically rehabilitated in 1989 following
 
 
 1179
 LITHUANIA
 judicial review of cases in which they had been convicted on
 political charges in previous years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Through the use of informers, monitoring of telephones and
 mail, surveillance, and other means, government authorities
 have the ability to interfere in every aspect of personal
 life. Constitutional provisions to the contrary, Soviet
 investigative agencies do not abstain from forced entry and
 illegal searches. The security apparatus did little, however,
 to intimidate Lithuanians or to hinder the virtual explosion
 of social and political activism which began in 1988 and
 continUed in 1989, Advocates of Lithuanian independence
 reported that obvious surveillance of their movements declined
 in 1989. Contacts between Lithuanians and visitors from
 foreign countries continued to be monitored, but the
 authorities facilitated a very considerable increase in such
 contacts during 1989. Although many Lithuanians continued to
 assume that telephones and mail were monitored, they exhibited
 little fear of using them to express their views.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Soviet Constitution provides for most internationally
 accepted political liberties on condition that their exercise
 does not threaten the security of the Socialist system. In
 previous years, the authorities had interpreted all such
 constitutional guarantees to fit the convenience of the
 State. Vague Soviet laws prohibiting "anti-Soviet agitation
 and propaganda" and "anti-Soviet slander," which had
 frequently been used in previous years to punish Lithuanian
 political and religious activists, were replaced in 1989 by a
 more limited provision which specifically prohibits calls for
 the "violent ovbrthrow" of the Soviet system.
 In 1989 freedom of speech was widely respected. The
 authorities tolerated public expression of virtually any
 viewpoint, including criticism'of Soviet officials and support
 for total Lithuanian independence. Approximately 1.6 million
 Lithuanians signed a petition which called for the withdrawal
 of Soviet "occupation" troops from Lithuania. In the fall
 over 1,000 young Lithuanians tore and burned their draft
 letters to underscore their refusal .to serve a 2-year
 conscription term based on a provision of the Geneva agreement
 of 1949 that an occupying army may not forcibly conscript the
 men of the occupied territories. Display of Lithuanian
 national symbols, such as the prewar flag, which had been
 repressed until mid-1988, was extremely widespread and
 officially sanctioned in 1989.
 The range of subjects covered by official Lithuanian
 televisioh, radio, and publications continued to expand in
 1989. Print and electronic media devoted considerable
 attention to the 50th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop
 Nonaggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany,
 together with the secret protocols that became the basis for
 the Soviet occupation and annexation of the three Baltic
 states. The Pact and the protocols were widely republished by
 Lithuanian papers, which also extensively described the Soviet
 Union's 1940 occupation,
 
 
 1180
 LITHUANIA
 Lithuanian media provided extensive information about the
 positions of candidates in the spring elections for the
 U.S.S.R. Congress of People's Deputies, and they regularly
 reported on the views of the Baltic deputies to the Soviet
 parliament. These views frequently differed from those of the
 political leadership in Moscow. The Central Committee of the
 Soviet Communist Party issued a harshly critical statement on
 August 26 about the Baltic opposition movement's failure to
 curb "extremist" and "separatist" forces. Nevertheless, the
 Lithuanian Supreme Soviet on December 4 voted to replace the
 provision in its Constitution which provided for the "leading
 role" of the Communist Party with one legalizing political
 parties and organizations.
 While self-censorship was exercised in varying degrees by
 individual editors and journalists, no political subject
 remained off-limits in 1989. Articles advocating the
 reestablishment of Lithuanian independence appeared regularly
 in state-supported publications. Official censorship was
 apparently used only to prevent the publication of such "state
 secrets" as operational military information.
 Despite the open nature of the Lithuanian press, most
 publications remained under the formal control of the
 Communist Party or other official organizations. Dozens of
 independent publications were also produced legally by Sajudis
 and some other nonofficial organizations. Unauthorized
 (samizdat) publications appeared without hindrance from the
 authorities, but the opinions in such publications were
 increasingly available in the official press.
 In Kaunas a university has been established which is
 independent from Republic or all-Union educational ministries,
 and the Republic's Academy of Sciences is urging complete
 independence from Moscow.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The peaceful assembly of citizens is controlled by the
 authorities, who retain the power to prohibit public
 gatherings. Soviet guidelines on demonstrations and meetings
 are contained in a 1988 decree confirmed by the U.S.S.R.
 Supreme Soviet.
 In practice, the people of Lithuania were allowed to hold mass
 meetings and demonstrations without hindrance from the
 authorities in 1989. Many of these meetings took place on the
 anniversaries of historical events, commemoration of which had
 been repressed as recently as 2 years ago.
 The Presidium of the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet declared that
 February 16, the independence day of the interwar Lithuanian
 Republic, should be officially commemorated as the "Day of
 Restoration of Lithuanian Statehood." Lithuanian Communist
 Party and government leaders participated along with the
 representatives of Sajudis and the Lithuanian Liberty League
 and religious leaders in public ceremonies attended by tens of
 thousands of people to mark the event.
 Hundreds of thousands of Lithuanians joined hands with
 Latvians, Estonians, and others on August 23 in a
 2-million-person chain that extended from Tallinn, Estonia,
 through Riga, Latvia, to Vilnius, Lithuania, as a sign of
 protest marking the 50th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop
 Pact.
 
 
 1181
 LITHUANIA
 The Lithuanian Constitution provides.for the right to
 associate in public organizations, but this right had been
 limited in previous years by legislhtion and repressive
 practices. While continuing to exercise a measure of control
 over mass organizations associated with the Communist Party,
 the authoiities have acquiesced in the rapid growth of Sajudis
 as well as many other independent clubs, professional
 associations, and organizations which refer to themselves as
 "political parties." There were no reports of significant
 harassment against any of these groups. Even the official
 Communist youth organization, the Komsomol, decided in June to
 break all its official ties to the central Komsomol
 organization in Moscow. The Lithuanian Communist Party in
 December declared itself independent of the Communist Party of
 the Soviet Union. An emergency session of the Communist Party
 of the Soviet Union (CPSU) Central Committee plenum met in
 December to discuss Moscow's reaction to the Lithuanian
 Communist Party vote. As 1989 closed, the CPSU Central
 Committee plenum had decided to send a high-level delegation
 to Lithuania in early 1990, but further action was not taken.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor Unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Soviet Constitution provides for the right to
 profess, or not to profess, any religion, both the party and
 Government promote atheism. The authorities continued to
 improve their relations with organized religion in 1989.
 Christmas was celebrated as an officially sanctioned holiday
 for the second consecutive year, and All Saints' Day was also
 celebrated for the second time since 1940. The Lithuanian
 Catholic Church began to publish a monthly journal on official
 printing presses, and religious television programming began
 to be shown on a regular weekly basis. The Lithuanian
 Catholic Church also gained greater control over the
 selection, training, and appointment of priests, which had
 previouslybeen the subject of consIderable government
 interference.�" Top Lithuanian political leaders held highly
 publicized meetings with leaders of the Republic's religious
 communities. Some church property, including churches,
 chapels, and monasteries, has b~en returned to the church. A
 second seminary was allowed to open.
 State control of religion nevertheless continued to be
 formally governed by repressive 1929. Soviet legislation, as
 the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet has not yet adopted a new law to
 guarantee freedom of conscience. The Lithuanian Supreme
 Soviet, however, in November amended its Constitution to
 guarantee 'freedom of thought, profession of religion, and the
 independence of church organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is neither guaranteed by law nor fully
 respected in practice, although Soviet officials have publicly
 pledged to bring their legislation into conformity with
 international standards. The right to emigrate by choice is
 not recognized by Soviet law, and persons wishing to leave
 temporarily are generally required to present an invitation
 from abroad. Many Soviet Jews in Lithuania were denied
 permission to emigrate in previous years, but the upsurge in
 Soviet Jewish emigration has had a positive effect on Jewish
 
 
 1182
 LITHUANIA
 emigration from Lithuania as well.
 Although travel abroad is limited by restrictive legislation
 and arbitrary enforcement, bureaucratic procedures are
 considerably less cumbersome in Lithuania than in the Soviet
 Union as a whole. For the second consecutive year, there was
 a dramatic increase in the number of Lithuanians visiting the
 United States and other Western countries in 1989. Leading
 figures in all the main political movements, including Sajudis
 and other groups favoring Lithuanian independence, visited
 Western countries to present their views.
 The number of visits by Lithuanian-Americans, other emigres
 and persons of Lithuanian background to Lithuania rose
 dramatically for the second consecutive year, with many
 visitors permitted to travel to areas formally "closed" to
 foreigners, although some Lithuanian-Americans have still been
 denied visas.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Until 1989 the peoples of Lithuania and the Soviet Union had
 not been free to change government leaders or the system of
 government. For the first time in postwar Lithuanian history,
 however, representatives to the U.S.S.R. Congress of People's
 Deputies (the all-Union legislature) were chosen in 1989 by
 secret ballot, on the basis of universal suffrage, in
 relatively free multicandidate elections.
 Although alternative parties could not formally participate in
 the Lithuanian elections, nominating procedures-were
 sufficiently flexible to permit nomination of candidates with
 a very broad range of political views. In Lithuania, unlike
 many areas of the Soviet Union, there was no apparent
 manipulation of the candidate registration process to exclude
 "troublesome" candidates from the ballot. Of 42 seats, 36
 were won by candidates, includiung some Communists, endorsed
 by Sajudis, and the remaining 6 were retained by Communist
 Party leaders. While many Communist Party leaders were
 elected or reelected to their posts, others--including the
 Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of
 Lithuania--were defeated. Most successful candidates
 campaigned with the active support of Sajudis, which
 voluntarily withdrew its front-running candidates to allow the
 election of the party's two top leaders.
 The spring elections to the U.S.S.R.'s legislature were
 boycotted by the Lithuanian Liberty League and some other
 proindependence organizations, which opposed participation in
 elections to the legislature of Lithuania's "occupying
 power." Participation in the elections was nevertheless very
 high--over 80 percent. Although the Lithuanian Parliament and
 Government were not democratically elected, in 1989 they were
 frequently responsive to the sentiments of popular movements
 and the general public. Draft laws were circulated and
 amended on the basis of public debate, parliamentarians
 frequently voted on the basis of their constituents' expressed
 interests, and the agenda for government action was heavily
 influenced by Sajudis, a leader of which--Kazimiera
 Prunskiene--was appointed as a Deputy Prime Minister in 1989.
 A commission of the Supreme Soviet condemned the
 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and characterized the Republic's
 incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940 as illegal.
 
 
 1183
 LITHUANIA
 Multicandidate elections to the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet were
 scheduled to be held on February 24, 1990.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government has adopted a more forthcoming approach
 to foreign criticism of its human rights record in recent
 years, acknowledging that human rights are a legitimate
 subject of official diplomatic intercourse. Although there
 were few allegations of human rights violations in Lithuania
 in 1989, the Lithuanian Government generally welcomed foreign
 and nongovernmental observers on any subject. Its decision to
 allow eight Lithuanian-American activists to visit Lithuania
 for the February 16 Independence Day ceremonies, however, was
 apparently overruled by Moscow, and their visa applications
 were denied. At the end of 1989, a subsequent application by
 a member of this group was again denied, as were the
 applications of other American activists.
 The Government did not interfere with the activities of
 various independent human rights groups in Lithuania,
 including those led by such former political prisoners as
 Helsinki Final Act monitor Viktoras Petkus. The last person
 regarded by most of these groups as a Lithuanian political
 prisoner, Boleslavas Liziunas, was pardoned and freed in 1989.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited in the Constitution. The relative homogeneity of
 Lithuania's'population, its strong sense of national identity,
 and the binding force of the Lithuanian Catholic Church have
 helped to preserve'many of the country's social and cultural
 traditions. Nevertheless, the disruptive effects of an
 antireligious ideology, forced collectivization, and a policy
 of industrialization have been severe. Lithuanians complain
 that immigrants from the Soviet Union receive favored
 treatment in the provision of housing and other social
 services and that nonresidents frequently visit Lithuania in
 order to shop in the Republic's stores.
 Regulations were issued to prevent nonresidents of Lithuania
 from purchasing goods which are in short supply, and economic
 measures to discourage immigration were adopted by major
 Lithuanian cities in 1989. The, Lithuanian Supreme Soviet
 adopted a law granting Lithuanian citizenship to virtually all
 permanent residents of the Republic, while providing stringent
 requirements for new immigrants to become citizens.
 Among non-Lithuanian residents of Lithuania, about 20 percent
 of the population (mostly Poles and Russians), there has been
 some concern about the rise of Lithuanian nationalist
 sentiment in 1988 and 1989. Some non-Lithuanians formed
 organizations known as "Yedinstvo" (Unity) and the "Committee
 to Defend Soviet Power," ostensibly to oppose discriminatory
 and separatist'tendencies among Lithuanians. Members of these
 groups claimed, for example, that a newly adopted Lithuanian
 language law was discriminatory against residents of Russian
 and Polish background.
 Local government councils of two predominantly Polish
 districts in Lithuania declared themselves to be "autonomous"
 
 
 1184
 LITHUANIA
 in 1989. This step was criticized and rejected by the central
 Lithuanian authorities.
 Most ethnic groups have formed officially recognized cultural
 societies which work closely with Sajudis on proposals to
 enhance their cultural autonomy. A law to protect the rights
 of national minorities was adopted by the Lithuanian Supreme
 Soviet in November.
 Over the past 10 years, discrimination and persecution has
 been directed against Lithuanians who sought to express their
 national and cultural identity, against independent political
 and religious activists, and against Jews and Pentecostalists
 wishing to leave the country.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, and an
 extensive system of day-care service and maternity benefits
 assists women in obtaining and retaining jobs.
 Lithuanian statistics on the problem of violence against
 women, including wife beating, are unavailable. The official
 Soviet press in 1989 discussed the issue, and the Soviet
 Council of Ministers established a special branch (headed by a
 woman) to study the problems of women. Human rights and
 women's rights groups in Lithuania are aware of the issue but
 have focused their efforts thus far on the broader question of
 independence and freedom.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Soviet labor law and practice has generally been enforced in
 Lithuania. There has been no right of association as defined
 by the International Labor Organization. Although the
 Constitution grants Soviet citizens the right to form trade
 unions, attempts to exercise this right independently of the
 state-controlled union had always been repressed. New
 professional associations and an independent "Lithuanian
 Workers' Union" with close ties to Sajudis were created in
 1989, but it is not yet clear whether they will effectively
 exercise trade union functions.
 Soviet authorities permitted the travel to the United States
 of a member of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, who
 is the leader of an independent union in Lithuania, in order
 to attend the convention of the American Federation of Labor
 and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
 A few brief strikes were reported in the Lithuanian press in
 1989. There were no reports of repression against strikers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in Lithuania have not generally been able to organize
 or resort to collective bargaining. There are no economic
 incentive zones or special industries in which labor standards
 differ from those elsewhere in Lithuania. Virtually all
 workers in the Soviet Union automatically become members of an
 affiliate of the official trade union organization, the
 All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, in order to be
 entitled to government social welfare benefits.
 
 
 1185
 LITHUANIA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Soviet law contains no prohibition on forced and compulsory
 labor. Most prisoners are confined to camps where they are
 forced to labor, often under harsh and degrading conditions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum age for employment of children is 16.
 There is no indication of widespread violations of this
 norm.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor cbnditions in Lithuania are similar to those in the
 Soviet Union. According to the Soviet State Statistical
 Committee, the average monthly wage in Lithuania for blue- and
 white-collar workers in September 1989 was $396 and for
 collective farm workers $282 at the official exchange rate.
 The minimum monthly wage in the U.S.S.R. was $140. (The ruble
 is not a convertible currency, and its value here in terms of
 the U.S. dollar does not represent actual purchasing power for
 international purposes.)
 The average workweek is 40 hours for most white-collar workers
 and 41 hours for most blue-collar workers. Soviet law
 establishes minimum conditions of health and safety. Press
 reports-suggest, however, that the laws on maximum hours of
 work and health and safety standards are widely ignored.
