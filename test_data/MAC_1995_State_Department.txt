 MACAU
 Macau, a tiny enclave on the south China coast encompassing only 6 square
 miles, is recognized by both China and Portugal as Chinese territory under Por-
 tuguese administration. The "Organic Statute of 1976, which serves as Macau's
 Constitution, grants it considerable administrative, financial, and legislative auton-
 omy. Legislative power is exercised by both the Governor and the Legislative As-
 sembly. The Governor, appointed by the Portuguese President, holds expansive pow-
 ers under the Organic Statute.
 Under the 1987 Sino-Portuguese joint declaration, Macau will become a Special
 Administration Region (SAR) of China on December 20, 1999, and operate under the
 principle of "one country, two systems," to remain unchanged for 50 years. The
 Macau SAR's future Constitution, a joint Sino-Portuguese document called the
 "Basic Law," was promulgated on March 31, 1993.
 Portuguese metropolitan law serves as the basis for the legal system, which fea-
 tures a judiciary and jury trials. The police force maintains public order and is
 under control of the civilian authorities.
 The market-based economy is fueled by legalized gambling, which generates ap-
 proximately one-half of government revenue. A thriving tourist industry and the ex-
 port of textiles and other light industrial products also contribute to economic
 growth. The opening of an international airport in December is expected to promote
 future economic expansion. The economy provides a high standard of living for its
 citizens.
 Although citizens derive a wide range of rights and freedoms from Macau's status
 as a Portuguese territory, they have limited ability to change their government. The
 Governor is appointed by the Portuguese President, only a third of the legislators
 are directly elected, and the territory's future path has been set by Lisbon and
 Beijing. New legislation, effective in November, provides greater equality in the
 work force for women. China, through the Basic Law, has agreed to continue the
 application of international covenants on civil and political rights and on economic,
 social, and cultural rights after 1999. Following a 1995 ruling of the Constitutional
 Court in Lisbon, the Macau Supreme Court reversed a decision to extradite to China
 three men alleged to have committed crimes in that country. This followed inter-
 national criticism of the involuntary transfer by the police to Chinese authorities
 of an Australian citizen of Chinese ancestry in 1994. Macau authorities investigated
 this matter and claimed to have found no evidence of police misconduct. There are
 credible reports that media self-censorship continues as 1999 draws nearer, particu-
 larly on issues considered to be sensitive to China.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Klling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 979
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such abuses are prohibited by law, and the authorities respect this in practice. Pris-
 on conditions meet minimum international standardh, and the Government permits
 visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal prohibitions against arbitrary ar-
 rest exist, and the authorities respect them in practice. The examining judge, who
 conducts a pretrial inquiry in criminal cases, has a wide range of powers to collect
 evidence, order or dismiss indictments, validate and maintain the detention of sus-
 pects, and determine whether to release accused persons. Police must present er-
 sons remanded in custody to an examining judge within 48 hours of detention. The
 accused's counsel may examine the evidence. If the judge is not convinced that the
 evidence is adequate, he may dismiss the accused.
 A recent rnling by the Macau Supreme Court upholdin g a Portuguese Constitu-
 tional Court decision on the unconstitutionality of extraditing individuals to coun-
 tries that practice the death penalty clarified Macau's policy towards people alleged
 to have coinmitted commercial or criminal violations in China. This ruling followed
 international criticism of the involuntary transfer to Chinese authorities of an Aus-
 tralian citizen of Chinese ancestry in 1994. Macau authorities investigated this mat-
 ter and claim to have found no evidence of police misconduct. Human rights activ-
 ists claim that in numerous cases in the past, Macau police had "transferred" de-
 tainees to China, despite the absence of a Sino-Portuguese extradition treaty. The
 Macau authorities have suggested that the three persons affected by the recent
 court ruling could be tried in Macau for the crimes they allegedly committed in
 China, using evidence and witnesses furnished by China. Chinese officials on the
 Sino-Portugese Joint Liaison Group, however, criticized the decision by the Macau
 Supreme ourt, arguing that because Macau is considered to be a part of China,
 no formal extradition arrangements are necessary for the transfer of prisoners want-
 ed by China.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Changes to the judicial system in 1993 designed
 to render the system autonomous from the Portuguese system-required to bring
 the system into line with the structure for the judicial system specified in the Sino-
 Portuguese Basic Law-raised some conerns .among human rights observers and
 journalists. Prior to the rerganzation, the judciary of Macau had only subordinate
 (first instance) courts located in the territory. In the first stage of the reforms, new
 courts, most notably a Supreme Court of Justice, were established to allow appeals
 to be heard locally.
 The Macau Superior Court currently onsists of six magistrates broken down into
 two panels, one of which hears only administrative, fiscal, and customs duties cases
 and the other overseeing all other types of cases. An additional judge serves as
 President of the Court. Cases before te Supreme Court are heard initially by the
 relevant panel of three judges. In instances where a judgment has been rendered
 by such a panel and subequently appealed, the   is then heard by all six judges,
 with the President voting only in case of a tie. This structure results in a situation
 where three of the individuals hearing a  ppeal have already rendered an opinion
 in the initial judgment, which critics chnarge calls into question the objectivity of the
 subsequent appeal ruling. Until full autonomy of the Macau courts is achieved, how-
 ever, some special appeal cases may still be either presented directly to outside
 courts in Portugal or reach them through a local court.
 Journalists and human rights activists have also voiced concerns that, as a result
 of the 1993 reforms, judges and public prosecutors are now appointed by the Gov-
 ernor based on proposals made by two administrative boards of the judiciary: the
 Supreme Council of Justice, which recommends judges for appointment o the
 Macau Supreme Court as well as the local attorney general, and the Judiciary
 Council of Macau, which recommends judges for the Macau common courts and del-
 egates to the public prosecutor's office. In particular, critics charge that the strong
 ties members of the latter group have to the executive branch and to China raise
 questions about the independence of the judiciary, particularly as judges and public
 prosecutors rely on the Judiciary Council to win renewal of their 3-year assign-
 ments. The 3-year appointment of judges differs from the practice n Portugal,
 where appointments are generally for life.
 The law provides for a fair trial, and this is generally observed. The Constitution
 provides for the right of access to law and the courts. The defense of indigent people
 and absentees are the responsibility of the public prosecution office. Public prosecu-
 tors are appointed by the Governor.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.  Home or  ofre o  ece.-Laws
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, jdes or  apponte  te
 provide for the inviolability of the home and of communcation, the right of owner-
 
 
 980
 ship of private property and enterprises, and the freedom to marry and raise a fam-
 ily. There are no indications of abuse of these rights by the Government.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.--Journalists and human rights activists believe
 that the practice of media self-censorship is increasing in Macau as reversion ap-
 proaches. Critics charge that Macau's leading newspapers are pro-China publica-
 tions that do not give equal coverage to liberal and prodemocracy voices. Reporters
 and human rights monitors expressed concern over directives issued over a 2-year
 period, but which only came to light in October, by a senior manager at the govern-
 ment-controlled news agency. These directives instructed personnel not to report on
 such issues as hunger strikes by Chinese dissidents, issues stemming from the 1989
 Tiananmen crackdown, and statements by leading prodemocracy voices in Macau.
 The news agency responded by stating that the senior official had acted alone in
 issuing these directives and had been reassigned to another department.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government has assisted in the resettlement of Vietnamese boat people. At
 year's end, there were only nine Vietnamese refugees living in Macau. All other boat
 people have emigrated to host countries.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have a limited ability to change their government. The 23-member Legis-
 lative Assembly is composed of 8 members elected in universal direct elections; 8
 indirectly elected by local community interests; and 7 appointed by the Governor.
 The Consultative Council, an advisory group to the Governor composed of elected
 and appointed members, also provides some measure of popular representation. By
 tradition, the Government also consults informally on a regular basis with local
 business and cultural leaders. Although the Legislative Assembly can enact laws on
 all matters except those reserved forbodies inPortugal or the Governor, in reality
 the Governor initiates the vast majority of legislation, either directly through "de-
 cree-laws" or in the form of "proposals of law" that require that he receive the per-
 mission of the Legislative Assembly prior to issuing legislation. While the Legisla-
 tive Assembly has the legal power to refuse to ratify laws issued by the Governor,
 in practice this is seldom done.
 Although women traditionally have played a minor role in local political life, they
 increasingly are being found in senior positions throughout the administration. The
 Legislative Assembly has three female members including the President of the As-
 sembly, which is the second most senior position. The Undersecretary for Health
 and Social Affairs is a woman, and other high-level positions in administrative min-
 istries, including education and statistics, are filled by women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 While the Constitution does not explicitly proscribe discrimination based on race,
 sex, religion, disability, langua e or social status, it does incorporate the principle
 of nondiscrimination. Separate iaws enshrine many of these rights. Access to edu-
 cation, for example, is provided for all residents regardless of race, religious belief,
 or political or ideological convictions under the law which establishes the general
 framework for Macau's educational system.
 Women.-Cases of violence against women are not common. For cases that are re-
 ported, the authorities enforce criminal statutes prohibiting domestic violence and
 prosecute violators. Police and doctors report abuses to the Social Welfare Depart-
 ment, which investigates them. If hospital treatment is required, a medical social
 worker counsels the victim and informs her about social welfare services. Until their
 complaints are resolved, battered women may be placed in public housing, but no
 facilities are reserved expressly for them.

 Women are becoming more active and visible in business and government, and
 some enjoy considerable influence and responsibility in these areas. Equal oppor-
 tunity legislation, applicable to all public and private organizations and enacted in
 1995, mandates that women receive equal pay for equal work, states that discrimi-
 nation based on sex or physical ability is not permitted, and establishes penalties
 for employers found to be in violation of these guidelines.
 Children.-The Government has not promulgated any statutes specifically to pro-
 tect the rights of children, relying on the general framework of civil and political
 rights legislation to protect all citizens. However, the Government seeks to protect
 the health and well-being of children, who represent a growing share of the popu-
 lation. The Social Welfare Institute is charged with taking the lead in implementing
 programs designed to provide services for children. A government-sponsored panel,
 set up to study specifically the provision of social services for Chinese families, re-
 cently recommended that greater effort be expended to address the need for addi-
 tional educational and other services for children.
 Child abuse and exploitation are not widespread problems.
 People With Disabilities.-The extent to which physically disabled persons experi-
 ence discrimination in employment, education, and the provision of state sarvices is
 not known. The Government gives little attention to the subject, and there is little
 funding for special programs aimed at helping the physically and mentally disabled
 gain better access to employment, education, and public facilities. The Government
 has not mandated accessib  for the disabled, legislatively or otherwise.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minoritie.-Although the governmental and legal sys-
 tems place a premium on knowledge of the Portuguese language, which is spoken
 by less than 4 percent of the population, the Chinese language received official sta-
 tus in 1993, and the use of Chinese in the civil service is growing.
 There is considerable public pressure for the Government to speed up the process
 of making the civil service more representative of the population; however, the pace
 of adding native bern Chinese speakers to the senior civil service has been very
 slow.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Portuguese Constitution recognizes the right
 and freedom of all workers to form and join trade unions and of private sector
 unions to strike, and these rights are extended to Macau. The Government neither
 impedes the formation of trade unions nor discriminates against union members.
 People's Republic of China interests heavily influence local trade union activities,
 including the selection of union leadership, and stress the importance of stability
 and minimum disruption of the work force. Nearly all of Macau's private sector
 union members belong to a pro-China labor confederation. Many local observers
 claim that this organization is more interested in furthering the Chinese political
 agenda in Macau than in addressing classic trade union issues. A few private sector
 unions and two of the four public sector unions are outside Chinese control. Al-
 though the Portuguese Constitution provides workers with the right to strike, labor
 leaders complain that there is no effective protection from retribution should they
 exercise this right.
 Unions may -reely form federations and affiliate with international bodies. Three
 civil services unions are affiliated with the major non-Communist Portuguese union
 confederation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions tend to resemble local
 traditional neighborhood associations, promoting social and cultural activities rather
 than issues relating to the workplace. Local customs, moreover, normally favor em-
 ployment without the benefit of written labor contracts except in the case of labor
 from China. Unions traditionally have not attempted to engage in collective bargain-
 ing. Portuguese laws protecting collective bargaining apply to Macau and the Gov-
 ernment does not impede or discourage such activity. No rules apply to the setting
 of wages and no minimum wage exists for local or foreign workers.
 However, a significant amount of the total work force (approximately 16 percent)
 is composed of laborers from China and other countries who fill both blue- and
 white-collar positions. These workers often work for less than half the wages paid
 to a Macau citizen performing the same job, live in controlled dormitories, wok 10
 to 12 hours a day, and owe large sums of money to the labor importing company
 for the purchase of their job. Labor interests claim that the high percentage ofim-
 ported labor erodes the bargaining power of local residents to improve working con-
 ditions and increase wages.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination and there were no complaints of it.
 There are no export processing zones; all of Macau is a free port.
 
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is illegal and
 does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law forbids minors under the
 age of 16 to work, except in businesses operated by their families. The Labor De-
 partment which enforces this law refers offending employers to the judicial authori-
 ties for prosecution. The Labor Department claims that the incidence of child labor
 has declined radically since effective enforcement began in 1985. School attendance
 is not compulsory.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In the absence of any statutory minimum wage
 or publicly administered social security programs, some large companies have pro-
 vided private welfare and security packages. Calls for labor reform, improvements
 in medical insurance and social security programs, and increases in employee com-
 pensation figure regularly in political campaign platforms.
 Labor legislation provides for a 48-hour workweek, an 8-hour workday, overtime,
 annual leave, medical and maternity care, and employee compensation insurance.
 Although the Labor Law provides a 24-hour rest period for every 7 days of work,
 worker representatives report that workers frequently agree to work overtime to
 compensate for low wages. The Department of Labor provides assistance and legal
 advice to workers on request, but government enforcement of labor laws is lax be-
 cause of limited resources.
 The Department of Labor enforces occupational safety and health. Failure to cor-
 rect infractions leads to government prosecution. Although a recent law states that
 employers should provide safe working conditions, no guarantee exists to protect
 employees' right to continued employment if they refuse to work under dangerous
 conditions.
