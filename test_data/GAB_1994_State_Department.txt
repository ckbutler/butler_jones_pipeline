 GABON
 In December 1993, Gabon held its first contested presidential election since 1964.
 The election was marred by serious irregularities, including a secret vote count that
 excluded all but government observers. It resulted in the reelection of incumbent
 President Omar Bongo, who has ruled the country since 1967. Immediately follow-
 ing announcement of the results, a group of opposition candidates filed suit in the
 Constitutional Court to have the election declared invalid. Second-place candidate
 Paul Mba Abessole declared himself president and established a 'parallel govern-
 ment." In January the Constitutional Court rejected the opposition candidates' suit,
 in part because many had accepted posts in Abessole's unconstitutional "govern-
 
 
 89
 ment." Although Bongo ostensibly disassociated himself from the former single rul-
 ing party (the Gabonese Democratic Party, or PDG, which he had formed in 1968)
 and had run as an independent, the PDG still provides the bulk of his support. It
 retains a majority in the National Assembly and provides most of the mebrs of
 the Cabinet. On October 7 Government and opposition leaders signed an agreement
 in Libreville, known as the "Paris Accords," to allow opposition members to join the
 Government, and establish an independent National Electoral Commission. The new
 Government formed in November with 6 opposition leaders among 27 cabinet min-
 isters.
 A gendarmerie and a police force normally maintain public security. In 1994, how-
 ever, the Government used the elite and heavily armed Presidential Guard on sev-
 eral occasions to restore and enforce public order. It was responsible for numerous
 human rights abuses.
 Although a one-party state until 1990, Gabon has adhered to strongly capitalist
 economic policies and welcomes foreign investment. Thanks to petroleum reserves
 and a population of only 1.2 million, it has a per capita income of more than $3,500
 per year. Nevertheless, corruption, financial mismanagement, the precipitous de-
 cline in petroleum prices, and neglect of the agricultural sector have forced the Gov-
 ernment to adopt austerity measures. The 14-member Communaute Financiere
 Africaine, of which Gabon is a member, agreed in January to devalue its currency,
 the CFA franc, by 50 percent, to 100 CFA to 1 French franc. The resulting economic
 uncertainty led to numerous strikes and demonstrations in the first half of the year,
 some of which became violent.
 The controversy attending the presidential elections and reactions to the CFA de-
 valuation led to clashes between security forces and supporters of opposition parties
 during February and again in March. Security forces were directly implicated in the
 killings of at least 15 Gabonese and 70 foreign nationals (according to official fig-
 urea) and were responsible for destroying an opposition radio station and the resi-
 dence of opposition leader Abessole. The Government briefly held numerous persons
 without charge. Opposition supporters also engaged in politically motivated violence.
 From the beginning of the year until April 10, the Government imposed a "state of
 alert" which curtailed numerous individual rights and freedoms and granted secu-
 rity forces extralegal powers. Other longstanding human rights abuses included se-
 curity forces' mistreatment of detainees, abysmal prison conditions, societal dis-
 crimination and violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.--Government authorities were re-
 sponsible for many confirmed extrajudicial killings. In February, between 67 and
 102 prisoners died while in detention in Libreville. After detaining at least 300 West
 Africans who were attempting to enter Gabon illegally, gendarmes beat many, then
 forced the entire group into four prison cells meant to hold 12 persons each. The
 Government first attributed the deaths to a prison brawl, and claimed that 67 adult
 males had died. However, both police sources and human rights groups put the
 number at 102, including 15 women and children, and survivors themselves re-
 ported that no brawl had occurred. Reportedly, foreigners died of suffocation, dehy-
 dration, and in some cases of injuries sustained during beatings. The Government
 claimed that a full investigation was underway, but by year's end it had issued no
 red                  o      Gi                 d
 riini political clashes in late February, security forces acknowledged respon-
 sibility for the deaths of seven Gabonese citizens and blamed demonstrators for kill-
 ing two gendarmes. Family members confirmed that security forces beat Francois
 D'Assisses Obiang-Ebe to death at his home in the northern town of Oyem. Wit-
 nesses also confirmed that Presidential Guard forces killed Antoine Mba Ndong, an
 Abessole bodyguard, when they attempted to arrest the candidate.
 Unofficial sources reported that as many as 35 died during confrontations, includ-
 ing 8 members of the security forces. In the northern town of Oyem, an anti-govern-
 ment demonstration turned violent when a member of the security forces shot and
 killed a demonstrator. In Libreville, opposition party supporters were responsible for
 publicly beating to death PDG party member Kamga Komo. By year's end, the Gov-
 ernment had announced no results of any investigation and had not arrested sus-
 pects in any of these cases.
 In December 1993, a soldier of the Presidential Guard detained and publicly shot
 a demonstrator. The Government has still issued no official report, nor has it re-
 vealed the name of the soldier whom it allegedly arrested.

 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed disappearances or abductions as-
 cribed to government security forces or any other group.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture and inhuman or extreme punishment.
 However, security forces regularly beat prisoners and detainees and humiliated
 male detainees by publicly stripping them and shaving their heads. Security forces
 employed other forms of torture to exact confessions. Eyewitnesses reported seeing
 prisoners tied to chairs, doused with ice water, or made to crawl on their stomachis
 over gravel or sun-baked asphalt. There were other credible reports of security
 forces exacting confessions by beating the soles of prisoners' feet or by bending or
 twisting fingers. Numerous persons--mcluding opposition party leaders and opposi.
 tion journalists-detained in connection with politically motivated violence in Feb-
 ruary and March alleged beatings, torture, and other humiliating treatment during
 detention (see Section Ld.). One journalist at the opposition-controlled Radio Liberte,
 Nan-Veca Bryce attracted international attention when an opposition newspaper
 falsely reported tlat authorities had tortured him to death in prison. When eventu-
 ally released, Bryce said he had been beaten, humiliated, and forced to swear alle-
 giance to President Bongo.
 Conditions in most prisons are abysmal and life threatening. Sanitation and ven-
 tilation are poor, and medical care almost nonexistent. Prisons rarely provide food,
 and there are unconfirmed reports that prisoners are deprived of water as a further
 means of punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for up to 48 hours of
 initial preventive detention, during which time police must charge a detainee before
 a judge. In practice, however, police rarely respect this provision. Bail may be set
 if there is to be a further investigation. There were, however, numerous instances
 of detention without charge, often for political reasons. In February Presidential
 Guard forces attacked and destroyed two opposition radio stations run by the
 Bucheron Party (see Section 2.a.). The Government arrested at least 10 radio station
 employees and Bucheron Party leaders, along with some 80 other persons associated
 with riots and disturbances that followed the attacks. In Librevilie authorities held
 Bucheron leader Jules Mba Bekale without charge for 48 hours before releasing
 him. Some 54 other detainees spent 3 weeks in prison before finally being charged.
 Among these was journalist Nang-Veca Bryce, who was eventually charged and re-
 leased on bail in early May. In Oyem police detained party leader Athanase Ondo
 Mintsa, 3 of his sons, and some 29 others without charge for more than 2 months.
 A union leader in Port Gentil was detained in connection with a strike but released
 after 24 hours. At year's end, the Government held no persons for strictly political
 reasons.
 The Government frequently continued to detain both illegal and legal refugees
 without charge. Many foreign nationals reported they were mistreated and forced
 to provide unpaid labor (see Section 6.c.).
 Exile is not used as a punishment nor as a means of political control, and there
 are no opposition leaders currently living in exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system includes the regular courts
 a Military Tribunal, and a civilian State Security Court. In September, the National
 Assembly passed a series of reforms to reduce obstacles the regular court system
 to try to reduce the bureaucracy private citizens face when bringing suits. The regu-
 lar court system includes trial courts, appellate courts and the Supreme Court. The
 Constitutional Court is a separate body charged with examining constitutional ques-
 tions, including the certification of elections. There are no traditional or customary
 courts. In some areas minor disputes may be taken to a local chief, but the Govern-
 ment does not recognize such decisions. The State Security Court, last convened in
 1990, is constituted by the Government on an ad hoc basis to consider matters of
 state security.
 The Constitution provides the right to a public trial and the right to legal counsel.
 These rights are generally respected in criminal cases. Nevertheless, procedural
 safeguards are lacking, particularly in state security trials, and the judiciary re-
 mains vulnerable to government manipulation. The law still applies the concept of
 presumed guilt. A judge may thus deliver an immediate verdict at the initial hear-
 ing if sufficient evidence is presented.
 Although the Constitutional Court ratified the official results of the 1993 presi-
 dential election that were widely considered to have been manipulated by the Gov-
 ernment, it demonstrated on other occasions an ability to act independently of the
 executive. In a separate development, the Government relieved the State Prosecutor
 for Estuaire Province of her duties, allegedly because she dismissed for lack of suffi-
 cient evidence a weapons charge against the bodyguard one of the President's prin-
 cipal rivals.
 
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides protection from surveillance, from searches without warrant,
 and from interference with private telecommunications or correspondence. As part
 of criminal investigations, police may issue search warrants, which are easily ob-
 tainable and often granted after the fact. The Government has used them to gain
 access to the homes of opposition figures and their families. Government authorities
 also routinely monitor private telephone conversations, personal mail. and the move-
 ments of citizens. Human rights monitors, opposition figures, union leaders foreign
 diplomats, and even members of the Government have all reported being fowed,
 watched, or otherwise monitored by authorities at various times.
 The state of alert in effect from the beginning of the year until April 10 imposed
 a curfew and granted the Government numerous extralegal powers to limit an indi-
 vidual's constitutional rights. Security forces routinely entered and searched private
 homes, offices, and vehicles without a warrant during this period. In February gov-
 ernment troops attacked and ransacked an opposition radio station and the homes
 of two leading opposition politicians (see Section 2.a.), confiscating or destroying a
 considerable amount of property.
 After August, when most of the reshuffling of personnel within ministries was
 complete, there were no further confirmed reports of dismissal of government or
 military personnel due to political affiliation. One of the opposition's negotiating de-
 mands in pursuit of a government of national unity was reinstatement of persons
 so dismissed.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the right of free
 speech and press, and in practice, citizens speak freely and criticize leaders. Legisla-
 tors in the National Assembly openly criticize government policies, ministers, and
 other officials.
 Although the Goviernment had effectively banned all opposition periodicals for a
 2-month period in 1993, print journalism thrived throughout the year. In contrast,
 the Government severely restricts the electronic media which reaches all areas of
 the country. There is one government-controlled daily newspaper, L'union, and
 more than a dozen lively, outspoken weekly independents, most of which are con-
 trolled by the opposition. All-including LUJnion-actively criticized the President,
 the Government, and political leaders of all parties. Later in the year, L'Union
 granted increasingly balanced coverage to opposition political figures and events. In
 February the Government issued a decree requiring all journalists to carry a gov-
 ernment-issued press card, creating fears of unfair allocation and of discrimination
 against opposition journalists. The Minister of Communications convoked the press
 corps m August to discuss the matter but did not implement the decree's provisions
 by ear's end.
 The Government did not respect freedom of the press for the electronic media. On
 February 22, armed Presidential Guard commandos attacked and completely de-
 stroyed the opposition-owned Radio Liberte station in Libreville, touching off a wave
 of social unrest and violence that lasted for nearly a month. Claiming that the sta-
 tion was promoting 'hate and ethnic violence," Armed Forces Chief of Staff Idriss
 Ngari, who 6 weeks later became Minister of Defense, publicly declared the follow-
 ing day that he personally had ordered the attack. This followed the December 16,
 1993, destruction of another opposition radio station, Frequence Libre. While the
 Government never claimed responsibility, numerous rumors circulated that the
 Presidential Guard had been responsible for destroying Frequence Libre as well.
 The Government had not ndertken a credible or public investigation of either
 event by year's end. There are currently no opposition-controlled radio or television
 stations.
 In April authorities arrested and deported without due process French journalist
 Yves Jaumanin. A member of the organization Reporters Without Borders,
 Jauianin was researching the case of arrested journalist Nang Veca Brice. The
 Government gave no explanation for the expulsion.
 There is no official interference with broadcasts of international radio stations
 Radio France 1, Africa No. 1, and Voice of America. Foreign newspapers and maga-
 zines are widely available.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom, including research.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens and recognized orga-
 nizations normally enjoy freedom of assembly and association, although groups must
 by law obtain permits for public gatherings in advanc. The state o alert m effect
 until April severely imitod exercise of these rights. The Government prohibited all
 large public gatherings and forbade opposition groups to meet. When groups orga-
 nized unauthorized demonstrations, the Government used force to disperse crowds.
 
 
 92
 The prohibition on public meetings even applied to social gatherings such as those
 in public bars. This latter provision was losely enforced, but police did use it to
 harass, to intimidate, and often to extort money from citizens. Opposition parties
 convened a number of unauthorized public demonstrations that turned violent.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and au-
 thorities do not engage in religious persecution or favoritism. While the Government
 has not lifted a ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, neither has it enforced the ban. Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses received permits and conducted large public gatherings in 1994.
 There is no state religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no legally mandated restrictions on internal movement, but
 authorities routinely hindered domestic travel. Police and gendarmes frequently
 atop travelers to check identity residence, or registration documents and extortion
 became increasingly frequent. in particular, security forces used the provisions of
 the state of alert to monitor and limit movement. Police detained, fined, and often
 mistreated anyone on the streets after the curfew. Also during the periods of unrest
 in January and February, groups associated with various political interests set up
 roadblocks throughout       vile and in other urban centers, seriously impeding
 movement and often stimulating violence, notably toward foreigners, both Africans
 and Europeans.
 On three occasions between December 1993 and February 1994, the Government
 prevented a group of opposition leaders from traveling abroad although eventually
 it allowed them to leave.
 Even during periods when the state of alert was not in effect, Gabonese continued
 to face numerous difficulties when they wished to travel abroad. The Gabonese Cen-
 ter for Documentation continued to require extensive paperwork before granting a
 passport and often delayed issuance for up to a year. Members of the opposition and
 certain ethnic groups alleged discrimination in the granting of passports. An un-
 evenly enforced law requires married Gabonese women to have their husbands' per-
 mission to travel abroad. An exit visa for citizens is no longer required for travel
 abroad.
 The restrictions placed on the movement and travel of the nearly 250,000 non-
 Gabonese Africans living in Gabon are severe. Members of the security forces rou-
 tinely harass expatriate merchants, service sector employees, and manual laborers,
 extorting bribes and services with the threat of imprisonment. Residence permits
 cost roughly $1,000; nevertheless, authorities frequently rounded up and detained
 even documented expatriates. African diplomats complained that their citizens,
 when detained, were mistreated, forced to provide labor, and often beaten. The au-
 thorities rarely informed consulates when they detain foreigners. Non-Gabonese
 must obtain an exit visa in order to leave Gabon and often experience difficulties
 when trying to reenter the country.
 illegal aliens face the harshest limitations and mistreatment. The most egregious
 example occurred when some 70 or more illegal aliens died of suffocation and dehy-
 dration in prison (see Section l.a.). The Government instituted a program of vol-
 untary departure for illegal aliens in cooperation with resident consular missions,
 led to a reduction of abuses. However, the Minister of Defense has announced that
 this program will be discontinued in 1995.
 The Government still controls the process of refugee adjudication, and its Policy
 is strict. Coordination with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has
 improved, however, and there were no credible reports that the Government forcibly
 repatriated illegal aliens. There were about 200 refugees in Gabon at year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 1991 Constitution explicitly provides this right, but the mismanagement and
 serious irregularities in both the 1990 and the 1993 presidential elections called into
 serious doubt the extent to which this right exists in practice.
 In the presidential elections, supporters of various political factions engaged in il-
 legal activities, such as voter card trafficking and mu tiple voting. The ballot count,
 under the control of the Minister of Territorial Administration, took place in secret,
 with all impartial observers excluded. After the Minister declared that incumbent
 President Bongo had won with 51.18 percent of the vote various individuals pre-
 sented strong evidence that two Libreville districts--neighborhoods known to sup-
 port the opposition-were left uncounted. The Governor of the Estuaire Province,
 where Libreville is located, was among those making this allegation. Shortly there-
 after, she was dismissed from office. In President Bongo's home region of Haut
 Ogoue, the number of ballots cast in his favor exceeded the population reported by
 
 
 93
 the 1993 census. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court ruled against a petition to
 annul the results.
 Citing organizational problems and an unsettled political climate, the Government
 postponed until May the municipal elections that were scheduled to take place im-
 mediately after the presidential elections. In May the Government again postponed
 these elections until early 1995.
 There are no restrictions on the participation of women and minorities in politics.
 There are 6 women among the 120 National Assembly deputies and 3 in the Cabi-
 net. Women serve at all levels within the various ministries, the judiciary, and the
 opposition. Despite governmental protections, indigenous Pygmies rarely participate
 in the political process, and the Government has made only marginal efforts to in-
 clude them (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongoernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government officially allows the existence of independent human rights
 groups. However, the mst vocal and dedicated of these, the Gabonese League of
 Human Rights (GLHR), reported being censured, threatened and intimidated.
 GLHR President Francois Ond Nze alleged that security authorities followed him,
 and that agents ofthe Presidential Gu  a once attempted to run his car off the
 road at high speed. Ondo Nze (one of the longest serving members of the Gabonese
 Bar Association) also reported receiving threatening calls from military leaders, in-
 cluding the Minister of Defense. A lawyer at the GLHR reported receiving anony-
 mous telephone calls threatening her and her children.
 In March alleged political prisoners being held in Oyem hired Ondo Nze as their
 legal representative. Authorities granted him access to the prisoners at that time,
 but only in his capacity as legal counsel Shortly afterward, he wrote to the Minister
 of Territorial Administration requesting permission to visit other prisoners and pris-
 on facilities in his capacity as GLHR President. The Government refused this re-
 quest in proceedings to disbar Ondo Nze, alleging that he had defrauded and over
 billed clients. Nze challenged the move in the Supreme Court, which in June cleared
 him of any wrongdoing. Nonetheless, the Bar suspended Ondo Nze for 1 year, send-
 ing what was generally perceived by other human rights activists as a threatening
 callgnal.n
 Ir ave been no active inquiries from foreign groups in recent years. However,
 the Government showed initial reluctance to accept international election observers
 who were not of its own choosing and did not permit independent observers to wit-
 ness the counting of ballots.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1991 Constitution forbids discrimination based on national origin, race, gen-
 der, or opinion.
 Women.-The law provides that women have rights to equal access in education,
 business, and investment. Women own businesses and property, participate in poli-
 tics, and currently work throughout the government and the private sector. Women
 nevertheless continue to face cnsidrable societal and legaldiscrimination, espe-
 cially in rural areas. For monogamous married couples, a common property law pro-
 vides for the equal distribution of assets after divorce. Polygyny is also legally and
 culturally accepted; however, wives who leave polygynous husbands incur severe re-
 duction in their property rights. In inheritance cases, the husband's family must
 issue a written authorization before his widow can inherit prop erty. Common law
 marriage, which is socially accepted and widely practiced, theords a woman no prep-
 erty rights. There is still a requirement in law that women obtain their husband's
 permission to travel abroad although it is not consistently applied.
 Violence against women is common and especially prevalent in rural areas. While
 rape has not been specifically identified as a chronic problem, religious workers and
 hospital staff report that physical beatings are common. Police rarely intervene in
 these cases.
 Caildren.-Traditional beliefs and practices provide numerous safeguards for chil-
 dren, hut children remain the responsibility of the extended family-including
 auntss grandmothers, and older sibigs. The Government has used Gabon's oil
 wealt to build schools, pay adequate teacher salaries and promote education, even
 in rural areas. Even so, according to U.N. statistics, Gabon still lags behind its poor-
 er neighbors in infant mortality and access to vaccination. There is growing concern
 about the problems facing the large community of expatriate African children. Al-
 most all enjoy far less access to education and health care than do nationals. Expa-
 
 
 94
 triate children are also victims of child labor abuses (see Section 6.d.). There is little
 recorded evidence of specific physical abuse of children.
 Indigenous People.-Several thousand indigenous Pygmies live in southern Gabon.
 In principle, they enjoy the same civil rights as other citizens. Pygmies are largely
 independent of formal authority, keeping their own traditions, independent commu-
 nities, and local decision making structures. Pygmies did not participate in govern-
 ment-instituted policies that integrated many small rural villages into larger ones
 along major roads; thus their access to government-funded heal and sanitation fa-
 cilities is limited. There are no specific government programs or policies to assist
 or hinder Pygmies.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.--Persons from all major ethnic groups contin-
 ued to occupy prominent positions in Government, the military, and the private sec-
 tor. Credible reports suggest, however, that ethnic favoritism in hiring and pro-
 motion occurs on a fairly regular basis throughout the public and private sectors.
 Near the end of 1993 as the election drew near, the campaign took on an increas-
 ingly ethnic overtone. The major opposition party, the Bucherons, drew most of its
 support from Gabon's largest ethnic group, the Fang. After the elections, many Fang
 accused the incoming Government of actively discriminating against them in nam-
 ing the members of the new government and in redistributing government and mili-
 tary posts. There was evidence, especially within the armed forces, that members
 of the President's ethnic group occupied a disproportionate number both of senior
 positions and of jobs within the ranks. During the unrest of January and February,
 human rights groups alleged that those the Government arrested were principally
 of the Fang ethnic group.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no laws prohibiting discrimination against
 persons with disabilities, nor providing for accessibility for the disabled. Various
 groups, both independent and associated with the Government, have initiated
 projects to assist handicapped persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assmiation.-The 1991 Constitution places no restrictions on the
 right of association and recognizes the right of citizens to form trade and labor
 unions. A Labor Code adopted in 1978 governs all labor activities. Unions must reg-
 ister with the Government in order to be recognized officially. Public employees may
 unionize although their right to strike is limited in areas pertaining to public safety.
 Until 1990 there was only one recognized labor organization, the Gabonese Labor
 Confederation (COSYGA), to which all workers contributed a mandatory 0.4 percent
 of their salaries. In 1992 the Government accepted the establishment of independent
 unions and abolished the mandatory COSYGA contribution.
 In May after lengthy consultations with labor leaders, the National Assembly
 passed a long awaited series of revisions to the 1978 Labor Code. Six years in the
 making, these changes clarify or bring up to date numerous sections of the old Code.
 The previous legislation recognized COSGA as the only official labor organization,
 despite the fact that the Gabonese Confederation of Free Unions (CGSL) has been
 functioning and actively recruiting members for nearly 3 years. Other provisions of
 the new Labor Code establish clearer procedures governing negotiations and strikes,
 areas which were vague under the 1978 Code. At year's end, the Ministry of Labor
 had not yet implemented the new Labor Code.
 Under current regulations, strikes are e  they occur after an 8-day notice ad-
 vising that outside arbitration has failed. The 1978Labor Code prohibits direct gov-
 ernment action against individual strikers who abide by the arbitration and notifica-
 tion provisions and also provides that charges may not be pressed against a group
 as a whale for criminal activities committed by individuals. In 1994, however, the
 Government took action against strikers and union leaders on a number of occa-
 sions. In February, following the devaluation of the CFA franc, COSYGA called a
 general strike aimed at forcing the Government to negotiate wage adjustments. The
 strike succeeded in stopping work in Port Gentil, the center of the petroleum sector.
 At one point labor demonstrations became violent. The Government responded by
 arresting COSYGA's Port Gentil representative and two other union members, hold-
 ing them for 3 days. Five days later, CGSL also called on its members to join the
 strike. Opposition parties rallied along with strikers, and violence broke out in
 Libreville and the north. The Government arrested a number of persons, including
 union members, detaining many for up to 2 months without charge (see Sections
 l.a., l.c. and l.f.). In March the leader of Libreville's postal and telecommunications
 union was dismissed, ostensibly for political and labor activities.
 Unions and confederations are free to affiliate with international labor bodies and
 participate in their activities. COSYGA is directly affiliated with the Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity, while CGSL is affiiated with the International Con-
 
 
 95
 federation of Free Trade Unions. Both COSYGA and CGSL have strong ties with
 numerous other international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining. Labor and management meet to negotiate differences, and the
 Ministry of Labor provides an observer. This observer does not take an active part
 in negotiations over pay scales, working conditions, or benefits. Agreements also
 apply to nonunion workers. While no laws specifically prohibit antiunion discrimina-
 tion, the court may require employers found guilty by civil courts of having engaged
 in such discrimination to pay compensation. Unions effectively used collective bar-
 gaining provisions to negotiate wage increases following the devaluation of the CFA
 franc.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor. De-
 spite this there were numerous reports of prisoners and detainees--principally for-
 eigue;--bing forced to provide unpaid labor. Security forces routinely "sweep* the
 large African neighborhoods to check residence and identity documents, and at
 times they even detain without charge foreigners in possession of valid paperwork.
 Police or gendarmes often hold these persons in prison overnight and force them to
 work at government facilities, on public grounds, or even in the homes of ministers,
 military officers, or other members of the Government.
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children.-Gabonese children below the
 age of 16 may not work without the express consent of the Ministries of Labor, Edu-
 cation, and Public Health. These ministries rigorously enforce this law, and there
 are few Gabonese under the age of 18 working in the modern wage sector. A signifi-
 cant number of expatriate African children work in marketplaces or perform domes-
 tic duties. The U . Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other concerned organizations
 have reported that government officials often privately use foreign child labor, main-
 ly as domestic or agricultural help. These children do not go to school, have little
 means of acquiring medical attention, and are often victims of abuse. Laws forbid-
 ding child labor theoretically extend protection to foreign children as well, but
 abuses often are not reported.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1978 Labor Code and the 1982 General
 Convention of Labor govern working conditions and benefits for all sectors and pro-
 vide a broad range of protection to workers. The Code stipulates a 40-hour work-
 week with a minimum rest period of 48-consecutive hours. Employers must com-
 pensate workers for overtime work. Foreign and local companies in the modern
 wage sector pay competitive wages and grant generous fringe benefits, including
 maternity leave and 6 weeks of annual paid vacation. Despite austerity measures
 and difficulties in servicing foreign debt, the Government and the private sector
 have generally met their payrolls on time.
 Each year representatives of labor, management, and Government meet to exam-
 ine economic and labor conditions. They recommend a minimum wage rate within
 government guidelines to the President, who then issues an annual decree. Follow-
 ing the 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc, the Government and most private
 sector employers instituted a 14.9 percent wage increase, the maximum amount al-
 lowed under the tentative agreement reached with international lending institu-
 tions. This increase was not applied to the monthly minimum wage, which remained
 approximately $125 (approximately 64,000 CFA). Inflation following the devaluation
 caused a significant decrease in purchasing power.
 The Ministry of Health has established occupational health and safety standards
 but does not effectively enforce or regulate them. Industry application of labor
 standards varies greatly depending upon company poicy. The  overnment report-
 edly did not enforce Labor Code violations in sectors where the bulk of the labor
 force is African. Foreigners, both documented and undocumented, may be obliged to
 work under substandard conditions, may be dismissed without notice or recourse or,
 especially in the case of illegal aliens, be physically mistreated. Employers fre-
 quently require longer hours of work and payless, often hiring on a short-term, cas-
 ual basis only in order to avoid paying taxes, social security, and other benefits.
