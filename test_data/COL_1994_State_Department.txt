 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy in which the Liberal and Con-
 servative parties have long dominated the political scene. Relatively peaceful na-
 tional congressional and presidential elections were held in June with the Liberal
 Party candidate, Ernesto Samper, winning the Presidency by a very slight margin
 in a runoff election against Conservative Party contender Andres Pastrana.
 Internal security is the primary responsibility of the Ministry of Defense, which
 in addition to the armed forces, includes the National Police. The Department of Ad-
 ministrative Security, which is responsible for national security intelligence, reports
 directly to the President. The police and the armed forces remained responsible for
 widespread human rights abuse.
 Colombia has a mixed private/public sector economy. The Government continued
 an economic liberalization program and the privatization of selected public indus-
 tries. Crude petroleum rivals coffee as the principal export and, after the August
 discovery of immense natural gas reserves, petroleum and gas exports will play an
 even greater role. Narcotics traffickers continued to control extensive illicit and licit
 enterprises.
 For 35 of the past 43 years, the Government has operated under declared states
 of emergency which enable the executive to rule by "temporary" decree to deal with
 civil unrest associated with the high degree of internal violence. These decrees fre-
 quently set aside fundamental judicial guarantees of due process and sometimes
 have been incorporated into permanent law by subsequent legislative action. Several
 violent guerrilla organizations continued to operate, despite regular attempts to ne-
 gotiate settlements. Military cooperation with narcotics and landowner paramilitary
 groups in remote regions of the country continued. The Government continued to
 allow the military to assert jurisdiction over, and in almost all cases to fail to pros-
 ecute, abuses by military personnel. This rampant impunity from justice underlies
 Colombia's human rights problems; 97 percent of all crimes go unpunished.
 The overall human rights situation in Colombia remained critical, with a variety
 of violent actors-including the police and security forces--continuing to commit
 abuses such as political and extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, and
 other physical mistreatment. In addition to official forces, other perpetrators of
 human rights abuses include antigovernment guerrilla groups, narcotics traffickers,
 and paramilitary groups. While violence by narcotics traffickers was drastically re-
 duced from previous years, internecine violence among the trafficking organizations
 still accounted for substantial numbers of homicides, kidnapings, cases of torture,
 and attacks against the military and the police. Guerrillas and narcotics traffickers
 continued to work cooperatively, especially in rural regions of the country. The vic-
 tims of these abuses most common y included politicians, labor organizers, human
 rights monitors, and-overwhelmingly-peasant farmers. Violence directed against
 women and children also remained commonplace. Vigilante groups,, often supported
 or condoned by the police and military, engaged in "social cleansig"--the killing of
 street children, prostitutes, homosexuals, and others deemed socially undesirable.
 The human rights situation dominated much of the new administration's agenda
 during its first few months in office. President Samper created a ministerial-level
 Human Rights Commission in August, and his Government revived a military jus-
 tice reform commission intended to address the question of impunity for police and
 military violators. The Government reopened investigations into several important
 
 
 human rights cases and brought charges against policemen in another case. At
 aen  however, despite positive actions by the new Minister of Defense, the
 Government had yet to establih effective 3udicial control over military abusers of
 human rights and thereby begin to end the long reign of impunity.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Ext'inu.icial MKing.-The total number of murders in Co-
 lombia appeared to decline slightly during the first quarter of 1994; however, it re-
 mained cause for grave concern. According to a report by the Government's Depart-
 ment of Planning, between 1987 and 1992 there were 77 homicides per 100,000 in-
 habitants, by far the highest murder rate in the world. Due to insufficient police
 and 'udicial resources to investigate and prosecute most killings and the frequently
 overlapping violent forces at work in the country, it is often difficult to separate po-
 litical from nonplitial murders. According to the Bogota-based nongovernmental
 organization (NGO) 'Justice and Peace", there were 1,268 political and presumably
 politically motivated murders between January and September. The Andean Com-
 mission of Jurists (CAJSC) estimated that in approximately 77 percent of all re-
 ported violent deaths from March 1993 to March 1994, no perpetrator could be es-
 tablished. Ten candidates for political office were assassinated before the October
 30 local elections.
 The police and military forces continued to be implicated in cases of extrajudicial
 killings in 1994. Members of the army's Tarqui battalion in Sogamoso attacked a
 civilian home with a grenade in an attempt to kill local community organizer
 Paulino Velandia. Velandia survived the a , which killed two others and injured
 two children. The Procuraduria investigated the incident, and a separate military
 criminal investigation was also under way. No motive was given for the attack. The
 authorities brought one officer in question before a court-martial, but it had made
 no ruling by the end of the year.
 In January members of the Goneral Gabriel Reveiz Pizarro battalion based in
 Arauca department killed nine peasants from the town of Puerto Lleras claiming
 that the attack occurred in the context of a counterinsurgency sweep. The
 Procuraduria filed charges against nine officers and soldiers based on its investiga-
 tion that determined that the army sealed off the town, illegally detained approxi-
 mately 500 townspeople, read off the nine names from a list, and summarily exe-
 cuted them as suspected guerrilla collaborators.
 According to the Procuraduria's annual human rights report that covered the 1-
 year period preceding April 1994, the National Police had the worst human rights
 record among state security agencies. The Procuraduria linked 80 percent of its dis-
 ciplinary decisions that involved violations of human rights to police actions.
 In June two off-duty Bogota policemen stopped a bus on which they were travel-
 ing in order to intervene in a street scuffle. The fired indiscriminately into the
 crowd, kifling one person and forcing a 9-year-old street vendr to board the bus
 with them. One of the agents then shot the child and threw the body out the win-
 dow. Taxi drivers initially apprehended the agents; police and Procuraduria inves-
 tigators later determined that they were inebriated at the time of the crime. In De-
 oember a court sentenced one of the police officers involved in the killing to 60
 years, or two maximum sentences.
 Human rights monitors also implicated the police in incidents of social cleansing,
 involving attacks and killings of individuals deemed socially undesirable such as
 drug a        prostitutes, transvestites, beggars, and street children. The Center for
 Investigations and Popular Research (CINEP) reported that between January and
 October there were 291 homicides, 57 injuries, and 22 threats that it considered so-
 cial cleansing. This activity was particularly notable in Call, where there were per-
 sistent reports of murders of indigent youths on or around construction sites. Ac-
 cording to the local human rights ombudsman, 20 such murders occurred in Cali
 in just the first 2 months of the year. In July a group of masked armed men gunned
 down six individuals in a northern Medelli neighborhcod frequented by drug ven-
 dors and prostitutes. The killers arrived in a taxi, lined the victims up against a
 wall and executed them gangland-style. In this and other cases, human rights
 groups persistently alleged impi cit police cooperation with the "clean-up squads."
 The Government opened an investigation, but it produced no leads by the end of
 the year.
 Paramilitary groups also perpetrated scores of extrajudicial killings in 1994, often
 with the alleged complicity of military units or individuals. Indigenous community
 and labor leaders frequently were the victims of this violence. In March unknown
 gunmen murdered four Zenu Indian leaders in San Andres de Sotavento in Cordoba

 department. A new paramilitary group "Colombia Without Guerrillas" (Colsingue)
 claimed responsibility for the August assassination of Communist Party Senator
 Manuel Vargas Ce      and openly threatenedother members of the Patriotic Union
 (UP) Communis Par..Although most paramilitar killings  o unresolved, in Janu-
 ary   lice arrestd Wilam   iante, te paramliary assassin of UP leader Jaime
 Pard   e  in 1986. Both the Gaviria and Samper administrations regularly con-
 demned extrajudicial killings, but rarely punished police or military personnel im-
 plicated in such cases.
 Soldiers and police continued to be the victims of violence perpetrated by drug
 traffickers, guerrillas, and ommon criminals on a daily basis. F or example, Revolu-
 tionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas murdered army 4th Division
 ommander General Gil Colorado near Villavicencio in July. Guerrillas also killed
 noncombatants on a regular basis and assassinated several prominent politicians.
 FARC operatives executed the highly popular mayor of Fusagsuga after guerrillas
 accidentally trapped him during an attack on a highway toll station. Operatives of
 the Arm. .of National Liberation (L) unsuccessfully attempted to kill the Treas-
 ury inter Wh a car bomb in Bogota in January. There were strong indications
 that urban operatives of the ELN assassinated Senatorial candidate Francisco
 Alejandro Gonzalo Jaramillo in Medellin in January and Antioquia Congressman
 Arlem Uribe in September.
 b. Disappearance.-Colombia continued to suffer from extremely high overall rates
 of disappearance and kidnaping. According to a joint report by the Government and
 a human rights group, there were a total of 1,378 reported kidnapings in 1994, an
 increase of 35 percent over the previous year. Given the complexity of the internal
 disorder and the variety of perpetrators, both among the state security forces and
 illegal goups involved in this conflict, the disappearances for political motives and
 kidnaping for profit is often unclear; guerrillas were responsible for approximately
 half the cases. There were rarely arrests or prosecutions in any of the cases.
 In October the Senate passed a bill which while narrower than the administra-
 tion had wanted, codified the act of forced disappearance as a crime. However, in
 doing so, it stripped from the bill a proposal to transfer jurisdiction in such cases
 from military to civilian courts. The Senate also deleted a section which stipulated
 that such an act could never be considered in the line of duty for police and military
 service members. In June President Gaviria had vetoed an earlier bill which con-
 tained the additional provisions. Many observers perceived his veto as an adminis-
 tration concession to the military high command, who claimed that such legislation
 would provoke a rash of false accusations by the guerrillas against military officials.
 The Samper administration reiterated objections to the proposed bill but attempted
 to address the issue by proposing language that clearly stipulated that service mem-
 bers were not obliged to obey illegal or immoral orders, such as an order to make
 someone "disappear." However, this section was also deleted from the final bill. At
 year's end, the lower House had not passed the bill.
 A CAJSC report highlighted the impunity that surrounds forced disappearances
 in Colombia when it attruted at least 2,000 cases of forced disappearance in the
 last 15 years to state security forces, yet recorded only 1 case of a military criminal
 sanction for such activity. The Office of the Defender of the People received 110 re-
 ports of forced disappearances between January and June. In 234 such incidents for
 all of 1993, the Procuraduria reported that the authorities brought only 2 sets of
 charges.
 In Cali disappearances perpetrated by state security members and organized
 criminals reached epidemic proportions, according to the local prosecutor's office,
 with an average of one disappearance per day. Many of these were women and chil-
 dren, who according to the same source, often end up being forced to work as pros-
 titutes.
 c. Torture and Other Cruet, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, but incidents of police and  i   beatings and torture
 of detainees continued to be reported throughout the year. These abuses often oc-
 curred in connection with illegal detentions in the context of counterinsurgency or
 counternarcotics operations. Paramilitary groups that operated in rural areas of the
 country were also responsible for instances of torture and sometimes took credit for
 their macabre work with menacing notes left on the bodies of their victims. In many
 cases, however, it was difficult to establish the perpetrators of torture since cadav-
 ers found bearing the traces of physical torture were rarely subject to extensive fo-
 rensic investigations.
 Justice andPeace reported an incident that occurred in June in Barrancabermeja
 in which members of the Nueva Granada Battalion detained the son of a local labor
 leader in an effort to exact information about local guerrilla activity. They tied the
 person naked to a stake on an anthill, threatened him with rape and then almost
 
 
 353
 suffocated him with a plastic bag. Military officials originally denied holding the in-
 dividual when family members questioned them but later admitted to local human
 rights officials that they had detained him. Police also allegedly tortured the same
 victim in January by electric shocks and beat   during an interrogation.
 Overcrowding and dangerous sanitary and health conditions in the prisons re-
 mained a serious problem. In May the Bureau of Prisons, the Office of the Defender
 of the People, and the Procuraduria established a pilot project in Bogota's La Picota
 prison, convoking a prisoners! human rights committee to work with prison and gov-
 ernment authorities to address perceived violations of basic human rights.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported that it continued
 to have access to most prisons and police and military detention centers. However,
 it noted that local or regional commanders did not always prepare mandatory deten-
 tion registers and follow notification procedures, resulting in a poor accounting of
 actual detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile.The Constitution includes several mecha-
 nisms designed to prevent illegal detention. The authorities must bring a detainee
 before a judge within 36 hours and the person has the right to seek, before any
 judge, a petition of habeas corpus that must be acted upon within 36 hours. Despite
 these legal protections, instances of arbitrary detention continued, and a large per-
 centage of the prison population remained in an undetermined pretrial status. The
 Procuraduria singled out the police and others conducting the late-1993 search for
 narcotics kingpin Pablo Escobar as having engaged in more arbitrary detentions
 than previously believed and stated that the police violated constitutional and proce-
 dural norms during this operation.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution specifically provides for the right
 to due process. The accused has the right to representation by counsel, but histori-
 cally representation for the indigenous and the indigent has been inadequate. The
 Government continues to battle staffing and funding inadequacies to develop a cred-
 ible public defender system.
 The judiciary remained overburdened and often in a state of chaos during 1994.
 The system is largely independent of the executive and legislative branches, both
 in theory and practice. It continued to experience growing pains as the various
 courts, prosecutorial entities, and ministries attempted to define their roles and
 streamline their operations in the wake of the judicial reorganization brought about
 under the 1991 Constitution. The judiciary has long been subject to threats and in-
 timidation when dealing with narcotics and paramilitary cases. With the decline in
 drug terrorism, there was a corresponding drop in the incidence of attacks on mem-
 bers of the judiciary, but this violence did not disappear altogether. In June un-
 known gunmen assassinated Luis Gillermo Lopz, head of the Medelin prosecu-
 tr's office. Several months earlier, gunmen a  murdered the directr of that of-
 fie's technical investigative unit, Luis Fernand Correa. The olice suspect narcot-
 ics trafficking organizations are involved in bth incidents, w  continued under
 investigation at year's end.
 The 1991 Constitution formalized the 'regional" or 'public order" jurisdictions, in
 which anonymous judges and prosecutors handle narcotics and terrorism cases.
 Human rihts groups continued to charge that the system infringed on basic proce-
 dural leg  rights.
 As in past years, the regional jurisdiction system continued to be overwhelmed
 with staggering caseloads that it was unable to process expeditiously. In May Presi-
 dent Gaviria invoked a state of internal emergency in order to proscribe portions
 of the Criminal Procedures Code that would have mandated the release of many of
 the public order detainees whose cases had not been processed. The Constitutional
 Court, however, found the President's action unconstitutional and struck down the
 state of emergency, facilitating the release of many of these suspects 1 month later.
 While a late 1993 reform of the Criminal Procedures Code addressed the lack of
 certain procedural rights within the system, problems remained. It is still extremely
 difficult for defense attorneys to impeach or cross-examine anonymous witnesses,
 and often they do not have unimpeded access to the State's evidence. Human rights
 groups also took exception with the Government's surrender policy for major narcot-
 ics traffickers which involved high-level voluntary surrender and sentence negotia-
 tions. These critics charged that "small-time! defendants were, in effect, railroaded
 under the system while powerful criminals were treated deferentially. Critics also
 charged that the vast majority of cases sent to the regional jurisdiction involved low-
 level criminals suspected of subversive activity, and that the system did not effec-
 tively deter the major guerrilla leaders. At yeas end the Attorney General began
 a review of plea-bargain agreements to ensure that confessed criminals had actually
 
 
 committed the crimes and that sentence reductions were related to genuine coopera-
 tion.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy. Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 generally requires a judicial order for authorities to enter a private home, except
 in cases of hot pursuit. In remote regions of the country, the military forces have
 civilian prosecutorial units delegated to them. Human rights groups charged that
 these delegate units were unconstitutional, and Congress refused to grant them per-
 manent status. Nonetheless, there were credible reports that they continued to func-
 tion, often facilitating army searches with little regard for judicious issuance of
 search warrants. In one example, the Nueva Granada battalion carried out over 60
 searches and detentions in the rural areas surrounding Barrancabermeja between
 January and March. Many of the detainees reported that soldiers mistreated and
 unjustly interrogated them.
 A judge must authorize telephone wiretaps and the interception of mail. This pro-
 tection extends to prisoners incarcerated in the penal system.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The internal subversive conflict received a good deal of governmental atten-
 tion in 1994. Both the Gaviria and Samper administrations urged the Congress to
 ratify Protocol H of the Geneva Convention. Although a Senate committee initially
 expressed reservations as to its internal application, Congress ratified it without
 reservations and President Samper signed it into law on December 16.
 The military forces, paramilitary groups, and particularly guerrilla organizations
 committed violations of international humanitarian law in Colombia's internal sub-
 versive conflict.
 In April members of the army's 2nd Mobile Brigade conducted a counter-
 insurgency operation near Barrancabermeja during which they allegedly took a local
 youth, Benjamin Santos, from his home in the Mesa de San Rafael. Local witnesses
 later reported seeing him dressed in an army uniform being marched with a patrol
 in the area. Shortly thereafter his body, showing signs of extreme torture, was found
 in a l ocal emetery. Military sources claimed he was an unidentified guerrilla slain
 in combat. Santos family members reported the incident to the local human rights
 ombudsman (personero) and claimed Santos had no guerrilla ties. It is not known
 if the Government is investigating this incident.
 Paramilitary groups, often with the alleged complicity of military units or individ-
 uals, usually carried out their violent acts with impunity. In September a military
 court issued a detention order for former army Lieutenant Coonel Luis Becerra,
 who is widely believed to have cooperated with paramilitary forces by covering up
 the October 1993 Rio Frio massacre. In September President Samper reiterated the
 Government's strong opposition to paramilitary groups and rural self-defense forces
 and promised to investigate carefully all allegations of cooperation with these
 groups by members and units of the state security forces. Little, however, has been
 accomplished in ending the climate of impunity.
 The loosely organized groups of the Simon Bolivar Coordinating Board, which in-
 clude the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the Army of National Lib-
 eration, committed a host of violations of humanitarian law during 1994. The most
 repugnant of these abuses was a January attack on the town of La Chinita in Uraba
 that left 35 agricultural workers dead. An exhaustive NGO investigation concluded
 that the FARCs fifth front perpetrated the attack in a move to intimidate the Com-
 munist Party stronghold for political purposes. FARC and ELN guerrilla regulars
 ambushed a police convoy in Purace on November 2, killing 11 police agents and
 2 students. A series of bembs exploded on city buses in Cartagena on December 21,
 killing 10 civilians. The Government arrested three suspects linked to the urban
 ELN.
 Guerrillas frequently committed atrocities against indigenous communities. Guer-
 rillas murdered four members of the Arzaria community in September, following a
 "trial" in which the four were accused of having participated in the February killing
 of two other tribe members allegedly working with the guerrilla groups. Guerrillas
 also violated norms of international humanitarian law during attacks on military
 installations. Eyewitness survivors reported that in attacks on a petroleum station
 and military installations in Putumayo in July, FARC guerrillas summarily exe-
 cuted defenseless wounded soldiers.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Includirg:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The authorities generally respected these con-
 stitutionally protected rights, but in at least one instance there was implied intimi-
 dation of the media (see below). Print and broadcast media regularly criticized the
 Government without recrimination. The privately owned print media published a
 wide spectrum of political viewpoints, especially throughout the presidential cam-
 
 
 355
 paign. They often voiced harsh antigovernment opinions without administration re-
 prisals. The Government imposes some restrictions on electronic media coverage of
 public order and drug terrorist activity and has the right to prohibit coverage of cer-
 tain news events that could affect state security. In July some observers charged
 that the Minister of Communications' public reminder to the media of this constitu-
 tional provision during the "narco-cassette? scandal, in which President-elect
 Samper's campaign financing was allegedly linked to Cali drug barons, constituted
 a veiled threat of government censorship. In September and November, Constitu-
 tional Court decisions struck down some of the provisions on government
 prescreening of electronic media coverage of public order and narcotics terrorist
 events.
 All citizens have the right to seek a judicial injunction or motion (tutela) for im-
 mediate redress of violations of basic constitutional rights. This theoretically pro-
 vides all persons and organizations, including the media, a mechanism to denounce
 both private and government violations of basic constitutional rights.
 Several incidents of violence directed against journalists occurred during 1994. An
 unidentified gunman murdered Cucuta radio and print journalist Jesus Medina in
 January. Unknown persons killed Medellin radio journalist and national vice presi-
 dent of a broadcasters' union, Martin Eduardo Munera, in September. Colleagues
 of Munera also reported receiving death threats. The International Press Society re-
 ported that Munera's death was the sixth slaying of a Colombian journalist since
 August 1993. While very few of these cases are ever definitively resolved, it is ap-
 parent that journalists are most often the victims of guerrilla groups, paramilitary
 organizations, and narcotics traffickers. In one case, however, the Procuraduria
 charged an ex-soldier with the 1991 slaying of "El Tiempo" journalist Henry Rojas.
 It also charged Colonel Diogenes Castellanos Guerrero, a former commander of an
 army unit based in Arauca, with covering up the incident.
 The Government generally respected academic freedom, and there exists a wide
 spectrum of political activity throughout the country's universities. Teachers at the
 elementary and secondary levels in guerrilla-controlled territory are often subject to
 threats and intimidation from local subversive operatives and are unable to resist
 guerrilla propaganda campaigns.
 b Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoiation.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and the Government respects these
 rights in practice. The authorities do not normally interfere with public meetings
 and demonstrations and usually grant the required permission except when they de-
 termine that there is imminent danger to public order. Any organization is free to
 associate with international  ups in its field.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for complete religious freedom
 and there is little religious discrimination in practice. Catholic religious training is
 no longer mandatory in public state schools, and a July Constitutional Court deci-
 sion found unconstitutional any official government reference to Colombia as "the
 country of the sacred heart The Government permits proselytizing among the in-
 digenouspopulation, provided the Indians welcome it a  re not induced to adopt
 changes that e.Aanger their survival on traditional lands. Indian tribes must still
 invite outsiders onto their reserves, and these groups remain at the disposition of
 the indigenous community.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens the right to travel domestically and
 abroad. In areas where military operations against guerrillas are under way, police
 or military officials occasionally required civilians to obtain safeconduct passes;
 guerrillas reportedly used similar mesns to restrict travel in areas under their con-
 trol�
 Guerrilla incursion, military counterinsurgency operations, guerrilla and para-
 military conscription, and land seizures by narcotics traffickers often forced peas-
 ants to flee their homes and farms. In October the Episcopal Bishop's Conference
 pubished a comprehensive study on the phenomenon of internal forced displace-
 ment and put the total number of such persons at 600,000. The report said that the
 single greatest cause of displacement is guerrilla incursion into the rural civilian
 population. Members of the armyes V Brigade threatened and harassed the Peasant
 Farmer's Refuge, a local refugee center in Barrancabermeja, in March. The incident
 highlighted the dilemma faced by displaced persons in Colombis they cannot stay
 in conflict zones for legitimate fears or  eir  ety, yet they are not wanted and
 perceived as an economic drain in the regional and major cities that are their most
 common destinations.
 The law provides for unrestricted emigration and repatriation by expatriates.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Colombian citizens exercise this right in regular, secret ballot elections that have
 historically been considered fair and open. Presidential elections are held every 4
 years. The Liberal and Conservative parties have long dominated Colombian poli-
 tics, with one or the other customarily winning the presidency. The President serves
 only one term and may not be reelected. All citizens are enfranchised at age 18.
 Public employees are not permitted to participate in campaigns but, with the excep-
 tion of the military, may vote. All parties operate freely  =tout government inter-
 ference. Political parties which fail to garner 50,000 votes in a general election may
 lose the right to present candidates and may not receive funds from the Govern-
 ment. But they may reincorporate at any time by presenting 50,000 signatures to
 the National Electoral Board.
 Colombia held national presidential and congressional elections, as well as guber-
 natorial and mayoral elections, in 1994. Liberal Party presidential candidate
 Ernesto Samper narrowly defeated Conservative Party hopefl Andres Pastrana by
 just 1.73 percentage points in a June runoff election. For the first time Colombians
 also elected a vice president, Humberto de la Calle, who ran on Samper's ticket. Lib-
 eral Party representatives also dominated the congressional elections in both the
 upper and lower houses. However, bipartisan coalitions were still often necessary
 for the Liberals to enact legislation.
 In 1990 the M-19 guerrilla movement signed a peace accord with the Government
 and became a legal political party Democratic Alliance M-19 (AD/M-19). In 1994
 the ADIM-19 fieldd a presidential candidate and several congressional candidates,
 all of whom were defeated.
 The elections were relatively peaceful, but numerous incidents of violence oc-
 curred. Unknown assailants assassinated Senator Manuel Vargas Cepeda, the only
 national UP representative, in Bogota in August. At least 10 candidates were assas-
 sinated and 10 others kidnaped preceding the October 30 local elections. President
 Samper postponed elections in 10 municipalities due to guerrilla violence during the
 campaigns. Elections proceeded normally in most districts, and the postponed elec-
 tions were held successfully in December.
 There are no legal restrictions, and few de facto ones, on the participation of
 women or minorities in the political process. There are 7 female senators and 18
 female representatives serving_ in Congress, including 1 black Congresswoman. The
 Ministers of Labor and the Environment are both women, as is the President's
 international affairs adviser and his adviser for social policy. Two seats in the 102-
 seat Congress are reserved for representatives of the indigenous population. Both
 the black and indigenous populations continued to expand their social and political
 agendas and an indigenous politician, Jesus Pinacue, ran as vice presidential can-
 didate on the unsuccessful ticket of former M-19 guerrilla leader Antonio Navarro-
 Wolf. Piedad Cordoba de Castro, a black female is a senior member of the Liberal
 Party national committee and served as a member of the Government's delegation
 to the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Center for Investigations and Popular Research, the Andean Commission of
 Jurists, the Intercongregational Commission for Justice and Peace, the Permanent
 Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, the Episcopal Bishops Conference, the
 "Jose Alvear Restrepo" lawyers collective, and others are among the many human
 rights groups active in Colombia.
 NGO's investigated and reported on a number of human rights abuses, including
 the army's extrajudicial assassination of two Socialist Renewal Current spokesmen
 in 1993, the army's coverup of the Rio Frio massacre, and the FARC's January mas-
 sacre of 35 townspeople in La Chinita. Often these reports criticized, justifiably, the
 Government's failure to investigate and punish those responsible.
 The Government generally did not interfere with the work of human rights
 NGO's, which were often the targets of threats and intimidation by the guerrillas,
 paramilitary groups, or individual members of the police and military forces. Many
 prominent human rights monitors, including lawyers Eduardo Umana, Carlos
 Alberto Ruiz, Raul Barrios Mendivil, and chilren's rights activist Jaime Jaramillo,
 work under constant fear for their physical safety. Unknown assailants assassinated
 human rights lawyer Laura Simmonds in Popayan in May.
 The Procuraduria investigates some allegations of human rights abuses by mem-
 bers of the state security apparatus, drawing upon a network of government rep-
 resentatives who serve as human rights ombudsmen in 1,041 municipalities. How-
 ever, the Procuraduria can only recommend administrative sanctions; as noted in
 
 
 357
 this report, police and military personnel are rarely punished commensurately for
 human rights abuses. The Office of the Defender of the People has the constitu-
 tionally assigned duty to ensure the promotion and exercise of human rights, but
 is severely underfunded. The President has a Special Adviser for human rights is-
 sues, who investigates allegations of abuse and disseminates human rights edu-
 cation and information.
 Since President Samper's August inauguration, he and the Government publicly
 admitted that the human rights situation reflected a "shameful and troubling re-
 alty. " President Samper requested that Amnesty International establish a perma-
 nent observer office in country and invited the United Nations H   Commissioner
 for Human Rights to visit Colombia. He also pledged to work clcee, with represent-
 atives of the ICRC and the Colombian Red Cross, and declared an  open door" policy
 with respect to international and local human rights NGO cooperation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 disability, language, or social status.
 Women.-Tlhe Constitution provides that women may not be subjected to any form
 of discrimination and specifically requires the authorities to 'guarantee adequate
 and effective participation by women at the decisionmaking levels of public adminis-
 tration."
 Even prior to implementation of the 1991 Constitution, the law had provided
 women extensive civil rights. Despite these constitutional provisions, however, dis-
 crimination and violence against women persist. The quasi-governmental Institute
 for Family Welfare (ICBF) and the presidential adviser's Office for Youth, Women,
 and Family Affairs published a report that criticized high and pervasive levels of
 spouse and partner abuse throughout the country. The ICBF runs programs and
 provides refuges and counseling for victims of spouse abuse, but the level and
 amount of these services are dwarfed by the magnitude of the problem. According
 to the National Forensic Office, a total of 440 females reported they had been raped
 in the first 2 months of the year alone. In a much pubiied decision in May, the
 Supreme Court mandated that a husband abstain frm physical aggression against
 his wife and children and ordered the local police to enforce its dictum by monitor-
 in the individual.
 Women earn, on average, 30 to 35 percent less than men for similar work despite
 being legally entitled to equal remuneration. They constitute a high percentage of
 the subsistence labor work force, especially in rural areas. Women's groups such as
 Promujer and the Association of Twenty-first Century Women reported that the so-
 cial and economic problems of marginalized single mothers remained great through-
 out the year, despite government efforts to provide training programs in parenting
 skills, reproductive rights, and birth control.
 Children.-Despite significant constitutional and legislative commitments to the
 protection of the rights of children, these are only marginally effective in practice.
 The Constitution provides for the fundamental rights of children and mandates that
 the family, society, and the State are obligated to assist and protect children, to fos-
 ter their development, and to assure the full exercise of these rights. A special Chil-
 dren's Code sets forth many of these rights and establishes services and programs
 designed to enforce protection of minors.
 The reality is that children's rights are frequently abused. Vigilante gangs often
 linked to the police killed hundreds of street children in several major cities in the
 social cleansing killings described earlier. Merchants and citizens' groups allegedly
 hire off-duty police agents and contract killers to rid neighborhoods of children sus-
 pected to be beggars and thieves; the Office of the Defender of the People reported
 clear complicity by police officers in some of these killings. In conflict zones, children
 were also frequent victims of cross fire by the security forces, paramilitary groups,
 and guerrilla organizations. Deadly land mines known as "leg breakers' laid by
 guerrillas killed or mutilated many children in conflict areas.
 Both forced and uncoerced child prostitution is commonplace in the five major
 cities of Colombia. The Procuraduria for the Family reported in September that in
 the preceding 15 months, 2,190 minors were killed violently, 3,125 were kidnaped,
 and 452 were reported to have been sexually assaulted. In all of these cases, the
 authorities detained only 45 perpetrators. In March the Government sentenced a
 former police agent to 41 years in prison for having shot a minor girl for refusing
 to dance with him at a party.
 Indigenous People.-There are approximately 82 distinct ethnic groups among the
 800,000 indigenous inhabitants. The Constitution gives special recognition to the
 fundamental rights of indigenous people. Under its provisions, two senatorial seats
 
 
 are reserved exclusively for indigenous representation and a special criminal and
 civil jurisdictio  based upon traditional community laws, functions within Indian
 territories. The Ministry of Government, through the Office of Indigenous Affairs,
 is responsible for protecting the territorial, cultural, and self-determination rights
 of Indians. Ministry representatives are located in all regions of the country with
 indigenous populations and work with other governmental human and civil rights
 organizations to promote Indian interests and investigate violations of indigenous
 rights.
 There are some 334 designated Indian reserves that are run by traditional Indian
 authority boards which handle national or local funds and are subject to fiscal con-
 trol by the national Comptroller General. These boards administer their territories
 as municipal entities, with officials locally chosen or elected according to Indian tra-
 dition. Indigenous communities are free to educate their children in traditional dia-
 lects and in the observance of cultural and religious customs. The Constitutional
 Court reaffirmed in March that indigenous men are not subject to the national mill-
 tavdraft.
 taspite protective efforts by the Government, Indians were frequently the victims
 of vioence throughout the year, by government security forces, parailitary groups
 (often spnsred by landowners), narcotics traffickers, and guerrillas (see Sections
 1.a. and 1.g.). In zones where the guerrillas are active, such as the Sierra Nevada
 and Valle de Cauca, the security forces often suspected the indigenous population
 of complicity with narcotics traffickers and gerrillas. Most of the incidents in which
 Indians were attacked or threatened stemmed from land ownership conflicts con-
 cerning the designated Indian reserves. The National Land Reform Institute esti-
 mated that some 40 indigenous communities had lost the legal title to land they
 claimed as their own and that roughly 100 other groups had title claims that were
 not recognized or reconciled.
 The Zenu tribe in particular saw at least seven of its community leaders assas-
 sinated during the first several months of the year. Unknown gunmen also killed
 well-known Indian rights activist Laureano Inampue. In response the Government
 provided bodyguards to many Zenu and other indigenous leaders. In September
 there was a rash of attacks against indigenous communities in the Sierra Nevada
 de Santa Marta region. FARC operatives executed four Indians from that commu-
 nity as suspected collaborators with the army. Most of the attacks were unsolved
 by year's end, and the regional land conflicts that spawned them remained largely
 unresolved.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Two million black citizens live primarily in
 the Pacific department of Choco and along the Caribbean coast. They represent
 roughly 4 percent of the general population. Blacks are entitled to all constitutional
 rights and protections but have traditionally suffered from economic discrimination.
 Despite the passage of the Afro-Colombian Law in 1993, little concrete progress was
 made in expanding public services and private investment in the Choco or other pre-
 dominantly black regions.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution enumerates the fundamental social,
 economic, and cultural rights of the physically disabled, but serious practical im-
 pediments exist to prevent disabled persons' full participation in society. There is
 no legislation that specifically mandates access for people with disabilities. The Con-
 stitutional Court ruled in September that physically disabled individuals must be
 given access to and assistance at the voting stations. In August the Constitutional
 Court ruled that the Social Security Fund for Public Employees (Cajanal) cannot
 refuse to provide services for the disabled children of its memrs, regardless of the
 cost involved.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law recognizes the rights of workers to organize
 unions and strike. The Labor Code provides for automatic recognition of unions that
 obtain at least 25 signatures from the workplace and comply with a simple registra-
 tion process at the Labor Ministry. The law penalizes interference with freedom of
 association. It also stipulates union freedom to determine internal rules, elect offi-
 cials, and manage activities, and forbids the dissolution of trade unions by adminis-
 trative fiat. According to Labor Ministry estimates, only about 8 percent of the work
 force is organized. Unions freely establish international affiliations without govern-
 ment restrictions.
 The 1991 Constitution provides for the right to strike by nonessential public em-
 ployees and authorizes Congress to pass enabling legislation that would define 'es-
 sential", which it has not yet done. In the absence of this definition, existing legisla-
 tion which prohibits public employees from striking is still in force. Before staging
 a legal strike, unions must negotiate directly with management and-if no agree-
 
 
 359
 ment results-accept mediation. By law, public employees must accept binding arbi-
 tration if mediation fails; in practice, publi service unions decide by membership
 vote whether or not to seek arbitration.
 In 1993 the International Labor Organization (ILO) criticized 10 provisions of Co-
 lombian law, including- the supervision of the internal management and meetings
 of unions by government officials; the presence of officials at assemblies convened
 to vote on a strike call; the suspension of union officers who dissolve their unions;
 the requirement that contenders for trade union office must belong to the occupation
 in question; the prohibition of strikes in a wide range of public services which are
 not necessarily essential; various restrictions on the right to strike and the power
 of the Minister of Labor and the President to intervene in disputes through compul-
 sory arbitration; and the power to dismiss trade union officers involved in an unlaw-
 ful strike.
 The most important strike in the private sector in 1994 was the 66-day work stop-
 page by the 4,000 employees of Acerias Paz del Rio, a steel plant in the department
 of Boyaca. Collective bargaining on salaries and benefits broke down when the
 union refused to affiliate with the new private pension system. In addition, the Gov-
 ernment's ongoing privatization plans provoked significant labor protests in several
 public enterprises. Petroleum workers opposed the Governments plan to divide the
 state petroleum company Ecopetrl into four smaller companies, a move they fear
 is a prelude to privatization. The authorities arrested and threatened union leaders
 during the longstanding Ecopetrol conflict, and the rank and file authorized the
 union leadership to call a national strie.
 Labor leaders throughout the country continue to be the target of attacks by guer-
 rillas, paramilitary groups, narcotics traffickers, the military, police, and their own
 union rivals. They aso suffer from the high level of violence and the pervasive use
 of firearms that negatively affect the ives of all Colombians. In the department of
 Antioquia alone, un  own perpetrators murdered at least eight labor leaders. In a
 single month (July), they killed Lis Guillermo Main Echavaria, education sec-
 retary of the Antioquia Labor Federation; Lis Efren Correa, vice president of the
 Textile Workers Union; and Jairo Leon Agudelo, president of the Antioquia Agricul-
 tural Workers Union. In the banana-prodig region of Uraba, organized workers
 historically belonged to the extreme left wing of the Colombian labor movement but
 refused to cooperate with the FARC. As a result, guerrillas killed labor leaders and
 union members, including the January massacre of a whole neighborhod-La
 Chinita-in Apartado, Antioquia.
 The list of killings, intimidations and arbitrary arrests of labor union leaders in-
 cludes the abduction of Domingo Rafael Tovar Arrieta, a member of the board of
 the Single Federation of Workers of Colombia (CUT), who was also the victim of
 threats and arbitrary arrest; the July murder of Trina Soto Xastellanos, treasurer
 of the Market Sellers Union in Cucuta, and her sister, the July killing of Alberto
 Alvarado, vice president of the Graphics Workers Union in Bogota; and numerous
 threats against other labor leaders.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colectivey.-The Constitution protects the
 right of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining. Workers have been
 most successful in organizing larger firms and public services, but these unionized
 workers represent only a small portion of the economically active population. High
 unemployment, traditional antiunion attitudes, and weak union organization and
 leadership limit workers' bargaining power in the private sector and in agriculture.
 The law forbids antiunion discrimination and the obstruction of free association.
 Government labor inspections theoretically enforce these provisions, but because of
 the small number of inspectors and workers' fears of losing their jobs, the inspection
 apparatus is weak. The authorities fined a few transgressor companies, and some
 workers successfully sought redress in the courts. The new Labor Code increases the
 fines levied for restricting freedom of association and prohibits the use of strike
 breakers.
 The Labor Code also eliminates mandatory mediation in private labor-manage-
 ment disputes and extends the grace period before the Government can intervene
 in a conflict. Federations and confederations may assist affiliate unions in collective
 bargaining.
 Labor law applies to the country's seven free trade zones (FTZ's), but these stand-
 ards are difficult to enforce. Public employee unions have won collective bargaining
 agreements in the FTZ's of Barranquilla, Buenaventura, Cartagena, and Santa
 Marta, but the garment manufacturing enterprises in Medellin and Risaralda, the
 most important in the country in terms of numbers of employees, are not organized.
 National labor leaders claim that in these FTZ's the provisions of the Labor Code
 dealing with wages, hours, health and safety are honored in the breach.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and any form of forced or compulsory labor, and this prohibition is respected in
 practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution bans the employ-
 ment of children under the age of 14 in most jobs, and the Labor Code prohibits
 granting work permits to youths under the age of 18. This provision is respected
 in larger enterprises and in major cities. Nevertheless, Colombia's extensive infor-
 mal economy remains effectively outside government ontrol. Some 800,000 children
 between the ages of 12 and 17 work, according to Labor Ministry studies. These
 children work-often under substandard conditions--in agriculture or in the infor-
 mal sector, as street vendors, in leather tanning, and in small family-operated
 mines. Working children are exposed to the same risks affecting adult workers, in-
 cluding exposure to toxic substances and accidental injuries, all of which contribute
 to impaired physical development.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Worh.-The Government annually sets a national min-
 imum wage which serves as a benchmark for wage bargaining. It set the current
 minimum wage-about $130 (107,000 pesos) per month-in December 1993 ater
 the National Labor Council, a tripartite advisory board, again failed to reach agree-
 ment among government, labor, and private sector representatives. The minimum
 wage, earned by over onear of the population, is consistent with the Govern-
 ment's anti-inflation policies, but falls far short of providing an adequate standard
 of living for a worker and family.
 The law provides for a standard workday of 8 hours and a 48-hour workweek, but
 does not specifically require a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, a failing which
 the ILO criticizes. Legislation provides comprehensiveprotection for workers' occu-
 pational safety and health, but these standards are dificult to enforce, in part due
 to the small number of Labor Ministry inspectors. In addition, unorganized workers
 in the informal sector are protected by social insurance systems and fear that they
 will lose their jbsi they exercise their right to denounce abuses, particularly in
 the agricultural sector. Accrdig to the Labor Code, workers have the right to with-
 draw from a hazardous work situation without jeopardizing continued employment.
 In general, low levels of public safety awareness, inadequate involvement by unions,
 andlax enforcement by the Labor Ministry result in an unacceptably high level of
 industrial accidents and on-the-job situations that jeopardize workers' heath.
