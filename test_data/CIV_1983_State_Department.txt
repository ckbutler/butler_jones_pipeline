 IVORY COAST
 Ivory Coast, which attained independence from the French in 1960,
 has developed into a authoritarian but benevolent one-party state.
 Power is concentrated in the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast,
 whose longtime leader is President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. While
 the formation of other parties is guaranteed by the Constitution,
 in practice no other party is allowed. Although President
 Houphouet's leadership is unquestioned, more open discussion of
 government policies has occurred since the country's first compet-
 itive elections for local party, municipal, and legislative
 positions in 1980.
 Despite great strides in development since independence,
 poverty still prevails in much of Ivory Coast. The Ivorian
 economy is market-oriented and open to foreign investment. Until
 recently steady economic growth had permitted appreciable annual
 improvement in the standard of living throughout the country and
 contributed to widespread support for the policies of the Govern-
 ment. Over the last two years, Ivory Coast has been squeezed by a
 heavy debt burden and low prices for its export products on world
 markets. The Government has introduced austerity measures to
 offset this reduced income. These measures have been widely, but
 not completely, accepted.
 The Ivorian Government has emphasized pragmatism and moderation in
 its policies. President Houphouet-Boigny, Head-of-State since
 independence and architect of Ivory Coast's economic development,
 prides himself on his advocacy of 'dialogue" in settling dis-
 putes. Houphouet generally seeks to involve dissenters in the
 operation of the Ivorian system rather than isolate or imprison
 them, with considerable success.
 For over two weeks in April and May 1983, the Secondary School
 Teachers' Union struck to protest the announcement of a sharp
 reduction in government housing allowances. Threatening govern-
 ment action, such as warnings of military conscription, and the
 dissolution of the union forced the teachers back to their
 classrooms while negotiations sought to resolve their grievances.
 There are no political prisoners in Ivory Coast, and there has
 never been execution of political opponents. There is no history
 of violent action against specific ethnic or religious minorities,
 although riots directed at foreign Africans have occurred in the
 past. Some detainees have been occasionally beaten due to lack of
 training and discipline in the ranks of the Surete Nationale and
 the Gendarmerie.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 No incidents of this type were reported during 1983. There are
 no reports of politically-motivated killing by either the Govern-
 ment or by opposition groups. In a February, 1981 incident,
 approximately 46 Ghanaian residents of Ivory Coast suffocated
 during a police roundup after having been held in a small poorly-
 ventilated cell. The Ivorian Government conducted an investiga-
 tion of the incident and arrested the officer responsible. The
 disposition of the case has not been made public.

 b. Disappearance
 There are no reports of abduction or disappearance of individuals
 by forces with official sanction. A government report during the
 Secondary School Teachers' strikes claimed that a young female
 relative of the President was kidnapped and assaulted in an
 apparent attempt to intimidate the Government.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Ivorian penal code prohibits the use of violence by offi-
 cial means without justification. The code does not, however,
 specifically mention or prohibit torture nor does it define
 what constitutes "legitimate justification" or the level of
 violence officials may use.
 There were no reports of torture during 1983. Systematically
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of individuals or prison
 inmates is not thought to occur routinely, but foreign Africans
 are likely to be treated more roughly by police than are Ivorian
 detainees. During a 1983 anti-crime campaign, some detainees,
 primarily foreign Africans, were reportedly denied adequate food
 and drink, beaten by police and forced to do menial labor.
 A 1982 report claims that airport officials used a cattle prod
 during what was presumably an interrogation of an African, but
 there were no similar reports in 1983.
 Prisoners are allowed visits from attorneys of their choice and
 from family members, who provide food to supplement the sparse
 prison diet. Prisons are crowded and conditions poor.  Sanitation
 and medical facilities are limited. There is no evidence of
 discriminatory treatment of prisoners on the basis of sex,
 ethnicity, race, or type of crime, once they are committed
 to prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Ivorian Constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit arbi-
 trary arrest or imprisonment. People are not detained, punished,
 or tried for expression of views critical of or different from
 those of the Government; but the Government has occasionally
 detained a few individuals it believes to be security threats.
 It also takes firm non-violent measures against acts it considers
 threats to internal security, the most recent examples being the
 suspension of the Secondary School Teachers' Union for an unau-
 thorized strike, in April and May 1983 and the arrest of student
 demonstrators in February 1982. The Government has used the
 possibility of forced conscription as a disincentive to involve-
 ment in antigovernment activities.
 Under the Ivorian penal code, a public prosecutor can detain a
 suspect for up to 48 hours without bringing charges. During a
 1983 anti-crime campaign, several thousand individuals were
 detained under this provision for identity checks, and many were
 apparently held beyond the legal maximum. The code dictates that
 further detention be ordered by a magistrate who can authorize
 periods of detention up to four months but must provide the
 Minister of Justice a monthly written explanation of why detention
 should be continued.
 
 
 173
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Ivorian law establishes the right to a fair public trial. This
 provision is generally respected in urban centers. In rural
 areas justice is often administered at the village level through
 traditional tribal institutions. The judiciary is independent of
 the executive and military. Defendants have the right to legal
 counsel, and the ju dicial system provides for court-appointed
 attorneys for indigent defendants. In practice, however, such
 attorneys are not readily available. The Court of Appeals hears
 appeals of verdicts of civilian courts. Civilians are not tried
 by military courts. There is no structure of appeals courts
 within the military justice system. Persons convicted by a
 military tribunal occasionally request the Supreme Court to set
 aside the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial. There are no
 political prisoners in Ivory Coast.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 All Ivorian citizens are declared by the Government to be members
 of the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast. Although party regula-
 tions call for active participation in party activities and
 payment of dues, most of the rural populace do not participate,
 and do not suffer retaliation. It is not known what percentage of
 the population actively participates in the party. The Code of
 Penal Procedures specifies that a police official or investigating
 magistrate may conduct searches of homes without a warrant if he
 has reason to believe there is evidence concerning a crime on the
 premises. The official must have the prosecutor's agreement to
 retain any objects seized in the search. He is required to have
 witnesses to the search which may not take place between the hours
 of 9:00 pm and 4:00 am. Legal safeguards against arbitrary
 searches are generally respected in the modern parts of cities.
 In less-developed urban sectors and in rural areas, legal
 safeguards are sometimes ignored. There are no reports of forced
 entry or other violations of the home during 1983. Monitoring of
 correspondence and telephone conversations is not widely
 practiced.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Despite Ivory Coast's established one-party state, there is a
 large measure of freedom of speech. Critics of the Government
 feel free to express themselves in informal situations, among
 Ivorians and foreigners alike, without fear of reprisal.
 Limits--such as cancellation of gatherings--are occasionally placed
 on the expression of controversial views in public forums. One ex-
 ample occurred in 1982 when student disorders and a strike began
 over what the students termed a curtailment of free speech. In
 this case the Government had cancelled previously scheduled extra-
 curricular lectures and debates because similar events several
 days earlier had resulted in disorders. A strong government reac-
 tion and threat of conscription broke the strike, and only apolit-
 ical gatherings are now permitted on campus. One outspoken publi-
 cation was banned during the 1982 disorders. On the other hand,
 students still speak freely about politics in informal situations.
 
 
 174
 The country's one daily newspaper is owned by private interests,
 but its editorial opinion follows the policies of the country's
 single political party. The one weekly news magazine is con-
 trolled by the party. The Ministry of Information operates a
 wire service, radio, and television. Government policy assigns
 the media a positive role in promoting national unity and develop-
 ment. It allows criticism of certain kinds. In practice, this
 means that failures of policy execution can be criticized but not
 policies themselves. Investigative journalism of government
 policies and administration is not permitted, but other types of
 investigative reporting are allowed. Foreign publications are
 readily available, but occasional issues which are particularly
 critical of the Ivorian Government, party or the President are
 seized. Authorities attempt to suppress distribution of locally-
 produced anti-government tracts that surface from time to time.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is generally respected in Ivory Coast except
 when the Government perceives a significant and immediate danger
 to public order. In such cases, it prohibits meetings and ar-
 rests persons disregarding its orders. Most unions are organized
 and directed by a government-sponsored umbrella union, the leaders
 of which occupy important positions in the party hierarchy. The
 umbrella organization is a relatively passive coordination
 mechanism rather than an active campaigner for workers'. rights.
 The right to. strike exists in theory, but in practice legal
 strikes are rarely authorized.
 In April 1983, the Secondary School Teachers' Union struck to
 protest a government decision to reduce its housing allowances
 program. In the teachers' view, they were unfairly being singled
 out as a privileged group of public employees and being forced to
 make sacrifices because of mismanagement and corruption in the
 government lodging program. In response the Government closed
 schools, suspended salaries, evicted striking teachers from
 government housing and suspended the union. Through a series of
 public speeches by the President and a well-orchestrated media
 campaign, the Government built strong support for its position and
 isolated the teachers. The strike was broken by a Presidential
 decree ordering teachers back to the classrooms and threatening
 them with prison sentences and fines for non-compliance. Wildcat
 strikes occur occasionally, the most recent being a strike by
 workers at a major hotel in late 1982. Generally the Government
 negotiates with strikers and resolves at least some of their
 economic grievances. There have been no reports that professional
 groups have experienced persecution or harassment. The Govern-
 ment, however, attempts to bring such groups under its wing
 or that of the party so as to exercise control over their
 activities.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no known impediments to religious expression in Ivory
 Coast. There is no dominant religion, and no particular faith is
 favored for advancement. The open practice of religion is per-
 mitted, and there are no restrictions on religious ceremonies or
 teaching.
 
 
 175
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Ivorian Government exercises minimal control over domestic
 travel. Ivorians can freely travel abroad and emigrate without
 discrimination. Ivorians have the right of voluntary repatri-
 ation. There are no known cases of revocation of citizenship.
 Ivory Coast's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The
 country has resettled or granted safehaven to Angolans, Eritreans,
 Guineans, Liberians, Indo-Chinese, Voltans and Ghanaians. The
 Ivorian Government issues refugee travel documents which permit
 refugees to return to Ivory Coast within two years. While in
 Ivory Coast, they receive one-year renewable resident visas for
 their first five years in the country, after which they may apply
 for permanent resident's cards. Ivory Coast does not take any
 significant responsibility for the economic and social welfare of
 refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 President Houphouet-Boigny heads the single Democratic Party of
 Ivory Coast and keeps most political power in his own hands. The
 country is in practice a one-party state, although its Constitu-
 tion provides for multiple political parties. No opposition
 groups exist openly, and their formation is discouraged. Within
 the party, the President operates through a nine-member Executive
 Committee, a 30-member Political Bureau, and a 100-member steering
 committee. All important decisions, however, are taken by the
 President himself.
 Within this strictly observed one-party system, the Ivorian
 Government has encouraged more open participation in the political
 process in recent years. In the 1980 National Assembly elections,
 for example, any candidate, not just traditional party faithful,
 could run for office within the confines of the one-party slate.
 There was intense competition for local party, municipal, and
 national assembly seats, in which all citizens were eligible to
 vote.
 About 50 percent of top local party officials were voted out of
 office, and only 27 incumbent deputies were re-elected to the
 147-member National Assembly. As a result of this process,
 current National Assembly members work more vigorously in their
 constituents' interest than their predecessors did, and debate
 within that body is more vigorous and well-publicized than was the
 case before 1980.
 Public criticism of basic government policies or of the party
 and the President rarely occurs, although abuses of the
 execution of policy-as in corruption cases-are publicized. The
 party-controlled press often reproaches individuals who criticize
 policy, although private criticism is common and tolerated.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude. Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been cooperative toward inquiries into its
 human rights situation. Ivory Coast has a chapter of Amnesty
 International. The last inquiry occurred in 1981 and concerned a
 published report by Amnesty International in Paris that the
 
 
 176
 Government had drafted striking television employees into the Army
 as a form of extra-judicial punishment. The Government at first
 maintained that these men were simply doing their duty as con-
 scripts. Later, the men appeared in uniform on national
 television and were told they were being returned to civilian
 life. This year Amnesty International did not include a report on
 Ivory Coast. Freedom House rates Ivory Coast "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Ivory Coast's population in 1983 was 8.89 million with an
 annual growth rate of 3.2 percent. Per capita gross national
 product (GNP) is estimated at $1,185 (1981), with life expect-
 ancy at birth being 47.1 years (1980). The country's infant
 mortality rate is 120.6 per 1,000 live births (1983), and its
 adult literacy rate was 41.2 percent in 1980. Nineteen percent
 of the population has access to safe drinking water, and the
 ratio of calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirement was 106.6 in 1977. Ivory Coast's primary
 school enrollment ratio was 74 percent in 1978.
 Some Ivorian traditional societies accord women considerable
 political and economic power. In rural areas tribal customs
 dictate the division of tasks and these sometimes fall heavily
 on women. Female circumcision continues to be practiced among
 elements of the Ivorian population, although it is rare in urban
 populations. Official party policy is to encourage full partici-
 pation by women in social, economic, and political life. The
 Government has established a Ministry of Women's Affairs for this
 purpose. Women, however, remain very lightly represented at the
 higher levels of Government and the party.
 Ivory Coast's population of over 8 million includes at least two
 million foreign Africans, perhaps as many as 100,000 Lebanese and
 40,000 French, and small numbers of other Europeans, North Ameri-
 cans, and Asians. A great disparity exists between the standard
 of living of expatriates and the African elites on one hand, and
 the urban poor and villagers on the other. Nonetheless, there is
 a sizable, growing urban Ivorian middle class, and living
 conditions in the villages have improved markedly and steadily
 during Ivory Coast's 23 years as an independent state. Most
 villages have wells, and at least three years of primary education
 are offered in all but the smallest villages. Efforts are being
 made to consolidate smaller villages to the minimum size necessary
 to provide education, health and other public services. The
 country has constructed an excellent, nationwide network of paved
 highways and nearly all Ivorians have access to motorized trans-
 portation. Individuals have property rights and these tend to be
 protected, at least in urban areas. In rural areas land tenure
 and possibly other property rights are often dictated by tribal
 custom.
 Ivory Coast has a substantial degree of food self-sufficiency.
 While perhaps 50 percent of the rice, 75 percent of red meat,
 and 100 percent of the wheat is imported, ample supplies of
 traditional starches, vegetables, fish, and other proteins are
 available and affordable. Although malnutrition sometimes
 occurs, it is largely due to nutritional ignorance and not the
 lack of food.
 
 
 177
 Better-paying government and private sector jobs seem to be
 concentrated among the minority Muslim (25 percent) and
 Christian (15 percent) populations, a phenomenon more related
 to urbanization and access to education than to a systematic
 pattern of discrimination. On the other hand, the Government's
 policy of Ivorianization requires that all positions be offered
 to Ivorians before foreigners; this keeps foreign Africans from
 most wage and salary jobs in the modern sector. Education absorbs
 some 30-40 percent of the operating budget and is generally avail-
 able to all children, Ivorian and foreign, boys and girls.
 Health, by contrast, absorbs only seven to eight percent of the
 operating budget and is less widely distributed than educational
 services. During the current period of economic austerity many
 health centers are operating without medicines and other medical
 supplies.
