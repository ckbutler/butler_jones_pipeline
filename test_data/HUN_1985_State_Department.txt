 HUNGARY
 Hungary is ruled by the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist
 Workers (Communist) Party which maintains a complete monopoly
 on political power. Although most civil rights are prescribed
 by the Constitution, in practice the exercise of such rights
 is often arbitrarily restricted. Since the early 1960's, the
 party has gradually eased internal controls and fostered a
 greater degree of economic well-being. Political expression
 is still tightly-controlled, and participation in the
 political process is not possible outside the limits set by
 the party.
 The Soviet Union has maintained military forces in Hungary
 since the end of World War II. In excess of 60,000 Soviet
 soldiers are currently stationed there.
 During the first half of 1985, Hungary held its first local
 council and parliamentary elections in which multiple nominees
 were compulsory. Members of the democratic opposition,
 environmentalists, and reform economists attempted to gain
 nominations but were unsuccessful.
 The secret police and other coercive institutions exist but
 have become somewhat more circumspect. On the legal side, a
 recent Hungarian decree reinforced the terms of the police
 surveillance law. Other decrees in recent years have
 strengthened the power of the police to search citizens
 without cause and tightened state control over duplicating
 machines and over persons without regular employment.
 Economic reform is still the key to Hungary's relatively
 tolerant domestic policies. Although the country has survived
 3 years of belt-tightening without too much domestic
 complaint, the Government is trying to cope with growing
 popular unhappiness about rising prices and a stationary
 standard of living by allowing modest wage increases.
 Hungarians as a whole are significantly freer of the type of
 economic restrictions and interference with private life which
 characterize other Warsaw Pact states.
 Hungary's human rights record showed some improvement in
 1985. As of early October, some dissidents who previously had
 been unable to receive passports suddenly found themselves
 free to travel. At the same time, a police surveillance order
 imposed for political purposes on a dissident economist and
 writer was removed. Also in October, members of a rock band
 who had received prison sentences for singing anti-Socialist
 songs and a stage director sentenced to 7 months in prison on
 charges of "pornography and Fascism" were released. Purveyors
 of "samizdat" (self-published) materials continued their
 activities with the usual harassment by the authorities in the
 form of fines and the confiscation of those materials. The
 possibilities of emigration and, especially, visits abroad,
 including to Western countries, continued as before.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing'
 There is no evidence that killing for political motives
 occurred in Hungary in 1985.
 
 
 1002
 HUNGARY
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reported disappearances in Hungary during
 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No known instances of torture have occurred in Hungary in
 recent years. Citizens, in principle, may bring complaints
 against the police.
 There are three levels of punitive incarceration in Hungary:
 'workhouse," which allows some privileges of visiting, outside
 work, and leaving; "jail," which is more punitive; and
 "prison," which means a maximum-security penitentiary.
 Confinement conditions vary in relation to the category of
 incarceration, but all levels are believed to provide adequatV
 diet and health care. Hardened criminals are confined
 separately from those convicted of petty crimes. With varying
 degrees of frequency, depending on levels of imprisonment,
 prisoners have rights to visitation by family members, other
 relatives, and friends. There does not appear to be
 deliberate, willful, or systematic mistreatment of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Citizens seem generally free from arbitrary arrest. Upon
 arrest, a detainee must be informed in writing of what offense
 he or she is suspected of having committed and may be held at
 a police station for a maximum of 72 hours before charges must
 be filed. There is no right of bail or provisional pretrial
 liberty. In cases of suspicion for major crimes, a person can
 be held in jail 30 days before trial, renewable twice for a
 maximum of 3 months.
 The penal code contains an article on incitement which permits
 officials to prosecute for a wide range of utterances or
 statements. Some individuals have reportedly been sentenced
 for denouncing the Communist Party or the Soviet occupation of
 Hungary. It is not clear how many cases of incitement involve
 political matters. According to the office of the Chief
 Public Prosecutor, in 1984 crimes against the state decreased
 by 50 percent.
 A penal code provision concerning "espionage" provides for
 punishing "a person who obtains, collects, or gives out data
 which can be used against the Hungarian People's Republic with
 the purpose of forwarding them to a foreign government or
 organization ....... Neither the nature of the data transmitted
 nor the nature of the recipient organization is clearly
 defined, thus allowing a broad interpretation by the
 authorities of the kind of "data" considered to be proscribed.
 Under an amendment to the criminal code which went into effect
 in 1985, a person "who is capable of working but follows a way
 of life of vagrancy" may be punished by loss of liberty for up
 to 2 years or by reformatory and educative labor or by a
 fine. During the first half of 1985, Hungarian courts
 sentenced 80 persons to corrective training work. Many
 Gypsies have been sentenced under this law. There is no
 evidence that the law has been used against political
 dissidents.
 
 
 1003
 HUNGARY
 The police surveillance law was strengthened in 1985 to permit
 the police to place under surveillance or in internal exile
 any citizen or resident of Hungary above the age of 16 (rather
 than 18) for a period of 2 years (rather than I year),
 renewable for an additional year, if that person's attitude
 represents a permanent danger to the internal order or public
 security of the country.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution stipulates that all court proceedings are
 open, except for cases specifically exempted by law (those
 involving morals or state secrets). There are few closed
 trials in Hungary. Those which are closed usually involve
 "national security," not otherwise defined. In general,
 judicial procedures are investigatory rather than adversarial
 in nature. There is no trial by jury. Defendants have the
 right to choose their own counsel. Courts normally seek to
 apply the law in a methodical fashion. Nonpolitical trials
 are more likely to be handled in an impartial manner than are
 trials involving offenses considered to be political. Some
 10-15 young men are serving jail sentences of up to 3 years
 for having refused conscription on the grounds of
 conscientious objection to military service.
 An undetermined number of citizens, including some who opt to
 flee instead of serving in the military, may be incarcerated
 for attempting to leave Hungary without government permission.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution guarantees citizens' personal freedom and
 inviolability, as well as the secrecy of correspondence and
 privacy of the home, but these are violated when the
 authorities determine such violation to be in the State's
 interest. However, search warrants are generally obtained.
 House searches are conducted by a court order and must be
 carried out in the presence of two witnesses. A written
 inventory of items removed from the premises must be
 prepared. These procedures are generally adhered to.
 Since the 1960's, Hungarian practice has become more tolerant
 than previously with respect to a person's private activities.
 Formal systems for gathering information on people, such as
 the widespread use of informers and block wardens and overt
 intrusions of the police into the daily life of persons, have
 been substantially curtailed. It is widely assumed, however,
 that private telephone lines are tapped and correspondence
 opened when the authorities have an interest in doing so.
 Though it is expensive by Hungarian standards to do so,
 Hungarians may subscribe to nonpolitical Western
 publications. Subscribers to National Geographic magazine did
 not receive the June 1985 edition, however, which was made
 unavailable in Hungary because of a cover story on Afghanistan.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees free speech and free press, but
 these rights are qualified by the need to conform to the
 "interests of socialism and the people."
 
 
 1004
 HUNGARY
 According to Hungarian press law, a Hungarian citizen may not
 speak publicly against the Communist form of government or
 Hungary's alliance with the Soviet Union. A citizen who
 opposes basic tenets publicly may be subjected to varying
 measures of admonition, harassment, and punishment.
 Pervasive self-censorship in cultural and media circles
 determines the boundaries of free expression. The authorities
 have banned the circulation of certain books, magazines, and
 articles considered not to conform with accepted positions.
 The right to publish is restricted for political reasons. In
 1985, poet Gaspar Nagy was forced to resign from the official
 Writers Association under government pressure due to a poem he
 had published in a regional literary journal addressing the
 fate of former Premier Imre Nagy, who was executed following
 the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. In November Sandor Lezsak, the
 director of a provincial cultural center, was dismissed after
 organizing an exhibition illustrating the works of poets,
 including dissidents and emigres.
 Party and government authorities closely supervise the press,
 radio, and television, which are government-owned and must
 adhere to the party's ideological guidelines. Although some
 carefully nuanced differing views occasionally appear in the
 press, they are usually well within the general constraints
 imposed by the party. The public medium which enjoys the
 greatest degree of freedom of political expression is film,
 although the more politically controversial examples are
 typically withheld from public distribution until the
 authorities deem fit.
 Infrequently, Western viewpoints can be heard on Hungarian
 radio and television. These may be the views of a Western
 spokesman, broadcast together with those of other participants
 in a panel discussion, or straight reporting of a Western
 official's comments on a topical international issue, such as
 U.S.-Soviet relations. Hungary does not normally jam Western
 radio broadcasts. However, some-broadcasts carrying
 interviews with former Hungarian Prime-Minister Andras Hegedus
 may have been jammed. Austrian and Yugoslav radio and
 television broadcasts reach much of the country.
 Hungary permits some access to Western literature, films,
 television programs, and nonpolitical publications. In
 October 1985.Western periodicals including the'International
 Herald Tribune, Le:,Monde, The Sunday Times of London, and Die
 Presse were made available for local currency at centrally
 located, kiosks and transportation centers.
 Dissident activity in Hungary remains largely confined to
 several hundred intellectuals who live primarily in Budapest,
 although numbers of working-class youths have also been
 arrested for expressing dissatisfaction with the system.
 Hungarian dissidents meet irregularly for private discussion
 of political and other topics. Hungary's economic progress
 during the:last decade, its emphasis on consumerism, and its,
 willingness to permit more frequent travel to the West than do
 other Warsaw Pact nations, have served to undercut the appeal
 of dissidents to a broader public. However, the governmental
 decision to go ahead with a highly controversial dam on the
 Hungarian-Czechoslovakian border has increased the public
 appeal of those dissidents most concerned with the environment.
 
 
 1005
 HUNGARY
 The Government has shown a general willingness to tolerate
 some expressions of dissent without explicit reply or
 rejoinder   It is prepared, however, to harass political
 dissidents to keep them in check and has occasionally expelled
 them or encouraged their emigration to the West.
 One group of dissidents is active in the preparation and
 distribution of prohibited articles and books in "samizdat"
 (self-published) form. Since 1982 the authorities have
 engaged in a campaign of harassment against these activists.
 Occasional press articles have attacked the dissidents and
 their alleged Western supporters. A high level of activity,
 however, continues.
 No arrests for dissident activity are known to have occurred
 in 1985. The police in Budapest have the power to impose
 fines on persons involved in unauthorized publishing by
 administrative means wuthout the need to resort to court
 trial. They exercise this power regularly. The authorities
 also seek to discourage, or at least moderate, dissident
 activities by influencing job possibilities, both positively
 and negatively, and by treating travel requests by dissidents
 arbitrarily.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and
 the right to form associations, government approval or tacit
 acceptance is required for the exercise of these rights. At
 the outset of the 1985 Budapest Cultural Forum of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
 authorities refused to allow the International Helsinki
 Federation to meet with local and foreign writers in a
 Budapest hotel. The symposium was transferred to private
 apartments and was not disrupted by the police. Some
 dissidents meet frequently at an informal "free university" in
 Budapest, where academicians and dissidents lecture on topics
 which are not discussed in formal university institutions.
 The Hungarian National Trade Union Council, one of the party's
 mass organizations, is controlled and directed by the party.
 It serves the purpose of indoctrinating workers in party
 policy as well as representing worker interests within certain
 bounds. The Chairman of the council is a member of the party
 Politburo. He represents the council in meetings with the
 party leadership and with the Government over labor policy,
 economic planning, prices, wages, and other economic issues.
 On the local and enterprise level, the council has a veto
 right over state nominations of managers and administers a
 system of shop distribution of bonus money, profit sharing,
 enterprise-controlled housing, health care, union vacation
 plans, and other benefits. Stewards can veto management
 decisions on personnel actions, plant safety, and other
 work-related issues which do not comply with collective
 agreements and labor regulations. Disputed questions are
 referred to higher authorities for arbitration. The National
 Trade Union Council is currently holding elections for the
 majority of union offices and has incorporated some of the
 electoral reforms employed in the 1985 parliamentary and local
 council elections.
 The Constitution does not provide for the right to strike.
 Although work stoppages have taken place in local industries
 
 
 1006
 HUNGARY
 in recent years, there has not been a major strike affecting
 an entire industrial sector in almost a quarter of a century.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although freedom of conscience and freedom of religious
 practice are guaranteed in the Constitution, they are subject
 to restrictions. Steadfastly committed to atheism, the
 authorities for tactical reasons profess the acceptability of
 believers and nonbelievers working together in the interest of
 "socialist society." The Government has generally maintained
 good relations with the hierarchies of the major religious
 denominations, many of which have representatives in the
 National Assembly. Professed religious beliefs, however, may
 limit the citizen's advancement in government, industry, and
 the professions.
 There are some 19 iignificant religious denominations in
 Hungary which are recognized by law, plus several small sects,
 such as Jehovah's Witnesses which are not. Sizable religious
 groups in Hungary include Roman Catholics (5.25 million),
 Reformed Calvinists (2 million), Evangelical Lutherans (0.5
 million), and Jews (100,000). The total number of persons
 manifesting some religious belief is estimated at 8.5 million
 out of a population of 10.7 million.
 In church-state relations, progress toward the establishment
 of a new religious order of nuns dedicated to the care of
 elderly and infirm citizens was halted by government officials
 in 1985, who backed away from an earlier understanding
 authorizing the order. The successful visit of American
 evangelist Billy Graham generated positive publicity for
 church-state relations and demonstrated the continuing close
 connections Hungarians maintain with their religious
 counterparts in other countries.
 Religious denominations in Hungary have generally good access
 to religious materials, including Bibles and prayer books. In
 many cases, they print their own. They also publish
 periodicals and newspapers which, however, are subject to the
 same state control as all other publications.
 During 1985, party and state officials expressed continued
 interest in cooperating with religious denominations on social
 matters of mutual concern, such as the provision of adequate
 health care, the high divorce and alcohol rates, and juvenile
 delinquency.
 The churches do not act as organizing centers for dissent.
 Specialized dissension has grown up within the Catholic Church
 centering around the "basic community" movement, which has
 accused the hierarchy of being dogmatic and
 "collaborationist." The Hungarian authorities have not
 detained or arrested any clergy, but approximately 10-15 young
 men have been sentenced to prison terms ranging up to 3 years
 for refusing military service. The right of conscientious
 objection is recognized for only two small denominations, the
 Nazarenes and the Jehovah's Witnesses.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All adult citizens are issued an identity booklet and must
 carry it with them at all times. They must register with
 
 
 1007
 HUNGARY
 local police when moving from one locality to another.
 Although it is possible to transfer permanently from rural
 areas to Budapest, this is not encouraged because of
 overcrowding and a scarcity of housing in the capital. The
 gainfully employed also carry a "work book" which is their
 lifetime record of employment locations and positions.
 Since 1982, Hungary has followed a cautiously liberal practice
 in permitting visits to the West. More than 500,000
 Hungarians currently visit the West annually, while more than
 5 million visits are made annually to Warsaw Pact countries.
 Hungarian citizens now legally have the opportunity to visit
 the West at least once a year--instead of every third year as
 before--if relatives or friends abroad pay the costs. The
 modest hard currency allotment private travelers can receive
 once every 3 years to defray hard currency expenses was
 increased, and a new supplemental amount is now available to
 travelers to the West using their own private cars.
 Exit permission for both Hungarian tourists and emigrants can
 be and occasionally is denied for vague "reasons of state."
 There are indications that such permission in certain
 instances has been denied to dissidents in order to influence
 their activities. Although the pertinent law states that all
 Hungarians have the right to travel, it is also so qualified
 as clearly to leave the decision to the State.
 Hungarian emigration law is restrictive. A person can
 normally apply to emigrate only if joining a parent, spouse,
 or child abroad. However, the law provides for exceptions in
 individual cases, and approximately 90 percent of Hungarians
 who are eligible to apply to emigrate for purposes of family
 reunification receive permission. Persons who are refused
 permission to emigrate may appeal and reapply. Reapplications
 are sometimes successful, particularly if there are special
 humanitarian considerations. There are no systematic official
 sanctions, such as loss of employment or housing, imposed on
 persons who seek to emigrate, and emigrants may take a modest
 amount of personal property with them.
 Persons who have emigrated legally from Hungary have a legal
 right to return upon application. They must establish that
 there is housing and employment or an income available to
 them. Persons who leave Hungary as visitors with permission
 to stay abroad only temporarily and who then fail to return
 are subject to prosecution and sentencing under the civil
 code. Hungary appears to follow, however, a discretionary
 practice of treating such persons leniently, if they return.
 Prosecution may not occur or, when it does, may lead to a
 suspended sentence. Assiduous prosecution and other
 sanctions, such as deprivation of former employment, are
 possible.
 Regulations introduced in recent years liberalized and
 simplified procedures for Hungarians to obtain permission to
 work abroad for up to 5 years. Permission is not always
 granted. The regulations envisage that a person may take his
 or her family. The worker must agree to remit 20 percent of
 hard currency earnings to the Hungarian national bank, which
 will convert them into a Hungarian currency account that may
 be utilized by the worker within Hungary. The worker will be
 able to retain the remainder of the salary in hard currency.

 HUNGARY
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The. Right of-Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Hungary is ruled by the leadership-of the-Hungarian Socialist
 Workers Party. Politicaliparticipation is not possible
 outside the party or party-sanctioned.organizations. The
 Constitution states that the.Hungarian.SocialistWorkers Party
 represents the 'working class" and-the "interests of the.whole
 of the society." The party uses mass organizations such as
 the. Patriotic People's Front. trade unions, and the Communist
 Youth League to elicit public support. To a:growing extent,
 the party invites-the opinionsand recommendations of nonparty
 organizations (for. example,-cooperatives' associations) on
 policy proposals in. which they have.an interest, but
 implementation is: atthe-discretion of the party.
 In the 1985 elections, 90..percent of.the seats in the National
 Assembly and all-seats in local.councils were contested by at
 least.two candidates. nAlthough candidatesdid not necessarily
 have to be members of the Communist Party, all had to announce
 that they acceptedthe platform of the party-controlled
 Patriotic People's Front and had been deemed acceptable by
 that body. No other political parties were allowed. Several
 .members of.the democratic opposition who attempted to
 establish, candidacies were barred.from. participation in the
 nominating process.
 Section 4 -Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental;Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of;'Human Rights
 The Government. refuses to accept outside charges or
 investigations of alleged human rights violations on the
 grounds that this is "interference in internal affairs."
 Hungary-has shown, however, a willingness to engage in
 discussions with other countries on all aspects of the Helsinki
 Final Act, including its human rights provisions. This
 tolerance did not extend to allowing the privately-organized
 International Helsinki Federation to hold a cultural symposium
 in a hotel during the opening of the 1985 Cultural Forum. The
 symposium was, however, held in private apartments.
 In its 1985 Report (covering the year 1984), Amnesty
 International was concerned about the imprisonment of
 conscientious objectors to military service. It was also
 .concerned about short-term arrests and administrative
 maesures, such as fines and curfews, imposed on people for the
 nonviolent exercise of their right to freedom of expression.
 Freedom House rated'Hungary"partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Hungary's population of 10.7 million is slowly declining. The
 annual rate of growth is minus 0.2 percent. Per capita gross
 national product in 1983 was $2,150.
 Industrialized and increasingly decentralized, Hungary's
 economy has many features which are unique in Eastern Europe.
 Most state-owned enterprises enjoy a high degree of autonomy.
 Workers in much-of industry were allowed or required in 1985
 to vote on new managers rather than having them appointed from
 above. Government economic authorities do not impose specific
 production quotas on enterprises. Most consumer prices,
 especially-for food items, are set largely by free market
 
 
 1009
 HUNGARY
 forces. There are no food shortages. Private farming
 activities have long been encouraged on both state and
 cooperative farms. Moreover, the Government has recently
 begun to encourage private enterprise-type activities in the
 consumer services sector and in small units within industrial
 enterprises. In short, through a combination of flexible
 prices and enterprise autonomy, as well as through government
 encouragement of private enterprise-type activities, Hungary
 has produced an economic system that is more sensitive to
 consumer needs than those of other Eastern European countries.
 Hungary's standard of living, relatively high for Eastern
 Europe, is reflected in such measurements drawn from World
 Bank data as a life expectancy at birth of 72 years, an infant
 mortality rate per 1,000 live births of 20.2 (though this is a
 deterioration from previous years), and a ratio of caloric
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements of 131.8 percent. Emphasis on education has
 yielded an adult literacy rate of 98.9 percent. In 1980, the
 primary school enrollment ratio was 130.7 overall, with no
 significant difference between male and female children.
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 15 with
 restrictions pertaining to shifts and night work. There are
 no restrictions on minors older than 16 years of age.
 Although there is no national minimum wage in Hungary, wage
 charts are set for each profession according to the
 qualifications of the jobholder. The average workweek is
 approximately 45 hours. All Hungarians have a right to a
 minimum of 15 days of paid vacation per year; they are
 entitled to one additional day for each 3 years of service.
 Women account for one-eighth of the management positions in
 Hungarian industry and agriculture. Approximately half of
 these individuals attained their positions within the past 5
 years. Women's share of the more senior jobs, such as general
 director at state industrial complexes, is considerably
 lower. Women's share of professional positions has been
 increasing. At present, 7.6 percent of Hungarian women are
 professionals, compared to 8.6 percent of men.
 More than one-fifth of the members of the National Assembly
 are women. There are very few women at top levels in the
 government or party. Only one Deputy Premier of the 23
 members of the Council of Ministers and 4 of the 21 members of
 the Presidential Council are female.
 A large number of Gypsies (estimates range up to 5 percent of
 the population) live in Hungary. They are not recognized as
 an official minority. The Government engages in many programs
 specifically designed to raise the standard of living of
 Gypsies and help them to adjust to the mainstream of Hungarian
 life. Gypsies are on average, however, considerably less well
 educated and poorer than the majority Magyar population or the
 recognized ethnic minorities. Candid discussion continues to
 appear in the press and specialized literature about the
 social and economic difficulties experienced by Gypsies,
 including the fact that considerable popular prejudice
 exists.
