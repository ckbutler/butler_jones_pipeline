 ITALY
 The Italian constitution recognizes all the basic political
 and civil liberties and a number of fundamental economic and
 social rights. These rights are generally honored in piactice,
 even in the face of the terrorist violence occuring in that
 country.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedon from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedon from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and generally respected in practice.
 The Italian Penal Code-the so-called Rocco Law--was enacted
 during the fascist era. Although substantially amended,
 it remains the basis of Italian penal law, and authorizes
 certain restrictions on civil liberites. For example, it
 outlaws defamation of state institutions and government,
 as well as foreign and ecclesiastical officials.
 The Reale law which deals with criminal procedures, was
 oassed in 1975 in response to increasing terrorism and was
 confirmed by a public referendum in 1978. It establishes broad
 powers of arrest and imprisonment, and is considered by
 most political parties to be too stringent and in need of
 amendment. Parliamentary action on draft legislation to
 amend the law has been pending since 1977 and was recently
 postponed for the fourth time.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. However, as in some other Western European
 countries, a person may be legally imprisoned without
 bail for up to two years before his case is referred to a
 judge for trial. In the current year, for example, several
 alleged terrorists have been arrested and are still in
 prison without any date fixed for the trail.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. However, several cases of entry
 into homes without legal authorization have occurred.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Italy has an extensive system of social welfare benefits
 covering old age, retirement, health and unemployment. These
 programs have experienced continuing problems or inefficient
 administration which have resulted in inequities in some
 cases. The Government recognizes this problem and is
 attempting to improve social services.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are normally inviolate. However, one clear
 violation of freedom of the press is the regular confiscation
 of Male, a weekly newspaper of political satire.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration.
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political activity on the part of citizens is universal.
 Political parties represent the entire spectrum, from left
 to right. In a typical parliamentary election, over 90
 percent of eligible voters cast ballots.
 In some areas, notably the rural south, there remains a
 tendency to cast women in traditional roles and to delimit
 their freedom of action accordingly.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of HUman Rights:
 The Italian Government has an excellent record in supporting
 human rights throughout the world. Italy has not been the
 subject of investigation of alleged human rights violations.
