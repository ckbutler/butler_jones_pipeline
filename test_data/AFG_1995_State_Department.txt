 AFGHANISTAN*
 Afghanistan in 1995 continued to experience civil war with the military balance
 and political control shifting between various factions in different parts of the coun-
 try. Nominal President Burhanuddin Rabbani remained in power in Kabul, the cap-
 ital, although his mandate expired in June 1994. His authority was maintained by
 the military forces of de facto Defense Minister Ahmed Shah Masood. Only two of
 the factions that comprised the original nine-party coalition Government in 1993 re-
 mained. In November Rabbani told the U.N. Special Mission that he was willing to
 transfer power to a 28-member interim council, comprised largely of pro-Rabbani
 elements. His offer was rejected by the Talban, an independent coalition of religious
 students and former commanders. As of early December, no agreement on an in-
 terim council had been reached. There is no constitution, no rule of law, and no
 independent judiciary. Outside the capital, several provincial administrations main-
 tained limited functions. Civil institutions were mostly nonexistent. Banditry was
 prevalent in much of the country.
 Rabbani's forces controlled Kabul and 4 to 5 of Afghanistan's 32 provinces. The
 rest are controlled by the armed factions, primarily the Taliban (religious students
 movement), General Dostam's National Islamic Movement (NIM), and the Council
 of the Eastern Provinices. By September the Taliban had consolidated its hold over
 half the provinces and almost two-thirds of the territory. Efforts were under way
 to foster military and political cooperation among the opposition factions to oust
 Rabbani and Masood from power, however none succeeded. In October the Taliban
 began advancing on Kabul. In November and December, air raids and rocket attacks
 by proRabbani and Taliban forces resulted in over 100 civilian casualties. By year's
 end, Masood's forces had failed to dislodge the Taliban from their forward positions
 around Kabul.
 The Kabul authorities have not established a formal security apparatus; rather
 they relied on the forces of Masood. The Rabb-ani regime has limited influence even
 in the few provinces under its control. In most areas of the country, tribal warlords
 and armed commanders ruled their own personal fiefdoms with little reference to
 any other authority. Local security units operated independently of any govern-
 mental authority and were responsible for many human rights abuses.
 Agriculture, including high levels of opium poppy cultivation, remained the main-
 stay of the economy. Afghanistan has become the second largest opium producer in
 the world and a substantial hashish producer as well. Civil war has impeded recon-
 struction of irrigation systems and repair of market roads. The presence of an esti-
 mated 10 million land mines has restricted areas for cultivation and slowed the re-
 turn of refugees who are needed to rebuild the economy. The laying of new mine-
 fields, primarily by pro-Rabbani forces but also by General Dostam'a NIM, exacer-
 bated an already difficult situation. Formal economic activity remained marginal;
 commerce was deterred by the recurrent fighting and blockedrads.Modest recon-
 struction took place in Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad, Mazar-i-Sharif, and some rural
 areas where local authorities had reestablished a degree of order and civil adminis-
 tration and United Nations and nongove   en   o -ganizations were able to oper-
 ate. When Kabul was united under Rabani/Masood control in March, reconstruc-
 tion efforts began in the capital as well. However, rocket attacks of Kabul by
 Taliban forces in November largely halted those reconstruction efforts.
 Large-scale human rights violations continued to occur, citizens were effectively
 precluded from changing their government peacefully. The warring factions not only
 failed to protect the human rights of civilians, but often wantonly violated those
 rights by specifically targeting noncombatants. The various armed factions were

 often responsible for assassinations, indiscriminate lethal shelling of civilians, tor-
 ture, rapes, looting, and kidnapings for ransom. Masood's troops were responsible
 for looting and rape after they captured the Karte Seh section of Kabul from the
 Taliban and Shi'a forces in March. Dostam's forces systematically looted the north-
 ern cit of Kunduz after taking the city in mid-February. While the Taliban were
 generally acknowledged to have been more successful than other factions in restor-
 ing peace and order to areas under their control, they also were reputed to enforce
 strict Islamic punishments in areas that they controlled-public executions, amputa-
 tions of hands and feet for theft, and restricting women's rights by preventing them
 from working and girls from attendin.g schools. Civil war conditions and the unfet-
 tered actions of competing factions effectively limited the freedoms of speech, press,
 assembly, association, and religion.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Combatants sought to assassinate
 rival commanders and their sympathizers. The perpetrators of these assassinations
 and their motives were difficult to identify, as political motives are often entwined
 with family and tribal feuds, battles over the drug trade, religious zealotry, and per-
 sonal vendettas.
 In February Kabul authorities vowed to investigate the murder of the wife and
 children of Dr. Salem Mohammed Zeray, a former Communist government minister,
 who were found dead in their Kabul home. All had had their throats cut. In its 1995
 report on Afghanistan, Amnesty International (Al) stated that official investigators
 appointed by President Rabbani reportedly confirmed that there had been no signs
 of other injuries or of a robbery. No further information or outcome of the investiga-
 tion was known.
 In March Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of an anti-Rabbani Shi'a faction, was killed
 while in the custody of the Taliban. The Taliban carried out public executions of
 purportedly corrupt officials in certain areas they controlled. In March a mass grave
 with 22 bodies was found south of Kabul; 20 of the deceased were Shi'a Muslims
 of the Hazara ethnic minority. They apparently were killed execution style with
 their hands tied behind their backs and bullets fired into their heads. It was unclear
 who was responsible for the Shi'a deaths.
 In October Syed Mohammad Yousaf, a top Rabbani commander, was reportedly
 murdered as a result of internal strife within the Kabul coalition. Also in that
 month, Mamoor Ghayyur, former governor of northern Baghlan Province and Hezb-
 I-Islani member, and 15 others were ambushed and killed while travelling in
 Baghlan Province. Local press accounts suggested that NIM-allied General Jaffar
 Naderi ordered the assassination.
 In November Abdul Hakim Katawazi, retired Afghan general and Secretary Gen-
 eral of the Council for Understanding and National Unity (CUNUA), was murdered
 outside his Peshawar office. Some members of CUNUA, a moderate political organi-
 zation, favor a role for the former King of Afghanistan in a future Afghan govern-
 ment. The next day, Wakil Wazir Mohammad, a tribal elder and CUNUA supporter
 was shot and killed at his home in a Peshawar suburb. No suspects have been ap-
 prehended by local authorities in either case, althoagh some suspect that the Kabul
 regime or radical Isiamist Hekmatyar's faction was involved.
 b. Disappearance.-Hostage-taking for ransom or political reasons was common.
 There were persistent, credible allegations of hostage taking for ransom in Kabul,
 reportedly by troops loyal to de facto Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Masood. In Au-
 gust the Taliban forced a Russian aircraft enroute to Kabul to land in Kandahar
 and found it to be carrying AK-47 ammunition headed for the Kabul regime. They
 held the Russian crew of seven in detention, but allowed ICRC delegates to visit
 them regularly. The Russian Government appealed to the Taliban to free the crew
 on humanitarian grounds but to no avail. The Taliban demanded an accounting of
 60,000 Afghans who purportedly disappea-ed between 1978 and 1989; they believed
 some were still in the former Soviet Union. The Taliban gave Russian officials a list
 of 6,700 names about whom the Russians promised to seek information. As of year's
 end, the Russian crew had not been released.
 Groups in Russia listed nearly 300 Soviet soldiers who had served in Afghanistan
 as missing in action or prisoners of war. Most were thought to be dead or to have
 voluntarily assimilated into Afghan society. Some allegedly continued to be held
 against their will by their Afghan captors. The Ukrainian Government maintained
 that there are Ukrainian prisoners of war held in Afghan camps.
 There were unconfirmed but persistent reports of girls and young women through-
 out Afghanistan being kidnapped by local commanders. Some of the women were
 
 
 1289
 then forced to marry their kidnappers. Others simply remained missing. To avoid
 this situation, some families sent their daughters to Pakistan. There were also re-
 ports that women have been killed by their male relatives to prevent forced mar-
 riages (see Section 5).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Armed factions reportedly employed torture frequently to extract information from
 prisoners or to break their will. Inmates have been tortured to death. Various fac-
 tions maintained prisons in territories under their control and established torture
 cells in them. According to a press report prisoners in a Panjshir prison in the
 north, which was controlled by de facto Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Masood,
 were routinely beaten, kept awake at night, and fed insufficient and bad food.
 The U.N. Special1Rapporur for Human Right in Afghanistan visited a prison
 in Jalalabad in August. He described prison conditions as difficult; the prisoners
 were given no food. It was the responsibility of prisoners' relatives to provide food
 once a week. Those who had no relatives had to petition the local Shura or rely on
 other inmates. Prisoners live in collective cells.
 The Taliban ruled strictly in the southern and eastern provinces they controlled,
 establishing ad hoc and rudimentary judicial systems. As there was no functioning
 national judicial system, the Taliban imposed their own form of justice based on tra-
 ditional Islamic laws and punishments. Murderers were subjected to public execu-
 tions (see Section L.a.) and thieves had one hand and one foot severed. In February
 the Taliban imposed for the first time in Afghanistan the punishment of amputa-
 tion. Three Afghans convicted of highway robbery by an Islamic court in
 Lashkargah, Helmand province, each had a hand and a foot publicly amputated
 under local anesthesia; the operations were reportedly performed by doctors. Public
 amputation under similar conditions for the crime of theft reportedly was imposed
 by the Taliban Shari'a court in Ghazni province after the accused were caught at-
 tempting to rob a truck driver of goods valued at $280. There were also reports that
 amputations as punishment for severe crimes were carried out in other non-Taliban
 controlled areas.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-With the breakdown of law and order,
 justice was not administered according to formal legal codes and procedures in
 many localities. Little is known about procedures employed during the year for tak-
 ing persons into custody and bringing them to trial. Presumably, practices varied
 considerably among the localities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-With the collapse of a nationwide judicial system,
 many municipal and provincial authorities relied on some form of Shari'a (Islamic)
 law and traditional tribal codes of justice. However, little is known about the imple-
 mentation of these precepts. The administratimentation of entation ofjustice var-
 ied from area to area, and could depend on the whims of the local commanders. Re-
 portedly, one northern commander summarily executed, tortured, and meted out
 punishments without reference to any other authorty.
 According to AI, in the first months of the year, dozens of prisoners received pun-
 ishments, including execution and amputation, ordered by recently establishe Is-
 lamic courts in areas controlled by the Talian. These courts reportedly were hear-
 ing cases, at times in sessions that lasted only a few minutes. Reportediy one such
 court in Kandahar usually consisted of four judges who gathered in a room or court-
 yard. Both witnesses and the accused were brought before the judges to recount tes-
 timony and plead their cases. Prisoners were often brought forward in shackles. The
 court reportedly dealt with all complaints, using traditional Islamic laws and pun-
 ishments as well as traditional tribal customs (see Section 1.c). In cases involving
 murder, convicted prisoners were generally ordered executed by relatives of the vic-
 tim (see Section L.a.), who could instead choose to accept blood money. Decisions of
 the courts were reportedly final.
 In Kandahar the Taliban executed two persons convicted of murder in early 1995.
 The sentences were handed down by a four-member Islamic court headed by
 Maulawi Sayed Mohammed. The executions were performed by the victims' next-of-
 kin using rifles. In May a former army officer of the Communist regime was exe-
 cuted in Shaikhabad (Wardak Province) after being convicted by a Taliban Islamic
 court for murdering two men several days earlier. A relative of one of the murdered
 men performed the public beheading with a sword. Reportedly, northern Pashtun
 tribes residing in nominally Dostam-controlled areas punished severe crimes by am-
 putating hands.
 No firm estimate was available on the number of political prisoners, but a Paki-
 stan-based human rights group estimated that well over 1,000 people were held as
 political prisoners or hostages by armed factions or independent commanders. Ac-
 cording to an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) document issued in
 September, ICRC delegates had access to 2,829 detainees during the first 7 months
 
 
 1290
 of the year, 2 309 of whom were seen for the first time. Delegates made 83 visits
 to 43 places o? detention during the same period.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Famnly, Home, or Correseondence.-
 Intrafactional fighting often resulted in the homes and businesses of civilians being
 invaded by the oppsng forces--whether victor or loser. Armed gunmen acted with
 impunity given the absence of any legal p rotection from the law or a responsive po-
 lice force.In March after capturing the-Karte Seh district in southwestern Kabul
 from the Taliban and anti-RabbaniShi'a forces, Masood's troop went on a rampage,
 systematically looting whole streets and raping women. In one case reported byReu-
 ters, government troops broke a man's arms with shovels and beat his wife when
 he tried to stop them from looting his home. In February, after General Dostam's
 forces took the northern city of unduz, they engaged i widespread, systematic
 looting of the city, including homes, stores, and offices.
 _ g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations qf Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Fighting for ower in Kabul and the provinces continued among the armed
 factions, causing widespread destruct ion and indiscriminate killing. Command and
 control of armed men was often haphazard and informal, a conditon that obscured
 the relationship between the perpetrators of human rights violations and the politi-
 cal leaders with whom they were nominally affiliated.
 The civil war intensified in February when the Taliban, a loose movement of Af-
 [haan religiou-s students and former commanders, advanced to the outskirts of
 aul. They drove former Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekiatyar's forces out of
 southern Kabul and disarmed Shi'a forces allied with Hekmatyar. Rabbani's forces,
 however, repulsed the Taliban advance and the Taliban retreated to positions about
 30 miles south of Kabul. Some of the worst human rights abuses occurred in suth-
 western Kabul in the wake of the retreating Taliban and Shi'a fighters-looting,
 rape, and detention of citizens. Many of the auses were committed bypro-Rabbani
 forces. In November Taliban aircraft bombed residential areas of central Kabul, re-
 portedly killing 39 people and wounding 140.
 An estimated 1,500 people died in violence in Kabul primarily during the fighting
 in March when Masood's forces consolidated power over the capital. In many cases
 civilian deaths were incidental to the military actions of the belligerents, but in
 some cases combatants deliberately targeted civilian areas. In March Taliban com-
 manders reportedlyr admitted having fired rockets at Kabul during the intense fight-
 ing for the capitals southwestern sector. In August the Karte Seh section of Kabul,
 with a largely Hazara Shi'a population, came under rocket fire in two separate at-
 tacks resulting in the deaths o8 people. The Taliban subsequently denied respon-
 sibility.
 n Novembr and December, more than 150 peole died in Kabul due to repeated
 rocketin, shelling, and high-altitude bombing o ve the city, reportedly by  a I an
 forces. The Taliban denied responsibility for civilian casualties, stating they were
 aiming at military targets. Civilian casualties also resulted from government coun-
 teralacks, air raids, and shelling on Taliban positions, particularly around
 Charasyab.
 At the beginning of the year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNH) reported that there were approximately 300,000 internally displaced per-
 sons (IDP's) in campe near Jalalabad and as many as 200,000 living independently
 in and around Jalalabad city. By September the number remaining in the camps
 had fallen to approximately 164,000. Between 25,000 and 27,000 TDPs were re-
 orted to be living in camps in the north in Pul-i-Khumri, Mazar-i-Sharif,
 hibergan, and Hairaton. A large number of Kabulis were also displaced witin thy we
 city, but there were no reliable estimates as to how many.
 The Afghan countryside remaned plagued by an estimated 10 million land mines
 sown during and since the Soviet occupation. With funding from international do-
 nors, the United Nations (U.N.) has organized and tra   inene detection and clear-
 ance teams which operated throughout Afghanistan, and supported mine awareness
 programs for civilians. Nevertheless, the mines will pose a tnat for years to come.
 The laying of new minefields by pro-Rabbani forces of Ismael Khan in Herat, by
 Aroad Shah Masood around Kabul, and to lesser degree by General Dostam, has
 compounded the mine problem.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Spech and Press.-There are no laws effectively providing for free-
 dom of speehi and press, and the nominal government lacked the authority to pro-
 tect these rights. Senior officials of various warring factions allegedly attempted to
 intimidate reporters and influence their reporting. The few newspaprs, all of which
 were published only sporadically, were largely affiliated with different factions.
 There was a pro-Rabbani radio and television service in Kabul. The various regions
 
 
 1291
 
 had their own radio and television stations: former Prime Minister Hekmatyar has
 his own radio and television service near Kabul, as does General Dostam in the
 northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif. The media in Herat came under Taliban control
 when they captured the city in September.
 International journalists in Kabul report that they were routinely pressured by
 the authorities to slant their coverae in favor of the Rabban regime. In September
 the Taliban expelled from Herat a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) journal-
 ist because they believed his reporting had a pro-Rabbani tilt.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assciation.--Civjl war conditions in Kabul
 and the tenuous security situation in much of the country effectively limited Af-
 ghans' freedom of assembly and association. The prohibition against non-Islamic po-
 tical parties was reinforced by President Rabbani's call for Jihad, or holy war,
 against General Dostam and his followers. The President's backers do not view
 Dostam's movement as Islamic.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Af anistan's official name, the Islamic State of Afghani-
 stan, reflects the countrs aderence to Islam as the state religion. Some 85 percent
 of the population is Sunni Muslim, with Shi'a Muslims comprising most of the re-
 mainder. The Shi'a minority number among the most economically disadvantaged
 people in Afghanistan. Some armed groups have been particularly brutal in fighting
 the Shi'a factions. In October Sunni  i an forces reportedly seized the possessions
 of Shi'a families in the Nimrez capital of Zaranj and forced them to leave the city.
 The small number of non-Muslim residents in Afghanistan may practice their
 faith, but may not proselytize, according to an official source. The country's small
 Hindu and Sikh population, which once numbered about 50,000, continued to shrink
 as its members emigrated or took refuge abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Fordqn Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although in principle citizens have the right to travel freely both inside
 and outside the country, their ability to travel within the country was hampered by
 warfare, brigandage, millions of undetected land mines, a road network in a state
 of disrepair, and limited domestic air service (complicated by factional threats to air
 traffic). Despite these obstacles many people continued to travel relatively freely
 with buses plying routes in most parts of the country. However, due to intermittent
 fighting in various areas, international aid agencies often found that their ability
 to travel, work and distribute assistance was hampered. International travel contin-
 ued to be difficult as bth General Dostam and the Talb~an threatened to shoot
 down any planes that overfiew the areas of Afghanistan they controlled without
 their permission.
 Afghans continued to form one of the world's largest refugee populations. Accord-
 ing to the UNHCR, about 2.25 million Afghans remain abroad. Of these, 1.3 million
 are in Iran, 865,000 are in Pakistan, and 28,000 are in Russia. Approximately
 19,000 Afghans reside in parts of the former Soviet Unioa other than Russia. Pai-
 stan claimed an additional 500,000 unregistered Afghan refugees in its territory.
 Over 3.8 million Afghan refugees have been repatriated since 1988, with over 1.5
 million returning to Afghanistan in the peak year of 1992. According to the
 UNHCR, more than 391,000 Afghans repatriated in 1995, 153,000 from Paistan
 and 238,000 from Iran. In November the UNHCR border facility at Islam Qaleh re-
 opened after a month's closure as the border with Iran was sealed due to hostilities
 in the area.
 According to the UNHCR, of the 100,000 to 120,000 Tajik refugees who fled to
 northern Afghanistan, only 18,000 remained in January; most were repatriated in
 1994. From January to October, an additional 523 were repatriated. Tajiks repa-
 triating from Sakhi camp, in areas under the control of General Dostam, were ale
 to repatriate freely. Those in and around Kunduz, in areas controlled by pro-
 Rabban forces, were more restricted by local authorities and less accessible to the
 UNHCR. Pressures from the Tajik opposition limited repatriation as well.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Rght of Czens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The continuing violent struggle for political power among the three major armed
 factions (including the nominal Government) precluded citizens from changing their
 government or form of government peacefully and democratically. The authorities
 in Kabul, nominally a coalition headed by President Burhanuddin Rabbani, re-
 mained in power with the military backing of de facto Defense Minister Ahad
 Shah Masood. In March Nai Mohammadis Movement of the Islamic Revolution,
 one of the small coalition parties, resigned from the Government, leaving only 2 of
 the 9 original political parties of the coalition government which was established in
 1993. The Kabul regime controlled only the capital and 4 or 5 of Afghanistan's 32
 provinces. General Dostam's forces controlled several northern prvnces, and the
 
 
 1292
 Taliban movement held sway in at least 16 provinces in southern central, and west-
 ern Afghanistan. Three eastern provinces were ruled by a neutral governor. In most
 areas, the local Shura or Council was the most influential governing body.
 In November President Rabbani told Mahmoud Mestiri, the U.N. Special Envoy
 for Afghanistan, that he was willing to transfer power to a 28-member interim coun-
 cil, comprised largely of pro-Rabbani elements-an offer rejected by the Taliban. De-
 spite the determined efforts of the U.N. Special Mission to get the factions to agree
 to a cease-fire and an interim governing mechanism, no such agreement has
 emerged. The Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) also tried to bring the Af-
 ghan factions together. After the fall of Herat to the Taliban in early September,
 the U.N. and the OIC renewed their separate efforts to unite the factions. Efforts
 were under way at year's end to promote greater cooperation-both military and po-
 litical-among all the opposition factions to oust Rabbani from power, but these
 were not successful.
 Public response to Taliban rule in Herat was reserved. In other areas, the popu-
 lace long-wearied by the disorder caused by unrelenting fighting, welcomed te
 Taliban, who disarmed the warlords, restored some law and order, and halted the
 practice of frequent road tolls. Some Afghans expressed support for the return of
 the former king, Zahir Shah in some transitional arrangement. Although women in
 Afghanistan tended to be denied significant roles in public life, greater freedom in
 Kabul and in northern and western Afghanistan provided some limited respite from
 these traditional strictures. For example, a few women served as desk officers in the
 Kabul regime's Foreign Ministry, in the Protocol Department, as doctor.- at hos-
 pitals, and as administrators at Kabul University. The U.N. Special Rapporteur for
 Human Rights in Afghanistan noted a high level of female involvement, especially
 in areas of medical care and education.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Afghan League of Human Rights operated outside of the country in Pakistan;
 it produced its annual report there. The Cooperation Center for Afghanistan is an
 Afghan nongovernmental orgnization (NGO) which operated in both Pakistan and
 Afghanistan. It produced in Peshawar a monthly newsletter on the Afghan human
 rights situation. The civil war and lack of security made it difficult for human rights
 organizations to monitor the situation inside the country. In November two rep-
 resentatives from Human Rights Watch visited 4 Tajik refugee camps, 3 in Masood-
 controlled Takhar and Kunduz provinces and one near Mazar-I-Sharif in Dostam-
 controlled Balkh p rovince.
 In May a new U.N. Special Rapprteur for Human Rights in Afghanistan was ap-
 pointed allowing the death of the previous rapporteur. In AugustDr. Choong-Hyun
 Paik visited Kabul, Jalalabad, Mazur-I-Sharif, and Islamabad and Peshawar in
 Pakistan to discuss the human rights situation with officials, political leaders,
 NGO's, refugees, ordinary families, and others. In October he submitted his report
 to the U.N.     a   p concluded that "human suffering of considerable gravity per-
 sists in the form of murder, disappearances, and infliction of conditions that cause
 physical destruction, thus depriving people of fundamental human rights such as
 the right to life, the right to be free from torture, and the right to be free from cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment."
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There are no Constitutional provisions which prohibit discrimination based on
 race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status. It is not known whether
 specific laws prohibit discrimination; local custom and practices generally prevail.
 Discrimination against women varies from area to area, depending on the local lead-
 ership's attitude towards work and education for women. Traditionally, the minority
 Shi'a faced discrimination from the majority Sunni population. There was more ac-
 ceptance of the disabled as the number of people maimed by landmines increased.
 Women.-As lawlessness and inter-factional fighting continued, beatings, rapes,
 and the killing of women continued to occur. In January 13 armed gunmen said to
 be affiliated with Hekmatyar's faction, reportedly attacked a Tajik refugee camp
 near the town of Kunduz in the north. They raped 13 Tajik women before killinf
 them. In March when Masood's troops captured the Karte Seh district of Kabu,
 they reportedly engaged in widespread rape. Medical workers said that they knew
 of at least 6 rapes and 2 attempted rapes. Social taboos against revealing rapes are
 so strong that it is impossible to know how many rape victims there actually were.
 Afghan custom and tradition imposes limits on women's activities beyond the
 home. Under the Communist regime of the 1980's, a growing number of women,
 
 
 1293
 particularly in urban areas, worked outside the home in nontraditional roles. This
 trend was reversed when the Communists were ousted in 1992, and in 1995 women
 were increasingly precluded from public service, although some women continued to
 work as teachers and nurses in some areas. In conservative areas, many women ap-
 peared in public only if dressed in a burkha (an all-encompassing head-to-toe gar-
 ment with a mesh veil for the face).
 In late 1994, when the Taliban movement began to take control of provinces in
 the southwest, they banned the employment of women and prohibited girls from at-
 tending school. A strict dress code for women was also enforced. In September, when
 the Taliban captured Herat, a key provincial capital in the west, the movement
 again banned female employment and female school attendance. UNICEF publicly
 called on the Taliban to rescind these decisions. A UNICEF spokesperson said that
 local authorities did not allow women to work in public positions, except for health
 care workers. Schools were reopened, but female teachers and girls were not allowed
 to enter the schools. An Afghan woman in Herat employed by UNICEF was not al-
 lowed to return to her job. UN programs for women and girls were also suspended.
 However, Taliban authorities in Kandahar assured a high ranking U. visitor that
 education for girls would be permitted within an (undefined) Islamic framework.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) was given permission to open a nursing
 school for women in Kandahar and was actively recruiting students.
 In April the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghani-
 stan (UNOCHA) canceled a donor visit to Kandahar province because the Taiban-
 controlled Shura (Governing Council) refused to meet with female diplomats and in-
 sisted that they wear a burkha to visit project sites. This was the first time that
 female diplomats encountered difficulties visiting Afghanistan based on their gen-
 der. Several weeks later, female diplomats were permitted to visit Kandahar, as
 long as their heads were covered, and they did meet with local authorities.
 In June the Nangarhar Shura reinforced its ban on women working in Jalalabad
 City, and ordered all female employees except girls' teachers and female health pro-
 fessionals sent home. Female employees of the provincial government, except teach-
 ers, have been at home since October 1994.
 A national women's conference was held in Kabul in July which discussed wom-
 en's issues and planned for the Beijing Conference on Women. In August the
 Rabbani government canceled at the last minute its delegation's participation at the
 conference on the grounds that its agenda was anti-Islamic and a threat to Afghan
 religious and cultural traditions. However, about 10 Afghan women from Europe
 and elsewhere attended the NGO forum held concurrently with the Beijing ton-
 ference.
 Children.-Local administrative bodies and international assistance organizations
 undertook to look out for children's welfare to the extent possible. A nutritional sur-
 vey by aid agencies showed that 40 percent of the children of Kabul suffered from
 malnutrition. The general disruption of health services countrywide due to the civil
 war put many young people atUgrave risk. Local authorities in all parts of Afghani-
 stan have supported UNICEF/HO mass vaccination campaigns. The disruption of
 education due to the fighting throughout Afghanistan has caused a generation of
 school children to miss all of their schooling, reportedly raising illiteracy levels
 above 75 percent.
 People ?,ith lDisabilities.-It was not known whether the nominal Government
 took any measures to protect the rights of the mentally and physically disabled or
 to mandate accessibility for them. Victims of land mines were a major focus of inter-
 national humanitarian relief organizations, which devoted resources to providing
 prostheses, medical treatment, and rehabilitation therapy to amputees. There was
 more public acceptance of people with disabilities because of the prevalence of the
 maimed due to landmines. The U.N. Development Program conducted a million dol-
 lar project to strengthen comprehensive community-based rehabilitation services for
 diabled Afghans. The ICRC and some NGO's were actively involved in programs
 for people ith disabilities throughout Afghanistan.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Little was known about labor laws and practices in
 Afghanistan. There were no reports of labor rallies or strikes. Labor rights were not
 defined, in the context of the breakdown of governmental authority, and there was
 no effective central authority to enforce them. Many of Kabul's industrial workers
 were unemployed due to the destruction or abandonment of the city's minuscule
 manufacturg base.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Afghanistan lacks a tradition
 of genuine labor-management bargaining. There were no known labor courts or
 other mechanisms for resolving labor disputes.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-No information was available on
 government edicts regarding forced or compulsory labor. There were no confirmed
 reports of alleged forced-work road projects.
 d. Minimum Age or Employment of Children.-There was no evidence that the
 Government was able to enforce labor laws, if they existed, relating to the employ-
 ment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-There was no available information regarding
 a statutory minimum wage or the enforcement of safe labor practices. Many workers
 were apparently allotted time off regularly for prayers and observance of religious
 holidays.
