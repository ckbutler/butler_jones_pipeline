 URUGUAY
 Uruguay is a constitutional republic governed by an elected President and a bi-
 cameral legislature with an independent judicial branch. Its longstanding demo-
 cratic tradition was interrupted by 12 years of military rule from 1973 to 1985. On
 March 1, 1990, following a free and fair election in November 1989, power was
 transferred from one elected civilian president to another for the first time since the
 return to constitutionalgovernment in 1985. Political parties, the press, labor
 unions, private interest groups, and other nongovernmental groups function freely,
 and political debate is vigorous and unrestricted.
 The small military establishment, consisting of an army, an air force, and a navy,
 is under the supervision of the Ministry of Defense. The military does not particl-
 pate in domestic security matters unless ordered to do so by the civilian authorities.
 Domestic security and public safety matters are under the jurisdiction of the Inte-
 rior Ministry, which administers all the countrys police departments. The police
 were again responsible for physical abuse of detainees in 1993.

 A middle income country with a per-capita gross domestic product of $3,900 in
 1993, Uruguay's economy is heavily depenent on agricultural exports and
 agroindustry. The economy grew by 7.9 percent in 1992 and was projected to grow
 by 4 to 5 percent in 1993. The economy is a mixture of private enterprise and state
 entities- private property rights are respected. The current administration at-
 Lempted to carry out a program of modernization and reform of the economy in
 order to improve its competitiveness in world markets. Privatization, a key element
 of the pro am, was set back when a proposal to privatize the telephone company
 was roundy defeated in a referendum in December 1992.
 Uruguayans enjoy a broad range of individual rights and liberties. However, re-
 ports of police abuse of detainees persist, and few-if any-police have been con-
 victed and punished for such abuse. Prison conditions remain generally poor, but
 some improvements were made in the country's largest prison. Increased attention
 to the issue has publicized the high level of violence against women. The small Afro.
 Uroguayan community faces social, economic, and cultural impediments to advance-
 ment.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No cases of politically motivated kill-
 ing were reported.
 b. Disappearance.-No known or reported incidents of politically motivated abduc-
 tions or disappearances occurred in 1993.
 The 1986 Expiry Law, which was endorsed by a general referendum in 1989,
 blocks investigations into killings, torture, and disappearances which occurred dur-
 ing the military regime. In March the Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights, an arm of the Organization of American States, found this law incompatible
 with treaty obligations under the American Convention on Human Rights. The Uru-
 guayan Government strongly disputed the report and there is very little will among
 politicians or the general public to reopen this subject.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits brutal treatment of prisoners. However, there were re-
 ports of physical abuse of detainees by police. Physical abuse is most often alleged
 in the hours immediately following an arrest. Minors are thought to be particularly
 vulnerable to abuse.
 In March, after having confessed to 14 robberies, a detainee was taken before a
 Montevideo judge for processing. He retracted his confession and charged that the
 police had tortured him with an electrical device. The 4udge ordered an immediate
 search of the police station, and the device was found. F. our policemen were charged
 with personal injury and suspended from their jobs. The internal investigation was
 still in progress at year's end.
 In 1992 the Interior Ministry established an internal section responsible for mon-
 itoring police conduct. The judicial and parliamentary branches of government also
 investigate specific allegations of abuse. Nonetheless, human rights monitors insist
 that many cases of abuse go unreported and that police are seldom convicted and
 punished for such abuse.
 Conditions in prisons and juvenile detention facilities generally remained poor.
 Complaints commonly voiced by government and independent human rights inves-
 tigators included delapidated buildings and equipment, poor sanitary conditions, in-
 adequately staffed and equipped on-site clinics, and a lack of training, educational,
 and recreational opportunities. A shortage of resources and to some extent poor pris-
 on administration hamper improvement. One local group that monitors prison condi-
 tions cited some improvement in the country's largest prison but said that condi-
 tions in prisons outside the capital remain poor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires the police to
 have a written warrant issued by a judge before they can make an arrest. The only
 exception is when the accused is apprehended during commission of a crime. The
 Constitution also guarantees the accused the right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention and   ires that the detaining authority explain the legal
 grounds for the detention. A detainee may be held incommunicado by the police for
 24 hours before being presented to a judge, at which time he or she has the right
 to counsel. If the detainee cannot afford a lawyer, a public defender is appointed.
 The judicial process must begin within 48 hours; failure to comply has led to the
 release of accused persons. If the crime carries a penalty of at least 2 years in pris-
 on, the accused person is confined during the judge's investigation of the charges
 unless the authorities agree to release the person on bail, or until the case is closed.
 These constitutional previsions are generally respected in practice.
 
 
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, headed by a Supreme Court, which supervises the work of the lower courts.
 There is a parallel military court system that operates under a military justice code.
 Two military justices sit on the Supreme Court but participate only in cases involv-
 ing the military. Military justice is applied to civilians only during a state of war
 or insurrection. The independence of the judiciary is well respected in practice.
 All criminal trials must open with a public statement of the charge by the pros-
 ecutor or the complainant. Trial proceedings were formerly based on written argu-
 ments, which were not normally made public, but the defense attorney had access
 to all documents that formed part of the written record. Oral argument, introduced
 in 1.990 and now increasingly used in the Uruguayan system, has resulted in a more
 open and transparent legal process. Under Uruguayan law, there is no provision
 against self-incrimination, and the defendant may be compelled to answer any ques-
 tions posed by the judge. All convictions may be appealed by the defense attorney
 or prosecutor to a higher court which may acquit the person of the crime, confirm
 the conviction, or reduce or increase the sentence.
 Uruguay has no political prisoners and does not punish political activity.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects the right to privacy. It states that the home, absolutely invio-
 lable at night, may be entered and searched only with a judicial warrant during the
 day. Protection for private papers and correspondence is equally strong, and a war-
 rant is required for confiscation. These rights and safeguards are generally re-
 sfpected in practice. In August, however, the Minister of Defense resigned after some
 of his subordinates were placed under house arrest for electronic eavesdropping
 without his authorization. The subordinates were purportedly trying to discover who
 was responsible for a series of 1992 bombings, allegedly carried out by a radical fac-
 tion within the armed forces.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press. All elements of the political spectrum freely express their viewpoints in
 both the print and broadcast media. Montevideo has 8 daily newspapers and 6 im-
 portant weeklies; there are approximately 100 weekly and a few daily newspapers
 elsewhere.
 Montevideo has one government-affiliated and three commercial television sta-
 tions. There are about 110 radio stations and 20 television stations in the country.
 A 1989 law stipulates that expression and communication of thoughts and opinions
 are entirely free, within the limits contained in the Constitution and the law, and
 outlines methods of responding to "inexact or aggravating information." The same
 law calls for from 3 months to 2 years of imprisonment for "knowingly divulging
 false news that causes a grave disturbance to the public peace or a grave prejudice
 to economic interests of the State" or for "insulting the nation, the State, or their
 powers."
 In June this law was used to prosecute three reporters for slandering the Presi-
 dent; they were sentenced to 6 months' probation. In November a retired general
 was sentenced to 8 months' probation after a newspaper published his "open letter
 to the President" criticizing cuts in military retirement pay. This law, and its inter-
 mittent application, serve as notice that there are certain limits on freedom of ex-
 pression and that the limits will be enforced.
 The National University is autonomous, and academic freedom is generally re-
 spected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law protects freedom of
 assembly and association.
 Formerly banned groups, such as the Tupamaros (a terrorist movement active in
 the 1960's and early 1970's), freely organize and express their opinions. Public
 marche.s and demonstrations are allowed with permits from the Ministry of the In-
 terior and occur without official harassment or intimidation.
 c. Freedom of Religion. -Freedom of religion, provided for by the Constitution, is
 respected in practice. Most Uruguayans who practice a religion are Roman Catholic.
 Members of other religious groups exercise their faiths unhindered, and mission-
 aries are free to roselytize. Uruguayans who profess agnosticism or atheism ex-
 press their views freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Internal and foreign travel and emigration are unrestricted. Uruguay-
 ans who left the country during the military regime and wish to return are encour-
 aged to do so. All of the prominent political figures exiled by the military regime
 have returned.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Uroguayan citizens have the right and ability peacefully to change their govern-
 ment. Uruguay is a multiparty democracy with mandatory universal suffrage for
 those 18 years of age or older. Voting is not restricted by race, sex, religion, or eco-
 nomic status. The Colorado party, the National (Blanco) party, the Broad Front coa-
 lition, and the New Space coalition are the four major political groupings. Each al-
 lows ideological divisions within the party, and each such division may field its own
 slate of candidates in general elections. The electoral system combines a primary
 and a general election in a double simultaneous vote. Each party fields different
 lists of candidates; in essence, voters express a preference for a party and for a list
 of candidates rather than for an individual candidate.
 The winning list of the party that receives the most votes wins the presidency and
 a proportion of seats in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies corresponding to the
 percentage of votes that the party as a whole received. A party therefore may run
 multiple presidential candidates, each with his or her own slate of legislative can-
 didates. National and provincial elections are held simultaneously every 5 years.
 Blacks and women face de facto impediments to participation in politics and employ-
 ment in government (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups, some of which could not operate openly under mili-
 ta r rule, now function freely and without restriction. A prominent local human
 rights  oup, Service for Peace and Justice (SERPAJ), was legalized in early 1985
 aftr operating underground for 2 years during the military regime. Another group,
 the Legal and Social Institute of Uruguay, consists of lawyers and social workers
 who focus on juridical aspects of human rights cases. Both groups began by inves-
 tigating killing, torture, and disappearances that occurred during the military re-
 gime. They now investigate and report on many other aspects of human rights, in-
 cluding police abuse, prison conditions, and rights of women and children.
 The Government is open to inquiries from such organizations and does not restrict
 the activities of human rights investigators.
 The Government has also fully complied with U.N. Human Rights Commission in-
 quiries dating from the military regime period and is a strong supporter of, and par-
 ticipant in, human rights activities in international forums such as the United Na-
 tions and the Organization of American States.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination based on race, sex, religion, language, or social status is prohibited
 by the Constitution and by law. A law passed in 1989 prohibits discrimination
 against the disabled. Despite these prohibitions, discrimination based upon sex and
 race exist.
 Women.-Uruguayan women enjoy equality under the law but face a number of
 forms of discrimination stemming from traditional attitudes and practices. Recent
 surveys show that the work force remains segregated by gender and race. Women
 make up about a third of the work force but tend to be concentrated in lower paying
 jobs. They attend the National University in large numbers and often pursue profes-
 sional careers. About 50 percent of Uruguay's judges are women, but women are
 underrepresented in other professions such as engineering or architecture. Women
 are also found at the highest levels of the Uruguayan private or public sectors, but
 they remain largely marginalized from mainstream politics and underrepresented in
 most important government and political party offices. Conscious of these problems,
 the Government established the National Institute for Women to collect data on
 women's issues and to address these issues more effectively.
 Uruguayan society is increasingly sensitive to the question of violence against
 women. Each year, the police process about 1,700 domestic violence cases (including
 violence against children). Nongovernmental organizations estimate, however, that
 the actual number of cases is probably 10 times that figure. Rape statistics have
 increased sharply, possibly because victims are more willing to report the crime. The
 Interior Ministry has a women's division in the police force concerned exclusively
 with crimes against women and minors. The Penal Code mandates prison sentences
 from 3 months to 3 years for the crime of "private violence." Many women are un-
 able to make and sustain complaints under this law, however, especially when they
 continue to reside with their partners. Two private shelters for battered women
 have been opened in Montevideo. Some private women's rights groups offer counsel-
 
 
 ing services, and the Montevideo municipality operates a 24-hour hot line for vic-
 tims of domestic violence.
 Children.-The Government is committed to protecting the rights and welfare of
 children. There are no patterns of government abuse, although there continue to be
 some reports of police abuse of detained minors. In 1992 approximately 10.5 percent
 of the national budget was designated for preuniversity education; another 1.8 per-
 cent was allocated to the National Institute for Minors, which has responsibility for
 most other programs concerning the welfare of minors. A local human rights group
 estimates that there are approximately 1,000 street children in Montevideo. There
 are another 100 in juvenile institutions. These institutions offer very little in the
 way of education, rehabilitation, or training. An estimated 60 percent of adult pris-
 oners have formerly passed through the juvenile justice system.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Approximately 6 percent of Uruguay's popu-
 lation, or 180,000 people, belong to the country's black minority. Blacks are
 underrepresented among elite groups, particularly the bureaucratic, political, and
 academic sectors of society. One report put the number of black university grad-
 uates at 65    and black   professionals at fewer than   50. They   lack  the
 educationalopportunities and social and political connections necessary for entry
 into these groups. Black leaders say that 75 percent of employed black women work
 as maids. Most citizens do not believe that discrimination against minorities is a
 problem in Uruguay, and the Government has not addressed this issue.
 People with Disabilities.-There are approximately 250,000 persons with disabil-
 ities in Uruguay. A law covering the rights of the disabled was passed in 1989 but
 had not been implemented by the end of 1993. The law is mostly declarative, i.e.,
 it does not stipulate specific remedial measures or sanctions for not complying with
 these measures. There is legislation requiring that 4 percent of public sector jobs
 be reserved for the disabled. However, only the municipality of Montevideo has
 made efforts to comply with this law.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution guarantees the right of workers to
 organize freely and encourages the formation of trade unions. Civil servants and
 employees of state-run enterprises, as well as private enterprise workers, may join
 unions. An estimated 17 percent of the work force is unionized. Labor unions are
 independent of government and political party control.
 Uruguayan workers, including some civil servants, have the right to strike. Par-
 liament did not approve proposed legislation that would have required workers to
 vote by secret ballot on whether to strike. The Labor Ministry office which assists
 in mediating collective and individual labor disputes is increasingly attempting to
 stay out of private sector negotiations; members of the Parliament's labor commis-
 sions occasionally mediate labor disputes on an ad hoc basis.
 There was significant strike activity in 1993, including one in the construction in-
 dustry which lasted almost 3 months. The Government may legally compel workers
 to work during a strike if their work is considered an essential service. An essential
 service is defined as one whose interruption "could cause a grave prejudice or risk
 provoking suffering to part or all of the society." While no institutionalized mecha-
 nism exists for resolving complaints against employers, discrimination by employers,
 including arbitrary dismissals for union activity, generally is prohibited. In 1992
 rubber workers' unions and the Inter-Union Workers Assembly-National Workers
 Association (PIT-CNT) filed a complaint with the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) alleging that the Government had not investigated the dismissal of trade
 union officials following a strike. In May 1993, after examining the complaint and
 the Government's response, the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association con-
 cluded that the case did not merit further consideration. Its conclusion noted
 Uruguay's lack of statutory provisions in this area and said that, while the current
 system of protection against antiunion practices "does not infringe ILO Convention
 No. 98," it "could be improved in so far as accelerating the procedure."
 There are no restrictions on a union's right to affiliate with international trade
 union bodies. The largest trade union confederation, the PIT-CNT, is by choice not
 officially affiliated with any of the three world federations. Many individual unions
 are affiliated with international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining ceased
 during military rule. From the return of civilian rule until March 1992, industrial
 contracts were negotiated on a sector-wide rather than a plant-by-plant basis, under
 the auspices of a salary council, a tripartite organization composed of representa-
 tives from government, labor, and management. The government representatives
 played an active role in mediating these negotiations in some sectors; in others, they
 functioned more as observers. Since March 1992, contracts may be negotiated on a
 
 
 plant-wide or a sector-wide basis, with or without government mediation, as the
 parties wish. Union leaders believe that the government presence ensures contracts
 will be fulfilled and generally object to reducing it in contract negotiations.
 Workers employec[in Uruguay's five special export zones are fully covered by all
 labor legislation. There are no unions in any of these zones, but there are as yet
 relatively few workers in traditionally organizable occupations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Fored or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and there is no evidence of its existence.
 d. Minimum Age for Empoyment of Children.---Children are protected by a Child
 Labor Code, violations of which are punishable by fines of up to $500. Children as
 young as 12 may be employed if they have a special government work permit. Chil-
 dren under the age of 18 may not perform   angerous, fati ing, or night work
 apart from domestic employment. Salaries and hours for children are controlled
 more strictly than those for adults. Children over the age of 16 may sue in court
 for payment of wages, and children have the legal right to dispose of their own in-
 come. Children working in the expanding informal sector as street vendors or others
 with no fixed place of work or in the agrarian sector are generally less strictly regu-
 lated and receive lower pay.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A legislated minimum monthly wage is in ef-
 fect in both the public and private sectors and appears to be effectively enforced.
 The minimum wage is adjusted whenever public sector wages are adjusted, usually
 once every 4 months. The minimum wage as of September 1 was $86 (365 pesos).
 It functions more as an index for calculating wage rates than as a true measure
 of minimum subsistence levels and would not provide a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family.
 The standard workweek is 48 hours for a 6-day week. The Basic Labor Law stipu-
 lates 48-hour weeks for industrial workers and 44-hour weeks for industrial office
 workers and commercial personnel with a 36-hour break each week. This law is
 generally adhered to and adequately enforced. Industrial workers receive overtime
 compensation for work in excess of 48 hours. Workers are entitled to 20 days of paid
 vacation after a year of employment.
 Workers are protected by legislation regulating health and safety conditions; it is
 enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security in a generally effective man-
 ner. Some labor regulations cover urban, industrial workers more adequately than
 rural and agricultural workers.
