 GUINEA-BISSAU
 On November 14, 1980 President Luis Cabral was toppled
 from office in a coup led by Prime Minister Joao Bernardo
 Vieira. Since the coup all power has been concentrated in
 his hands and that of the revolutionary council. The new
 ruler accused the deposed president of responsibility for
 hundreds of executions of political opponents during his six
 year rule. Reporters and diplomats have been taken to
 several mass grave sites. These observers could not deter-
 mine when these deaths occurred or the circumstances surround-
 ing them. This is the first allegation of atrocities to be
 made against Cabral.
 Guinea-Bissau is a one party state. That party -- the
 African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape
 Verde (PAIGC) -- led the war for independence from Portugal.
 It has been the vehicle through which the political process
 operates.
 Guinea-Bissau is a poor country and the government has
 devoted its energies to bringing about economic and so-
 cial development for its people. The government empha-
 sizes cooperative organizations, both for agriculture and
 commerce. The economy is mixed and the right of private
 ownership recognized.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution of Guinea-Bissau has no provision relating
 to torture. There have been no reports of torture during
 the year.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment. Capital punishment is
 authorized but there have been no executions this year.
 Prison conditions are primitive. Prisons are overcrowded,
 sanitary conditions inadequate, and nutrition substandard.
 Most prisoners are permitted visitors, and family members
 frequently bring food and other necessities.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no allegations of people being abducted,
 secretly detained or held in clandestine detention by
 members of official entities in 1980.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution (Article 18) guarantees the right not to be
 detained, arrested or condemned other than according to law.
 However, Article 22 denies political rights and fundamental
 liberties to those who "encourage colonialism, imperialism,
 racism, or tribalism." There is no information on the exact
 number of political prisoners, but the total is not thought
 to be very large. In the wake of the November coup, deposed
 
 
 117
 President Cabral and some supporters were detained. In
 December 1980 the new government declared an amnesty for
 political prisoners under detention prior to the November
 14 coup. The exact number of people released was not made
 public, but most of them are believed to have been involved in
 the 1978 abortive coup.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution (Article 18) recognizes the right of a
 defendant to a defense. There are no private attorneys
 and the state provides lawyers for those who require legal
 representation. Separate civilian and military courts
 exist. The civilian courts are essentially a continuation
 of those under Portuguese colonial rule. The supreme court
 is the highest civilian court court of appeal. Regional
 military courts have jurisdiction over military, militia and
 security personnel on military missions. The supreme court
 (also known as the war court) has jurisdiction over more
 serious crimes such as acts against state security, attempts
 against the lives of PAIGC members, treason and piracy. It
 is also an appeals court for the regional military courts.
 The death penalty may be appealed only to the council of
 state. There have been no known cases this year where
 defendants were denied public trials.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution (Article 19) guarantees the inviolability
 of domicileg This right is believed to have been respected
 generally.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The government has placed economic and social development
 among its highest priorities. The constitution (Article 14)
 specifically mentions that employment and education are the
 basic rights of a citizen. Rapid forward movement towards
 these objectives has been hindered by the ravages left
 behind from the long war against the Portuguese, by a defi-
 cient infrastructure, and by a lack of natural resources.
 Before the war the country was self-sufficient in rice, the
 basic foodstuff, but today it imports tens of thousands of
 tons.
 Guinea Bissau's population is almost one million. Over 85
 percent of the population live in rural areas at marginal
 levels. Per capita gross domestic product is $120.00. Life
 expectancy is 37 years for males and 40 years for females.
 Adult literacy is low, only 5 percent for males and 3
 percent for females.
 Property is usually owned by the state or, according to
 tradition, by the local village; yet the right to private
 property also exists. There is virtually no racial or
 ethnic discrimination. Sexual discrimination is prohibited
 (article 16 of the constitution) but, in fact, society
 remains very much male-dominated, especially in rural areas.
 It is an avowed objective of the government to promote
 equality of women.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Article 17 of the constitution guarantees these rights as
 provided by law. Freedom of speech, press and assembly is
 limited. Direct criticism of the government and official
 leaders is not permitted. Differences with government
 policies, especially in the economic realm, have been voiced
 on occasion. At the village level, debates are frequently
 sharp and there is considerable freedom of expression. In
 the national assembly differences of opinion have occa-
 sionally been expressed on basic issues, especially those
 dealing with economic matters. The press and radio are
 government-controlled. Criticism of certain government
 programs has appeared from time to time. There is no
 religious discrimination. The majority of the population is
 animist, but other religions exist and their worship is
 unimpeded. Religious-sponsored missions also operate
 secular activities throughout the country.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are few restrictions on the freedom of movement within
 the country or on travel abroad. The principal constraints
 for foreign travel appear administrative, primarily the lack
 of foreign exchange. There are no known bars to emigration.
 Since the country's borders are not rigidly controlled,
 there is believed to be a certain degree of continuous
 unrecorded cross-border movement. There are no significant
 refugee groups in Guinea-Bissau. The government, sensitive
 to its peoples' own past history of receiving haven in
 neighboring countries, is generally sympathetic to the
 principle of asylum. There is no sexual or other discrimi-
 nation with regard to travel.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Guinea-Bissau is a one-party state, the single political
 organization being the Party for the Independence of Guinea-
 Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC). After the November 14 coup,
 the new rulers dissolved the National Popular Assembly, the
 council of state and the council of ministers.  Power is
 concentrated in the hands of the coup leader Vieira and the
 revolutionary council. The new rulers have not yet announced
 how the governmental political institutions will be restructed.
 There are eight regional political subdivisions, each
 governed by officials of a regional council who provide
 public order, local administration and promote economic and
 social development. All citizens over the age of 15 years
 are eligible to vote (Article 25 of the constitution). While
 many citizens are not active in the electoral process, many
 do debate important issues at the tabanca (village) level.
 Most office holders are PAIGC adherents, but some important
 offices are filled by individuals who do not belong to the
 government party. The acting president of the national
 assembly is a woman. Although women do not occupy many
 prominent positions at the national and regional level, in
 the villages they constitute almost half of the PAIGC
 membership by party regulation.

 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no known requests by outside groups to
 investigate human rights conditions in Guinea-Bissau, and the
 attitude of the government to such investigations is not
 known.
