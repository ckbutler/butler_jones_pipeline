 ALBANIA*
 Albania, which proclaims itself a People's Socialist Republic,
 is a one-party state ruled by a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship.
 Ramiz Alia, who officially replaced long-time dictator Enver
 Hoxha as Albania's leader in 1985, exercises personal
 leadership through the 140,000-member Communist party known as
 the Albanian Party of Labor (APL). Internationally, he has
 pursued a policy of cautiously expanding diplomatic, cultural,
 and commercial links abroad, especially with Balkan and
 Western European states.
 A large, effective security service, the Sigurimi, assists the
 APL in maintaining repressive controls over the Albanian
 people, who are permitted only very limited civil and
 political rights.
 Albania has a centrally controlled command economy under which
 the State owns the means of production, and the Government
 directs all significant economic activity. Within a strategy
 of economic self-reliance, the Government emphasizes a policy
 of rapid industrialization and development. In recent years,
 however, the rate of economic growth has declined. Many
 agricultural production targets were not met in 1988.
 Information on internal conditions within Albania is limited.
 Nevertheless, it is known that a limited number of
 restrictions on everyday life have been relaxed somewhat under
 Alia. Although the Albanian population continues to be
 isolated from foreign influences, the Government now tacitly
 allows citizens to receive foreign broadcasts from Italy,
 Greece, and Yugoslavia. The Government has liberalized visa
 issuance for tourists from most Western countries and allowed
 a limited number of its own citizens to visit neighboring
 countries in'tour groups. In other areas, significant human
 rights violations, corroborated by private international
 organizations and refugees, continue to occur. The Government
 has repeatedly refused to cooperate with any international
 organization which investigates human rights complaints.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political killing
 No evidence came to light of political killings by the
 authorities during 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no recent information available on whether
 disappearances occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The criminal code prohibits and provides punishment for the
 use of physical or psychological force during investigations.
 *The United States has not had diplomatic relations with
 Albania since 1939. Therefore, it is difficult to comment
 authoritatively on conditions in Albania.
 
 
 973
 ALBANIA
 Nevertheless, former political prisoners have often reported
 that they were beaten or otherwise ill-treated during
 investigative proceedings to force them to make confessions.
 Although some of the worst abuses of the past may have ended,
 there continue to be allegations that Albanian investigators
 resort to threats and beatings to obtain confessions or
 collaboration. In the absence of independent means of
 investigation, it is difficult to corroborate such reports.
 In the past, private international humanitarian organizations
 have reported harsh prison conditions in Albania, including a
 severe hard-labor regime with inadequate food and clothing,
 long-term solitary confinement, cramped cells without room to
 lie down, and unheated, unfurnished cells lacking any sanitary
 facilities. The Burrel prison and Spac and Ballsh labor
 camps, in particular, have been noted for their harsh
 conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that no one may be arrested without
 court or prosecutorial approval or be sentenced to jail
 without a court verdict or for an act which is not a crime.
 The criminal code, however, is explicitly ideological and
 officially characterized as a "weapon in the class struggle."
 Its provisions defining political offenses are loosely
 formulated, allowing the courts to interpret them broadly to
 punish whomever the regime desires-
 The criminal code lists 34 crimes, 12 of which are political
 offenses, for which the death sentence may be imposed. Among
 these are such nonviolent political offenses as: unauthorized
 departure or "flight" from the State, agitation and propaganda
 against the State, creation of a counterrevolutionary
 organization or participation therein, concealment of a person
 who commits a crime against the State, activity against the
 revolutionary movement of the working class, and refusal to
 carry out a duty or coercing others to refuse. Amnesty
 International (AI) reports that it is not known whether any
 death sentences were imposed or executions carried out.
 The criminal code also provides that banishment (generally to
 a state farm or enterprise) or internment may be imposed
 administratively, without trial, for up to 5 years on persons
 whom the authorities consider a threat to the Communist
 system, and on the families of fugitives. In February a new
 decree (No. 7071) was officially reported concerning
 "internment and exile as administrative measures." However,
 the text of the decree was not published, and it is not known
 how this decree differs from Decree No. 5912 of 1979.
 There are numerous reports that families of escapees from
 Albania have been imprisoned or interned as a deterrent to
 other potential illegal emigrants. AI has reported a number
 of such cases in recent years, but another source claimed that
 close relatives of recent escapees are no longer interned.
 AI reports that political detainees lack adequate legal
 safeguard during pretrial investigations. It also notes that
 political prisoners awaiting trial are not guaranteed visits
 from relatives during the investigation or access to a legal
 adviser unless the court "deemed it necessary". By law,
 investigations into crimes against the State must be completed
 within 3 months, but extensions are easily obtained, and no
 effective maximum period of investigation is enforced. Most
 
 
 974
 ALBANIA
 investigations into political offenses are completed within 4
 months, but AI has charged that some investigations have
 dragged on for more than a year.
 Political detainees have been held in solitary confinement for
 up to 6 months during pretrial investigations without access
 to lawyers or relatives. The criminal code provides that
 accused persons must be informed when investigation of their
 cases is concluded and allowed to examine all the evidence to
 be brought against them. Usually, however, they are not
 allowed to examine all the materials and are shown only a copy
 of the indictment. While investigators are theoretically
 bound by rules of procedure, and the accused may appeal to
 higher authority against investigators who violate proper
 procedures, these controls do not appear to be effective.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system includes the Supreme Court and regional
 and district courts. Like all organs of the Government, the
 judicial system is under the total control.of the APL. Courts
 may not render an independent verdict in conflict with the
 wishes or policies of the regime.
 AI reports that persons accused of political crimes lack
 adequate legal safeguards during their trials. Defendants at
 political trials have usually been denied defense counsel and
 have had to conduct their own defense. Major important trials
 of state officials are closed when it suits the purposes of
 the regime, but most political trials of ordinary citizens are
 held in open court. Most such trials last no more than 1 day,
 and there have been no known acquittals.
 Reports of the number of persons in prison range from 4,000 to
 40,000, including 300 members of the pre-World War II elite,
 as well as pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese, and other political
 prisoners. Many persons are serving sentences for expressing
 dissatisfaction with conditions in Albania or for trying to
 flee the country. Former political prisoners report about
 1,200 political prisoners each were being held in the Ballsh
 and Spac labor camps during the early 1980's. Some 300 more
 were imprisoned at Burrel, and others were held in Tarovic,
 Kosove, and Tirana prisons.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution proclaims the inviolability of the home and
 the privacy of correspondence, but at the same time it
 provides that these and other civil rights are subordinate to
 the general interest and may not be exercised in opposition to
 the Socialist order. Observers generally believe that the
 authorities can, and do, violate the privacy of the home when
 and as necessary to achieve their ends. The Government uses
 its pervasive informer network to report on, among other
 things, the private lives of its citizens.
 Contact with the outside world is carefully monitored.
 Albanian citizens are required to report to the police any
 contact with foreigners, but many welcome casual contact with
 foreign tourists. Refugees have reported difficulties they
 had while in Albania in receiving telephone calls from
 relatives living in the United States. Sometimes packages of
 
 
 ALBANIA
 food, medicine, and clothing sent to them were returned by the
 Albanian authorities. After 1986 it became significantly
 easier to receive letters and packages from relatives abroad.
 Though it is technically illegal to receive television or
 radio broadcasts from neighboring Italy, Yugoslavia, and
 Greece, the Government tacitly allows its citizens to do so.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution states that citizens enjoy these
 freedoms, it provides that they may not be exercised in
 opposition to the Socialist order. The Government has imposed
 rigid restrictions on freedom of speech and press. Any
 citizen who publicly criticizes the Government is subject to
 swift and severe reprisals under an article of the Constitution
 which forbids antistate agitation and propaganda. AI states
 in its 1988 report that the majority of political prisoners
 were imprisoned for attempting to exercise their rights to
 freedom of expression and freedom of movement.
 All news media are government controlled and never criticize
 the state and Party leadership or their policies. Art and
 literature are deemed to be weapons of revolutionary change
 and are subject to rigid state control and censorship. The
 authorities also manipulate scholarly inquiry and publications
 for political purposes, particularly in such fields as
 linguistics, literature, economics, history, geography,
 folklore, and ethnology.
 Information from abroad is carefully restricted. Persons
 having unauthorized contact with foreigners may be reprimanded
 or jailed. Such restrictions have been relaxed lately.
 Western visitors report that Albanian citizens are
 increasingly bold in talking to Western visitors and
 tourists. Tirana's decision to join the push for Balkan
 cooperation by hosting three multilateral meetings in the next
 2 years should increase the exposure of the Albanian citizenry
 to external influences.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The security police deal severely with group activities that
 do not have government sanction or that appear to be in
 opposition to the leadership. There are no independent
 associations or organizations.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religious activity in Albania is expressly prohibited by
 the Constitution and by government policy. Historically,
 about 70 percent of all Albanians were Muslim, neatly 2G
 percent were Orthodox, and a little more than 10 percent were
 Roman Catholic. A recent refugee report estimated that
 between 2,000 and 2,500 Jews live in Albania.
 In 1967 the Government proclaimed Albania the first atheist
 state in the world, abrogated all laws dealing with church-
 state relations, and began actively to eradicate all vestiges
 of religion. More than 2,100 mosques, churches, monasteries,
 and other institutions were closed, their fixed assets were
 
 
 976
 ALBANIA
 seized without compensation by the authorities, and many
 religious leaders were persecuted, imprisoned, or even
 executed for continuing their religious functions. All
 religious literature was banned, as were any personal
 manifestations of religious belief or practice. While a few
 outstanding historic churches and their religous art are being
 restored as museums, most churches and mosques have been
 converted to other uses.
 The regime continues to suppress religious activity by
 threatening harsh penalties for believers who practice their
 faith and by obliging citizens to inform on believers.
 Nevertheless, there have been some signs that the regime,
 eager to improve its relations with Western European countries
 as well as with its Balkan neighbors, is quietly toning down
 its antireligious campaign and even permitting private
 expressions of religion. There has been, however, no official
 statement that religious practice is once again allowed.
 In its 1988 report, Al reported that it had no new information
 on the fates of Roman Catholic priests Pjeter Mashkalla and
 Ndoc Luli. Both priests were reportedly imprisoned for
 conducting religious services. Father Mashkella reportedly
 died in prison in 1987. Despite years of antireligious
 pressure, some Albanians have continued to practice their
 faith in their own homes, particularly in villages and in more
 remote mountainous areas. Tourists have also reported seeing
 Muslims praying along roadsides with apparent impunity.
 In November 1983, the Vatican publicly condemned religious
 persecution in Albania and claimed that a number of priests,
 members of holy orders, and seminarians had died in prison.
 It also reported that two priests had been executed for
 baptizing children. The official press denies, however, that
 believers have been persecuted and maintains that religious
 belief is opposed only by argument.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution does not guarantee freedom of movement.
 Movement within the country and travel abroad are controlled
 very strictly, and transgressors against the laws have been
 severely punished in the past. The criminal code states that
 flight from the State or refusal to return to the fatherland
 by a person sent abroad on service or allowed to leave the
 State is considered treason and punishable by imprisonment for
 not less than 10 years or by death. AI stated in its 1988
 report that it had learned of three prisoners imprisoned (for
 16, 12, and 25 years, respectively) for trying to leave
 Albania illegally. Until recently, Albanians were allowed to
 leave the country legally only on official business or, very
 rarely, for family reasons. In 1987 organized groups of
 Albanian tourists visited Yugoslavia, and Albania is reported
 to be negotiating similar programs with Italy and other
 Western European countries. Albania has publicly stated that
 it wishes to increase the number of its university students on
 exchange programs in Western countries. Neither Albanian law
 nor practice allows the right to emigrate.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 No such right exists in theory or in practice. The system of
 government is a Communist dictatorship, headed by Ramiz Alia
 
 
 977
 ALBANIA
 in his capacity as First Secretary of the APL and Chairman of
 the Presidium of the People's Assembly. The Constitution
 establishes the APL as the sole political entity and Marxism-
 Leninism as the only political ideology. The APL is governed
 internally by the principle of "democratic centralism," under
 which decisionmaking power is concentrated in the hands of a
 small elite.
 The Constitution provides that the People's Assembly (a
 unicameral parliament) is the supreme organ of national
 government in Albania; similar bodies, called people's
 councils, exist at the local level. Candidates for these
 assemblies are first designated by a mass organization known
 as the Democratic Front, which is controlled by the APE, and
 then "elected" without opposition by universal suffrage.
 There are several women in party and government leadership
 positions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government denies violating human rights and refuses to
 cooperate with any investigation of allegations to the
 contrary, including confidential investigations by the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Greeks are the largest ethnic minority, but smaller numbers of
 Serbs, Macedonians, Vlachs, Gypsies, and Jews also live in
 Albania. The Constitution grants national minorities
 "guaranteed protection and development of their culture and
 popular traditions, the use of their mother tongue, and its
 teaching in the schools, and equal development in all fields
 of social life." While there are differences of opinion over
 the extent to which minorities can exercise their cultural,
 educational, and linguistic rights, they are clearly
 restricted. While Greeks and Macedonians can be educated in
 their mother tongue through the primary level, there is no
 broadcasting in these languages. A Greek-language newspaper,
 Laiko Vima, is published in the southern town of Argyrokastro.
 Cross-border ties between Greeks increased after the November
 1987 visit to Albania of the Greek Foreign Minister, with
 relatives and friends of the Greek minority being permitted to
 send remittances to Albania.
 Several reports indicate persecution, harassment, and
 discrimination against minorities solely because of their
 ethnic status. There have even been reports of mass removals
 of segments of the Greek population out of traditionally Greek
 lands in the south to areas more distant from the
 Albanian-Greek bcrder. Furthermore, insofar as the ban on
 religious practice has removed the Greek Orthodox church from
 Greek communities in Albania, an important part of that ethnic
 group's community life and links to Greece has been
 eliminated. The leadership of both the APL and the Government
 are overwhelmingly ethnic Albanians of Moslem background. The
 Chairman of the People's Assembly, a Greek woman, is one
 notable exception, however.
 The Constitution states that women shall enjoy "equal rights
 with men in work, pay, holidays, social security, education,
 in all social-political activity, as well as in the family."
 
 
 978
 ALBANIA
 Information on the extent to which these rights are exercised
 is not available, but there are indications that the regime
 has advanced the status of women. Women are said to
 participate equally in the obligatory labor and military
 serv'ce programs. Women account for 47 percent of the total
 labor force and 53 percent of the agricultural labor force.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right to associate freely and to
 strike. Nearly all Albanians belong to trade unions that are
 part of the United Trade Unions of Albania (UTUA), an arm of
 the APL. These unions have no significant independent voice
 in the field of labor relations, but they play a key role in
 indoctrinating and propagandizing the workers, in maintaining
 labor discipline, and in organizing the periods of so-called
 voluntary manual labor in which all Albanians are expected to
 take part. There is a seat reserved for the UTUA as an
 affiliate of the World Federation of Trade Unions, but the
 Albanians have not participated in this Soviet labor front
 since the mid-1960's. Albania withdrew from the International
 Labor Organization in 1967.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers do not have the right to organize freely and to
 bargain collectively. There are no special economic incentive
 zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Little information on forced labor is available. It is
 believed that one form of punishment is internal banishment to
 a labor camp. The prisoners do not have a choice of work but
 are remunerated for their labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 According to the Labor Code of 1980, amended in 1981, the
 minimum age for employment of children is 15. Those under 16
 years of age may not work more than 6 hours per day.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 According to the Labor Code, the workweek is 48 hours.
 Pregnant women, children under 16 years of age, and persons
 with a doctor's certificate may not work between 10 p.m. and 6
 a.m. Women, young persons under 18 years of age, and those
 with a doctor's certificate are prohibited from working
 underground. Workers in arduous and dangerous jobs are
 provided appropriate protective clothing and special food
 rations. The Labor Code contains regulations pertaining to
 occupational health and safety, but there is no available
 information on the effectiveness of enforcement. Minimum wage
 information is not available.
