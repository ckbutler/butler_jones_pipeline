 SWITZERLAND
 In Switzerland, which has centuries-old democratic
 traditions, the rule of law, individual freedom and
 human rights are cherished and fostered. The Swiss
 constitution guarantees basic human rights. Swiss
 social and political institutions are well developed,
 and the Swiss enjoy a high standard of living. The
 federal structure of partially-autonomous cantons and
 the wide linguistic and religious diversity of
 Switzerland have produced a system of consensus
 which, although sometimes slow to assimilate social
 trends and to take political decisions, assures that
 decisions affecting Swiss citizens are broadly
 based. Cantonal involvement in human rights matters
 is direct, but it is circumscribed in federal
 legislation and constitutional guarantees, which
 provide that defendants have a right to appeal to the
 federal level if they believe their constitutional
 rights or due process have been violated in the
 cantonal courts. Switzerland's excellent human
 rights record has been further enhanced by its role
 as home to a number of worldwide organizations
 concerned with humanitarian affairs, and by its
 generous assistance to refugees.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed under article 65
 of the constitution and is respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. The Swiss constitution prohibits corporal
 punishment.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no allegations of persons being
 abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandestine
 detention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus does not exist in Switzerland in the
 same form as in common law countries; however,
 freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law. A detained person may not be held
 longer than 24 hours without a warrant of arrest
 issued by the judge conducting the preliminary
 investigation. Once the warrant is issued, the
 individual may be detained as long as necessary until
 the investigation is completed. However, the length
 of investigative detention is always reviewed by
 higher judicial authority and, traditionally,
 investigations are conducted within a very brief
 period. A suspect must be immediately shown the
 warrant under which he or she is being held, and has
 a right to contact legal counsel as soon as an arrest
 warrant is issued. Bail, or release on personal
 recognizance, is traditionally granted unless the
 (874)
 
 
 875
 examining magistrate believes the individual is a
 danger to society or will not appear for trial.
 Minor cases are tried by a single judge; difficult
 cases by a panel of judges, and murder or other
 serious crimes by a public jury. According to
 long-standing tradition in Switzerland, even the most
 serious cases are usually brought to trial quickly,
 usually within several weeks or, at the most, a few
 months.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There have been no allegations of denial of fair,
 public trial in Switzerland. The court system is an
 independent branch of the government, and fair,
 public trials are guaranteed by the Swiss
 constitution.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice. A magistrate's
 warrant is required in order to enter a private
 residence, and there have been no allegations of
 violations of the home by the Swiss authorities.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Switzerland has no restrictions on political
 expression or association except those placed on
 groups considered a potential threat to the
 confederation. Ho such groups are currently
 designated. The constitution guarantees freedom of
 the press. Rights of linguistic minorities are
 respected. Switzerland is a country of absolute
 religious tolerance. Freedoms of creed and
 conscience are guaranteed by the constitution, and
 there are constitutional guarantees to prevent
 domination of people by religious groups. The
 constitutional requirement for universal military
 service by Swiss men provides no exemption for reason
 of conscience. Concern is expressed by some Swiss,
 as well as by Amnesty International, at the almost
 100 percent conviction rate for refusal to accept
 induction (353 convictions out of 354 cases heard in
 1980). The penalty is usually six months'
 imprisonment. The European Human Rights Commission
 recently heard a case on this subject. It found that
 due process is observed in such cases and did not
 criticize Swiss practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Constitutional guarantees assure freedom of movement
 within Switzerland, foreign travel, and emigration
 and repatriation. About 30,000 refugees currently
 are settled in Switzerland.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Switzerland has a highly developed constitutional
 
 
 876
 democracy. Federal legislative power is vested in a
 bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage.
 Although Swiss women have the federal franchise, the
 electors in two small, local jurisdictions have not
 yet granted full voting rights to women for local
 issues. Labor has full freedom to organize, and to
 make its influence felt through the political process.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no requests during the postwar period
 for outside investigations of the human rights
 situation in Switzerland.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Swiss government is committed to seeing that the
 vital needs of the entire Swiss community are
 fulfilled, a commitment shared by the cantons,
 voluntary organizations and private industry, all of
 which are important in providing for the welfare of
 all Swiss. Wealth is reasonably distributed,
 unemployment is virtually nonexistent, and health
 services are superior. Education is free through the
 university level. Citizens have the right to own
 property, but acquisition of real estate by
 foreigners is controlled. Although large numbers of
 foreign workers (10% of the total population), many
 of whom had spent years in Switzerland, were obliged
 to leave the country when their jobs were lost during
 the recession of the late 1970's, Swiss policy now
 aims at gradually integrating the resident foreign
 worker into Swiss social services programs.
 Parliament has passed a law which would liberalize
 the conditions for attaining permanent residence in
 Switzerland. This law will now be subjected to a
 referendum. Cantonal laws are being revised
 generally to improve protection of individual rights
 and to harmonize local laws among the 26 cantonal
 jurisdictions. A revision to the law on asylum has
 been proposed to improve the standing of refugees and
 integrate them more fully into Swiss society by
 providing eligibility for social services programs.
 Women, granted the federal franchise in 1971, have
 made considerable progress over the past eight years
 in achieving equal status with men in public life. A
 report by the federal commission on women's affairs
 concluded, however, that women are still
 underrepresented in business and public occupations.
 A June 1981 national referendum approved a draft
 constitutional amendment calling for equality between
 the sexes in family relations, education and at
 work. This referendum was the government's response
 to a public petition on the same subject, submitted
 to the government several years ago. It now remains,
 however, for the parliament to elaborate this "equal
 rights amendment" with individual bills in order to
 guarantee such aspects es equal pay and equal
 property rights.
 The following are relevant economic and social
 indicators: per capita GNP in 1979 was $13,920; life
 expectancy at birth is 75 and the infant mortality
 rate is 10 per 1,000 live births (1978); the total
 fertility rate was 1.6 in 1979 and the average annual
 population growth rate in the 1970's was 0.3 percent;
 the 1978 adjusted primary school enrollment ratio was
 86, with a ratio of 86 for males and 87 for females;
 adult literacy is at 99 percent; the percent of
 calorie supply available for consumption as a
 percentage of nutritional requirements was 130 in
 1977.
