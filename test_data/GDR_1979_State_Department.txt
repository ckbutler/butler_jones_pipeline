 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 
 The German Democratic Republic (GDR) is a tightly-controlled,
 one-party Communist state with substantial restrictions on
 the exercise of civil and political rights. The Socialist
 Unity Party (SED) controls all aspects of society except the
 major churches, which retain some autonomy.
 The GDR faces a situation unique in Eastern Europe. The GDR
 shares with the Federal Republic of Germany the most
 sensitive strategic position in Europe. There are nearly
 400,000 Soviet troops on its territory. At the same time,
 there are profound historical, cultural and family ties
 between the people of the GDR and the FRG that the thirty-
 year-old division of Germany has not eradicated. These ties
 are kept alive by millions of FRG visitors and television
 and radio broadcasts which expose the GDR's Western-oriented
 population daily to Western ideas and attractions.
 As the Berlin Wall testifies, the GDR tightly controls
 emigration and travel. Today, despite its signing of the
 1975 CSCE Final Act in Helsinki, the GDR severely limits the
 ability of its citizens of pre-retirement age to travel to
 the West or to emigrate. Those attempting to cross the
 border illegally run the risk of imprisonment or death from
 border guards or automatic shooting devices, though border
 shooting incidents have greatly declined in recent years.
 East Germans are still subject to imprisonment for publicly
 criticizing the government, and in June 1979, the government
 passed harsh new laws designed to limit the freedom of
 foreign journalists and to discourage East Germans from
 expressing views or sharing with foreigners even unclassified
 information that the state considers defamatory.
 Over the past decade there have been modest improvements in
 a few limited areas. There has been significantly improved
 access to the GDR for Western visitors. The GDR no longer
 jams Western radio or TV broadcasts. The GDR has made
 substantial progress in meeting social and economic needs of
 its citizens, though such benefits can be curtailed for
 those who do not conform to the State-imposed orthodoxy. It
 has a highly-industrialized economy, a relatively good
 standard of living, and a strong, extensive welfare system.
 In regard to civil and political liberties, however, the
 general posture remains poor.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The Department of State is not aware of any reports of
 torture in the GDR.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There is no public discussion in the GDR of prison and jail
 conditions and treatment by police authorities. Available
 information comes from people who have been arrested. From
 these sources there are credible allegations of incidents of
 serious mistreatment. Prison guards have allegedly beaten
 prisoners with fists and billy clubs or left prisoners
 outside in snow for long hours without shoes or warm
 clothes. Some guards have been said to punish prisoners by
 allowing German shepherd dogs to attack them, leading in
 some cases to serious injuries. Summary executions do not
 occur and, in fact, the death penalty has not been imposed
 in recent years.

 Prison conditions are reportedly inadequate in some
 respects, including overcrowding in cells. Though prisoners
 have access to medical facilities, there are allegations of
 scarcity of medication, long waits to see specialists, and a
 lack of specialized diets. In some cases, nursing care is
 reportedly given by police women with little or no medical
 training. Prisoners are generally allowed to exercise their
 right to have two visitors per month. Political prisoners
 and ordinary prisoners are sometimes mixed together.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Some GDR laws are written in vague and general language; it
 is not always clear what objectively constitutes an offense.
 Trials are usually closed to the public,.and the courts or
 government agencies do not publish interpretations of the
 laws. It is, therefore, very difficult to get an accurate
 picture of how the laws are enforced, and a citizen cannot
 always know what is and is not permitted. The Penal Code
 appears to contain a high degree of subjectivity, particularly
 in regard to actions which it defines as criminal but which
 would be considered political in Western countries. For
 example, Section 220 of the Penal Code says a person can be
 sentenced up to three years for "demeaning in public the
 State order or State organs, institutions or social
 organizations or their deeds or measures."
 The number of political prisoners is unknown, .though in
 September 1979 some Western observers estimated that about
 5,000 out of 30,000 prisoners in the GDR were incarcerated
 for political offenses. Amnesty International reports that
 the majority of its cases in the GDR are those of individuals
 who sought to leave the GDR. In a 1972 amnesty, the
 Government of the GDR said that the amnesty applied to
 "political and criminal prisoners," thus acknowledging that
 the GDR has political prisoners.
 According to paragraph 103 of the Preliminary Proceedings
 Section of the Criminal Procedure Code, a person can be held
 at the most three months before the preliminary procedures
 are finished (i.e., until charges are filed). However, the
 Public Prosecutor may extend the detention period indefinitely
 if the inquiry cannot be finished within that time. The
 officials have reportedly extended this detention period in
 several political cases.
 No specific charges must be brought to detain a citizen
 under house arrest. According to the Law on House Arrest,
 the Public Prosecutor can, with the approval of a court,
 order the house arrest of a person, "even if a violation of
 a particular law has not occurred," if this person is
 considered to be a threat to public security and order.
 In September 1979, the GDR announced an amnesty for its 30th
 anniversary. The amnesty did not apply to those sentenced
 for Nazi or war crimes or crimes against humanity, those
 convicted in compliance with international law or
 agreements, those convicted of particularly serious crimes
 (e.g., murder or acts of violence), or those convicted of
 military espionage. Political prisoners benefited equally
 from its terms; among the released were well-known
 individuals, including Nico Huebner and Rudolf Bahro, who
 were released to the West. The GDR announced that 21,928
 prisoners were freed under the 1979 amnesty which ended
 December 14. According to public reports, payments
 totalling substantial amounts have been received in the past
 for the release of detainees from the GDR to the West.

 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The GDR law provides that all defendants are entitled to a
 fair public trial. However, the judge can authorize a
 closed trial. In practice, almost all political trials are
 closed to the general public and the press. The judiciary
 appears to provide little or no protection to the accused in
 trials for political offenses. Defendants often cannot
 choose a lawyer freely. In some cases, the defendant is not
 allowed to choose a lawyer until a few days before the
 trial, and sometimes the trial is held within days after the
 State completes its investigation, thus allowing the
 defending lawyer little time to prepare a defense. Trials
 tend to be short and perfunctory.
 Though there is not a large body of information on whether
 defense attorneys are subject to pressure or harassment, the
 defense attorney for one dissident, Robert Havemann, was
 prohibited from practicing law after defending Havemann.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The police have the authority to enter a home almost at
 will. By law, they need an authorization in order to enter
 and search a house, but the police can authorize entry
 themselves, and the courts will retroactively give approval.
 The authorities reportedly do not investigate complaints of
 abuse.
 It is legal for the authorities to tap telephones and open
 mail; evidence collected in these ways can be used in court.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 The GDR has a highly industrialized, centralized, planned,
 socialist economy. There is a relatively high standard of
 living and no serious shortages of essential goods and
 services, though there are periodic shortages of other
 goods. Individuals are permitted to receive foreign
 currency, which comes most frequently from West German
 relatives. Hard currency is necessary to purchase Western
 goods in Intershops and often it'is the only way to secure
 scarce goods and services.
 There is an extensive welfare system which includes a
 comprehensive child care system for working parents, free
 medical care, and free and universal education through the
 12th grade. Rents and prices of basic goods are subsidized,
 and GDR citizens have adequate access to food, clothing,
 etc. Most income-producing land and businesses have been
 nationalized, although some small private businesses are
 allowed. East Germans may own their own homes and garden
 plots subject to local government approval.
 There is a housing. shortage, a result in part of the damage
 from World War II. The government is committed to a major
 housing construction program.
 Special privileges for housing, foreign travel, education
 and buying goods are extended to those favored by the
 authorities. These special benefits can be more important
 than wages in determining one's status and living standard
 and thus in creating a privileged class.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 Although all these freedoms are guaranteed by the GDR
 Constitution, they are not permitted in practice.
 Individuals are frequently arrested for expressing views
 which are considered "anti-socialist" or contrary to the
 interests of the State. All forms of the media are
 government controlled and censored. However, most GDR
 citizens regularly view West German television on their
 sets. Western publications are often confiscated by border
 officials. Those Western publications permitted into the
 GDR are not widely distributed, and such publications are
 unavailable to the average East German. Views which are
 critical of the government or the party are not allowed to
 be expressed publicly. Some latitude is allowed, however,
 for criticism of economic performance.
 The government in the past year has taken measures adversely
 affecting the working conditions of foreign journalists. In
 April 1979, regulations were implemented which prohibit a
 foreign journalist from interviewing a GDR citizen without
 specific government permission. In August, the GDR amended
 the Penal Code to broaden the definition of the crimes for
 which GDR citizens can be prosecuted. Among these crimes is
 disseminating or allowing the dissemination in foreign
 countries of unclassified information deemed harmful by the
 authorities to the interests of the GDR. This and several
 other amendments appear designed to discourage GDR citizens
 from having contacts with Western journalists or publishing
 articles or other works in Western, particularly West
 German, media. To date, one journalist has been expelled
 for violating these regulations, although there are no
 reports that GDR citizens have been punished.
 Until spring 1979, a number of prominent literary and
 intellectual figures were able to publish works in the West
 that did not hew to the party line and could therefore not
 be circulated in the GDR itself. In the spring, however,
 the GDR cracked down on this means to avoid censorship by
 fining two prominent dissidents (Stephan Heym and Robert
 Havemann) for evading currency regulations. In the end,
 Heym and eight other non-establishment authors who publicly
 criticized the GDR's cultural policies were expelled from
 the Writer's Union, a move that could seriously affect their
 livelihood and presage a further tightening of the
 intellectual climate. Several of the expellees have been
 permitted and/or urged to leave the GDR.
 In general, a wide range of religious activities is
 permitted. Church services are on occasion broadcast on
 state-controlled radio and television. The church may
 import religious publications (a privilege most other
 institutions do not have), and new churches are being built.
 GDR churches receive considerable financial aid from
 churches in the Federal Republic, which is used primarily to
 build new churches for which there would not otherwise be
 adequate funds. The church has on some recent occasions
 publicly criticized some government policies without overt
 retribution. Despite the toleration of religious activity,
 the church does face problems, particularly discrimination
 against church members in terms of educational and job
 opportunities. The population is nominally 70 percent
 Lutheran and 8 percent Roman Catholic. In general, the
 smaller religious sects are not as well treated as the large
 
 
 597
 ones. One sect, the Jehovah's Witnesses, is specifically
 prohibited. The very small Jewish community receives
 government financial support for its activities, including
 the building and maintenance of synagogues and the
 maintenance of an old-age home. There are no Jewish
 schools and no resident rabbi.
 There is no freedom of assembly. Individuals are not
 allowed to organize into groups which are not officially-
 controlled, with the exception of the churches. The GDR has
 been supportive of the maintenance of the cultural identity
 of the Sorbs, a Slavic people who make up 0.2 percent of the
 population.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Travel within the GDR is generally not controlled unless a
 person is under house arrest, and travel is comparatively
 easy to Eastern European countries. Travel to the West,
 however, is impossible for most GDR citizens under
 retirement age. To cross the border without permission is a
 crime punishable by up to five years in prison. Persons
 attempting to escape to the West also risk wounding or death
 by border guards or automatic shooting devices, though known
 incidents of wounding or death have fallen off substantially
 in the past few years.
 After the Helsinki Final Act of CSCE was signed in 1975,
 tens of thousands of GDR citizens applied to emigrate
 legally to the West. The vast majority of applications were
 refused. Many who apply to emigrate lose their jobs and are
 harassed and sometimes imprisoned.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Nominally the GDR is a multi-party state; in fact the
 political system is totally dominated by the Socialist Unity
 Party (SED). There are four other parties, but they defer
 to the SED on important policy matters. Only once since the
 GDR was founded has one of the parties voted in the
 parliament against a bill.  (This was the Christian
 Democratic Union, which voted against a bill legalizing
 abortion.) The delegations in the parliament are
 apportioned among the parties, and'the SED holds a
 plurality. No opposition parties are permitted. All
 parties have their own newspapers, but all follow SED
 policy. All citizens are expected to vote, although there
 is only a single list of candidates on the ballot. In fact,
 a citizen can be imprisoned for refusing to vote.
 Women are equal to men under law. Approximately 80 percent
 of the women are employed, but in general they have not
 reached the top positions of the party, government, economy
 or the professions.
 There is only one trade union organization, and it is
 controlled by the party. Strikes are not permitted.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The GDR has generally taken the position that inquiries on
 its human rights policies are interference in the internal
 affairs of the GDR. Amnesty International has requested
 information on human rights conditions in the GDR without
 success.
