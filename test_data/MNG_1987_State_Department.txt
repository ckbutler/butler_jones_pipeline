 MONGOLIA
 Mongolia, or the Mongolian People's Republic (MPR), is a
 rigidly controlled Communist state. The Mongolian Communist
 Party, called the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party
 (MPRP), is the only political party permitted to function.
 The leadership of the country is vested in the 7-person
 Politburo of the MPRP Central Committee headed by Jambyn
 Batmonh. Nominally, the People's Great Hural, or National
 Assembly, enacts the basic laws of the country. It meets for
 3 days once each year. Between sessions, the Council of
 Ministers (Cabinet) issues current legislation.
 The Soviet Union dominates Mongolia politically and
 economically. The Mongolian State is modeled on the Soviet
 system, and key MPRP and government leaders travel often to
 Moscow for consultations. The Soviets station approximately
 four combat divisions on Mongolian soil. As in the political
 arena, Mongolian economic life is shaped by the Soviet bloc:
 approximately 95 percent of Mongolia's foreign trade is
 conducted with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Soviet
 involvement in the Mongolian economy is focused largely on
 mining and concentration of nonferrous metals that
 subsequently are shipped to the USSR for processing.
 Nonetheless, the Mongolian economy is agriculturally based
 with an emphasis on livestock raising and associated light
 industry.
 Little information is available concerning government control
 or treatment of Mongolian citizens. There are no known
 domestic opposition groups, and emigres are few. Although the
 United States and Mongolia established diplomatic relations on
 January 27, 1987, the United States has not yet opened an
 Embassy in Mongolia. Thus, there is limited information on
 the human rights situation in Mongolia. Much of the
 information that is available comes from the Mongolian
 Government itself. The few resident diplomats and occasional
 visitors to Mongolia are mainly limited to the capital city
 (Ulaanbaatar). Travel to other parts of the country is
 restricted.
 Mongolian life and society are highly regimented. Few
 Mongolians are authorized to travel outside Soviet bloc
 countries. Political opposition to the MPRP is not
 permitted. Freedoms assured to the individual under the
 Mongolian Constitution, including speech, religion,
 demonstration, and assembly, can be exercised only to "develop
 and consolidate the state system of the Mongolian People's
 Republic." In sum, individual civil and political liberties
 are highly restricted.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no information available concerning political killing
 in Mongolia.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no reliable information available concerning
 disappearance in Mongolia.

 MONGOLIA
 C. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 No information is available concerning this subject.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 No information is available on these subjects.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Current civil and criminal codes stipulate the right of the
 accused to judicial process, a legal defense, and public trial
 "except as stipulated by law." Closed proceedings are
 permitted in the case of crimes against the State. The civil
 code places a heavy emphasis on this category of crimes and
 the MPRP controls the legal system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is
 provided in the Constitution, but there is no information
 available concerning the application of these rights by
 Mongolian authorities. Travel, as well as job and residence
 changes, are decided in accordance with economic needs as
 determined by the State. In determining work assignments,
 individual aptitude is also a factor.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech but specifies
 that the exercise of individual rights must be to "develop and
 consolidate the state system of the MPR." Actions deemed by
 the MPRP to fall outside this guideline would likely result in
 arrest and detention. Criticism of the Government is not
 tolerated. Control is exercised through various government
 organizations, notably the People's Control Organization,
 extending down to the neighborhood committee level. The press
 serves primarily as a propaganda tool. Representatives of
 non-Communist foreign media are able to travel to Mongolia,
 but find it necessary to arrange their trips well in advance.
 Academic and artistic life also is tightly controlled in
 accordance with government policy. Information flow is
 tightly monitored. Mongolian citizens have little access to
 books, periodicals, or newspapers not printed in Communist
 countries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of demonstration and assembly are provided for in the
 Constitution, but in practice only government-authorized
 organizations may assemble and the only demonstrations allowed
 are carefully orchestrated by government authorities.
 The Constitution gives workers the right to organize
 professional and trade unions, but all are controlled and
 directed by the Government to promote its policies. While the
 Labor Law does not mention collective bargaining specifically,
 it does provide for the settlement of labor grievances by
 "Commissions for Labor Disputes" formed by local trade union
 councils and people's courts, and composed of equal numbers of
 
 
 768
 MONGOLIA
 trade union council representatives and enterprise managers.
 There is no information on how this has worked in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion exists in theory, but the Government
 strictly controls religious activity through an Office of
 Religious Affairs attached to the Council of Ministers. All
 Buddhist temples, and all but one monastery have been closed
 since the 1930's, and, as a result, religion no longer seems
 to play any significant part in the lives of most Mongolians.
 There are no mosques for the traditionally Islamic Kazakh
 minority of 80,000 in western Mongolia. Lamaism, which was a
 central force in Mongolian life prior to the establishment of
 the Communist Government, has been reduced to one showcase
 monastery, the Gandang monastery, with about 100 monks.
 Mongolians who visit the Gandang monastery for worship are
 mostly of the older generation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Until recent years, few Mongolians traveled abroad, even to
 the Soviet Union. Foreign travel usually has been permitted
 only for official purposes, but government-sponsored education
 abroad has become increasingly common. In recent years, as
 many as 40,000 Mongolian youths have gone to various places in
 the Soviet Union yearly for short, specialized training
 programs. There has also been an increase in the number of
 senior scholars pursuing extended study abroad, although most
 foreign travel remains restricted to Soviet bloc countries.
 There is no known routine emigration from Mongolia.
 All Mongolians over age 16 must have internal passports and
 must obtain permission from the Security Bureau in order to
 travel within the country. Attempts to change jobs or
 residences must be approved both by the Security Bureau and
 the People's Control Organization.
 Although the 1978 Constitution assures the right "to reside in
 the territory of the MPR* to foreign citizens, Mongolian
 authorities in May 1983 began a systematic expulsion of the
 6,000 to 7,000 ethnic Chinese, most of whom resided in and
 around Ulaanbaatar. The Mongolian authorities claimed the
 expellees had-no formal occupation or did not abide by
 Mongolian law or both, despite the fact that many of them had
 been living and working in Mongolia since the 1950's.  In line
 with the improvement of Sino-Mongolian relations in recent
 years, Mongolia stopped the arbitrary expulsion of ethnic
 Chinese in 1985; today Mongolia's Chinese population numbers
 less than 2,000. A bilateral consular treaty regarding
 treatment of their nationals was signed by Mongolia and China
 in July 1986.
 Section 3 .Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) has a
 monopoly on political power. There is no mechanism by which
 the citizenry as a whole can effect transitions in leadership
 or changes in government. The MPRP is established on the
 Soviet model with'a narrow pyramid of power topped by Party
 General Secretary Batmonh. Lower-ranking members of the MPRP
 have no real ability to influence the decisions of their
 superiors. Elections are held at regular intervals, but only
 
 
 769
 MONGOLIA
 one candidate is listed for each office, so the choice is to
 vote for him or cross his name out. The 1986 election to the
 Great Hural brought into office a large group of younger
 officials in their 40's. In the 1986 election, 69.2 percent
 of all the Deputies were elected to the Great Hural for the
 first time. Many elections purportedly result in a 99.9
 percent turnout and the sole candidate regularly receives the
 entire vote. While there is no officially espoused policy of
 minority disenfranchisement, only a few members of minorities
 occupy elite party or government positions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Mongolia acceded to the United Nations Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights in 1976. However, the Government has
 consistently followed the Soviet human rights policy and
 practice, whether or not it is consistent with the Covenant.
 There is no known organization dedicated to the protection of
 human rights in Mongolia.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There appears to be little discrimination in education on the
 basis of race, sex, or religion.
 Universal franchise and equal rights for women are official
 policy. According to government statistics, the percentage of
 women in the work force rose from 30 to 48.5 percent between
 1960 and 1984. From 1951 to 1986, the number of women
 Deputies elected to the Great Hural, which has 370 Deputies,
 increased from 51 to 92. In 1987 elections to local Hurals,
 33.9 percent of the 15,967 Deputies were women. Women
 constitute 30.3 percent of the MPRP membership and 49.8
 percent of trade union membership. Few women occupy positions
 of responsibility in the Government or in party structures,
 although women have served on the 8-person Presidium, the
 acting legislative body between sessions of the Great Hural.
 It is reported in Mongolian media that women hold high
 professional positions in institutions such as schools,
 research centers, and hospitals.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Mongolian Labor Law sets a minimum work age and maximum
 work hours for all workers, and exhorts state enterprises to
 observe work safety requirements. The Law proscribes work for
 children under age 16, although those age 15 may work if
 allowed to by the local trade union committee. Those under 18
 are statutorily prohibited from doing arduous work or from
 working in dangerous areas such as mining. The workday is
 prescribed as 8 hours for adults, 7 hours for those age 16-18,
 and 6 hours for those age 15. No information is available on
 the implementation of the Labor Law.
