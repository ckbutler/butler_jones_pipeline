 INDIA
 The Republic of India is the world's most populous democracy,
 with a secular political system that melds Indian political
 traditions with the British parliamentary system. India
 regularly holds free elections at the'national and state
 levels.- As the result of genetal elections in 1984, Prime
 Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress (I) Party holds almost 80
 percent of the seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of
 India's Parliament) and controls the upper house (Rajya Sabha)
 by a substantial majority. Congress (I) also rules 12 of the
 25 states and it minority partner in coalitions that govern 2
 more.   AS the result of elections in 1987, Congress (I) lost
 control of the state governments of Mizoram and Haryana; in
 Kerala, the front in which Congress (I) was a leading partner
 lost control of the state in elections in April. The elected
 government in Punjab-was'dissolved in May following problems
 of law and order related t6 political disputes.
 The internal security apparatus of India is a complex weave of
 national and state-controlled paramilitary and police forces.
 All derive their authority from the Constitution. The Union
 Ministry for Home Affairs controls the Indian Police Force
 (the overarching all-India police bureaucracy), the
 paramilitary forces, and the intelligence bureaus. State
 governments control their own police forces, the provincial
 armed constabularies (if any), and some specialized police
 forces. Over the years since independence, control of law and
 order operations has come increasingly under the purview of
 the Home Ministry. This tendency has been fueled in part by
 the rapid growth of the intelligence bureaus, which function
 with little reference to the state governments. The growing
 use of paramilitary forces for internal control, such as in
 Punjab, has also contributed to the centralizing tendency. In
 recent years the military forces have also been used for
 internal control--notably in the 1984 army raid on the Golden
 Temple complex in Amritsar, Punjab.
 The Indian economy is mixed, with the central and state
 governments owning and operating banks, air and rail
 transport, public utilities, and much heavy industry. The
 agricultural sector, manufacture of consumer goods, some heavy
 industry, and services other than financial are largely in
 private hands. Some rules regulating private economic
 activity have been relaxed recently.
 India is officially a secular state. Approximately 83 percent
 of its population are Hindus and 11 percent Muslims with
 smaller proportions of Jains, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis,
 Sikhs, and animists.
 The overall Indian human rights situation in 1987 remained
 relatively unchanged, but there was some variation in practice
 from state to state. India remains a basically democratic
 polity with strong and legally respected safeguards for
 individuals, but its many domestic difficulties continue to
 generate significant human rights problems.
 The most serious human rights concerns in India in 1987 were
 continuing intercaste violence linked to criminal elements,
 especially in the state of Bihar; continuing violence in
 Punjab and the incommunicado detention of suspected security
 risks for prolonged periods without charge; the growth of
 communal and quasi-religious gangs as a political force;
 controlling and punishing police accused of mistreating
 arrested suspects; alleged government pressure against

 newspapers which criticize the Government with too much zeal;
 and concern over women's rights in connection with "dowry
 deaths" and a prominent instance of "sati," i.e.,
 self-immolation of widows.
 RESPECT FOR HU4AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government does not sanction political killing. On the
 other hand, local political parties are often involved in
 violence which is communal or caste related.
 Intercaste and political violence occurred frequently in 1987
 in the eastern state of Bihar, where social tension continued
 to fuel violence by landlords, sometimes with links to
 criminal elements, politicians, and local police, against
 disadvantaged classes seeking improved economic and social
 conditions. In mid-April landlords belonging to the Rajput
 caste reportedly instigated the killing of seven Yadavs (a
 pastoral caste) in Chechhani village. In late May, in
 retaliation, a large mob destroyed two Rajput villages,
 killing 55 people. Local authorities blamed the latter
 incident on "Naxalites" (a generic and sometimes misapplied
 term for Maoist radicals active in Bihar and elsewhere). In
 August a leader of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, a front
 agitating for formation of a separate tribal state, was
 murdered. Some observers have noted a connection among
 certain politicians, criminal gangs, and some landlords in
 rural areas, where private armies and local police are used to
 resist demands for social and economic change. In turn, lower
 castes have increasingly joined the activities of radical
 organizations. The Bihar state government has not been
 effective in coping with the violence; the Bihar director
 general of police admitted in a March interview that brutality
 and corruption plague his police force.
 In Punjab, the level of killings decreased somewhat after the
 central Government imposed President's rule in May, replacing
 a government elected after the signing of the Punjab Accord of
 1985 which had attempted to restore political normalcy to this
 troubled state. Most victims of this violence were Sikhs,
 victims of violence committed by other Sikhs rather than
 Hindus. However, Sikh terrorists were allegedly responsible
 for 2 massacres of bus passengers in which 76 people, mostly
 Hindus, lost their lives. Estimates of killings by terrorists
 vary, but all exceed the total for 1986 (approximately 525);
 according to one newspaper, 674 people were killed by
 terrorists in Punjab between January and August 1987. Neither
 the press nor the Government, however, distinguishes between
 terrorist deaths and those resulting from common crime, of
 which there is a high incidence in Punjab.
 In 1987 the Government tabled in Parliament the report of the
 Misra Commission, created to investigate the anti-Sikh riots
 in 1984. The report was highly critical of police actions and
 stated that the army should have been called out sooner to
 suppress the riots. Some human rights activists have
 complained that the report ignores allegations that important
 Congress (I) members instigated rioting in some areas.

 INDIA
 According to.government figures, communal violence, primarily
 Hindu-Muslim, took 167 lives in India in the first half of
 1987, compared with 184 in all of 1986. The most notable
 incidents of Hindu-Muslim violence were in Uttar Pradesh and
 Gujarat. Hindu-Sikh clashes in Delhi also recurred, but were
 kept in check despite several massacres of bus passengers in
 the Punjab and shootings by unknown gunmen in June and October
 which left. 13 and 9 dead, respectively From time to. time,
 reports continued to appear in the press of murders of
 untouchables (Harijans) by higher-caste Hindus.
 Much of the Hindu-Muslim violence took place in Uttar Pradesh,
 where in Meeut alQne 117 people died in riots in April and
 May. In a highly publicized incident in May, members of the
 Provindial Armed Constabulary (PAC) were sent to Maliana, a
 village near Meerut, to pr&vent the outbreak of communal
 hostilities. Reports -state, however, that they set Muslim
 houses'and shops on fi-re and shot people indiscriminately as
 they fled the blazes. There were also reports of the PAC
 rounding up.young Muslim men in Hashimpura, a section of
 Meerut, and allegedly. killing some and dumping -their bodies in
 a nearby canal. In a special report released November 1,
 Amnesty Inteunational (Al)-said there is strong evidence that
 the PAC deliberately killed dozens of unarmed civilians and
 caused dozens more -to "disappear.' The state government
 announced that it yould conduct an inquiry -into the incidents.
 Communal.hostility in.Uttar.Pradesh has-also been fed by the
 continuing dispute over -a. site in Ayodhya that is holy for
 both Muslims and Hindus.s Critics charge that government
 figures understate the number of casualties resulting from
 communal violence..
 In West Bengal, armed state police and supporters of the
 ruling-Comminist Party of India (Marxist) regularly clashed
 violently with the cadre and supporters of the so-called
 Gorkha National Liberation Front-(GNLF-) in connection with the
 agitation for autonomy for Nepali-speaking areas. In related
 events, about 7,000 Nepalis in leghalaya were left homeless
 after riots by Khasi tribals against the presence of foreigners
 in that state. Ethnic tension between tribals and nontribals
 (especially Bengali settlers from Bangladesh)-is widespread in
 the remote northeastern states,- including Assam. Neither the
 central Government nor the state governments, however, follow
 a policy that would cause or condone an incident such as the
 anti-Nepali riots in Meghalaya.
 Law and order in the Indian system is primarily the
 responsibility of the various states. The quality, training,
 and evenhandedness of':police vary from state to state, as does
 the willingness of political authorities to restrain political
 violence. The decision whether to institute judicial
 proceedings-in cases of politically related violence also
 often appears to be heavily political. In any event, judicial
 processes are lengthy.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been charges that police in Andhra Pradesh have
 cause4."disappearances" of perhaps a dozen Naxalites. Some
 Sikhs claim that the Government has not yet accounted for a
 small number of people seized during the Golden Temple
 operations in 1984 and subsequent security operations in
 Punjab.
 
 
 1151
 INDIA
 c. Torture and Other Crnel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and cruel treatment are prohibited by law in India.
 Indian case law excludes confessions or information extracted
 through the use of force or torture from being admitted in
 court. Throughout 1987, however, the press continued to
 report allegations of abuse of prisoners and suspects by
 police in many Indian states. In Kerala the entire opposition
 walked out of Parliament in July to protest the death in
 police custody of an elderly mann The Indian press continues
 to cite the police in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh as
 particularly brutal. In November the Canadian Government
 protested the alleged torture of a Canadian Sikh arrested in
 Punjab while reportedly carrying funds for Sikh extremists.
 Other reports accused the pol-ice of staging fake encounters
 with terrorists, especially in Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, to
 cover up deaths in police custody and attributing deaths in
 custody to incorrect causes. In its special report on alleged
 killings by the Provincial Armed Constabulary in Uttar Pradesh
 released in November; AI expressed concern about reports that
 at least five people arrested in connection with communal -
 rioting were beaten to death in jail. While center and state
 governments do-not overtly Condone police abuses, -there have
 been few government inquiries into such incidents and
 allegations.-
 In its 1987 Report, covering 1986, AI expressed concern about
 reports it said it had -received from-most Indian states of
 torture- and ill-treatment of detainees, resulting in some
 cases in the death of the detainees.
 Prison conditions are generally poor, and pretrial detention
 may last for an extended period. In one extreme case a man
 was sentenced to 1 year's imprisonment--after 13 years of
 detention. Press reports include claims of sexual abuse of
 female prisoners and use of prisoners by prison officials for
 domestic labor. The government-of West Bengal, in response,
 has acted to release all "crimeless women" (prostitutes,
 destitutes,-orphans, etc.) from prison, and has formed a
 special police group-to investigate complaints by women of
 mistreatment.
 The penal system grants different privileges to different
 categories of prisoners. Political prisoners and foreign
 nationals are provided less crowded cells, better food, and
 some amenities such as access to publications. In some states
 a number of children are reported to be imprisoned.
 Legislation effective on October 2 mandated that such children
 be placed in rehabilitation homes rather than prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution requires that an arrested person be informed
 of the grounds for arrest, given the right to be represented
 by counsel, and produced before a magistrate within 24 hours
 of- arrest. At this initial appearance, the accused must be
 either remanded for further investigation or released. These
 provisions are generally respected and.were firmly upheld in a
 January decision by the Supreme Court. In Punjab, pursuant to
 the Disturbed Areas Legislation, arrest warrants are not
 required.
 The enactment of preventive detention laws in the event of
 threats to public welfare and national security is permitted
 
 
 1152
 INDIA
 under the Constitution. Such laws provide for limitS on the
 length of detention (up to 2 years) and for judicial review of
 such detention. Two such laws are in force. The first, the
 National Security Act (NSA), permits detention of security
 risks., To be released from detention under this law, a court
 must determine that all grounds for detention are invalid.
 Upon expiration of the detention order, an additional order
 can be issued for -another 12 months, making it theoretically
 possible for a detainee to be held indefinitely without
 -charges being filed or a trial held. The NSA was used in
 Punjab to place a large number of persons'into preventive
 detention in the aftermath of the imposition of President's
 rule. Punjab government officials have said that a number of
 those arrested in the aftermath of the imposition of
 Presidbntl  rule have been released., During the first three
 months oE central rule, 4,116 people were arrested as
 "terrorists. !-
 The central Government has, however, kept 360
 persons--arrested during Operation Bluestar (the June 1984
 army action at the Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine)--in
 detention without charges at Jodhpur (Rajasthan) jail. G. S.
 Tohra and-P. S. Badal, leaders of the.breakaway Akali Dal (B)
 faction-and now beads of the United Akali Dali were arrested
 in December 1986 under the National.Security Act which-
 provides for detention for up to 1 year without charges. They
 were released the first week of December 1987.
 Incommunicado detention is permitted under the Terrorist and
 Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act of 1987 (TDPA);'which
 applies to Punjab and the union territory of Chandigarh. The
 Act permits maximum detention of 2 years. All detainees have
 the right to have their detention reviewed by courts and are
 allowed access to legal counsel. According to figures
 released by the Government in the Lok Sabha on December 9, a
 total of;9,298,persons were under detention under the
 provisions of the TDPA. Of the total; 4,028 are being
 detained in Punjab, 2,234 in Gujarat, and-l,410 in Haryana.
 In its 1987 Report, Al expressed particular concern qbout the
 detention of hundreds of political detainees held without
 charge or trial under antiterrorist legislation or preventive
 detention laws. AI said it was concerned that these laws
 lacked legal safeguards required by international human rights
 standards and-that they allowed people to be detained for
 nonviolently expressing their opinions.
 Exile is not practiced as a punishment in India. Forced labor
 is in effect prohibited by constitutional provisions
 establishing the "right against exploitation" as a fundamental
 right of Indian citizens. It is not used as a form of
 punishment,-.
 I
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Indiin Criminal Procedure Code provides for open trial in
 most cases but allows the judiciary, under certain
 circumstances, to hold closed proceedings. Such circumstances
 include proceedings involving official secrets or trials in
 which statements prejudicial to the safety of the State might
 be made. Sentences must, however, be announced in public.
 Generally, legal procedures assure a fair trial, although the
 process can be drawn out. Defendants have the right to choose
 counsel from an Indian bar that is fully independent of the
 Government. Effective appeal channels exist at all levels of
 
 
 1153
 INDIA
 the judicial system. In 1987 the judicial authorities in
 Punjab had difficulty in bringing to tr. a1-leither alleged
 terrorists who had been charged or police offenders.  \
 Government officials claim they are unable to find witnesses
 willing to testify against terrorists and have thus far been
 unable to find a way to overcome this impediment
 There were no reports of any prosecutions in,1987 un er the
 1984 Terrorist Affected Areas Act, which provided for special
 courts and judicial procedures in areas with widespread and
 prolonged civil disturbances, including in camera review and
 the shifting of the burden of proof to the defendaq4
 The judiciary is independent from the executive branc h  f
 government. Indian judges are selected by the Law Ministry
 following consultations with the Chief Justice of the Supreme
 Court. Islamic religious law governs some noncriminal matters
 concerning Muslims, including divorce.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,'or
 Correspondence
 Under Indian law, warrants are normally required for searches
 and seizures. In ; criminal investigation, however, police
 may conduct searches without a warrant if there would be undue
 delay but must justify such searches in writing. Under the
 Disturbed Areas Legislation, the authorities continue to have
 special powers in Punjab to search and arrest without a
 warrant and to shoot to kill under certain circumstances.
 They have also been granted increased telephone surveillance
 powers. Surveillance of communications, including tapping of
 telephones and intercepting personal mail, is authorized "on
 the occurrence of any public emergency or in the interest of
 the public safety or tranquillity." Censorship of mail is
 legal in certain circumstances, such as in a public emergency.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and expression are protected by the Constitution.
 Consequently, Indian newspapers reflect a variety of political,
 social, and economic beliefs. The Government controls the
 allocation of newsprint, however, as well as-the placement of
 government and public sector advertisements and has been
 accused of using these to exert influence over the press.
 The Government leaves the press free to print all but the most
 sensitive political and security stories, which come under the
 purview of the Official Secrets Act. In an incident which
 attracted international attention, 11 offices of the Indian
 Express, a major daily and leading press opponent of the
 Gandhi administration, were raided on September 2 by
 government inspectors looking for evidence of financial
 violations. The Express charged the Government with
 attempting intimidation, an accusation supported by other
 newspapers and press organizations. Express operations in New
 Delhi were affected in late 1987 by an employees' strike,
 which had political overtones, and by a government attempt to
 cancel the lease on its office building. The strike has ended,
 and the Express' Delhi edition has resumed publication.
 Various legal issues are under litigation. Two Indian states,
 Tamil Nadu and Bihar, tried in 1987 to introduce bills in their
 legislatures to curb press freedom; these bills met vehement
 opposition from journalists and the public. A Bombay high
 
 
 1154
 INDIA
 court ruling in October upheld press freedom against a
 government challenge under the Monopoly and Restrictive Trade
 Practices Act.
 There have bben occasional reports of journalists being
 assaulted in small Indiaiii -cities'*because their stories clashed
 with local political interests,
 Films are reviewed by a film censorship board before being
 licensed for distribution. The board deletes material deemed
 too violent or offensive to either public morals or to
 religious or communal sentiment.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right of peaceful assembly and
 the right to form associations, including unions. These
 rights are respected. Government authorities sometimes
 require permits and notification prior to holding parades and
 demonstrations. At times of civil tension, local governments
 can ban public assemblies and impose a curfew. Ordinarily,
 local governments respect the right to protest peacefully,
 including such traditional Indian forms of protest as "gherao,"
 in which~an office is surrounded by protesters who allow nobody
 to enter or leive, and sit-downs blocking public thoroughfares.
 The Industrial Disputes Act of i947 and the Indian Trade Union
 Act of 1926 established the right for labor to organize,
 bargain collectively, and strike. Under the Essential
 Services Maintenance Act, the Government can ban strikes and
 require conciliation or arbitratibn in 16 essential industries.
 Five percent, or approximately 14 million, of India's work
 force belong to labor unions. This represents roughly half of
 the workers in the so-called modern industrial sector of the
 economy. Four-fifths of India's work force, however, is in
 the rural sector, where organization is difficult. The
 Government, labor unions, and employer organizations all play
 a role.in developing labor policy and industrial relations
 norms.
 Unions and professional bodies are free to maintain contact
 with international bodies. The Indian National Trade Union
 Congress and the Hind Mazdoor Sabha are affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The
 All-India Trade Union Congress, associated with the Communist
 Party of India, is affiliated with the Soviet-supported World
 Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU); the Centre of Indian Trade
 Unions, associated with the Communist Party of India (Marxist),
 attends WFTU meetings as an observer. In recent years, Indian
 unions have complained several times to the International
 Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee on Freedom of
 Association, charging violations of ILO conventions and
 recommendations. The Government has cooperated in the
 committee's investigations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 India is a secular state in which all religious groups have
 the full right to worship freely. Government policy does not
 favor any one religious group, but communal tensions based on
 religious differences continue to be a social problem and pose
 challenges to the overall secular posture of the Indian polity.
 There is no bar to proselytizing by Indian Christians, but the
 Government limits the number of foreign misssionaries. During
 
 
 1155
 INDIA
 1987 the governments of Madhya Pradesh and Bihar requested
 that visas not be extended for several foreign missionaries
 working in those states. In Bihar confrontations have
 persisted between Christian missionaries and Hindu
 fundamentalists. Indian religious organizations may maintain
 communication with coreligionists abroad. Financial
 contributions from abroad are subject to scrutiny aiid
 licensing by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Indian citizens enjoy full freedom of movement within the
 country, except in certain sensitive border areas for which
 special permits are required. Foreign travel and emigration
 are without political restrictions. Millions of people of
 Indian origin live abroad.
 Foreigners (including diplomats) must obtain special
 permission to visit Punjab and Assam and are prohibited from
 visiting other sensitive border areas. Foreign journalists
 accredited to India may tiavel to Punjab without prior
 permission.
 India admitted millions of refugees and displaced persons at
 the time of partition in 1947 and accepted most for
 citizenship, integrgating them fully into Indian society.
 Subsequent migration has largely been the result of upheavals
 in nearby countries,'and the refugees in this'migration have
 generally not been granted citizenship or been fully
 integrated. In most cases both the refugees and their hosts
 consider their stay temporary, although it may be for a very
 long time. 'The most'recent migrations have been of
 Bangladeshi Chakmas (estimated as high as 50,000 persons) into
 northeastern states and Tamils from'Sri Lanka into Tamil
 Nadu. The Assam state government has undertaken to identify
 "foreigners" who have entered that state with a view towards,.
 repatriating them. Tamils from Sri Lanka in Tamil Nadu are
 provided shelter and subsistence by the Government. The
 recent , ccord between India and Sri Lanka, aimed at settling'
 the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict, calls for repatriation of
 these refugees.
 In addition, several thousand Afghans have entered India since
 the Soviet invasion in 1979. India does riot recognize them as
 refugees, but there has been no forcible repatriation and the
 office of the'United Nations High Commissioner 'for Refugees in
 New Delhi provides them with a living allowance. Many have
 traveled onward from India tp third countries. India continues
 to provide humanitarian assistance to the laige-and vigorous
 Tibetan exile community in Dharmsala (northern India) and
 elsewhere in India.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 India is governed under a complicated but democratic
 parliamentary system. The Constitution provides for full
 adult universal suffrage. Elections are held regularly. A
 parliament can be constituted for.not more than 5 years.
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the President can declare
 "President's rule," i.e. a state of emergency, in any state in
 the event of war, external aggression, .internal disruption,
 collapse of the constitutional machinery in any state, or
 
 
 1156

 financial biefkdoin of th6 central or any state government.
 Under Pregfdent'irule, the central Government, through the
 Parliament and'the Peesident, dired9li controls the state,
 replacing the elece'd -state government. It was imposed in
 Punjabiri iiy'an'Jnas extdnded by Parliament fOr another 6
 months in November.
 Although the ruling Congress (I) Party holds a firm majority
 of seats in Parliament And in 12 of Ipdiats 25 state
 governments, it faces an articulate and active, if fragmented,
 political opposition. Partids represent a broad range of the
 political spectrum and a full mix of ethnic, linguistic, and
 religious outlooks.

 women die earlier'thandmn, and-there has been a-declne in
 the ratio of women to men in the population. Female literacy
 is substantially lower than the national average of 36
 percent." These fact6rs relate to the traditionally higher
 economic and social value placed upon males and the relative
 neglect given women's nutritional, health, and educational
 needs. Government figures indicate that crime against women
 is also rising rapidly.
 In recent years, attention has been focused on the incidence
 of "dowry deaths," i.e., deaths under suspicious circumstances
 of womenunable to provide the additional dowry sometimes -
 demanded by the husband's family after marriage. In late
 1986, the Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961 was strengthened.
 Increasing attention'to this phenomenon has encouraged police
 
 
 1157
 INDIA
 to investigate these cases as murders rather than accidents.
 (Government figures for the first half of 1987 show 423 cases
 of unnatural death of married women in New Delhi, 300 of which
 were by burning.) Attention to conditions for women in India
 was dramatically focused in September by the illegal-"sati,"
 or self-immolation, of a young widow in Rajasthan, which was
 subsequently glorified at gatherings of enormous crowds of
 Rajput men and women. The sati, and the state government's
 slow response, was condemned with equal vehemence by women's
 groups and most of India's elite. A strengthened state
 ordinance against abetting and glorifying sati has been
 promulgated, and the central Government has passed new
 legislation outlawing'the practice.
 There are no legal barriers to female candidates for public
 office, although their numbers'have remained small since
 independence. The late prime minister, Indira Gandhi, was a
 woman, and there are moderate numbers of women in both houses
 of Parliament.
 Government programs designed to improve the lot of the
 so-called scheduled castes, i.e., prQtectedlower-caste Hindus
 who make up 15 percent of the population, have met only
 partial success. In some cases, upper-caste communities have
 mobilized against the upward mobility of the disadvantaged,
 with violence sometimes resulting. Political controversy
 surrounds the question of which lower castes, tribes, and
 classes-should be granted preference in education, employment,
 and housing. This violence and controversy relates in part to
 perceived threats to the economic position of the higher-caste
 groups. In recent years, the central Government has
 increasingly attempted to strengthen the legal protection
 accorded to these underprivileged and often victimized
 groups. In several, states, the system of reservations for
 disadvantaged castes is manipulated for political gain by
 party and community leaders.
 Minority religious groups continueto charge they are victims
 of discrimination. Sikhs traditionally have been fully
 integrated into Indian society and have been notably
 successful in agriculture and the professions, particularly
 the armed services. Terrorist violence, however, has
 increased tensions and distrust between Hindu and Sikh
 communities. The police forces have been unable to contain
 random Hindu retaliation against Sikh terrorism, but there is
 no evidence to support the charge of government instigation of
 this-violence during 1987. in response to the activities of
 Sikh militants in Punjab and elsewhere, the Government has
 taken measures to control terrorism. Although they are
 treated equally under the law, Sikhs, particularly young
 males, continue to be subjected to more rigorous security
 precautions than others in certain circumstances (e.g.,
 airport security).
 CONDITIONS OF' LABOR
 Although India is a leader in legislation protecting labor,
 certain categories of'labor abuse remain common. Bonded
 labor, illegal since 1976, continues. Most commonly, bondage
 arises from debt incurred at usurious rates and continued
 through a lifetime of renewal of these debts. Bonded laborers

 Forced lbbor has been defined by a Supreme Court decision as
 labor for remdneration at!-less than the minifaum'wage. Under
 this definition, forced labor is widespread throughout India,
 especially in-rural areas.- Minimum wages, however, are
 established by the states through wage'advisory board  for
 "nonmodern? SectorS-such as agriculture. Minimum wages vary
 widely from state to-state," and'enforcement-of even these low
 wage rates is poor." Central"govdrnment figut4s~show that,
 overall, 37.4-percent of the populati6n'lives below the
 poverty line (1984 figures). The poorest state by this
 measure is Bihar (49.5 percent). 'In many more modern
 industr'ies,"wage iates are set through 'collective bargaining
 of employers and trade unions, reflecting'supply and demand.

 The Factories!Act,f 1948 established an*8-hour workday, a
 48-hour workweek, and minimum stafidards fbr occupational
 safety and health. These standards are generally enforced and'
 accepted in the m6dern industrial sectors but are less
 accepted in older, less cost-effective ihdustries. Standards
 are generally not observed in small industries, largely
 because of the'rapid growth in this sector and the small'
 number of labor-inspectoks.
