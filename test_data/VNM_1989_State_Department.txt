 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) proclaims itself a
 proletarian dictatorship in its 1980 Constitution. It is an
 authoritarian state ruled by the Vietnamese Communist Party
 (VCP) through a 13-member Politburo and a Communist Party
 Central Committee of approximately 173 members nominally
 -,elected by a party congress held every 5 years. Government
 policies, carried out under the Council of Ministers, reflect
 gui'delines-if not specific directives--laid down by the VCP
 Politburo.
 Stroiig-,ationalism has characterized Vietnam's tistory and
 culture'Tof more than '1,000 yeats. Resistance against Chinese
 encroachment from the north and expansion at the expense of
 declining civilizations (the Cham and Khmer)-to the south and
 west have resulted in cultural and political differences
 between southern and northern Vietnamese. Most of the
 political leadership comes.fromnorthern Vietnam. The
 northern,,Communi-st core.views other regional, religious, and
 ethnic groups with suspicion. The northern Vietnamese
 political leadership has also long considered Indochina as a
 single strategic-unit in'terms of military security.
 The security apparatus consists of civil and military elements
 under the-control of the Government.end' Communist Party.-
 Police and-nonmilitary law enforcement officers are-controlled
 both by-the Government.(Ministry of Interior) and the Party.
 Both Interior Ministry and police officials generally are
 responsive-to Communist Party directives and influence, the
 Minister himself'being'a member of the. Politburo. -,The
 'il'itary security apparatus is subject to a similar system of
 party and governmental control. The Ministry of the Interior,
 through its various agencies, has a decisive influence on
 government employment,.business licensing, and travel.
 Although it is now easier for average Vietnamese to open a
 business or hold private property, the Government continues to
 regulate private enterprise through complicated bureaucratic
 procedires.           , ..
 Abuses of.h'hman rights'.include brutal treatment of persons,
 arbitrly-"detentons, absence of faiT trials, denial ,of
 privacy,' and severe restrictions n freedom of speech and
 press,  stsmbly and association,.rmovement, worker rights, -and
 the:rilght;of citizens to-change their'government. Restrictions
 -bn trav'eIabroad-wereifutther relaxed in 1989 and, during the
 first half of the year, there was some greater freedom of
 expression in literature and the press, but there were signs
 of a,rore restrictive policy in the second half. In July the
 Goverhment dgrded to-pexmit emigration of the vast majority of
 former reeducation center, detainees and their families,
 Vietnam claims .it withdrew its remaining troops from Cambodia
 *in September after a decade of-occupation but continued to
 obstruct efforts to achieve a comprehensive solution to the
 Cambodia problem, effectively denying Cambodian political
 rigbts'-ï¿½ Also,, there were few -new releases of political
 prisoer; -during 1989;- the Government has stated it will not
 discuss the :rele'ase.of-.the last 127 i'nmates incarcerated since
 1975 in its reeducation centers.

 RESPECT FOR HUM4AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Relatives of reeducation camp detainees as well as inmates
 released in 1988 have reported that guards sometimes shot to
 death those attempting to escape. Other prisoners reportedly
 have died of malnutrition, exhaustion, and other effects of
 extreme prison conditions. Statistics on the number of deaths
 of political prisoners in reeducation camps are not available.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no recent evidence of political abductions by
 government security organizations and no reports of
 disappearances or hostage-taking by forces resisting
 government authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There are credible and consistent reports from refugees
 concerning the severity of conditions in reeducation camps and
 prisons. The authorities have attempted to produce conformity
 among detainees through confinement, hard labor,
 self-criticism, and indoctrination. Detainees face
 substandard nutrition, poor or nonexistent medical care, and
 severe and often arbitrary punishment for minor infractions of
 camp rules.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although the Vietnamese legal system ostensibly contains
 procedural safeguards for citizens against arbitrary
 government behavior, in fact, they are meaningless. Public
 security officials are required to obtain warrants to arrest a
 person for a major crime, including alleged political
 offenses, but the officials are not required to show these
 warrants to those they apprehend. Officials can hold suspects
 for an indefinite period. Refugees have reported that
 authorities sometimes wait several months before notifying
 relatives of those arrested of the charges and location of the
 detainee.
 According to refugees, since 1979 the normal practice has been
 to conduct summary trials of those apprehended on political
 charges, imprison them for several months, and then move them
 to reeducation camps. Reports indicate that inmates
 considered particularly recalcitrant are sent to penal rather
 than reeducation camps. The Government has said it
 incarcerated some 100,000 persons in reeducation centers
 following the Communist victory in 1975. The Government draws
 a distinction between reeducation centers (trung tam) for
 those associated with the former regime in the South, and
 reeducation camps (trai) for those detained after
 consolidation of VCP power throughout the country. In 1988
 the Government declared that all of the center inmates and
 their families would be released and permitted to emigrate.
 As of mid-1989, the Government stated that only 127 persons,
 mostly former high-ranking South Vietnamese military officers
 and government officials, remain in reeducation centers and
 will not be released until they are reformed. The Government
 
 
 1013
 VIETNlA1
 has announced numerous amnesties over the past 13 years, but
 none during 1989.
 For criminal acts, a suspect may be apprehended on a warrant
 which stipulates the nature of the crime and which authorizes
 detention for 2 months prior to trial. A 2-month extension of
 the detention period may be obtained on application. There is
 no provision for bail or legal counsel prior to trial.
 Some former prisoners have reported that they were kept
 incommunicado for relatively short periods of time, but there
 is no evidence that any prisoners have been detained
 incommunicado throughout their confinement. Exile is not used
 as a matter of public control.
 In December 1988, Vietnam signed a Memorandum of Understanding
 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 which included a pledge to waive prosecution and punitive
 measures for persons who departed the country illegally and
 who return under the UNHCR voluntary repatriation program.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Vietnamese court system consists of the local people's
 courts, military tribunals, and the Supreme Court, which can
 review cases from either of the lower courts. In addition,
 the National Assembly or Council of State may decide to
 establish special tribunals, which may be superior to the
 Supreme Court, if the National Assembly so chooses. In
 addition, local mass organizations are empowered by the
 Constitution to deal with minor breaches of law or disputes.
 Although technically judges in all regular courts are elected,
 candidates for election as judges are selected by the Party
 organization and are therefore not independent. At present,
 Vietnam has a penal code and family law but no labor or civil
 law codes.
 Trials are generally public, with legal counsel provided to
 defendants. Acting for the Government, "people's assessors"
 present the evidence against the accused. Defense counsel is
 supposed to ensure that proper legal procedures are followed,
 in accordance with the defendant's rights under the
 Constitution, and to explain the proceedings to the
 defendant. However, the defense counsel is not an advocate
 for the defendant.
 Sentencing is highly arbitrary, despite existing sentencing
 guidelines. For example; according to various reports, the
 sentences for former South Vietnamese officials--though never
 formally tried--correlated directly to rank and position
 held. Former intelligence and psychological warfare officers
 were given longer than normal sentences. Court officials take
 bribes to reduce sentences.
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of political
 prisoners. In addition to the 127 inmates who the Government
 admits remain in reeducation centers, there are certainly many
 others detained for political reasons.
 
 
 1014
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In 1989 the Government continued to operate a nationwide
 system of surveillance and control through household
 registration and party-appointed block wardens who use
 informants to keep track of each person's activities. It
 works imperfectly in southern Vietnam, however, partly because
 of a shortage of trusted party workers. In the recent past,
 the security apparatus has reduced overt control efforts,
 particularly over persons who have no ties to the previous
 southern regime and who express no opposition to the current
 Government. In addition, according to refugees, the
 population is increasingly able to circumvent security
 restrictions through bribery of party and government
 officials. To enhance public control, the Government
 established "People's Security Units" in some localities
 during 1989.
 There have been reports of official and nonofficial security
 wardens conducting searches of homes, sometimes with warrants
 issued by the authorities. There-continue to be reliable
 reports that Ministry of the Interior officials inspect and
 sometimes confiscate mail and packages sent to Vietnam,
 particularly those sent to politically suspect persons. Some
 of the outgoing mail is subject to inspection and censorship.
 Vietnamese are prohibited from receiving many publications
 from abroad; nevertheless, they are widely available on the
 black market.
 Nearly all Vietnamese are obliged to belong to one or more
 mass organizations. There are mass organizations for villages
 and city districts, for school or work (trade union), for
 youth, women, etc. These mass organizations disseminate
 propaganda and policy guidelines, support party-sanctioned
 activities, and play an active watchdog role. Not only is
 membership virtually compulsory, but attendance at meetings is
 advisable to prevent either being singled out for criticism or
 to protect family members from criticism. Membership in the
 Communist Party is essential for advancement in the state
 sector. No opposition political activity is tolerated.
 Communist Party General Secretary Linh attacked proponents of
 a multiparty system at the Seventh Central Committee Plenum in
 August 1989 and vowed that opposition political parties would
 never be permitted in Vietnam.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Vietnamese Constitution theoretically provides for freedom
 of speech and of the press; but in practice such freedoms are
 severely limited. Some visitors to Vietnam in 1989 reported
 that persons they met were more willing to express critical
 views--even in the presence of others--than in previous years,
 but public criticism of government and party rule is not
 tolerated.
 The Government owns and operates broadcast media and does not
 permit airing of opposing views. The Government prohibits
 persons from importing or viewing many foreign films.
 However, continuing a trend of the past 3 years, foreign films
 were widely available in VCR format on the black market,
 especially in the south.
 
 
 1015
 VIETNAM
 The Ministry of Culture and Information and Communist Party
 ,organs-control all newspapers, books, and other publications,
 as well as all cultural exhibitions. In many Vietnamese
 publications, criticism of the .Party and the Government is
 allowed only within limits set by the authorities,
 highlighting alleged cases of government corruption, for
 example. During the past 2 years, Saigon Giai Phong, a Party
 daily newspaper in the south, and Tuoi Tre, the publication of
 the Youth Union of Ho Chi Minh City, had increasingly
 criticized government officials and policy. The editors of
 both newspapers were suddenly replaced in August 1989.
 Observers agree that since mid-1989 press news reports and
 commentary have been more restricted.
 - b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of assembly is restricted in law and in practice.
 Persons wishing to gather in a group are required to apply for
 a permit. Permits are issued by local authorities, who often
 do not follow uniform procedure, According to refugees, in
 some localities citizens-must obtain permission for gatherings
 of over.three people.
 Nongovernmental organizations, such as church groups, are
 permitted but they can meet only for approved and narrowly
 defined.objectives, such as-religious services. Religious
 organizations were permitted-to maintain affiliation with
 coreligionists in foreign countries. Opposition political
 parties or organizations are-not permitted.
 For a discussion of-freedom of association as it applies to
 labor, unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Continuing a trend of the past 2 years, the Government
 continued to ease'previous restrictions on religious
 activities. There were no reports of arrests or trials of
 religious figures in 1989. Persons are permitted to attend
 religious services, although there are reports that government
 officials are.present,.to observe who attends the services.
 Seminaries and other places of religious instruction continued
 to operate. Travel abroad for religious reasons or to meet
 with coreligionists was eased considerably for most persons.
 Foreign religious figures could travel freely to Vietnam
 during 1989. However, the Government continues to prohibit
 proselytizing and restrict the movement of some clerics.
 The Government has been concerned that religious groups could
 become seedbeds of subversion and political opposition. It
 has consistently attempted to divide and control religious
 groups, in part by establishing government-controlled
 policymaking bodies such as the Catholic Patriotic
 Association. The Government has attempted to.prevent the
 growth of religious groups by inhibiting the publication of
 religions materials and the training of new clergy. The New
 Testament is availible and several American nongovernmental
 organizations were allowed to import small numbers of Bibles
 in 1989.
 Buddhism is the dominant religion in the country- According
 to some estimates nearly half of the population of Vietnam is
 Buddhist. The Government has claimed that only 6 million
 Vietnamese are practicing Buddhists. Up to another 6 million
 of the population (9 percent) reportedly are Catholic.
 
 
 1016
 V1ITAM
 Adherence to a religion is not compatible with membership in
 the Communist Party, which espouses atheism. Nevertheless,
 visitors to Vietnam report that attendance at religious
 services seemed to grow in 1989. They reported that even
 government officials, who in previous years feared losing
 their jobs if it was known that they attended religious
 services, show no such inhibitions now.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel was freer within the country in 1989, continuing a
 trend of the past 2 years. Vietnamese are required to obtain
 permission to change their residence, but most reports concur
 that this was less difficult during 1989.
 In early 1988, the Government announced that it would
 authorize private travel abroad for education, tourism,
 medical treatment, and visits to close relatives. Such travel
 would be restricted to 3 months, except in the case of travel
 for education or medical treatment, and violators would be
 barred from further travel for 3 to 5 years. Observers report
 that the Government still restricts temporary travel abroad,
 but made exit permits available to a large number of passport
 holders during 1989.
 The Government continued to permit emigration for family
 reunification and of Amerasian Vietnamese and their close
 family members. Vietnamese who emigrate are generally free to
 return to Vietnam. In mid-1987 Vietnam relaxed its
 restrictions on tourist permits for those who had fled the
 country clandestinely, prompted in part by the need to earn
 foreign exchange. Now, only those who allegedly committed
 "serious crimes" are not allowed to visit. There is no
 evidence of mistreatment of repatriates. In late 1988 Vietnam
 signed a Memorandum of Understanding with UNHCR to increase
 acceptance of voluntary repatriates, provided there was
 financial assistance. In June 1989, Vietnam joined in the
 adoption of the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) at the
 International Conference on Indochinese Refugees in Geneva.
 Under the CPA, the Vietnamese agreed to encourage volunteers
 to return from first-asylum camps throughout the region.
 Nearly 1,000 volunteers from Hong Kong were expected to return
 by the end of 1989. UNHCR has reported no sanctions against
 the voluntary returnees. In September 1989, five Vietnamese
 volunteers who returned.from Malaysia were detained for 2 days
 upon arrival in their home village. Local authorities had not
 been informed of their planned return and jailed the
 repatriates before central authorities intervened. These
 returnees are now fully integrated and freely exercising their
 trade as fishermen.
 In a significant positive development, in July 1989 the
 Vietnamese agreed in bilateral talks with the U.S. Government
 to permit emigration of former reeducation center detainees
 and their families. Interviews of former detainees by U.S.
 consular and immigration officers began in October in Ho Chi
 Minh City. The first departures for the United States were
 scheduled to occur in January 1990.
 Sixty-five percent more Vietnamese refugees left Vietnam
 clandestinely during 1989 than in the previous year. Many
 people continued to use the established land routes through
 Cambodia and passage by boat across the Gulf of Thailand to
 various Southeast Asian first-asylum destinations. Others
 
 
 1017
 VLIETNAM1
 traveled overland through China or made their way in small
 boats along the Chinese coast to Hong Kong, which experienced
 an 87-percent increase in its arrival rate. Poor economic
 conditions, especially in the north, exacerbated the outflow.
 Since the occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam, large numbers of
 Vietnamese have settled in Cambodia. Although some of these
 persons are former residents who fled during the period of the
 Lon Nol Government (1970-75) and later during the rule of the
 Khmer Rouge (1975-78), others are first-time settlers.
 In June 1988, Vietnam adopted a new nationality law. It
 stated that those who wished to divest themselves of
 Vietnamese citizenship could renounce it formally but that the
 Government would need to approve the request.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are not free to change their Communist-dominated
 government. All authority and political power is vested in
 the Vietnamese Communist Party. Political opposition is not
 tolerated, nor are there any other political parties. The
 Politburo of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Communist
 Party is the supreme decisionmaking body in the nation. The
 Politburo's powerful Secretariat oversees day-to-day
 implementation of directives.
 Debate of government policies or criticism of the role of the
 Party is not permitted. Citizens may vote for members of the
 National Assembly, ostensibly the chief legislative body, but
 in fact subordinate to the Party. From the single list
 presented to them, voters may only strike out the names of
 candidates for whom they do not wish to vote. In several
 cases during the most recent elections for the National
 Assembly, however, no candidate received sufficient votes and
 it was necessary to hold follow-up elections with new
 candidates. These were held in November and the vacant seats
 filled.
 The Vietnamese Party hierarchy expressed alarm over the
 disintegration of party rule in Eastern Europe and implicitly
 has criticized Moscow's reaction. The leadership clearly is
 worried about the ramifications for its controlof a populace
 long disillushioned with the VCP's rule. As a result, there
 has been a more marked doctrinaire approach in opposition to
 political reform, even though the economic renovation policy
 remains in vogue.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not cooperate with international human
 rights groups and strongly resents criticism-of its human
 rights policies.
 Foreign delegations and journalists who have been allowed to
 visit reeducation camps (no visits in 1989) have been shown
 only model camps. Former detainees have described extensive
 preparations to beautify camps prior to visits, temporary
 removal of most detainees during visits, and careful briefing
 of-the "remaining detainees by Communist Party cadres on what
 to tell delegation members. The Government does not permit
 the existence of private human rights groups in Vietnam.
 
 
 1018
 VIETNM
 Vietnam generally does not participate in international human
 rights activities and prohibits such contact by private
 citizens. For example, in late 1988 two brothers were
 convicted and imprisoned for disseminating information on
 political prisoners to overseas human rights organizations.
 In 1988, however, the Government permitted the Vietnamese Red
 Cross to participate in international meetings and, in a
 meeting with a senior U.S. Government official in July 1989,
 the Vietnamese Red Cross proposed expanded cooperation with
 its U.S. counterpart in assisting persons seeking missing
 relatives, including those in reeducation centers.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Gradual assimilation and cooption appear to be the
 Government's long-term strategy for most minorities. The
 Government has created special schools in the Hanoi area to
 train minority cadres to be the "eyes and ears" of the Party
 among their own people. Highland minorities in central
 Vietnam are subject to repression if suspected of ties with
 resistance groups. Officially programmed resettlement of
 ethnic Vietnamese into the highlands is designed in part to
 increase government control over minority groups. Minorities
 in the south, such as the Chinese and the Indians, have been
 encouraged to leave the country. Since the adoption of
 economic reforms, however, the Government has valued the
 entrepreneurial skills of the Chinese population and has
 allowed a limited renaissance of private enterprise in Cholon,
 Ho Chi Minh City's Chinatown. It has also permitted the
 reopening of private Chinese-language schools.
 People released from reeducation camps face considerable
 discrimination, according to refugees. They do not regain
 their citizenship rights until 1 year after leaving the camps,
 if then. Ih addition, their children generally are not
 allowed to attend college.
 According to a Western academic specialist on Vietnam, the
 passing grade needed on entrance examinations is lower for
 children of party officials. It is arbitrarily set high
 enough to keep the children of suspect background (e.g.,
 officials of the former South Vietnamese Government), out of
 university. Study abroad is also restricted to politically
 acceptable persons.
 Women do not appear to face discrimination in general
 employment. No statistics are available on the percentage of
 women in the work force, or on women's occupations.
 There are no statistics available on the frequency of violence
 against women within the home. However, in 1987 Premier Do
 Muoi issued a decree banning spouse beating.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Vietnamese workers are not free to form or join unions of
 their own choosing. All workers automatically become members
 of the "union" in their workplace, and dues are deducted from
 their pay. These groups are organized by the Government and
 belong to the government-controlled Federation of Vietnamese
 Workers which is affiliated with.the Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions. Strikes are considered
 
 
 1019
 unpatriotic and officially forbidden; none are known to have
 taken place in 1989. Vietnam is not a member of the
 International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Vietnamese workers do not have the right to organize unions of
 their own choosing or to bargain collectively. No law
 protects against antiunion discrimination by employers against
 union members and organizers; in the context of mandatory
 union membership the concept is meaningless. In Vietnam, if
 one rifuses to participate in the workplace union activities,
 one risks punishment. There are no export processing zones in
 Vietnam.
 c. Prohibition of Forced of Compulsory Labor
 Compursory labor'is permitted by the Constitution, which
 states in Article 58 that "people fit for work must work as
 provided by law." Refugees report that every Vietnamese is
 required by law to contribute 15 days of work per year to the
 State or to pay a fee. In addition, unemployed persons,
 especially unemployed young people, are compelled to work in
 exchange for small wages and food. A number of government
 projects have used forced labor provided by reeducation camp
 prisoners.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 According to existing regulations inherited from the former
 French colonial administration, the minimum age for workers in
 Vietnam is 17. Refugees report that children under age 15 are
 exempt from compulsory'labor requirements.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government inherited from the former French colonial
 administration a system of regulations pertaining to working
 conditions, including a minimum wage, a maximum workweek of 8
 hours per day, 6 days per week, and safety standards.
 However, except for some safety ptandards, these regulations
 have not been updated since at least 1975, nor are existing
 standards enforced universally, if at all. As a result, for
 example, the minimum wage is so low as to be meaningless. Pay
 is generally low in Vietnam, inadequate to  ovide the vast
 majority of workers'and their families a decent living.
 Moreover, wages frequently are paid late, sometimes by as much
 as several months. According to reports from refugees, nearly
 all wo'eers dxperiehce delayed paydays in, their workplace.
 Observers agreethat doctors, nurses, and teachers are most
 often the victims of delayed paydays. Possibly as a result,
 many ate'reportedly leaving these professions, and there is
 currenily a'n acute hortage of teachers.
 Such safdty standards as exist are developed joihtly between
 the Ministry of Labor and worker organizations at individual
 workplaces. Enforcement of the standards is uneven at best.
