 MACAU
 Macau, a 13 square mile enclave on the south China coast is recognized by both
 China and Portugal as Chinese territory under Portuguese administration. The 'Or-
 ganic Statute" of 1976, which serves as the constitution, grants it considerable ad-
 ministrative, financial, and legislative autonomy. Both the Governor and the Legis-
 lative Assembly exercise legislative power. The Governor, apointed by the Por-
 tuguese President, holds extensive powers under the Organic Statute.
 Under the 1987 Sino-Portuguese joint declaration, Macau will become a Special
 Administration Region (SAR) of China on December 20, 1999, and operate under the
 principle of 'one country, two systems," to remain unchanged for 50 years. The fu-
 ture constitution, a joint Sino-Portuguese document called the "Basic Law," was pro-
 mulgated on March 31 1993
 Portuguese metropolitan law serves as the basis for the legal system, which fea-
 tures a judiciary and jury trials. The police force maintains public order and is
 under civilian control
 The market-based economy is fueled by legalized gambling, which generates ap-
 proximately one-half of government revenue. A thriving tourist industry and the ex-
 port of textiles and other light industrial products also contribute to economic
 growth. An international airport opened in December 1995 and is expected to pro-
 mote economic growth. The economy provides a high standard of living for its citi-
 zens.
 Although citizens derive a wide range of rights and freedoms from Macau's status
 as a Portuguese territory, they have limited ability to change their government. Vot-
 ers directly elect only one-third of the legislators, and the territory's future path has
 been set by Lisbon and Beijing. Legislation, effective in November 1995 provided
 greater equality in the work force or women. Although China, through the Basic
 Law, agreed to continue the application of international covenants on civil and polit-
 ical rights and on economic, social, and cultural rights after 1999, human rights ac-
 tivists remain concerned that China made no obligation to submit regular reports
 in these areas. There are credible reports that media self-censorship continues on
 issues considered to be sensitive to China.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punzshment.-
 Such abuses are prohibited by law, and the authorities respect this in practice. Pris-
 on conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government permits
 visits by human rights monitors. Human rights groups have expressed concern that
 there has been no agreement to date witiun the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison
 Group on the application to Macau of the Covenant against Torture and Other
 Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, although both Portugal
 and China have ratified the covenant.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal prohibitions against arbitrary ar-
 rest exist, and the authorities respect them in practice. The examining judge, who
 conducts a pretrial inquiry in criminal cases, has a wide range of powers to collect
 evidence, order or dismiss indictments, validate and maintain the detention of sus-
 pects, and determine whether to release accused persons. Police must present per-
 sons remanded in custody to an examining judge within 48 hours of detention. The
 accused's counsel may examine the evidence. If the judge is not convinced that the
 evidence is adequate, he may dismiss the accused.
 A 1995 Maca Supreme Court ruling upholding a Portuguese Constitutional
 Court decision on the unconstitutionality of extraditing individuals to countries that
 practice the death penalty, clarified policy towarda people alleged to have committed
 commercial or criminal violations in China. This ruling followed international criti-
 cism of the involuntary transfer to Chinese authorities of an Australian citizen of
 Chinese ancestry in 1994. The authorities investigated this matter and claimed to
 have found no evidence of police misconduct. Human rights activists assert that in
 numerous cases in the past, the police had "transferred" detainees to China, despite
 the absence of a Sino-Portuguese extradition treaty. The authorities have suggested
 that three persons affected by the 1995 court ruling could be tried in Macau for the
 crimes they allegedly committed in China, using evidence and witnesses furnished
 by China. Chinese officials on the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, however,
 criticized the decision by the Macau Supreme Court, arguing that because Macau
 
 
 1072
 is considered to be a part of China, no formal extradition arrangements are nec-
 essary for the transfer of prisoners wanted by China.
 Forced exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TWal.-Changes to the judicial system in 1993 designed
 to render the system autonomous from the Portuguese system-required to bring
 the system into line with the structure for the judicial system specified in the Sino-
 Portuguese Basic Law-raised some concerns among human rights observers and
 journalists. Prior to the reorganization, the judiciary had only subordinate (first in-
 stance) courts located in the territory. In the first stage of the reforms, new courts,
 most notably a Supreme Court of Justice, were established to allow appeals to be
 heard locally.
 The Superior Court consists of six magistrates broken down into two panels, one
 of which hears only administrative, fiscal, and customs duties cases; the other over-
 sees all other cases. An additional judge serves as President of the Court. Cases be-
 fore the Supreme Court are heard initially by the relevant panel of three judges.
 In instances where a judgment has been rendered by such a panel and subsequently
 appealed, the case is then heard by all six judges, with the President voting only
 in case of a tie. This structure results in a situation where three of the individuals
 hearing an appeal have already rendered an opinion in the initial judgment, which
 critics charge calls into question the objectivity of the subsequent ruling. Until full
 autonomy of the Macau courts is achieved, however, some special appeal cases may
 still be either presented directly to courts in Portugal or sent to them through a
 local court.
 Journalists and human rights activists have also voiced concerns that, as a result
 of the 1993 reforms, judges and public prosecutors are now appointed by the Gov-
 ernor based on proposals made by two administrative boards of the judiciary. The
 Supreme Council of Justice, recommends judges for appointment to the Macau Su-
 preme Court as well as the local attorney general, and the Judiciary Council of
 Macau, which recommends judges for the common courts and delegates to the public
 prosecutor's office. In particular, critics charge that the strong ties members of the
 latter group have to the executive branch and to China raise questions about the
 independence of the judiciary, particularly as judges and public prosecutors rely on
 the Judiciary Council to win renewal of their 3-year assignments. The 3-year ap-
 pointment of judges differs from the practice in Portugal, where appointments are
 generally for life.
 The law provides for a fair trial, and this is generally observed. The Constitution
 provides for the right of access to law and the courts, and the authorities respect
 this right in practice.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Laws
 provide for the inviolability of the home and of communication, the right of owner-
 ship of private property and enterprises, and the freedom to marry and raise a fam-
 ily. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these rights, and the Gov-
 ernment respects them in practice. However, some journalists andhuman rights ac-
 tivists believe that the practice of media self-censorship is increasing as reversion
 approaches. Critics charge that the leading newspapers are pro-China publications
 that do not give equal coverage to liberal and pro-democracy voices. Chinese and
 Portuguese journalists and legislators have expressed concern over a draft law pro-
 posed by the Government in June to create a press council to monitor and advise
 the Government on press issues. Critics charge that the proposed makeup of the
 p ress council-a judge from Maca's Judiciary Council, three legislators from the
 slative Assembly, two persons appointed by the Governor, and three individuals
 chosen by the other members of the council-excludespress professionals, and the
 closed meetings of the council could lead to an erosion ofpress freedoms.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Portuguese law as extended to Macau provides for free-
 dom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice. Human rights
 oups have expressed conern, however, that the Legislative Assembly thus far has
 ed to entrench these rights in local law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreisn Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 p atriation.The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.

 The Government has assisted in the resettlement of Vietnamese boat people. At
 year's end, there were only six Vietnamese refugees living in Macau. All other boat
 people have emigrated to host countries.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights:- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have a limited ability to change their government. The 23-member Legis-
 lative Assembly is composed of 8 members elected in universal direct elections; 8
 indirectly elected by local community interests; and 7 appointed by the Governor.
 The Consultative Council, an advisory group to the Governor composed of elected
 and appointed members, also provides some measure of popular representation. By
 tradition the Government also consults informally on a regular basis with local busi-
 ness and cultural leaders. Although the Legislative Assembly can enact laws on all
 matters except those reserved for-bodies inPortugal or the Governor, in reality the
 Governor initiates the vast majority of legislation, either directly through "decree-
 laws" or in the form of "proposals of law" that require that he receive the permission
 of the Legislative Assemnbly prior to issuing legislation. While the Legislative As-
 sembly has the legal power to refuse to ratify laws issued by the Governor, in prac-
 tice this is seldom done.
 Elections were held on September 22 for the Legislative Assembly. There was a
 large voter turnout with nearly 75,000 residents, 64 percent of the electorate, going
 to the polls. The elections were generally fair and open, although there were some
 charges of vote buying and other irregularities.
 Although women traditionally have played a minor role in local political life, they
 increasingly are being found in senior positions throughout the administration. The
 Legislative Assembly currently has three female members including the President
 of the Assembly, which is the second moat senior position. Other high-level positions
 in the ministries, including education and statistics, are filled by women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and
 publishing findings on human rights cases.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 While the Constitution does not explicity Prosribe discrimination based on race,
 sex, religion, disability language, or social status, it does incorporate the principle
 of nondiscrimination. Separate laws provide for many of these rights. Access to edu-
 cation, for example is stipulated for all residents regardless of race, religious belief
 or political or ideological convictions under the law which establishes the general
 framework for the educational system.
 Women.-Violence against women is not common. For cases that are reported, the
 authorities enforce crmial statutes prohibiting domestic violence and prosecute
 violators. Police and torsors report abuses to the Social Welfare Department, which
 investigates them. If hospital treatment is required, a medical socal worker coun-
 sels the victim and informs her about social welfare services. Until their comlaints
 are resolved, battered women may be placed in public housing, but no facilities are
 reserved expressly for them.
 Women are becoming more active and visible in business and government, and
 some enjoy considerable influence and responsibility in these areas. Equal oppor-
 tunity legislation  enacted in 1995, applicable to all public and private organiza-
 tions, mandates that women receive equal pay for equal work, states that discrimi-
 nation based on sex or physical ability is not permitted, and establishes penalties
 for employers found to be in violation of these guidelines.
 Chilren.-The Government has not promulgated any statutes specifically to pro-
 tect the rights of children, relying on the general framework of civil and political
 rights legislation to p rotect all citizens. However, the Government seeks to protect
 the health and well-ben of children, who represent a growing share of the popu-
 lation. The Social Welfare Institute is charg ed with implementing programs de-
 signed to provide services for children. A government-spnsored panel, set up to
 study the provision of social services to Chinese families, recommended in 1995 that
 greater effort be expended to address the need for additional educational and other
 services for children.
 Child abuse and exploitation are not widespreadprblenis.
 People With Disabilities.-The extent to which physically disabled persons experi-
 ence discrimination in employment, education, and the prvision of state services is
 not known. The Government gives little attention to the subject, and there is little
 funding for special programs aimed at helping the physically and mentally disabled
 
 
 1074
 better access to employment, education, and public facilities. The Government
 t mandated accessibility for the disabled, legislatively or otherwise.
 ationa/Racial/Ethnic Minoritiea.-Although the governmental and legal systems
 place a premium on knowledge of the Portuguese language, which is spoken by less
 than 4 percent of the population, the Chinese language received official status in
 1993, and the use of Chinese in the civil service is growing. By the end of May, local
 Chinese accounted for only one half of the 951 senior government posts and none
 of the top 30 positions.
 There is considerable public pressure for the Government to speed up the process
 of making the civil service more representative of the population; however, the pace
 of adding native-born Chinese speakers to the senior civil service has been very
 slow.
 Setion 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Portuguese Constitution recognizes the right
 and freedom of all workers to form and join trade unions and of private sector
 unions to strike, and these rights are extended to Macau. The Government neither
 impedes the formation of trade unions nor discriminates against union members.
 _Human rights groups are concerned that no similar rights and protections have
 been incorporated into local law.
 People's Republic of China interests heavily influence local trade union activities,
 including the selection of union leadership, and stress the importance of stability
 and minimum disruption of the work force. Nearly all of the private sector union
 members belong to a pro-China labor confederation. Many local observers claim that
 this organization is more interested in furthering the Chinese political agenda than
 in addressing trade union issues such as wages, benefits, and working conditions.
 A few private sector unions and two of the four public sector unions are outside Chi-
 nese control. Although the Portuguese Constitution rovides workers with the right
 to strike, labor leaders complain that there is no efective protection from retribu-
 tion should they exercise this right.
 Unions may freely form federations and affiliate with international bodies. Three
 civil services unions are affiliated with the major non-Communist Portuguese union
 confederation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively-Unions tend to resemble lcal
 traditional neighborhood associations, promoting social and cultural activities rather
 than issues rating to the workplace. Local customs, moreover, normally favor em-
 ployment without the benefit of written labor contracts except in the case of labor
 from China. Unions traditionally have not attempted to engage in collective bargain-
 inag. Portuguese laws protecting collective bargaining apply, and the Government
 does not impede or discourage such activity. No rules apply to the setting of wages.
 A significant amount of the total work force (approximately 16 percent) is com-
 posed of laborers from China and other ountries who fil both blue- and whit-collar
 positions. These workers often work for less than half the wages p aid to a Macau
 citizen performing the same job, live in controlled dormitories, work 10 to 12 hours
 a day, and owe large sums of money to the labor-importing company for the pur-
 chase of their job. Labr interests claim that the high percentage of imported labor
 erodes the bargaining power of local residents to improve working conditions and
 increase wages.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination, and there were no complaints of it.
 There are no export processing zones; Macau is a free port.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsoy Labor--Compulsory labor is illegal and
 does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law forbids minors under the
 age of 16 to work, except in businesses operated by their families. The Labor De-
 partment enforces this law and refers offending employers to the judicial authorities
 or prosecution. The Laber Department claims that the incidence of child labor has
 declined radically since effective enforcement began in 1985. School attendance is
 not compulsory.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-No minimum which exists for local or foreign
 workers. In the absence of any statutory minimum wage or publicly administered
 social security programs, some large companies have provided private welfare and
 security packages.
 Labr legislation provides for a 48-hour workweek, an 8-hour workday, overtime,
 annual leave, medical and maternity care, and employee compensation insurance.
 Although the law provides a 24-hour rest period for every 7 days of work, worker
 representatives report that workers frequently agree to work overtime to com-
 pensate for low wages. The Department of Lbor provides assistance and legal ad-
 
 
 1075
 vice to workers on request, but government enforcement of labor laws is lax because
 of limited resources.
 The Department of Labor enforces occupational safety and health. Failure to cor-
 rect infractions leads to government prosecution. Although a recent law states that
 employers should provide safe working conditions, no guarantee exists to protect
 employees' right to continued employment if they refuse to work under dangerous
 conditions.
