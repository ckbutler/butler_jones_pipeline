 KIRIBATI
 Kiribatils,33 islands, scattered across an enormous area of
 the central Pacific, total about 750 square kilometers and are
 populated by about 63,000 people.- Most of the people are a
 Micronesian and Polynesian mixture. Kiribati gained full
 independence from the United Kingdom in 1979 and became a
 republic within the Commonwealth of Nations. It has a
 nationally elected president and a 35-member legislative
 assembly elected by universal suffrage. The economy is very
 small; the majority of the population is engaged in subsistence
 agriculture and farming. Isolation and meager resources,
 including poor soil and limited arable land, severely limit
 prospects for economic development. Fishing is viewed as one
 of Kiribati's few economic hopes. There were no important
 human rights issues in 1987.

 interests. There are no significant restrictions in practice.
 The right to strike is provided-for by law. However, strikes
 are rare, the last one having taken place in 1980. Kiribati
 has a relatively strong and effective trade union movement.
 In 1982 the 7 trade unions registered in Kiribati merged to
 form the Kiribati Trade Union Congress (KTUC). It has
 approximately 2,500 members, most of them drawn from the
 public service. The XKTUC is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions and is involved in an
 ongoing trade union education program under the auspices of

 "government" faction in parliament generally has consisted of
 those representatives chosen by the President for cabinet

 KIRIBATI
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 race, creed, or national origin. Traditional culture in which
 males are dominant has been an impediment to women taking a
 more active role in the economy. This is slowly changing, and
 more women are finding work in the unskilled and semiskilled"
 occupations. There were no reports of discrimination in the
 provision of social services by the Government. Education is
 free and compulsory through the first six grades.
 CONDITiONS OF LABOR
 Kiribafi law prohibits the employment of children under age 14.
 Children age 15 are prohibited from industri~l employment and
 employient aboard ships. Males under  age 16 may not be
 employed ih mines. Males under age 18 are prohibited from
 employment at'night and may not work aboard ships unless
 suitably traihed and certified medically fit. Females may not
 work at night except under specified circumstances (g~nerally
 in service jobs such as h6tul clerks). Women-are provided up
 to 12'weeks of maternity luave and are entitled to not less
 than 25 percent of their regular salaries during such leave.
 Nursing women are allowed one-half hour twice a day during
 working hours to nurse a child.
 Employment laws also provide basic health and safety'standards
 for the workplace. Employers must, for example, provide an
 adequate supply of clean water for their workers and must
 ensure the existence of sanitary toilet facilities. Employers
 are liable for expenses of workers injured on the job.  The
 Government's ability to enforce employment laws is constrained
 by a lack of qualiffed enforcement personnel, a situation it
 is attempting to remedy by improvements in training of the
 relevant personnel. Although legislation authorizing the
 Government to set minimum wages exists, it has not been
 implemented yet. The Government is reviewing an ILO-funded
 study on procedures for establishing minimum wages.
