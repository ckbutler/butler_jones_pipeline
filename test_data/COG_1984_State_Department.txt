 CONGO
 The People's Republic of the Congo is officially a
 Marxist-Leninist state. It has a single legal party, the
 Congolese Labor Party, which controls the policies and
 leadership of the Government, the media, and the military. The
 party also directs the national organizations of various social
 groups such as workers, farmers, women, the elderly, and
 youth. The executive organ of the party is its 75-member
 central committee which elects a president, who serves as
 President of the Republic and chief of state, head of
 government, and president of the Council of Ministers. He also
 selects the 13-member political bureau, the key policymaking
 group. Within the central committee, members from the northern
 regions of the country are in the majority and hold the balance
 of power, even though they are a minority of the population.
 The military and security services are also firmly under the
 control of the northerners, and they ultimately hold the key to
 power in the Congo. Decisions are made at the top and executed
 through the party and its control over the organs of
 government. The need to maintain consensus among the political
 leaders representing areas traditionally in conflict provides a
 check on arbitrary policies.
 The third Party Congress in 1984 was marked by three major
 trends: :the consolidation of presidential power, a
 -strngthening of the party organization, and an effort to
 reinforee the role of the formal organs of government. Other
 decisions approved by the party congress included the
 establishment of a constitutional council to rule on the
 constitutionality of laws and treaties, and the limitation of
 the jurisdiction of the "revolutionary courts' to acts against
 the security of the state. Other crimes against the state,
 such as fraud in state enterprises, were transferred to the
 regular judicial system with its procedures and safeguards.
 The security apparatus, which is under the direction of the
 presidency, is patterned after those in Eastern Europe but is
 less pervasive. Its principal objective is to protect the
 state, e.g., to watch for any possible political dissident
 activity.
 While not politically free, the Congolese go about their daily
 lives with a minimum of government or police interference.
 Although there have been scattered incidents of terrorism
 during the last couple of years, terrorism is not generally a
 problem and the crime rate is relatively low. Contact between
 Congolese and foreigners is open, and the Congolese, while
 refraining from direct political criticism of the Government,
 discuss economic and social problems with frankness and
 objectivity. The tendency in the country is toward a more open
 society and expanded contacts with the West, particularly given
 the need for foreign investment and technology.
 The Congo has a mixed economic system--state and private, With
 a per capita gross national product of roughly $1,360, the
 Congo is relatively prosperous, with about three-fifths of
 government receipts coming from oil revenues. The country has
 experienced a real economic growth rate of eight percent per
 year since 1979.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 During 1984 there were no reported instances of killing for
 political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1984 there were no reported instances of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The practice of beating suspects at police stations and the
 state security offices in the course of interrogations is not
 uncommon. Neither is it uncommon for the public and the police
 to beat thieves caught red-handed. Two Zairian thieves were
 reportedly beaten to death last year. There continue to be
 occasional cases of militiamen harassing both Congolese and
 foreigners. This harassment takes place in many instances to
 obtain money, cigarettes, beer, and the like. However, the use
 of militiamen is steadily decreasing as trained police assume
 an increased and improved role.
 Prison conditions in general are poor, and there is a lack of
 adequate food, hygiene, and medical care. Prisoners generally
 have access to family, friends, attorneys, and others. In the
 past, political prisoners have been held incommunicado.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Whereas the Constitution guarantees protection against
 arbitrary indictment, arrest, and detention, in practice a
 warrant is not required to make arrests. There is a habeas
 corpus provision, but in cases involving the security of the
 state, people arrested can be held without a court hearing.
 Individuals detained for non-political offenses are entitled to
 an attorney and are judged by a generally impartial judiciary.
 Given the slow pace of administrative processing, even though
 the Government has taken steps to increase the number of
 magistrates and to improve the processing of cases, persons
 awaiting trial are often detained for considerable periods, and
 sufficient funds for their upkeep have not been budgeted by the
 Government. After the November 1984 release of former
 President Yhomby Opango, the Congo has only one known political
 prisoner--former number two in the party, Thystere Tchicaya.
 He is believed to be under house arrest and is not permitted
 contact with the outside world.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for a Supreme Court which is in
 practice an arm of the Government rather than an independent
 body. By law, the right to a fair and public trial exists in
 all cases, but some prisoners have been held for months without
 trial. The legal system is not insulated from political
 interference. Lawyers are permitted to argue circumstances
 surrounding the case. It is not uncommon to have a higher
 court reverse the verdict of a lower one in the event of
 irregularities.
 
 
 89
 CONGO
 The amended Constitution provides for non-professional judges
 to be elected to any court below the Supreme Court. The stated
 purpose of this change was to "popularize" justice. According
 to the law, any Congolese citizen may now become a judge, but
 can decide cases only in collaboration with trained judges.
 Each nomination must be approved by the party.
 f.   Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence
 There is little interference with privacy, family, home, or
 correspondence by the Government. Individuals are not forced
 to participate in the party or its organs. There are only
 8,600 members in the party out of a population of 1.745
 million. The Constitution provides for the inviolable secrecy
 of mail and all other forms of correspondence except in the
 cases of criminal investigations, defense mobilization, or
 state of war.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are restricted, despite guarantees
 in the Constitution. The state owns and controls the media
 (except for one weekly church newspaper). News reports in the
 government-owned media come from a variety of sources,
 including several foreign press agencies and French satellite
 feeds. The party is selective in the kinds of news and
 information it permits Congolese journalists to publish from
 various outside sources of information. Television viewers
 have access to zairian media programs. While the Government
 keeps control over the press, in practice foreign journalists
 can move freely about the country. Photography, however, is
 subject to security controls, and permits must be obtained even
 for commonplace photos in the cities. The Government allows
 some domestic criticism of policies and programs judged not to
 be politically sensitive, but it does not allow its authority
 to be challenged. Journalists may raise issues and concerns
 only within general guidelines laid down by the party. There
 are regular radio and television programs featuring dialogue
 between journalists and government officials. While these
 discussions are relatively frank, they are limited to specific
 programs and policies already under scrutiny by the
 Government. The state censorship board reviews the content of
 newspapers, movies, books, and records. Publications are
 subject to censorship if they contain articles which are
 critical, are contrary to the image the Government wishes to
 project either internally or externally, or judged to be
 contrary to social welfare. For example, one issue of the
 church newspaper was seized and burned as a result of some mild
 criticism of the third party congress, and a warning to the
 church was later published in the party's official organ. In
 general, however, considerable material which could be censored
 under these guidelines is allowed to circulate.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is limited by the State's
 perceived self-interest. Political meetings are restricted to
 the party and its organizations. Government permission is not
 required for groups to assemble for religious and social
 purposes, but is required for use of official facilities.
 Government authorization is needed to start a formal club or
 organization.

 CONGO
 Given its past active political role, the labor movement is
 closely scrutinized and controlled by the Government and
 party. The Congolese Trade Union Confederation represents
 workers, but as an appendage of the state. Its head is a
 member of the party's political bureau. It is prohibited from
 striking, although wildcat strikes occur with relative
 impunity. The Trade Union Confederation is repreented in
 every ministry and state-owned enterprise and serves on
 mandatory boards which include a union representative along
 with a member of the administration and the party. Known as
 the 'determinant trilogy,' this structure is responsible for
 ensuring that the three major points of view are represented in
 the decision-making process. The local unions within the
 confederation have been able to persuade the Government to
 provide workers with transportation, cafeteria facilities,
 increased medical benefits, vacation time with pay, travel, and
 housing. However, no group is allowed to form an independent,
 alternative union outside the party. Officers of the
 confederation at the national level must be approved by the
 party. The confederation is permitted to maintain relations
 with recognized international organizations such as the
 International Labor Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In theory, freedom of religion is guaranteed by law. In
 practice, party members are prohibited from practicing
 religion. Adherents to the Jehovah's Witnesses are'not allowed
 to exercise their right to worship, allegedly because Witnesses
 do not recognize the authority of the state. Beyond this, the
 party does not normally interfere in religious association.
 The Catholic Church, the largest congregation, maintains a
 seminary for the training of the clergy and has missions all
 over the country. Masses are held in the various local
 languages as well as French. The Catholic church publishes the
 only independent newspaper, La Semaine Africaine. Missionaries
 are active in running private missions and clinics and other
 social services for the handicapped, etc. Some of these
 services are joint ventures between the church and the
 Government. However, many of the former services provided by
 the church have been abolished, and the Government is
 officially atheist. Christmas Day is called Children's Day.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration,-and Repatriation
 The Government exercises limited control over the internal
 movement of its citizens through identification card checks.
 Control points also are manned in Brazzaville and soldiers
 occasionally shoot people who fail to follow their instructions
 or who inadvertently drive into restricted zones at night.
 Congolese citizens who wish to travel abroad require exit
 authorization from the office of State Security. For the
 average citizen this is a fairly routine process.   However,
 those who may be suspected of political motives encounter some
 difficulty. Government employees traveling abroad must obtain
 permission from the appropriate government office. Passports
 must be returned to the state security office after the
 traveler's return.
 Control over foreigners is very tight. Most visas are for one
 entry only, exit visas are required, and almost all long-time
 residents such as missionaries spend considerable time dealing
 with government red tape.
 
 
 CONGO
 The Congo is the home of numerous exiles and refugees, mostly
 from surrounding central African states. Most refugees,
 including some Zairians, are permitted to travel to other
 countries for settlement under the auspices of the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. While refugees are
 usually safe in the Congo, they are subject to surveillance and
 occasional harassment by the Congolese Government.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Congo is governed by an elite group of party and cabinet
 officials. Military officers occupy key positions among the
 ruling group and help ensure its continuation in power. The
 people do not have the right to change the government through
 democratic processes. Opportunities for political involvement
 by Congolese citizens are limited to the Marxist-Leninist
 Congolese Labor Party, including the national, regional, and
 local assemblies and the 'mass' organizations. No other
 political parties are permitted to operate. Party membership,
 which presently numbers approximately 8,600, is highly
 controlled on the basis of loyalty and performance.
 The third party congress in 1984 declared the National Assembly
 the supreme organ of state and the only organ to make law. The
 national, regional, and local assemblies are 'elected" from
 single-party approved lists. While policy decisions are
 usually made by the central committee and political bureau,
 assemblies at the local and regional levels may discuss issues
 before the decisions are made at the national level.
 Representatives of the National Assembly are chosen from all
 walks of life, including traditional leaders, peasants, and
 workers, but selection is made by the party. The Assembly has
 impact on social and some economic issues. In general,
 however, its power to make decisions outside the will of the
 political leadership is restricted. Its decisions generally
 mirror the wishes of the Government.
 The last 'elections* for local, regional, and national
 assemblies, were held in 1984. Opposition groups are illegal.
 Opponents of the Government within the Congo keep a very low
 profile. Occasionally tracts are distributed by opposition
 groups, but they do not appear to enjoy much political support.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has demonstrated some willingness to respond to
 human rights inquiries on a case-by-case basis. Amnesty
 International's 1984 Report (covering 1983) noted that 50
 political detainees had been released. Freedom House rates the
 Congo 'not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 With its small population and relatively high per capita income
 the Congo is one of Africa's more prosperous countries. The
 economy is based predominantly on petroleum, which accounts for
 about 90 percent of export earnings. In 1982 the Government
 inaugurated a five-year plan designed to rationalize investment
 and create a viable economy to sustain the country after the
 depletion of known petroleum reserves. The plan focuses on
 infrastructure, agriculture, forestry, and light productive
 
 
 92
 CONGO
 industry. The Government encourages private investment and
 offers special incentives in areas of prime interest, such as
 forestry and agriculture. The Congo had a real economic growth
 rate of some eight percent a year since 1979, and major urban
 centers appear prosperous.
 There is a marked disparity between urban and rural standards
 of living, however, and resultant heavy migration from the
 countryside. It is estimated that the average per capita GNP
 of rural Congolese, constituting some 60 percent of the
 population, is less than one-twelfth that of their urban
 counterparts. Rural migration is straining social services in
 the cities and depriving the rural areas of farmers.
 Approximately 80 percent of the economy remains in the hands of
 the private sector--predominantly foreign-owned and operated.
 Improvements in health and nutrition have resulted in an
 increase in the average life expectancy to over 61 years. The
 fertility of the soil, abundance of indigenous fruits,
 vegetables, and fish, and the reliability of water sources
 around the country have all fostered a naturally hospitable
 environment for a sparse population. The Congolese diet
 provides 102 percent of caloric requirements, although in rural
 areas, where cassava is the major staple, protein intake is not
 always sufficient. Safe water is available to about 24 percent
 of the total populatioh--approximately 40 percent of the urban
 population, and less than 10 percent of those in rural areas.
 Despite an infant mortality rate of 112 per 1,000, the
 population is now growing at a rapid rate of 3 percent annually.
 The Congolese have tried to maintain the educational system
 left to them by the French after independence, and have a
 historically high literacy rate (variously estimated at between
 50 and 80 percent for the adult population). The emphasis on
 education is high, and many children who do not finish school
 return as adults to continue their studies. Attendance is high
 among both male and female students. There are primary schools
 all over the country, and adjusted primary enrollment,
 including adult enrollment, was estimated at over 145 percent
 of the school age population in cities in 1981, with a lower
 figure in the countryside.
 While northern ethnic groups have the upper hand politically,
 there is little evidence of systematic tribal, ethnic, racial,
 or other discrimination intended to economically disadvantage a
 particular group.
 Under the Constitution, women have the same rights as men in
 the private, political and social domains, and for equal work
 they are entitled to the same social welfare rights. There is
 a disparity, however, between salaries for men and women, and
 women are relegated to a secondary role in society. Five women
 are members of the central committee and one occupies a
 high-level government position as Minister of Basic Education
 and Literacy. In secondary schools increasing numbers of young
 women are enrolled in technical courses, and university
 attendance among women continues to rise.
