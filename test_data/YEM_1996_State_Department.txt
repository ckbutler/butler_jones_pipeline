 YEMEN
 The Republic of Yemen, comprising the former (northern) Yemen Arab Republic
 and (southern) People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, was proclaimed in 1990. Fol-
 lowing a brief but bloody civil war in mid-1994, the country was reunified under the
 rule of the Sanaa-based government. Later in 1994, a new postwar governing coali-
 tion was formed, composed of the General People's Congress (GPO) and the Yemeni
 Grouping for Reform (Islaah). The Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), formerly the main
 party of the south and a previous coalition partner, is now an opposition party.
 Lieutenant General Ali Abdullah Salih is the President and leader of the GPO.
 He was elected by the legislature in 1994 to a 5-year term. However, the Constitu-
 tion provides that henceforth the President will be elected by popular vote from at
 least two candidates selected by the legislature. The 301-seat House of Representa-
 tives was elected in 1993-the first multiparty Parliament elected by popular vote
 and universal suffrage. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for April
 1997. The Parliament is not yet an effective counterweight to executive authority;
 real political power rests with a few leaders, particularly the President. The judici-
 ary, nominally independent, is severely hampered by corruption, executive branch
 interference, and frequent failure of the authorities to impose sentences.
 The primary state security apparatus is the Political Security Organization (PSO)
 which reports directly to the President. It is independent of the Ministry of Interior
 and its leaders are all military officers. The Criminal Investigative Department
 (CID) of the police conducts most criminal investigations and makes most arrests.
 The Central Security Organization (CSO), a part of the Ministry of Interior, main-
 tains a paramilitary force. Members of the security forces, particularly those in the
 PSO, committed human rights abuses.
 Yemen is a poor country with an emerging market-based economy that is impeded
 by excessive government regulation and unchecked corruption. Its annual per capita
 gross national product is estimated at $340. Oil is the primary source of foreign ex-
 change, but remittances from Yemenis working abroad (primarily in Saudi Arabia)
 are also important. Remittances were sharply reduced after Saudi Arabia and other
 Gulf states expelled up to 850,000 Yemeni workers during the Gulf War because of
 the Government's pro-Iraq position. The Gulf States also suspended most assistance
 programs, and much Western aid was reduced.
 The human rights situation changed little in 1996. Problems include violence by
 security forces, which in one incident lead to a killing; arbitrary arrest and deten-
 tion, especially of people still regarded as separatists; significant limitations on citi-
 zens' rights to change their government; infringements on the freedom of speech and
 the press; judicial corruption and inefficiency; and widespread discrimination based
 
 
 1401
 on sex, race, disability, and to a lesser extent, religion. The Government rarely pun-
 ished human rights abusers. Government response to demonstrations in the south-
 ern city of Mukallah in June resulted in several deaths, at least one of which oc-
 curred while the victim was in custody. PSO officers have broad discretion over per-
 ceived national security issues, and, despite constitutional constraints, routinely de-
 tain citizens for questioning, sometimes mistreat detainees, monitor their activities,
 and search their homes. Prison conditions are poor. Female genital mutilation is
 practiced to an undetermined extent by some families; although publicly discour-
 aged, it is not prohibited by the authorities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Police killed several persons during
 demonstrations on June 11 in the city of Mukallah. In addition, one young man ac-
 tive in the Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) died in custody following his arrest for par-
 ticipating in the demonstrations. His body was buried without being returned to his
 family. The Government has not assessed any blame nor punished any member of
 the security forces for this death.
 There were no other reports of political or extrajudicial killings.
 b. Dsappearance.--Security forces continue to arrest and detain citizens for vary-
 ing periods of time without charge or notification to concerned families. Many de-
 tamees, especially in southern governorates, are associated with the YSP and ac-
 cused of being separatists. Most such disappearances are temporary, and detainees
 are released within months. A southern poet and singer whose recorded songs satiri-
 caly criticized government leaders was detained in Apri without charge or notifica-
 tion to his family. He was released in August.
 Hundreds of cases of disappearances dating since the 1970's, implicating the
 former governments of both north and south Yemen, remain unresolved.
 Some tribes, seeking to bring their concerns to the attention of the Government,
 kidnap and hold hostages. Victims include foreign businessmen and tourists, as well
 as Yemenis. Foreign victims are rarely injured. The authorities have succeeded in
 obtaining the fairly quick release of foreign hostages.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution, which asserts that Shari'a (Islamic law) "is the source of all legis-
 lation" is ambiguous on its prohibition of cruel or inhuman punishment. It states
 that tle Government may not impose illegal punishments-a formulation that could
 be interpreted as permitting amputations according to Shari'a. There were, however,
 no reports of amputations.
 Although there is no evidence of the systematic use of torture in detention facili-
 ties, arresting authorities are known to use force during interrogations, especially
 of those arrested for violent crimes. A young man arrested for participating in a po-
 litical demonstration died in custody (see Section L.a.). Authorities still use leg-irons
 and shackles, and flogging is occasionally inflicted as punishment for minor crimes.
 A woman detained in Mukallah in May complained to authorities that she was
 raped by a police officer while being interrogated. Upon making her complaint, she
 was arrested, and charged with prostitution. She was acquitted at her August trial
 while the officer accused of assaulting her was convicted of "abuse of authority" and
 sentenced to prison. The arrest caused riots, which resulted in several deaths.
 Prison conditions do not meet internationally recognized minimum standards.
 Prisons are overcrowded, sanitary conditions poor, an   od and health care inad-
 equate. Inmates must depend on relatives for food and medicine. Prison authorities
 and guards often exact money from prisoners and even refuse to release prisoners
 until family members pay a bribe. Conditions are equally bad in women's prisons,
 where children are likely to be incarcerated along with their mothers. All prison
 guards are male.
 The Government tightly controls access to detention facilities. Nonetheless, it per-
 mits most impartial observers to visit prisoners and detainees, including representa-
 tives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Nongovernmental or-
 ganizations (NGO's) have distributed food, medical supplies, and clothing directly to
 prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-According to the law, detainees must be
 arraigned within 24 hours of arrest or released. The judge or prosecuting attorney
 must inform the accused of the basis for the arrest and decide whether detention
 is required. In no case may a detainee be held longer than 7 days without a court
 order. Despite these constitutional and other legal provisions, arbitrary arrest and
 prolonged detention without charge are common practices. Such practices often re-
 sult, in effect, in the disappearance of such persons (see Section Lb.).
 
 
 1402
 Detainees have the right to inform their families of their arrests and may decline
 to answer questions without an attorney present. There are also provisions for bail.
 In practice many authorities respect these rights only if bribed.
 The Government has failed to ensure that detainees and prisoners are incarcer-
 ated only in authorized detention facilities. The Ministry of Interior and the PSO
 reportedly operate extrajudicial detention facilities. Unauthorized, private prisons
 also exist in tribal areas, where the central Government exercises very little author-
 ity. People detained in these prisons are often held for strictly personal reasons and
 without trial or sentencing.
 In cases where a criminal suspect is at large, security forces sometimes detain a
 relative while the suspect is being sought. The detention may continue while the
 concerned families negotiate compensation for the alleged wrongdoing.
 Thousands of people have been imprisoned for years without documentation con-
 cerning charges against them, their trials, or sentences. While a few such cases
 have been redrssed through the efforts of the Yemeni Human Rights Organization,
 the authorities have done nothing to investigate or resolve the problem. The au-
 thorities continue to detain politically active persons for limited periods of time.
 At the end of the 1994 civil war, the President pardoned nearly all who fought
 against the entral Government, including military personnel and most leaders of
 the unrecognized, secessionist Democratic Rpublic ofTYemen (DRY).
 The Government does not use forced exile. However, the Government denied the
 amnesty to only the 16 most senior leaders of the DRY, who fled abroad. Although
 they were technically not forced into exile, they are subject to arrest if they return.
 After more than a year of postpnment, the Attorny General in November sum-
 moned the 15tobe tried.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution provides for an autonomous judi-
 ciary and independent judges, however, the judiciary is not fully independent.
 Judges are appointed by the executive branch of government, and some have been
 reassigned or removed from office following rulings against the Government. Many
 litigants maintain that a judge's social ties and susceptibility to bribery sometimes
 have greater influence on the verdict than the law or acts of the case. Others main-
 tain tmat judges appinted since mid-1994 are poorly trained and that those closely
 associated with the Government often render decisions favorable to it. The judiciary
 is further hampered by the frequent reluctance of the authorities to implement sen-
 tences.
 There are 2 types of courts: Islamic law or Shari'a courts, which try criminal cases
 and adjudicate civil disputes (such as divorce and inheritance cases), and commer-
 cial courts. There are no jury trials under Shari'a. Criminal cases are adjudicated
 by a judge who plays an active role in questioning witnesses and the accused. De-
 fense attorneys are allowed to counsel their clients, address the court, and examine
 witnesses. Defendants, including those in commercial courts, have the right to ap-
 peal their sentences. Trials are public. However, both Shari'a and Commercial
 courts may conduct closed sessions "for reasons of public security or morals. foreign
 litigants in commercial disputes have complained of biased rulings.
 Female judges who worked in the south prior to the civil war have been re-
 apsinted to positions. There r e no female judges in the north.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privcy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Despite
 constitutional provisions against government interference with privacy, security
 forces routinely search homes and private offices, monitor telephones, read personal
 mail, and otherwise intrude into personal matters for alleged security reasons. Such
 activities are conducted without leg ally issued warrants or judicial supervision. Se-
 curity forces regnlarly monitor telephone conversations and have interfered with the
 telephone service of government critics and opponents. Security forces sometimes
 detain relatives of suspects (see Section 1.d.).
 Section 2. Respect for Cijul Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution restricts the freedom of speech
 and press by allowing it only "within the limits of the law." Although many citizens
 are uninhibited in their private discussions of domestic and foreign policies, some
 are cautious, believing that they may be harassed for publicly expressed criticism
 of the Government.
 The relative freedom of the press experiencedprior to the 1994 civil war has not
 been fully reestablished. Although there were nower official restrictions on news-
 papers in 1996 than in 1995, a level of government pressure on independent and
 political party journals continues that was not present before the civil war.
 The Ministry of Information influences the media by its ownership of the tele-
 vision and radio companies, printing presses, and by subsidies to certain news-
 
 
 1403
 papers. The Government selects the items to be covered in news broadcasts and
 oes not permit broadcast reporting critical of the Government. Even televised de-
 bates in the Parliament are edited to delete the most biting commentary on the Gov-
 ernment.
 Although newspapers are allowed to criticize the Government, journalists some-
 times censor themselves, especially when writing on such sensitive issues as govern-
 ment policies toward the southern governorates, relations with Saudi Arabia and
 other foreign governments, or official corruption. The penalties for exceeding these
 self-imposed limits can be arrest for slander or libel, dismissal from employment,
 or extralegal harassment. In 1995 the Ministry of Information sought a court order
 to close the opposition newspaper A-Shura. The case was decided in favor of the
 paper, which resumed publication in June.
 The Government permitted the independent newspaper AJ-Ayam, whose publica-
 tion had been limited to Sanaa at the end of 1995 to resume publication in Aden.
 The paper was also allowed to import a printing press this year, the first privately-
 owned newspaper in Yemen to own its own press. Despite these positive develop-
 ments, the paper came under pressure to comply with the standards of expression
 adhered to by government papers.
 The independent English-language weekly, the Yemen Times, has frequently criti-
 cized the Government. The management has been periodically subjected to anony-
 mous threats of violence, and government authorities have interfered with the pa-
 per's operations.
 The newspaper AI-Tajammu was denied access to government presses for a period
 of 4 weeks after publishing a story criticizing government policies toward
 Hadramaut Governorate, where there had been increased civil disorder.
 There were reports throughout the year of journalists--particularly in the south-
 being subjected to ninor physical harassment and short periods of arbitrary incar-
 ceration. One such journalist, writing for the YSP paper Al-Thawry, was beaten by
 soldiers in the Parliament building in July
 Customs officials confiscate foreign publications regarded as pornographic or ob-
 jectionable because of religious or political content. In June the Ministry of Informa-
 tion began routinely delaying the distribution of international Arabic-language dai-
 lies, such as AI-Hayat and Ab-Sharq A1-Awsat, in an apparent effort to decrease
 their sales in Yemen. On a few occasions, the Ministry has banned the entry of
 international Arabic publications. In almost all cases, this was because they carried
 news about, or statements by, leaders of the 1994 secession attempt.
 Academic freedom is restricted by the presence of security officials on university
 campuses and at most intellectual forums. Government informers monitor the ac-
 tivities of professors and students. The authorities review prospective university ad-
 inistrator and professors for their political acceptability before they are hired. In
 addition to Government activities, individuals identified with various Islamic politi-
 cal gups are also believed to gather information on the activities of professors and
 students.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although there are no con-
 stitutional restrictions on the right to peacefully assemble, government informers
 monitor meetings and assemblies.
 Demonstrations in May and September in Mukallh protesting government ac-
 tions deteriorated into violence wich resulted in several shooting deaths of both
 demonstrators and security officers. At least one such demonstrator died in custody
 (see Section l.a.).
 The Constitution does provide for the right of association. Associations must ob-
 tain an operating license from the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, usually a
 routine matter.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion, and there are restrictions on
 the practice of other religions. Virtually all citizens are Muslims, either of the Zaydi
 branch of Shi'a Islam or the Shafe'ei branch of Sunni Islam. There are also some
 smaii in the north. Private Islamic organizations may maintain ties to pan-Is-
 amic organizations and operate schools, but the Goverment monitors their activi-
 ties.
 Most Christians are foreign residents, except for a few families of Indian origin
 in Aden. There are several churches and Hindu temples holding regular services in
 Aden, but no non-Muslim public p laces of worship in the former north Yemen.
 Church services are, however, regularly held without harassment in private homes
 or facilities such as schools.
 Nearly all of Yemen's once sizable Jewish population have emigrated. There are
 some restrictions on those Jews who remain (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Mocement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriaion.-The Government does not obstruct domestic travel, although the army
 
 
 1404
 and security forces maintain checkpoints on major roads. Likewise, the Government
 does not obstruct foreign travel or the right to emigrate and return. Women must
 obtain permission from a male relative before applying for a passport or departing
 the county, although enforcement of this restriction is irregular. The Constitution
 prohibits t e extradition of a citizen to any country.
 The Government cooperates with the office of United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 The Government has provided de facto first asylum to approximately 30,000 in
 1996. There are no reports of forced return of perons to a country where they
 feared persecution. The UNHCR is negotiating with the Government to improve the
 living conditions of the more than 50,000 Somali refugees in Yemen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Government is accountable to the Parliament, there are significant
 limitations on the ability of the people to change their government. Although inter-
 national observers judged the 1993 parliamentary elections as generally free and
 fair, to date the Parliament is not an effective counterweight to executive authority;
 it does little more than debate issues. Decisionmaking and real political power still
 rest in the hands of relatively few leaders, particularly the President.
 The President has the authority to introduce legislation and promulgate laws by
 decree when Parliament is not in session. Decrees must be approved by Parliament
 30 days after reconvening. In theory, if a decree is not approved, it does not become
 law; in practice, a decree remains in effect even if not approved. The President ap-
 points the Prime Minister, who forms the Government. The Cabinet comprises 24
 ministers; the majority of ministers come from the GPC and the remainder from
 Islaah.
 In some governorates, tribal leaders retain considerable discretion in the interpre-
 tation and enforcement of the law. Central government authority in these areas is
 often weak.
 There is a functioning multiparty system. All parties must be registered in accord-
 ance with the Political-Parties Law of 1991, which stipulates that each party must
 have at least 75 founders and at least 2,500 members. In preparation for the 1997
 parliamentary elections, 10 political parties have been registered under the law with
 6 more applications pending at year's end.
 The Constitution prohibits the establishment of parties that are contrary to Islam,
 oppose the goals of the Yemeni revolution, or violate Yemen's international commit-
 ments. The Government provides financial support to all parties represented in Par-
 liament. The parties are permitted to publish their own newspapers.
 Although women may vote and hold office, these rights are limited by cultural
 customs. Only 2 women have been elected to the 301-member Parliament, and few
 hold senior leadership positions in the Government or political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Yemeni Human Rights Organization (YHRO) is the best known local non-
 governmental human rights group. It is headquartered in Sanaa with branches in
 seven other cities. While the Government does not overtly restrict its activities, its
 senior staff are subject to petty harassment from the authorities and its work has
 subsequently decreased during the year. Another group, the Yemeni Organization
 for the Defense of Liberties and Human Rights, is based in Aden but has also been
 less active than in the past. There is a Human Rights Committee in Parliament,
 which has investigated some reports of human rights abuses. It suffers from lack
 of official and financial support and has no authority to do anything other than
 issue reports.
 Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch observe Yemen closely. There
 is an International Committee of the Red Cross representative resident in Yemen.
 The Government has given these groups relatively broad access to government offi-
 cials, records, refugee camps, and prisons.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Prior to 1994, the Constitution stated that "no discrimination shall be practiced
 due to sex, color, racial origin, language, occupation, social status, or religious be-
 liefs." However, as amended in 1994, the Constitution now states that "all citizens
 are equal in general rights and duties." There is widespread discrimination based
 on sex, race, disability, and to a lesser extent, religion.
 Women.-Although spousal abuse occurs, it is undocumented and difficult to
 quantify. In Yemen's traditional society, an abused woman would be expected to
 
 
 1405
 take her complaints to a male relative (rather than the authorities) who would in-
 tercede on her behalf or provide her short-term sanctuary if required.
 Women face significant restrictions imposed by law, social custom, and religion.
 Men are permitted to take as many as tour wives, though few do so for economic
 reasons. The practice of dowry payments is widespread, despite efforts to limit the
 size of such payments. Husbands may divorce wives without justifying their action
 in court. Following a divorce, the family home and children (who are older than a
 certain age) are often awarded to the husband. Women also have the right to di-
 vorce, in accordance with the precepts of Shari'a. Women seeking to travel abroad
 must obtain permission to receive a passport and to travel from their husbands or
 fathers and are expected to be accompanied by male relatives.
 Islamic law permits a Muslim man to marry a Christian or Jewish woman, but
 no Muslim woman may marry outside of Islam. Married women do not have the
 right to confer citizenship on their foreign-born spouses; they may, however, confer
 citizenship on children born in Yemen of foreign-born fathers.
 An estimated 80 percent of women are illiterate, compared with approximately 35
 percent of men. In general, women in the south are better educated and have had
 somewhat greater employment oportunities. Since the 1994 civil war, however, the
 number of working women in the south appears to have declined, in part due to
 the stagnant economy, but also because of increasing cultural pressure from the
 north. Nevertheless, female judges, magistrates, and prosecutors in southern
 governorates have been reappointed.
 The Government has established a women s association to promote female edu-
 cation and civic responsibilities, and a nongovernmental organization has also been
 established for the same purpose.
 Children.-While the Government has asserted its commitment to protecting chil-
 dren's rights, it lacks the resources necessary to ensure adequate health care, edu-
 cation, and welfare services for children.
 Child marriage is common, especially in rural areas. Although the law requires
 that a girl be 15 years of age to marry, it is not enforced. Marriages of 13-year-old
 girls are not unusual. The Government has cooperated with foreign embassies in
 cases involving dual national girls brought back from overseas for forced marriages.
 Female gemtal mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is practiced
 by some Yemenis, particularly those of African origin living mainly in the coastal
 areas. It is not known to exist among the majority Zaydi and Shafi'i populations.
 There is no available information on its extent. While some government health
 workers actively and publically discourage the practice, the Government has not
 passed legislation outlawing it.
 People With Disabilities.--There are distinct social prejudices against persons
 with mental and physical disabilities. The disabled often face discrimination in edu-
 cation and employment. The Government has not enacted legislation or otherwise
 mandated accessibility for the disabled nor provided special clinics or schools for
 them. Mentally ill patients, particularly those who commit crimes, are imprisoned
 and even shackled when there is no one to care for them. There is a charity project
 to construct separate detention facilities for mentally disabled prisoners.
 Religious Minorities.-Apart from a small but undetermined number of Christians
 and Hindus in Aden, and a few Baha'is in the north, Jews are the only indigenous
 religious minority. Their numbers have diminished dramatically due to voluntary
 emigration. Jews are traditionally restricted to living in one section of a city or vii-
 lage and are often confined to a limited choice of employment, usually farming or
 handicrafts. Jews may, and do, own real property.
 Christian clergy who minister to the foreign community are employed in teaching,
 social services, and health care. A hospital in Jibla operated by the Baptist Church
 has, in the past, experienced occasional threats and harassment from local Islamic
 extremists who feared that the hospital may be used to spread Christianity. Since
 an August 1995 incident of mob violence at the hospital, which was eventually con-
 trolled by the authorities, the hospital has not been threatened. Mother Theresa has
 active charity operations in three cities.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Yemenis with a non-Yemeni parent, called
 "Muwalladin," may face discrimination in employment and in other areas. Persons
 seeking employment at Sanaa University or admission to the military academy
 must by law demonstrate that they have 2 Yemeni parents. Nonetheless, many sen-
 ior government officials, including Members of Parliament and ministers, have only
 one Yememd parent. In some cases, naturalization of the non-Yemeni parent is suffi-
 cient to overcome the "two-Yemeni parent" requirement.
 A small group believed to be descendants of ancient Ethiopian occupiers of
 Yemen, who were later enslaved, are considered the lowest social class. Known as
 
 
 1406
 the 'akhdam" (servants), they live in squalor and endure persistent social discrimi-
 nation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that citizens have the
 right to form unions. A March 1995 law governs labor relations. It provides workers
 with the right to strike and equal labor rights for women, and it renews the freedom
 of workers to associate. The Labor Law does not stipulate a minimum membership
 for unions, nor does it limit them to a specific enterprise or firm. Thus, Yemenis
 may now associate by profession or trade.
 The Yemeni Confederation of Labor Unions (YCLU) remains the sole national um-
 brella organization. The YCLU claims 350,000 members in 15 unions and denies
 any association with the Government, although it works closely with the Govern-
 ment to resolve labor disputes through negotiation. Observers suggest that the Gov-
 ernment likely would not tolerate the establishment of an alternative labor federa-
 tion unless it believed it to be in its best interests.
 By law, civil servants and public sector workers, and some categories of farm
 workers, may not join unions. Only the General Assembly of the Yemeni Confed-
 eration of Labor Unions may dissolve unions.
 Three strikes occured during the year, negotiated solutions resolved two of them.
 However, a strike by Hodeidah port workers against the private companies for
 which they work was declared illegal by the Government. The leaders were arrested
 and jailed, breaking the work action. The dispute eventually was resolved through
 negotiation and those imprisoned were released.
 The International Labor Organization cited Yemen this year for not providing
 since 1994 required reports on the freedom of association, the application of ratified
 conventions, and the application of standards.
 The Yemeni Confederation of Labor Unions is affiliated with the Confederation
 of Arab Trade Unions and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The new Labor Law provides
 workers with the right to organize and bargain collectively. All collective bargaining
 agreements must be deposited with and reviewed by the Ministry of Labor. Unions
 may negotiate wage settlements for their members and can resort to strikes or other
 actions to achieve their demands.
 The law protects employees from antiunion discrimination. Employers do not have
 the right to dismiss an employee for union activities. Employees may appeal cases
 of antiunion discrimination to the Ministry of Labor. Employees may also take a
 case to the labor courts, which are often favorably disposed toward workers, espe-
 cially if the employer is a foreign company.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. There were no reports of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Because most Yemeni families
 feed themselves through subsistance agriculture, child labor is common. Even in
 urban areas, children may be observed working in stores, workshops, selling goods
 on the streets, and begging. The established minimum age for employment is 15
 years of age in the private sector and 18 years of age in the public sector. By special
 permit, children the age of 12 to 15 may work. The Government rarely enforces
 these provisions, especially in rural and remote areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law sets monthly and daily mini-
 mum wages, which are incredibly low (as little as $.80 per day (YR 100) and even
 these are not enforced. The minimum wage does not provide a worker and family
 with a decent standard of living. Inflation substantially eroded wages during the
 past few years, but it subsided in 1996.
 The law specifies a 40-hour workweek with a maximum 8-hour workday, but
 many workshops and stores operate 10- to 12-hour shifts without penalty. The work-
 week for government employees is 35 hours, 6 hours per day, Saturday through
 Wednesday, and 5 hours on Thursday.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations and
 can challenge dismissals in court. The law establishes workplace health and safety
 standards which the Ministry of Labor has the responsibility to enforce; however,
 the Ministry's budget does not provide sufficient resources to fulfill its obligations
 under the law. Some foreign-owned companies implement higher health, safety, and
 environmental standards than required in Yemen.
