 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a practicing parliamentary democracy with
 political institutions and traditions rooted in English
 Common Law. In the December 1976 national elections,
 the Government of Prime Minister Manley returned
 to office with an overwhelming majority in Parliament.
 Jamaica's domestic human rights record reflects not
 simply its heritage but a present commitment to an open
 and free society. Manley has repeatedly denounced viola-
 tions of human rights abroad. He has signed the American
 Convention on Human Rights and urged his Caribbean
 colleagues to do likewise.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There have been no reports alleging torture by the
 Jamaican authorities.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been a few unconfirmed charges of cruel or
 degrading treatment or punishment. Conditions within
 Jamaican prisons are relatively good.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 An increase in violent crime in 1976 prompted the Prime
 Minister, with Parliament's consent, to declare a state
 of emergency under which security authorities were granted
 broad powers of search and arrest. The state of emergency
 came to an end June 5, 1977. All persons detained under
 its authority have either been charged with crimes or
 released. Since that time there have been no charges
 of arbitrary arrest or imprisonment.
 In an earlier effort to reduce violent crime, Parliament
 enacted the Gun Court Act (1974) which provided for in
 camera trials and indefinite detention. In 1975, thes-e
 provisions were found unconstitutional by the Privy
 Council sitting in London and were replaced with manda-
 tory life sentences for persons convicted of the illegal
 possession of firearms. The Government has recently
 announced its intention to "streamline" Gun Court proce-
 dures, but at present it is not clear what this will
 mean.

 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons accused of crimes are given a fair public trial.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home appears to be respected.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Prime Minister Manley has publicly committed his Govern-
 ment to a policy designed to meet the needs of the poor
 by "finding jobs for the jobless, shelter for the homeless,
 and food for the hungry." The ability of the Government
 to implement this policy is limited because of the scarcity
 of available resources and severe economic problems.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Jamaicans are free to hold whatever views they wish and
 to express their beliefs openly. There is freedom of
 religion. A recent wave of violent crime prompted the
 Government, in November 1977, to adopt a series of measures
 designed to deal with that problem, including a ban on
 all public meetings. It is too early to judge the full
 impact of these measures. The press continues to represent
 the entire spectrum of political beliefs. A Government
 ban on the printing of inflammatory articles during
 the 1976 election campaign was ignored with impunity
 by one of Kingston's leading papers. Some supporters
 of Prime Minister Manley are calling for more reticence
 on the part of the press. There is concern among Jamaicans
 that the independence which characterizes the press may be
 limited in the electronic media where the Government
 is the sole owner of the radio and television networks.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Jamaicans are free to move within the country and to
 emigrate. However, currency control regulations which
 
 
 allow a Jamaican traveler to carry no more than 50
 U.S. dollars out of the country have cut back the
 number of citizens who can travel abroad.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political process is characterized by hotly con-
 tested free elections and lively Parliamentary debate.
 Labor unions play an important role in Jamaica's political
 life and operate freely.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In October 1976, Amnesty International wrote Prime Minister
 Manley urging that persons detained under the state of
 emergency be tried or released. Mr. Manley has called
 attention to Jamaica's good human rights record and in
 April 1977, he invited Amnesty to visit Jamaica for a
 thorough human rights investigation. The Amnesty Inter-
 national Re ort 1977 stated all persons he   under
 the state of emergency were released following its
 termination.
