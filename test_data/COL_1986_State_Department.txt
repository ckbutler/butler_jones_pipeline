 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a multiparty democracy in which elected
 governments have ruled for all but 4 years (1953-57) of this
 century. While Colombia's two traditional political parties,
 the Liberals and the Conservatives, have dominated the
 political arena since the mid-19th century, smaller parties
 have fielded candidates at all levels and are usually
 represented in Congress, state assemblies and city councils.
 Governors and mayors traditionally have been appointed by the
 President under a constitutional provision requiring "adequate
 and equitable" representation of the major party not holding
 the presidency. However, Liberal President Virgilio Barco
 announced a "party government" after his overwhelming
 electoral victory May 25, 1986. The Conservative Party has
 declined to accept any political or technical positions in the
 Barco Government and has declared itself in "reflexive
 opposition."
 Colombia has a mixed economy in which private enterprise plays
 an active role. The coffee industry, which accounts for one
 half of the country's export earnings, is in private hands, as
 are most entities engaged in manufacturing, agriculture, and
 provision of services. There is a relatively large informal
 economy. State enterprises control domestic participation in
 major export industries such as oil and coal and play a
 deciding role in the electrical and communication industries.
 Notwithstanding its long tradition of electoral democracy,
 Colombia continues to experience high levels of both political
 and criminal violence. For most of the past 35 years, the
 country has lived under a constitutionally authorized state of
 siege to deal with civil disturbances, insurgent movements,
 and, most recently, organized crime. The state of siege
 lifted in 1982 was reimposed in 1984, following the
 assassination of the Minister of Justice by narcotics
 traffickers, and remained in effect through 1986. Except for
 transferring terrorist cases from civilian to military courts,
 the current state of siege has left most civil liberties
 largely unaffected.
 In 1986 various guerrilla groups and drug traffickers, at
 times working in alliance, escalated the already high level of
 violence inColombia, directly challenging the Government's
 ability to maintain order and preserve democratic institutions.
 Their particular target was the judicial branch.
 Under President Betancur (1982-1986), the Colombian Government
 negotiated cease-fire agreements with half a dozen guerrilla
 organizations then active in the country. Although they
 pledged to cease hostilities for 1 year, most insurgent forces
 by mid-1985 had withdrawn from the peace process and returned
 to armed conflict, alleging that the Government was not
 complying with the peace accords. The Revolutionary Armed
 Forces of Colombia (FARC), the largest guerrilla group in
 Colombia, continues to honor the ceasefire agreement with the
 military. In 1985 FARC established a political party, the
 Patriotic Union (UP), and participated in the 1986
 congressional and presidential elections, fielding candidates
 at all levels.
 The 1986 election resulted in a landslide victory for Barco,
 the Liberal candidate, who took office August 7, 1986. During
 the campaign, Barco announced a 6-point peace plan to help end
 Colombia's 20 years of guerrilla violence. The plan calls for
 guarantees for the peaceful exercise of political activity;

 implementation of an agrarian reform; verifiable agreements to
 incorporate rebels who lay down their arms and abandon
 terrorist actions into civil life; government maintenance of
 public order, with strict respect for human and civil rights;
 state mediation in social conflicts, and rehabilitation of
 basic public services, particularly in regions afflicted by
 violence.
 Shortly after assuming office, President Barco named a Special
 Advisor for Rehabilitation, Normalization, and Reconciliation,
 Carlos Ossa Escobar, who immediately met with FARC and UP
 leaders to outline the President's plan. The FARC reacted
 with demands for political and economic reforms;
 .purification" of the armed forces; lifting the state of
 siege; and an end to "death squads." Although Ossa has since
 criticized the FARC for truce-breaking, this first meeting
 opened negotiations between the Barco Government and the
 insurgents. At the end of 1986, prospects for participation
 by the remaining guerrilla groups in the peace process were
 uncertain.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Violence in Colombia has many sources, including guerrilla
 assaults and the response by government forces, political
 assassinations, narcotics traffickers' intimidation, and
 common criminal activity. Victims of political killings
 during 1986 have included political activists, city
 councilmen, labor leaders, and legislators. Political
 violence related to party affiliation in the modern era has
 affected all of Colombia's parties regardless of size or
 power. While the Communist-supported UP party has been a
 principal target of such violence--28 of its activists and
 office holders were killed in 1986--the Liberal and
 Conservative parties have not been immune, suffering the loss
 of 26 Conservative and 15 Liberal activists during the year.
 These murders are under investigation but few persons have
 been arrested or charged. Guerrilla groups are among the
 suspects in politically motivated murders, including those of
 UP politicians; they have also killed many people in rural
 areas to intimidate others to support their activities. There
 have also been allegations that members of the military or
 paramilitary groups were responsible for some of the
 killings.
 The most serious current threat to Colombian human and
 political rights is the campaign of intimidation and murder
 waged by the narcotics traffickers against any and all
 elements opposed to them. Murders attributed to narcotics
 traffickers-during 1986 include several judges, among them a
 Supreme Court magistrate, over 100 police officers, a senior
 customs official, an editor of the oldest and second largest
 newspaper in the country, and a number of private sector
 leaders. An October assassination attempt against a
 congressman opposing legislation favored by the illegal drug
 trade signaled an expansion of the violent campaign to targets
 in the legislative branch.
 In this period of active insurgency, statistics on killings
 and disappearances are unreliable and subject to differing
 
 
 446
 COLOMBIA
 interpretations. While the Permanent Committee for the
 Defense of Human Rights, the major human rights organization
 in Colombia, does maintain statistics, its 1986 report had not
 been issued as of December 31. The Committee's data are based
 on press reports, personal testimony, and complaints filed by
 relatives and friends of alleged victims. The Committee does
 not investigate incidents but conveys the information it
 gathers to the Attorney General's office. Statistics issued
 by Colombian military intelligence for the period January 1
 through October 17, 1986, report the deaths of 131 policemen,
 160 members of the armed forces, 450 guerrillas, and 639
 civilians due to conflicts with the insurgency.
 During the last year, there have been charges that military
 repression exists in Colombia, In July 1986, Amnesty
 International accused the Colombian armed forces of carrying
 out a "dirty war" in Colombia. The organization claimed that
 600 Colombians had been seized and killed in the first 6
 months of 1986 by troops, police, and gunmen working with
 them. Amnesty International alleged that the victims included
 students, teachers, lawyers who defend political prisoners,
 trade unionists, supporters of left-wing opposition parties,
 Indian community leaders, and human rights activists. Amnesty
 International quoted security force spokesmen that many
 assassinations are committed by private "death squads."
 Amnesty International added that death squads, sometimes in
 uniform, use army vehicles, cross army roadblocks without
 being detained, and park in army and police installations.
 The organization asked then-President Belisario Betancur to
 "act urgently to put an end to the assassinations."
 The Government reacted swiftly and strongly to deny the
 charges made by Amnesty International The Ministers of
 Defense and Foreign Affairs stated that Colombia had the
 mechanisms to investigate and punish those responsible for
 violations.
 In September 1986, Americas Watch updated a report published
 earlier in the year claiming that Colombia's armed forces were
 responsible for summary executions, torture, and
 "disappearances" in actions against leftist guerrillas.
 Americas Watch said it has no evidence "establishing high
 command complicity in authorizing abuses," but it blamed the
 high command for failing to put a stop to such practices.
 The Attorney General is legally empowered to investigate and
 prosecute members of the security forces for human rights
 abuses. Cases of alleged abuse by a member of the armed
 forces are investigated and, if substantiated, the persons
 responsible are prosecuted. As an example, on October 30 the
 Government announced that Captain Tomas Ignacio Monroy and
 Sergeant Marco Aurelio Mendoza Mena were convicted following a
 military court martial for responsibility in the murder of six
 peasants near Medellin.
 b. Disappearance
 The Attorney General's office received and investigated
 reports of 181 disappearances between September 1985 and
 September 1986, compared with 344 disappearances in the first
 11 months of 1985. Of those reported in 1986, 11 were found
 alive, one was found dead, and the remaining 169 are still
 missing. Military intelligence reported 139 kidnapings
 through the first 10 months of 1986. It attributed 25
 kidnapings to the FARC, 12 to The National Liberation Army
 
 
 447
 COLOMBIA
 (ELN), 9 to The April 19th Movement (M-19), 5 to The Popular
 Liberation Army (EPL), and 88 to persons unknown, Of these,
 40 victims were freed, 17 were killed, 19 were rescued, and 63
 were still being held. Colombian authorities have a
 commendable record in investigating these crimes and in
 rescuing many victims unharmed.
 No United States citizens were kidnaped in Colombia in 1986.
 However, one of the two kidnaped by the EPL in December 1985
 was released June 3, 1986; the other died May 17 while in
 captivity.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Attorney General investigated 50 cases of alleged torture
 of individuals between September 1985 and September 1986, but
 results of these inquiries had not been made public as of
 December 1986. The results of investigations into incidents
 of torture involving 27 police and armed forces officers in
 1985 had also not been made public by the end of 1986.
 Colombian prisons are notoriously overcrowded and understaffed
 due to the practice of preventive detention and inadequate
 budgets. In most prisons, inmates receive a subsistence diet
 which they must supplement with purchases from prison stores.
 Prisoners with financial resources live better than those
 without means. Family members and friends are allowed to
 visit regularly and to bring food and clothes. Consular
 officers are given regular access to foreign prisoners. Most
 prisoners accused of crimes in connection with guerrilla
 activities are incarcerated in regular prisons, although
 segregated from common criminals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides the right to a judicial
 determination of the legality of detention. A person may be
 arrested if an order of capture (not an arrest warrant) has
 been issued or if caught in the act of committing a crime.
 The police must place the detained person at the order of a
 judge within 24 hours. The judge must hold a preliminary
 hearing, where an unsworn statement is given by the suspect,
 within 48 hours. During or after the preliminary hearing, if
 the judge finds that there is enough evidence to pursue the
 case, he issues an arrest warrant or an order of preventive
 arrest. Preventive arrest is an order to keep the person
 incarcerated until trial. Colombian law stipulates specific
 terms within which a trial must be held or the person is
 released. Colombian law also provides for the granting of
 bail, parole, and probation.
 There are no legal provisions for exile. Forced or compulsory
 labor is legally prohibited, and the prohibition is respected.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative
 branches of government. The rights of public trial and due
 process are guaranteed by the Constitution. Prisoners have
 the right to representation by counsel. If a prisoner does
 not have an attorney, the court will appoint one. However,
 due to the overburdened and underfunded judicial system, the
 widespread practice of preventive detention, and the
 traditional reluctance to grant bail in serious cases, most
 prisoners incarcerated for common crimes never come to trial
 
 
 448
 COLOMBIA
 but are simply released after serving the minimum sentence
 applicable to the crimes alleged. In October 1986, there were
 approximately 27,000 persons in prison, of whom 8,000 had been
 tried and sentenced.
 The existence of a large and powerful narcotics subculture is
 a serious threat to the Colombian judicial system.
 Magistrates, judges, and attorneys have been threatened or
 killed because they were investigating, prosecuting, or trying
 narcotics traffickers or their associates.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution requires a court order before authorities can
 enter a private home, except in the case of hot pursuit.
 While Colombian human rights organizations allege widespread
 violations in the more remote areas, government forces
 generally respect the sanctity of the home and privacy in most
 parts of the country. Persons from rural areas frequently
 claim that they have been forced to leave their farms by
 military counterinsurgency operations, guerrilla conscription
 and confiscation, and by paramilitary thugs hired by local
 landowners.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These constitutionally guaranteed rights are respected as a
 rule, and the press often vigorously criticizes the Government
 and its leaders. The privately owned print media are under no
 governmental restraints and publish a wide variety of
 political views. Television channels are controlled by the
 State, which leases time to private companies and imposes some
 guidelines to insure equal time for political candidates.
 During the 1986 congressional campaign, three leading
 candidates appeared in a debate, and during the presidential
 campaign, the Government insured that each of four announced
 candidates received equal time for a series of national TV
 appearances. A pending electoral reform bill in the Congress
 would guarantee access to the electronic media for all
 political parties.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is generally
 respected. Public meetings and demonstrations are normally
 held without interference. Under the state of siege, prior
 permission is required for demonstrations and is usually
 granted, except when there is a clear and imminent danger to
 public order. During 1986 no marches or demonstrations by
 major groups or parties were banned in the capital, Bogota.
 Some demonstrations were restricted in outlying towns and
 regions afflicted with guerrilla violence.
 Colombian workers enjoy the right to organize and, in the
 private sector, to bargain collectively and strike. Use of
 strikebreakers is prohibited by law, and generous severance
 benefits tend to discourage management from firing union
 militants. However, many provisions of labor law are
 effectively ignored by small and medium-sized enterprises.
 Given a severe labor surplus, unions have limited bargaining
 power and have been unsuccessful in organizing beyond the
 largest firms and the public services. Only about 8 percent
 
 
 449
 COLOMBIA
 of Colombia's economically active population is unionized,
 according to the latest government census of trade unions.
 The country's 880,000 union members are divided almost equally
 between the traditional "confederated" labor sector and the
 leftist "independent" sector. Of the four confederations, two
 are affiliated with the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions, one with the World Federation of Trade Unions,
 and one with the World Confederation of Labor. Some of the
 leftist independent unions are considering affiliation with a
 new labor confederation, ostensibly nonideological but under
 heavy Communist influence.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. According to
 official statistics, 217 different religious sects are
 registered in Colombia. Although an overwhelming majority of
 Colombians are Roman Catholics, no legal discrimination exists
 against any religious group. In practice, however,
 evangelical Christians and other non-Catholic groups operating
 in Colombia have found it difficult to obtain entry and
 resident visas for additional or replacement mission workers.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Colombians are free to leave and return to the country. In
 areas under government control where operations against rural
 guerrilla groups are under way, traveling civilians require
 "safe conduct" passes; guerrillas reportedly use a similar
 means to restrict travel in areas under their control.
 Colombians who have sought and been granted diplomatic asylum
 in foreign embassies have always been allowed to depart the
 country. Expatriates can, by law, repatriate.
 Colombia in the past has accepted refugees; however, because
 of high unemployment and underemployment, the Government is
 increasingly reluctant to accept displaced persons. The
 Government does not involuntarily repatriate asylum seekers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Colombia has a democratic system of government, and elections
 are conducted fairly and openly. Persons are enfranchised by
 the Constitution at age 18. Those convicted of certain crimes
 may be disenfranchised. Public employees are forbidden by law
 to participate in political campaigns but, with the exception
 of military personnel, can vote. Colombian politics are
 dominated by two major parties, the Liberal and the
 Conservative, and each includes elements with widely divergent
 political views. l owever, all parties are free to raise
 funds, field candidates, hold public meetings, have access to
 the media, and publish their own newspapers. The Patriotic
 Union, participating in national elections for the first time
 in 1986, won 3 seats in the Senate and 5 in the House of
 Representatives in the congressional elections Pnd 4.5 percent
 of the vote in the presidential election, the best showing by
 a third party in recent history.
 Legislation providing for direct election of mayors beginning
 in March 1988 was signed into law by President Betancur
 January 1, 1986. Under consideration by the Congress is
 legislation to expand "popular consultation"--popular
 referendums and recall of elected officials. In October the
 
 
 450
 COLOMBIA
 Government proposed a constitutional reform that would provide
 up to six new congressional seats specifically for small
 parties on a national, rather than departmental, basis. The
 draft reform would also increase the number of congressional
 seats for the sparsely settled eastern plains, and would
 permit public financing of election expenses.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Colombia, an active participant in international and regional
 human rights bodies, currently chairs the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission, and has welcomed nongovernmental human
 rights organizations. The Human Rights Commission established
 by the Attorney General in 1985 continues to operate.
 Although it rarely meets as a whole, the assistant Attorney
 General for human rights, a member of the Commission, receives
 and investigates complaints of violations. The Permanent
 Committee for the Defense of Human Rights is the most active
 Colombian human rights organization. Its 94 members include
 members of Congress--a UP senator is the Executive
 Secretary--journalists, labor leaders, and persons in the
 arts, including Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The
 Committee compiles statistics based on press reports and
 personal testimonies, which it turns over to the Government
 for investigation and possible prosecution. It has no staff
 or budget to verify such reports by conducting its own
 inquiries. The Committee's statistics have been used
 extensively by international organizations such as Amnesty
 International, Americas Watch, and the Washington Office on
 Latin America. The Committee also sponsors periodic human
 rights forums in Colombia.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women have equal civil and property rights by law. Their
 economic situation is inferior, however, especially in rural
 areas. Women comprise just over 25 percent of the country's
 economically active population but are concentrated in
 low-productivity, low-income sectors. Historically, the
 unemployment rate for women has been higher than for men, but
 this difference has decreased in recent years. Although
 women, legally entitled to pay equal to that of their male
 counterparts, are normally paid equal salaries when employed
 by the Government, such is not generally the case in private
 industry. As more Colombian women graduate from universities
 and participate in the work force, they are increasingly
 active at all levels of society. A growing number of women
 are receiving higher education. Currently 40 percent of the
 university population, women also serve as legislators,
 judges, governors of departments (states), political party
 leaders, government officials, and diplomats.
 Colombian Indians legally enjoy all rights and privileges of
 full citizenship. However, Indian rights groups protest that
 they-suffer a variety of abuses and are seeking to promote
 local improvements through community action, public education,
 and legal aid. Their most common complaint is that they are
 forced off contested land by paramilitary thugs hired by large
 landowners. When the Indians retaliate, the landowners
 allegedly call on local police and military forces for
 protection. One Indian group has organized a guerrilla band,
 
 
 COLOMBIA
 the Quintin Lame, reportedly allied with other guerrilla
 groups against the Government.
 The upsurge of land occupation by Indian groups that began in
 mid-1984 continued unabated into 1986. Some landowners
 attribute this to leftist political activists; other observers
 consider it a natural result of the rural land situation,
 perhaps exacerbated by current politicking over land reform.
 Whatever the cause, the trend of increased invasions continues
 to generate concern in government and among landowners.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The law prohibits the employment of children in most jobs
 before the age of 14, particularly where such employment might
 interfere with schooling. These provisions are respected in
 the larger enterprises and larger cities. However, the
 unofficial sector of very small businesses--workers employed
 by relatives, self-employed workers, and street vendors--is
 effectively outside government control. Approximately 2.5
 million children under 15 work for low pay under poor
 conditions with little protection from the labor code in the
 unofficial sector. The labor code regulates the hours of
 labor and other work conditions. The 8-hour day is standard
 in larger companies, but the workweek generally exceeds 40
 hours; a standard week of 5 8-hour days remains an important
 long-term goal of Colombian trade unions.
 The Government annually sets a national minimum wago which
 serves as an important benchmark for wage bargaining.
 Workers' occupational safety and health are extensively
 regulated, including use of protective clothing and
 ventilation, first aid and firefighting equipment at the job
 site, sanitary facilities and potable water for workers, and
 compensation for injuries. These regulations apply to the
 larger agricultural enterprises as well as industry and
 mining. However, exemptions for small companies, the frequent
 use of workers as "subcontractors" rather than employees, and
 general enforcement difficulties leave very large numbers of
 workers outside the protection of the law. The Government is
 endeavoring to improve regulatory enforcement, and improved
 work conditions are a priority goal of the trade unions.
