 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a
 member of the Commonwealth of Nations. A prime minister, a cabinet, and a uni-
 cameral legislative assembly compose the Government. The Governor General, ap-
 pointed by the British monarch, is the titular head of state, with largely ceremonial
 powers. Prime Minister Sir James F. Mitchell and his New Democratic Party (NDP)
 were returned to power for an unprecedented fourth term by a slim margin in free
 and fair elections held on June 15. The judiciary is independent.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police, the only security force in the country, includes a
 coast guard and a small Special Services Unit with some paramilitary training. The
 force is controlled by and responsive to the Government, but police continued to
 commit some human rights abuses.
 St. Vincent has a market-based economy. Much of the labor force is engaged in
 agriculture, in particular, banana production. Bananas are the leading export and
 a major source of foreign exchange earnings. However, the banana industry is de-
 clining, and the growing tourism sector is becoming the leading earner of foreign
 exchange. Unemployment is estimated to be 40 percent, and the 1997 per capita
 gross domestic product was low, at approximately $2,500.
 Human rights are generally well respected. The principal human rights problems
 continued to include occasional instances of excessive use of force by police, the Gov-
 ernment's failure to punish adequately those responsible for such abuses, poor pris-
 on conditions, and an overburdened court system. Violence against women and
 abuse of children also were problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 In June the police shot and killed a man who had been arrested, when he at-
 tempted to flee the police station in handcuffs. The authorities initially charged the
 officer responsible for the shooting death with murder, but they later reduced the
 charge to manslaughter. The officer was released on bail and was awaiting trial at
 year's end.
 There was also one death in custody under questionable circumstances (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politicaly motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. However, a very high percentage of convictions (estimated
 at 90 percent by the regional Caribbean Human Rights Network) continue to be
 based on confessions. The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Human Rights Associa-
 tion (SVGHRA), an affiliate of the regional network, claims that some of these con-
 fessions resulted from unwarranted police practices, including the use of physical
 force during detention, illegal search and seizure, and failure to properly inform
 those arrested of their rights.
 
 
 There is no independent review board to monitor police activity and to hear public
 complaints about police misconduct. The SVGHRA has advocated such a board to
 protect the rights of citizens complaining of these activities.
 Incidents of police brutality continued. In April a prisoner was found dead on a
 toilet seat in his cell 1 day after police arrested him on the island of Bequia. The
 police reported that the prisoner had been under the influence of alcohol at the time
 of his arrest and died by choking on his own vomit. An initial post mortem report
 confirmed police reports. However, a-second post mortem examination noted marks
 on the neck and bruises on the small intestines, and indicated that both forearms
 and fingers were in a clutching position. A coroner's inquest in August ruled that
 no one was responsible for the death.
 In an August 1997 case, police officers dragged a man through the streets hanging
 from their jeep. The police initially failed to provide a reason for taking the man
 into custody and never indicated that the man was being placed under arrest. How-
 ever, subsequent to the incident, they charged him with resisting arrest and as-
 saulting a police officer. The case was still pending in court at year's end.
 Prison conditions are poor. Antiquated and overcrowded prisons, with over 400 in-
 mates in a prison designed for 75, result in serious health and safety problems. Re-
 cent renovations have improved conditions somewhat. However, according to the
 SVGHRA, 75 to 80 prisoners still sleep on the floor. An inmate who wishes to speak
 with his lawyer must do so by written correspondence; however, the authorities
 sometimes monitor and censor such correspondence.
 These conditions are particularly harsh for juvenile offenders. There is a small fa-
 cility for delinquent boys, but it is seriously inadequate and generally is used for
 those already convicted through the criminal system. Although separate legal stat-
 utes exist" for youthful offenders, there are no separate magistrates or prosecutors
 to handle such cases.
 The SVGHRA brought a constitutional motion against the Superintendent of Pris-
 ons for ordering corporal punishment with a "cat-o-nine tails against an inmate.
 The High Court found that the Superintendent had no authority to order corporal
 punishment, that the cat-o-nine tails should not be used in the prison, and that its
 use represented an abuse of authority. The Government appealed the decision to the
 Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal, but later withdrew the appeal. Monetary com-
 pensation for the inmate remains to be determined by the High Court.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for persons de-
 tained for criminal offenses to receive a fair hearing within a reasonable time by
 an impartial court. Although there are only two official magistrates, the registrar
 of the High Court and the presiding judge of the family court now effectively serve
 as magistrates when called upon to do so. While this practice reduced the backlog,
 complaints remain regarding police practices in bringing cases to court. Some de-
 fense attorneys claim this has caused 6- to 12-month delays in preliminary inquiries
 for serious crimes.
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent and
 impartial court, and the judiciary is independent in practice.
 The judiciary consists of lower courts and a High Court, with appeal to the East-
 ern Caribbean Court of Appeal and final appeal to the Privy Council in the United
 Kingdom. There are three magistrates, plus one magistrate who serves only the
 family court.
 The Constitution provides for public trials. The court appoints attorneys for indi-
 gent defendants only when the defendant is charged with a capital offense. Defend-
 ants are presumed innocent until proven guilty and may appeal verdicts and pen-
 alties. There is a large backlog of pending cases, particularly for criminal cases, be-
 cause of delaying tactics by lawyers as well as the overburdened judicial system.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary search and seizure or other government intrusions
 into the private life of individual citizens, and there were no reports of such abuses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. Tere are two major newspapers and numerous smaller, partisan
 publications; all are privately owned, and most are openly critical of the Govern-
 ments policies. There were no reports of government censorship or interference with
 the operation of the press. However, individual journalists critical of the Govern-
 ment have on occasion found themselves denied professional opportunities, including
 training and advancement.

 The lone television station in St. Vincent is privately owned and operates without
 government interference. Satellite dishes are popular among those who can afford
 them. There is also a cable system with mainly North American programming that
 has about 300 subscribers. The Government controls programming for the govern-
 ment-owned radio station.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. The issue
 of the provision of first aslyum did not arise. There were no reports of forced expul-
 sion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however, government practice
 remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through regularly scheduled
 free and fair elections. St. Vincent has a long history of multiparty parliamentary
 democracy. During the June election, the ruling New Democratic Party won a slim
 1-seat majority (8 of 15) in Parliament, despite losing the popular vote by a 55 to
 45 percent margin to the opposition ULP. Calling this outcome an "overt manifesta-
 tion of rejection by the public" of Prime Minister Mitchell's Government, the Unity
 Labour Party (ULP) made claims of election fraud and demanded new elections,
 However, no evidence was found to support the allegations of election fraud. The
 Prime Minister refused the ULP demand, and instead proposed a constitutional re-
 view to consider possible amendments such as a provision for proportional represen-
 tation.
 One of the opposition members of Parliament is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Opposition political groups and the Vincentian press often comment on human
 rights matters of local concern. The SVGHRA closely monitors government and po-
 lice activities, especially with respect to treatment of prisoners, publicizing any
 cases of abuse. The Government is generaliy responsive to public and private inquir-
 ies about its human rights practices.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law regardiess of race,
 sex, or religion, and the Government adheres to this provision.
 Women.-Violence against women, particularly domestic violence, remains a
 major problem. The Government took legislative steps to address this problem
 through the Domestic Violence/Matrimonial Proceedings Act (1994) and the more ac-
 cessible Domestic Violence Summary Proceedings Act (1995). Both laws provide for
 protective orders, as well as occupation and tenancy orders, although the former is
 only accessible through the High Court, whereas the latter can be obtained without
 the services of a lawyer in family court. For the past 3 years, the SVGHRA has con-
 ducted numerous seminars and workshops throughout the country to familiarize
 citizens with their rights under these acts. Increasing numbers of women are com-
 ing forward with domestic violence complaints.
 Depending on the magnitude of the offense and the age of the victim, the penalty
 for rape is generally 1 or more years in prison.
 In 1995 the legislature amended the Child Support Law to allow for payments or-
 dered by the courts even though notice of an appeal has been filed. Previously, fa-
 thers who had been ordered to pay child support could appeal decisions and not pay
 while the appeal was being heard. This resulted in a huge backlog of appeal cases
 and effectively reduced the number of mothers and children receiving support pay-
 ments. The family court was established in 1995 in the capital city of Kingstown
 with one magistrate. According to the SVGHRA, because there is only one bailiff
 to service all the country, summonses often are not served on time for cases to be
 heard as scheduled in court.
 The Ministry of Education, Women's Affairs, and Culture has a women's desk that
 assists the National Council of Women with seminars, training programs, and pub-
 
 
 772
 lic relations. The minimum wage law specifies that women should receive equal pay
 for equal work.
 Marion House, a social services agency established by the Catholic Church in
 1989 and staffed by 11 trained counselors and 4 foreign volunteers, provides coun-
 seling and therapy services.
 Children.-Education is not compulsory, but the Government states that it inves-
 tigates cases where children are withdrawn from school before the age of 16. Al-
 though the Government has played a more prominent role in legislating health and
 welfare standards since independence, the infant mortality rate is still very high.
 One underlying cause is the large number of children born to teenage mothers.
 The Domestic Violence Summary Proceedings Act provides a limited legal frame-
 work for the protection of children. Nevertheless, reports of child abuse remain high
 and are on the increase. The Social Welfare Office is the government agency respon-
 sible for monitoring and protecting the welfare of children. The police are the en-
 forcement arm; the Social Welfare Office refers all reports of child abuse to the po-
 lice for action.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation covering persons with
 disabilities, and the circumstances for disabled individuals are generally difficult.
 Most severely disabled people rarely leave their homes because of the poor road sys-
 tem and lack of affordable wheelchairs. The Government partially supports a school
 for the disabled which has two branches. A separate, small rehabilitation center
 treats about five persons daily.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides citizens the right to form
 unions and to organize employees, while the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Act
 allows the right to strike. Employers often ignore the constitutional provisions that
 provide for union rights, and claim that they have a constitutional right not to rec-
 ognize a trade union. Some employers, however, seek a good industrial relations en-
 viro"nment and cooperate with trade unions. There were no major strikes.
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines joined the International Labor Organization in
 1997 and assumed all its obligations for enforcement of labor standards.
 Unions have the right to affiliate with international bodies. -
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are 'no legal obstacles
 to organizing unions; however, no law reguire'-employers to recognize a particular
 union as an exclusive bargaining agent.&S3me companies offer packages of benefits
 with terms of employment better than, or comparable to, what a union can normally
 obtain through negotiations. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employ-
 ers against union members and organizers. Generally effective mechanisms exist for
 resolving complaints. The authorities can order employers found guilty of antiunion
 discrimination for firing workers without cause (including for participation in union
 activities) to reinstate the workers or give them severance pay.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Corpulsory Labor.-The Government prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and it is not known to occur. The Government does not specifi-
 cally prohibit forced or bonded labor by children, but there were no reports that it
 occurred.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 sets the minimum working age at 16 years of age, although a worker must be 18
 years of age to receive a national insurance card. The labor inspection office of the
 Ministry of Labor monitors and enforces this provision, and employers generally re-
 spect it in practice. The age of leaving school at the primary level is 15 years; when
 these pupils leave school, they are usually absorbed into the labor market disguised
 as apprentices. The Government does not prohibit specifically forced or bonded labor
 by children, but there were no reports that it occurred (see Section 6.c.). There is
 no known child labor except for children working on family-owned banana planta-
 tions, particularly during harvest time, or in family-owned cottage industries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages, which were last
 promulgated in 1989. They vary by sector and type of work and are specified for
 several skilled categories, including attendants, packers, cleaners, porters, watch-
 men, and clerks. In a          the wage for workers provided shelter is $0.82
 (EC$2.25) per hour; skilled industrial workers earn $7.36 (EC$20) per day, and un-
 skilled workers earn $3.68 (EC$10) per day. In many sectors the minimum wage
 is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family, but
 most workers earn more than the minimum. The Wages Council, according to law,
 should meet every 2 years to review the minimum wage, but it has not met since
 1989. However, the Ministry of Labor plans to convene a meeting with unions and
 employer's representatives in early 1999 to discuss changes to the minimum wage.
 
 
 773
 There is no legislation concerning the length of the workweek; however, the general
 practice is to work 40 hours in 5 days. The law provides workers a minimum annual
 vacation of 2 weeks.
 According to the Ministry of Labor, legislation concerning occupational safety and
 health is outdated. The most recent legislation, the Factories Act of 1955, has some
 regulations concerning only factories, but enforcement of these regulations is ineffec-
 tive. Workers enjoy a reasonably safe working environment; however, the trade
 unions have dealt with some violations relating to safety gear, long overtime hours,
 and the safety of machinery. There were some reports of significant visual deficiency
 by visual display unit workers, and some reports of hearing impairment by power
 station and stone crushing employees.
