 BELARUS
 Belarus has a constitutional government with executive, legislative, and judicial
 branches. Since his election as the first President in July 1994, Aleksandr
 Lukashenko has steadily amassed power in the executive branch. May parliamen-
 tary elections, which international observers described as "less than free and fair,"
 failed to elect enough members for a quorum. Repeat parliamentary elections held
 in December seated enough new members for the new legislature to begin delibera-
 tions in early 1996. Although the Constitution provides that the old Parliament re-
 tains its competency until replaced, President Lukashenko described it as illegit-
 imate, and refused   work with it, leaving the ountry without an effective legisla-
 tive body. The President repeatedly ignored limits on the authority of the executive
 branch, and the frequency and scope of his decrees increased as the year progressed.
 The President exercises executive power and a ppoints the Cabinet of Ministers and
 all executive heads of the six provinces. Presidential decrees have the force of law,
 except in those cases restricted by the Constitution and Parliament. A Constitu-
 tional Court was established in 1994 to adjudicate serious constitutional issues, but
 has no means to enforce its decisions.
 The Committee for State Security (KDB) and Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVS),
 both answerable to the President, remained the chief law enforcement and police
 organs. Special formations of MVS troops on occasion used force against members
 of Parliament, opposition political gatherings, and union activities. The armed
 forces, which are not involved in law enforcement, continue to engage in hazing of
 recruits as it was practiced in the former Soviet Union. Members of the security
 forces committed numerous human rights abuses.
 The economy is still largely state controlled, and it continued its steady decline
 since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Little privatization occurred, but prices on
 most goods were liberalized and subsidies to state enterprises were further cut. In-
 dustry and construction employ 40 percent of the labor force, and agriculture 20 per-
 cn. Maor exports include machinery, transport equipment, and chemicals.
 The government's human rights record worsened markedly as Belarus turned
 back toward Soviet-era authoritarian practices. The right of citizens to change their
 government was severely limited in the May parliamentary elections. However, as
 a result of the November and December polling a fully functioning Parliament was
 seated. Candidates nevertheless were hampered by p residential decrees limiting the
 activity of political parties and access to the media. The security services reportedly
 still closely monitored the activities of opposition politicians and other segments of
 the population. Securit y forces reportedly regularly beat detainees and prisoners.
 Government restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, peaceful assembly,
 religions and movement all increased. The Government sharply curtailed the rights
 of workers to organize and bargain collectively. The judiciary is not independent and
 has encountered difficulty acting as a check on the executive branch and its agents.
 Prolonged detention and delays in trials were common. Discrimination in employ-
 ment and domestic violence against women remained significant problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 
 
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person and specifically pro-
 hibits torture, as well as cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment. However, beat-
 by police and prison guards reportedly occurred regularly in detention centers
 and prisons. Law enforcement and prison officials may use physical force against
 detainees and prisoners if the latter are violent, have refused to obey the instruc-
 tions of the prson administration, or have "maliciously violated the terms of their
 sentences." Law enforcement sources as well as former detainees report that inves-
 tigators physically abused detainees in order to secure confessions. Although such
 behavior is against the law, the Government seldom, if ever, punishes people who
 commit such abuses.
 In the armed forces hazing, the practice of severe harassment and abuse of new
 draftees by senior soldiers to maintain strict discipline, continues unchanged. Offi-
 cers do not interfere with the practice.
 Conditions in prison hospitals worsened, and the infection rate for tuberculosis in
 the prison population continued to climb. The MVS's single tuberculosis hospital
 was reportedy overcrowded, and patients were crowded into closed cells with little
 ventilation. One prisoner reported making repated attempts to seek treatment for
 tuberculosis, but prison health officials allegedly misdiagnosed him on purpose so
 as not to be forced to send him to the already overcrowded hospital.
 The Government limited prison visits by international humanitarian groups. The
 United Kingdom-based group Penal Reform International was granted access to a
 pretrial detention prison near Minsk but was denied access to maximum security
 facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Belarus has only slightly amended its So-
 viet-era law on detention. The Criminal Procedure Code provides that authorities
 may detain a   rson suspected of a crime for 3 days without a warrant. This eriod
 may be extended for up to 10 days, pending further investigation of a crime. nthe
 basis of a local prosecutor's authority, detainees may be kept in pretrial detention
 for up to 3 months. Regional- and republic-level prosecutors may request extensions
 up to a maximum of 18 months. The law permits citizens to appeal the legality of
 an arrest either to the court or to the prosecutor's office. According to judicial
 sources, nearly 90 percent of all arrests are now contested.
 By law a judge must initiate a trial within 3 weeks from the time charges are
 friled. However, the overloaded court system often does not meet this requirement,
 and months may pass before a defendant is finally brought to court.
 Detainees maybe allowed unlimited access to their legal counsel, and, according
 to the new Constitution, if they cannot afford counsel, a lawyer must be appointed
 free of charge. However, prisoners and lawyers alike report restrictions on consulta-
 tions, and investigators may prohibit consultations between a lawyer and a client.
 Some detainees reported that investigators coerced them to sign statements waiving
 the right to an attorney during interrogation. The Government has failed to budget
 sufficient funds for defense attorneys to represent the indigent. Defense attorneys'
 fees are prohibitively expensive for many defendants. Since there are no legal provi-
 sions for bail and because there is no effective judicial oversight of prosecutors' ac-
 tions, pretrial detention has in some instances lasted longer than 2 years.
 The constitutional right of access to counsel and the requirement to charge detain-
 ees are frequently ignored. Free Trade Union President Gennady Bykov and Mem-
 ber of Parliament Sergei Antonchik were detained on August 21 and held incommu-
 nicado at an MVS military base for 3 days. Bykov and Antonchik, who were held
 in connection with the Government's breakup of a Minsk metro workers' strike
 were neither arrested nor charged and were denied access to counsel for the period
 of their detention. The law does not provide for the right to a prompt judicial deter-
 mination of the legality of detention.
 Exile .is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The judiciary is not independent and is largely
 unable to act as a check on the executive branch and its agents. The Supreme Coun-
 cil passed legislation to support the independence of the judiciary, but these reforms
 are not scheduled to be implemented until 1996. Without major structural reforms,
 the independence of the judiciary from outside pressure cannot be achieved. Even
 the Constitutional Court, which according to the Constitution has an autonomous
 existence, has no means of enforcing its decisions. In December President
 Lukashenko issued an instruction to executive branch agencies that all of his de-
 crees-even those struck down by the court as unconstitutional--must continue to
 be .obeyed.
 The criminal justice system, following the former Soviet model, has three tiers:
 district courts, regional courts, and the Supreme Court. Several modifications have
 
 
 been made, brought about by passage of the new Constitution including direct pres-
 idential appointment of all local-level and military judges. The President also ap
 points the chairmen of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the new y
 created Supreme Economic Court.
 Parliament selects judges for republic-level courts on the basis of recommenda-
 tions from the Ministry of Justice, based in part on examination results. However,
 many current judges and prosecutors were appointed in Soviet times when political
 influence pervaded the criminal justice system as it does today. Judges are depend-
 ent on the Ministry of Justice for sustaining ourt infrastructure and on local execu-
 tive branch officials for providing their personal housing. Organized crime has had
 a significant impact on court decisions. There have been reports of judges granting
 lenient sentences to 'connected' defendants.
 Prosecutors, like the courts, are organized into offices at the district, regional, and
 republic levels. They are ultimately responsible to, and serve at the pleasure of, the
 Procurator General who is appointed by Parliament. On May 22, Procurator-General
 Vasily Sholodonov resigned, following press reports that the President's administra-
 tion  held  information  implicating  him  in financial misconduct. President
 Lukashenko appointed his successor, whose candidacy had not been presented to
 Parliament for debate by year's end.
 Trials are generally public, although they may be closed on grounds of national
 security. Defendants have the right to attend proceedings, confront witnesses, and
 present evidence on their own behalf. However, during their August 23 trial, Minsk
 metro strike organizers were denied the right to call witnesses on their behalf. Ac-
 cording to the Constitution, the court appoints an attorney for defendants who do
 not have one, but defendants and judges alike report that court-appointed lawyers
 are frequently absent at interrogations and trials.
 While the Constitution establishes a presumption of innocence, conviction rates
 have not changed from the Soviet era. Nearly 99 percent of completed cases result
 in convictions. Judges frequently send cases unlikely to end in convictions back to
 the prosecutor for additional investigation," and prosecutors withdraw cases not
 likely to result in conviction.
 Both defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal, and nearly 60 percent
 of all criminal cases are appealed. On appeals, neither defendants nor witnesses ap-
 pear before the court; the court merely reviews documents from the lower court s
 trial, and appeals rarely result in reversals of verdicts.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Elec-
 tronic monitoring of residences and telephones reportedly continues. The KDB, the
 MVS, and certain border guard detachments have the right to request permission
 to install wiretaps but must legally obtain a prosecutor's permission before installa-
 tion. The Government makes no secret of the KDB's activities or capabilities. On
 August 30 in a televised interview, President Lukashenko boasted of receiving intel-
 ligence service reports on opposition member of Parliament Gennady Karpenko's ac-
 tivities. Except in cases of pursuit, a prosecutorial search warrant is needed in order
 to enter a private home.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 but the Government often does not respect this right in practice. The executive
 branch of government, through the head of the president's chief directorate for pub-
 lic information, increased direct suppression of freedom of expression through its
 near total monopoly on the means of production and distribution of mass media and
 through its use of laws on slander. A defamation law makes no distinction between
 private and public persons for the purpose of lawsuits for defamation of character.
 A public figure who has been criticized for poor performance in office may ask a
 public prosecutor to sue the newspaper that printed the criticism.
 The newspaper Svaboda was sued four times for publishing material critical of the
 Government. In late May Svaboda's bank accounts were frozen pending payment of
 a 45 million ruble fine assessed during a trial in which the newspaper was not rep-
 resented. At year's end, the newspaper's official accounts remained frozen, although
 the newspaper has managed to continue publishing. After pressing criminal charges
 against the newspaper, deputy procurator general Kondratyev sent Svaboda an offi-
 cial warn'ng that criticism of government employees in the performance of their du-
 ties would result in lawsuits and the closing of the newspaper. When Svaboda criti-
 cized a judge's decision as "not objective" in a case against opposition member of
 Parliament Sergei Antonchik, the judge in the case, Lyubov' Zholnerchik, sued the
 paper for one billion rubles for defamation of character.

 Despite the passage of a press law in 1994 prohibiting the existence of a press
 monopoly, the Government maintained a virtual monopoly over the press since it
 owns nearlyaprntng and broadcasting facilities and manages the distribution of
 all print media through official outlets. There are some private newspapers printed
 in Belarusian and Russian. However, in December, on instructions from the
 Lukashenko administration, the monopolist state printing house cancelled the con-
 tracts of the leading independent newspapers Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta, hays,
 and Svabda. The newspapers contracted with a Lithuanian printing concern and
 continue to publish, but the state postal service, which distributes all other periodi-
 cals to susribers, refused to distribute these newspapers.
 The Government's direction of the issuance of radio frequencies and cable tele-
 vision licenses and the registration of radio stations, as wel as its ownership of the
 countrys only broadcast television station, amount essentially to complete control
 of the broadcast media. All mass media must register with the Government, which
 can use the registration reguirements as an instrument of censorship since it can
 revoke registration at any tine. This absence of independence encourages editors to
 practice self-censorship. In November President Lukashenko attempted to halt
 roadcasting of television program  featuring candidates for the upcoming par-
 liamentary elections. The candate made efforts to obtain air time on other tele-
 vision channels. Some succeeded.
 President Luikashenko also issued decrees replacing the editors-in-chief of the four
 leading daily newspapers following the former editors' attempts to publish excerpts
 of a sensationalistic December 1994 report on corruption within the Lukashenko
 Government. According to both the press law and the newspapers' charters, the
 President had no authority to take suh action. In the final week before the Decem-
 ber 10 round of elections, Speaker of the old Parliament Myacheslav Grib sought
 to broadcast an apolitical get-out-the-vote message via state television, but was de-
 nied air time. Grlb then attempted to broadcast his message via two independent
 Russian television stations which are rebroadcast in Belarus. However, the Ministry
 of Communications shut down the transmitters of these two television stations "for
 repairs..
 The state-owned Belarusian Television and Radio Company (B-TR) runs the only
 nationwide television station and also controls frequencies and licenses for all broad-
 cast media. The B-TR closed Minsk's independent Cable Channel 8 for the 3 months
 leading upto the parliamentary elections "for transmitter repairs." B-TR issued the
 station alicense to reopen only after both rounds of elections were over and after
 station management officials agreed to a clause in their contract that the station
 would never broadcast political reporting. B-TR management on one occasion
 censored the remarks of two foreign Ambassadors on the independently produced
 television show "Praskpekt," a weekly political television newsmagazine broadcast
 on B-TR. The independent television studio Fit, which produced the program, was
 informed by B-TR management that if it did not censor the program, the B-TR
 would restrict the studio's access for the five other programs it produced for broad-
 cast on B-TR.
 The observance of academic freedom is mixed. University students and academics
 alike are free to pursue virtually any course of study or research. After enjoying con-
 siderable freedom to develop curriculums in the first years following independence,
 educators are now more restrained.
 In August, 2 weeks prior to the start of the 1995-96 school year, President
 Lukashenko reportedly signed a decree ordering schools to return to Soviet-era text-
 books. The decree claimed that post-Soviet textbooks were politicized and required
 their replacement with Soviet-era textbooks pending development of new curricu-
 lums. After educators and intelligentsia strongly objected to the move, President
 Lukashenko denied having signed the decree. Moreover, in response to their out-
 spoken criticism of the decree, two deputy ministers of education, Tatiana Galko
 and Gennadiy Petrovaky, were fired. Following these actions, educators appear to
 be less outspoken in pursuit of academic reform.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government restricts free-
 dom of assembly. The Soviet law on demonstrations, which is still valid, requires
 an application at least 10 days in advance to local officials. The local government
 must respond either positively or negatively not later than 5 days prior to the sched-
 uled event. Public demonstrations ocurred frequently, but always under strict Gov-
 ernment control.
 On April 12 16 hunger-striking members of Parliament were beaten by masked
 special police forces as they were forcibly ejected from the Parliament hall. Opposi-
 tion members of Parliament were protesting the President's attempt to push
 through the legislature language for the May 14 referendum that they claimed
 would seriously jeopardize Belarusian sovereignty and give him the power to dis-
 
 
 band Parliament. In an April 20 televised press conference, the President warned
 that political groups could expect similar treatment if they incited political disturb-
 ances during  e parliamentary election campaign. In addition, black-bereted special
 police troops roughly dispersed a small crowd which had gathered to protest the
 ouster outside Minsk's government house.
 Police used truncheons in an attempt to disperse a crowd in independence square
 on July 27, Belarusian independence day. Following instructions that they claimed
 came from President Lukashenko, police detained five protestors for displaying the
 former Belarus flag and national emblem. (The flag and national emblem had been
 changed to resemble those of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic as a result
 oL a May 14 referendum.) After initial attempts to disperse the crowd failed, the pro-
 testers were allowed, under heavy guard by special police forces, to march down
 Minsk's main street to join a rally in a near y city park, which was not further im-
 peded.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association. By the end of 1995, there
 were 36 registered political parties.
 c. Freedom of Relgwon.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government generally respects this right in practice. However, a Cabinet of Min-
 isters directive published on July 22 sharply limits the activity of foreign religious
 workers in Belarus. Citizens are not prohibited from proselytizing, but foreign mis-
 sionaries may not engage in religious activities outside the institutions which in-
 vited them. Only religious organizations already registered in Belarus may invite
 foreign clergy. This new directive is already begining to hamper foreign religious
 workers' efforts to proselytize; it seeks to limit them to providing humanitarian aid
 only.
 The Cabinet of Ministers regulation is seen as a means of enhancing the position
 of the Orthodox Church with respect to the faster growing Roman Catholic and
 Protestant churches and also as a means of preventing nonmainstream religious
 movements from spreading. Announcement of the new rules was delayed to coincide
 with a visit from the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. President
 Lukashenko has declared the preservation and development of Orthodox Christian-
 ity a 'moral necessity." Fifty Polish Roman Catholic priests were reportedly denied
 registration as foreign religious workers. According to the new rules, bishops must
 receive permission from the State Committee on Religious Affairs before transfer-
 ri  a foreign priest to another parish.
 ome difficulties still exist in transferring church property from state control back
 to the former owners. Progress involving repatriation of former Jewish property has
 been limited and inconsistent.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-According to the Constitution, citizens are free to travel within the
 country and live and work where they wish. However, all adults are still issued in-
 ternal passports, which serve as primary identity documents and are required for
 travel, permanent housinq, and hotel registration.
 The right to choose one s place of residence, although guaranteed by law, remains
 restricted in practice. Despite its formal abolition by te Soviet Government in Octo-
 ber 1991, the "propiska' (pass) system survives in  elarus. All citizens are required
 to register their places of residence and may not change them without official per-
 mission. The authorities limit the number of residence permits in Minsk and the
 five regional centers of Brest, Grodno, Mogilev, Vitebsk, and Gomel. Government of-
 ficials report that decisions are based sole y on availability of housing and few citi-
 zens are denied permission to change their residence. However police checkpoints
 at the approaches to -all major cities are often manned by soldiers in full combat
 gear who randomly inspect vehicles. Citizens who appear to be of Central Asian de-
 scent report that they are stopped much more frequently than others.
 The MVS's law on entry and exit requires those who wish to travel abroad to first
 obtain a "global" exit visa, which is valid from 1 to 5 years. Once a traveller has
 a valid visa, the law does not restrict travel. However, Free Trade Union President
 Gennady Bykov was denied permission to leave Belarus on September 6 to attend
 a union conference in another country following his detainment in connection with
 a Minsk metro workers' strike.
 On September 7, President Lukashenko issued a decree recalling all diplomatic
 and official passports. The decree sharply limits the number of diplomatic and offi-
 cial passports and requires travellers to receive permission from the Government
 prior to their use. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that the purpose of the
 recal is to prevent abuse of official status, but opposition members of Parliament
 claimed that the decree is intended to limit travel abroad only to trips approved by
 the executive branch-or even by Lukashenko himself.

 According to government data, no citizen was denied permission to emigrate. Leg-
 islation restricting emigration by those with access to "state secrets" remained mu
 effect, and any citizen involved in a criminal investigation was also ineligible to emi-
 grate. Persons who have been refused the right to emigrate may appeal to the
 courts.
 On September 12, the Belarus military shot down a gas balloon flying in an inter-
 national race that flew over the border from Poland. The two American crewman
 were killed. An international commission is conducting an investigation into the in-
 cident. Belarus is cooperating with the international commission, of which the US.
 is a part.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commisioner for Refu-
 gees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change their Government was severely limited in the May
 parliamentary elections. International observers termed the elections "less than free
 and fair," citing inappropriate restrictions on campaigning and limits on the activity
 of pitical parties. The executive branch also influenced the outcome of the elections
 through its control of the mass media and its smearing of the opposition. Voters had
 limited information about the elections, parties, candidates, and their platforms.
 Only 119 of 260 seats were filled after the first two rounds of elections, far fewer
 than the two-thirds required for the Parliament to begin deliberations, because min-
 imum turnout was not achieved. Repeat elections for the vacant seats were held in
 December, and despite what international observers termed "executive branch ac-
 tions to discourage voter turnout," enough voters took part in elections to seat an
 additional 78 members, exceeding the quorum requirement.
 Campaign spending in May and in the fall parliamentary voting was limited to
 about $50 (600,000 Belarusian rubles), provided by the Government, for each can-
 didate. Political parties were not permitted to campaign for candidates, and presi-
 dential decrees restricted political gatherings and candidates' use of the mass
 media. A vicious "smear" campaign broadcast on state-run television in the final
 days of the campaign ensurea that not a single candidate from the opposition
 Belarusian Popular Front was elected.
 Although the Constitution states that the old Parliament retains its competence
 until it is replaced by a new legislature, President Lukashenko termed the old Par-
 liament "illegitimate and refused to permit it to take part in the governing of the
 country. President Lukashenko announced in an October 2 address to the nation
 that he had sent advisers to the provinces to persuade members of Parliament not
 to convene in Minak the following day. Those efforts were successful, as Parliament
 was unable to reach a quorum. Independent press articles alleged that strong-arm
 tactics, such as the threat of losing jobs or privileges, kept many parliamentarians
 homne.
 There are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics and govern-
 ment. However, with the exception of the judiciary, social barriers to women in poli-
 tics are strong, a a m        d       all leade ip  sitions. There are two fe-
 male ministers in the Lukashenko government, the Minister of Health and the Min-
 ister of Social Welfare. Of the 197 members elected to the new Parliament oniy 9
 are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights monitors reported that the Government presented some obstacles
 when they tried to investigate alleged human rights violations. The Belarusian
 League of Human Rights, founded in 1992, reported that the courts continued, on
 the pretext of procedural grounds, to refuse to review its appeals to investigate al-
 leged human rights violations. However, local human rights monitors noted that
 Fovernment willingness to discuss human rights problems increased in 1995, and
 international organizations were not hindered in visiting Belarus.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Law on Citizenship, passed by the Parliament, grants citizenship to any per-
 son living permanently on the territory of Belarus as of October 19, 1991. Those vho
 arrived in Belarus after that date and wish to become citizens are required to sub-
 mit an application for citizenship, take an oath to support the Constitution, have
 a legal source of income, and have lived in the country for 7 years. Parliament
 
 
 786
 passed a new Law on Immigration and Migration which provides numerical limits
 on new citizens, but failed to-budget funds for its implementation.
 Women.-Although statistics are not available, domestic violence against women
 continues to be a significant problem. Knowledgeable sources indicate that police
 generally are not hesitant to enforce laws against violence and that the courts are
 not reluctant to impose sentences. The problem, according to women's groups, is a
 general reluctance among women to report incidents of domestic violence.
 The law requires equal wages for equal work, and in practice, women are paid
 the same as men. However, they have significantly less opportunity for advance-
 ment to the upper ranks of management and government.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare and health, par-
 ticularly as related to the consequences of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, and,
 with the help of foreign donors gives them special attention. Families with children
 receive government benefits. Abuse of children does not appear to be a general soci-
 etal problem.
 People With Disabilities.-A law mandating accessibility to transport, residences,
 businesses, and offices for the disabled came into force in 1992. However, facilities,
 including transport and office buildings, often are not accessible to the disabled. The
 Government, facing a deteriorating economic situation, failed to budget sufficient
 funds to implement these laws. Men the Government slashed subsidies for most
 sectors of society, however, subsidies for the disabled were largely left in place.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of workers,
 except state security and military personnel, to form and join independent unions
 on a voluntary basis and to carry out actions in defense of workers' rights, including
 the right to strike. However, these rights are not generally recognized in practice.
 The Government used police and imported strikebreakers to break an August strike
 by Minsk metro workers.
 The independent trade union movement is still in its infancy. Although several
 independent trade unions exist, the Belarusian branch of the former U.S.SR.'s All-
 Union Central Council of Trade Unions--currently the Federation of Trade Unions
 of Belarus (FTUB)-is by far the largest trade union organization. This trade union
 of 5 million members is not considered independent in practice since it often follows
 government orders.
 In practice, workers are often automatically inducted into the FTUB, and their
 union dues are deducted from their wages. Independent labor leaders believe that
 the official trade unions' control over social functions usually performed by the state
 (such as pension funds) is an obstacle to the growth of true, independent trade
 unions.
 The two major independent trade unions are the Free Trade Union of Belarus
 (SPB), and the Belarusian Independent Trade Union (BNP). The BNP and the SPB
 formed the Congress of Free Trade Unions of Belarus, which coordinates the activi-
 ties of the two largest unions over 16,000 members and serves as a resource center
 for the free trade union movement.
 On January 26, the FTUB staged a 1-day Soviet-style strike in which 20,000
 workers gathered by enterprise, waved Soviet flags, and called for a recreation of
 the Soviet economy with full support for production, increased wages, and lower
 prices.
 On August 17, the Minsk metro locals of beth the SPB and the FTUB went on
 strike to protest late payment of wages and managements failure to abide by the
 terms of their ccllective bargaining agreement. On August 21, at the President's in-
 struction, 23 striking metro employees were detained at gunpoint by special police
 forces. Over 60 metro workers who continued to support the strike were fired. SPB
 trolley bus drivers in the southeastern city of Gomel who struck in solidarity with
 Min k metro workers were also fired.
 SPB President Gennady Bykov, Member of Parliament and founding member
 Sergei Antonchik, as well as other metro strike leaders, were detained on August
 21 for their involvement in the metro strike. Antonchik was released after being
 held incommunicado for 3 days (despite protection from criminal prosecution as a
 Member of Parliament), and Bykov was sentenced to 10 days in jail. On August 31,
 President Lukashenko issued a decree banning the activities of the SPB and the
 Minsk metro local of the FTUB. He also rescinded parliamentary immunities in the
 decree. The Constitutional Court ruled in late 1995 that these and other presi-
 dential decrees are unconstitutional. President Lukashenko instructed the executive
 branch to ignore this ruling, and the activities of the SPB remain sharply restricted.
 Unions may freely affiliate with international bodies.
 
 
 787
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation dating from the
 Soviet era provides for the right to organize and bargain collectively. Since the econ-
 omy is still largely in the hands of the State, unions usually seek redress at the
 political level. Workers and independent unions have recourse to the court system.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1994 Constitution prohibits
 forced labor, and there were no reports that it occurred.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor law establishes 16 years of
 age as the statutory minimum age for employment of children. With the written
 consent of one parent (or legal guardian), a child of 14 years may conclude a labor
 contract. Reporte4ly, the Procurator General's office enforces this law effectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The President's administration sets a mini-
 mum wage, which was raised once in response to inflation. On October 1, the
 monthly minimum wage was less than $6 (60,000 Belarusian rubles). The minimum
 wage istoo low to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 The Labor Code sets a limit of 40 hours of work per week and provides for at
 least one 24-hour rest period per wek. Because of the difficult economic situation
 an increasing number of workers find themselves working considerably less than 40
 hours per week. Ofen, factories require workers to take unpaid furloughs due to
 shortages of raw materials and energy, and lack of demand for factory output.
 The law establishes minimum con  ions for workplace safety and worker health;
 however, these standards are often ignored. Workers at many heavy machinery
 plants do not wear even minimal safety gear, such as gloves, hard hats, or welding
 glasses. A state labor inspectorate exists but does not have the authority to enforce
 compliance, and violations are often ignored. There is no provision in law allowing
 workers to remove themselves from dangerous work without risking their jobs.
