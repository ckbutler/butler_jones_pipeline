 HUNGARY
 Except for a brief period during the Hungarian
 revolution in 1956, communist rule has been a fact in
 Hungary for more than three decades. Hungary's
 Communist Party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers
 Party, has maintained a monopoly of political power.
 Although a number of citizens' rights are prescribed
 by the constitution, as in other communist countries,
 such rights are qualified by the interests of
 "socialist society."
 Prior to the 1956 revolution, the Hungarian
 goverment followed rigid Stalinist policies.
 Beginning in the early 1960's, Hungary gradually has
 eased internal controls, permitting a degree of
 modest economic well-being and cultural diversity.
 This easing of controls represents an attempt to
 accommodate popular opposition to rigid
 restrictions. Political expression still is tightly
 controlled and effective participation in the
 political process is not possible w~thout approval of
 the Communist Party. The party has sought public
 support through an explicitly stated policy of
 alliance between'it and the general population under
 the tenet "who is not against us is with us" and
 through the Communist Party's mass organization, the
 People's Patriotic Front.
 According to Hungarian officials, the number of
 political prisoners is about fifty. Emigration is
 possible within limits;"visits.abroad, including to
 western countries, are possible within wider limits.
 Practice of religion is tolerated within the
 framework of agreements reached between the Hungarian
 churches and the government. Secret police and
 prosecutorial discretion, powers, and methods have
 been somewhat curtailed. In this last connection,
 party and government officials claim to have
 eradicated many of the abuses of socialist legality
 which characterized the pre-1956 period.'
 The Soviet Unionhas maintained military forces in
 Hungary since the end of World War II; approximately
 60,000 Soviet soldiers are currently stationed there
 -- roughly the same number as prior to the 1956
 revolution.
 1.     Respect" for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The 1972 constitution of the Hungarian People's
 Republic states, in paragraph 57 (1)t "In the
 Hungarian People's Republic, citizens have the right
 to the protection of life, integrity of the body, and
 the preservation of good health." There are no known
 recent instances of torture.
 
 (794)
 
 
 795
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no known summary executions in
 Hungary in recent years (although some reportedly
 occurred during -- and a much larger number after --
 the suppression of the 1956 revolution).
 Mistreatment of those who may have participated in
 the revolution ie believed to have ceased gradually
 after the end of the so-called consolidation phase in
 1960-62. Citizens in principle may bring complaints
 against the police.
 There are three levels of punitive incarceration in
 Hungarys "workhouse", with somewhat liberal
 visiting, outside work, and outside leave
 possibilities, "Jail", which is more punitive; and
 .prison", maximum-security penitentiary. Confinement
 conditions vary in relation to the category level,
 but all levels are believed to provide adequate diet
 and health care. Hardened criminals are confined
 separately from those convicted of petty crimes.
 With varying degrees.of frequency, depending on
 levels of imprisonment, prisoners have visitation
 rights by family members, other relatives, and
 friends. There does not appear to be deliberate and
 willful or other systematic mistreatment of prisoners.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reported disappearances in Hungary
 in the past year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Citizens generally are free from arbitrary arrest.
 Upon arrest, a-detainee must be informed in writing
 of what offense he or she is suspected of having
 committed, and can be held at a police station for a
 maximum of 72 hours before charges must be filed.
 There is no right of bail or of provisional pretrial
 liberty. Although authorities have some discretion
 to grant pretrial liberty, they rarely do so. In
 cases of suspicion for major crimes, a person can be
 held in jail 30 days before trial, renewable twice
 for a maximum of three months.
 On July 1, 1979, Hungary adopted a new penal code
 which somewhat narrows the range of acts defined as
 crimes and provides for modest reduction of penalties
 for some types of offenses. The new penal code
 retains an article on incitement which permits
 officials to prosecute for a wide range of utterances
 or statements. Official Hungarian statistics show
 that 230 cases of incitement arose in 1977 and 214 in
 1978. Current estimates remain approximately the
 same witb.periodic reports of individuals being
 sentenced for denouncing the Communist Party or
 Soviet domination of Hungary. Not all cases of
 
 
 796
 incitement involved political matters. Frequently
 such cases result in short or suspended sentences.
 Another penal code provision on "espionage" provides
 for punishing "a person who obtains, collects, or
 gives out data which can be used against the
 Hungarian People's Republic with the purpose of
 forwarding them to a foreign government or
 organization..." Neither the nature of the data
 transmitted nor the nature of the recipient
 organization is closely defined.
 In general, however, the new penal code is more
 lenient than the previous one. It provides lesser
 penalties for so-called political crimes on a small
 scale, such as offhand statements against the party
 or government. Many such crimes are now
 misdemeanors, with the first offense often resulting
 in a short (three months) suspended sentence and a
 fine (usually about $43.00). At the same time, the
 new penal code has taken a harder line against
 economic corruption. Crimes of this nature often
 result in more severe penalties. It appears to be
 difficult to get reduced or suspended sentences in
 corruption cases.
 A public statement by the Hungarian minister of
 justice in October 1980 said that two-tenths of one
 percent of all Hungarians in jail can be classified
 as political prisoners, indicating an actual total of
 less than fifty individuals. The Minister described
 three categories of political prisoners: those
 accused of war crimes, espionage an4 "incitement
 against the Hungarian constitution." There is no
 information to either substantiate or rebut the
 Minister's statement.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution stipulates that all court
 proceedings are open except for cases specifically
 exempted by law (those involving morals or state
 secrets)} and that "all courts are independent" and
 "subject to laws." All courts deal with criminal,
 political and security cases. There are very few
 closed trials in Hungary. Those which are closed are
 usually connected in some way to national security.
 The Hungarian government claims that defendants in*
 closed trials are guaranteed the same rights as in
 any other trial. In general, judicial procedures
 resemble continental Western European practices, in
 that they are investigatory rather than adversarial
 in nature. There is no trial by jury. Defendants
 have the right to choose counsel. Courts normally
 seek to apply the law in a methodical fashion.
 Political pressure by the Communist Party presumably
 is applied when necessary, but discreetly, at least
 in open trials.
 
 
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution guarantees citizens' personal
 freedom and inviolability, as well as the secrecy of
 correspondence and privacy of the home. Such
 guarantees are said to be "in the interests of
 socialism" and will be breached in the name of that
 interest, but Hungarian practice appears to afford
 due process. For example, search warrants are
 necessary in all cases. House searches require a
 court order, and must be carried out in the presence
 of two witnesses. A written inventory must be
 prepared of items removed from the premises.
 Available information corroborates adherence to these
 procedures. It is assumed that such procedural steps
 as issuance of search warrants may be "expedited" in
 instances of special interest, such as state security
 cases.
 2.     Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including t
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of conscience,
 religious practice, free speech, free press and
 assembly, and the right to form associations. The
 last four rights are qualified by the need to conform
 to the "interests of socialism and the people." In
 practice, if a Hungarian citizen accepts the
 communist form of government and does not publicly
 oppose Hungary's alliance with the Soviet Union, he
 or she is free to pursue a range of thought and
 activity. If the citizen does not respect these, he
 or she may be subjected to varying measures of
 admonition, harassment, and punishment. The
 constitution does not-protect the citizen who exceeds
 the generally understood political limits'on
 expression pervasive self-censorship in media and
 cultural circles serves to remind the citizen where
 the boundaries are. Despite the absence of formal
 censorship, authorities have banned the circulation
 of particular books or articles.
 The most recent example of such a banning was a book
 of essays written by some seventy Hungarian
 intellectuals in memory of Istvan Bibo, minister of
 state in the government of Imre Nagy during the
 Hungarian revolution in 1956 and a prominent
 contemporary political thinker. The Hungarian
 authorities refused to publish the book, because a
 number of the book's essays criticized Soviet
 domination of Eastern Europe and contested the
 legitimacy of communist party rule.
 Hungarian dissidents are loosely organized. In
 December 1979 a group of young intellectuals and
 professionals formed a group which they called the
 Foundation for the Assistance of the Poor (known by
 
 
 798
 its Hungarian acronym 8ZETA). The stated purpose of
 the group was to raise money and provide financial,
 legal and other assistance for the poor within
 Hungarian society. Their activities included a
 public auction of works donated by Hungarian artists
 in December 1980. The group raised approximately
 $8,000 at the auction for distribution to the poor.
 other dissidents meet frequently at an informal "free
 university" in Budapest, where academicians and
 dissidents lecture on topics which are not discussed
 in formal university institutions.
 Dissidents also meet irregularly:for private
 discussions of political.and other topics. A group
 of Hungarian dissidents is active in the distribution
 of books and articles in samizdat form which are
 prohibited by authorities. In September 1981, a
 Hungarian was arrested by Hungarian police after
 leaving the home of a prominent dissident. He was
 questioned by police and reprimanded for his
 involvement in the dissemination of samizdat
 documents. Five other Hungarians are known to have
 been questioned by Hungarian police and reprimanded.
 The authorities also reportedly confiscated a
 significant amount of samizdat material from the
 homes of those arrested. No one received a jail
 sentence.
 Notwithstanding these activites, dissident activity
 in Hungary remains largely confined to several
 hundred intellectuals who live primarily in
 Budapest. The Hungarian government has sought and
 obtained both tacit support from much of the populace
 and the active participation by broad groups of
 intellectuals and others in national life. Hungary's
 economic progress over the last decade, its emphasis
 on consumerism, and its willingness to permit more
 frequent travel to the West than most other Warsaw
 Pact nations, have all contributed to the relative
 marginality of the dissident movement vis-a-vis
 Hungarian society as a whole. ,The government has
 improved relations with the hierarchies of most of
 the major religious denominations. The churches do
 not act as organizing centers for dissent. The
 government has also shown a general willingness to
 weather without explicit reply or rejoinder some
 incidents of dissent which occasionally emerge. It
 has occasionally expelled or permitted the emigration
 to the West of outspoken opponents of the political
 system. In at least two such cases, individuals
 later have returned to Hungary and resumed residence
 and their dissident activities.
 Hungarian press, radio, and television are
 centrally-managed media. They are government-owned
 and observe current party guidelines, which include
 the maxim that the role of a "journalist" is to
 further the cause of communism. A formal structure
 of censorship does not exist, but censorship is
 exercised by writers and editors themselves in terms
 
 
 799
 of certain basic premises of domestic and foreign
 policy. Some carefully-nuanced differing views
 occasionally appear in the press and literature, but
 they are usually well within the general
 constraints. Infrequently, Western viewpoints can be
 heard on Hungarian radio and television. These may
 be the views of a Western spokesman, broadcast
 together with those of other participants in a panel
 discussion, or straight reporting of a Western
 official's comments on a topical international issue,
 such as U.S.-Soviet relations and the crises in
 Afghanistan or Poland. Hungary does not jam Western
 radios, and Austrian and Yugoslav radio and
 television broadcasts reach much of the country.
 Hungary permits a degree of access to Western
 literature and films, including some television
 programs and about twenty American films annually.
 Some Western periodicals are available in limited
 quantities in Hungary, usually at newsstands
 frequented by foreigners.
 The practice of religion in Hungary is neither
 encouraged nor rigorously impeded by the state which
 -- albeit steadfastly committed to atheism -- has for
 tactical reasons come to profess the acceptability of
 both believers and nonbelievers working together in
 the interest of socialist.society. In this
 connection, major religious denominations have
 representatives in the parliament, and state honors
 have been bestowed on prominent churchmen such as the
 Roman Catholic primate, Cardinal Laszlo Lekai, and
 the chief Jewish rabbi, Laszlo Salgo. A Hungarian's
 religious beliefs can limit advancement in government
 and in society in general.
 Sizeable religious groups in Hungary include Roman
 Catholics (5.25 million), Calvinists (2 million),
 Evangelical Lutherans (0.5 million), and Jews
 (100,000). There are some 19 religious denominations
 in Hungary recognized by law, plus several minor
 sects, such as Jehovah's Witnesses. The total number
 of ,persons manifesting some religious belief is
 estimated at 8.5 million out of a population of 10.7
 million..
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 All adult citizens are issued an I.D. booklet and
 must carry it with them for travel, and register with
 local police when moving from one locality to
 another. Permanent transfer from rural areas to
 Budapest is permitted, but, because of overcrowding
 of the capital, is not encouraged and can be
 difficult because of the scarcity of housing.
 Hungarian emigration law ostensibly is restrictive in
 that it stipulates that a person can normally apply
 to emigrate only if over 55 years of age and joining
 a parent, spouse, or child abroad. However,
 
 
 800
 the law provides for exceptions in individual cases,
 and approximately 90 percent of Hungarians who apply
 to emigrate for such purposes receive permission.
 Persons who are refused may appeal and reapply;
 reapplications are sometimes successful, particularly
 if special humanitarian considerations emerge. There
 are no systematic official sanctions, such as loss of
 employment, imposed on persons who seek to emigrate,
 and emigrants may take a modest amount of personal
 property with them.
 Hungary follows a cautiously liberal practice in
 regard to permitting visits to the West. Some
 486,000 Hungarians currently visit the West annually,
 and 4,685,400 made visits to other Eastern European
 countries.
 Substantial numbers of Hungarians can visit the West
 at regulated intervals if they wish. It is possible
 to pay for trips to Western Europe and beyond,
 including North America, in Hungarian currency.
 Private travelers can receive a modest hard-currency
 allotment once every three years to defray
 hard-currency expenses. Biennial or, in the case of
 older persons, annual trips are possible if relatives
 or friends abroad pay the costs.
 Exit permission for both visitors and emigrants can
 be and occasionally is denied for vague reasons of
 state. The right of travel remains a gift of the
 state rather than a prerogative of the individual.
 Persons who have emigrated legally from Hungary have
 a legal right to return. Persons who leave Hungary
 as visitors with exit permission to stay abroad only
 temporarily and who then remain away are subject to
 prosecution if they return. Hungary appears to
 follow, however, a discretionary practice of
 regarding such persons, if they return, with benign
 neglect. Prosecution may not occur or, when it does,
 may amount to a formality leading to a suspended
 sentence. Returnees probably would not be granted
 the privilege of visiting abroad again for up to five
 years, and there is no assurance that more assiduous
 prosecution and other sanctions, such as deprivation
 of former employment, would not occur.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The constitution emphasizes that the Hungarian
 Socialist Workers (Communist) Party represents the
 "working class" and the "interests of the whole of
 the society." The Communist Party retains a monopoly
 of political power in Hungary and uses
 party-sanctioned organizations such as the Patriotic
 People's Front, trade unions, and the Young Communist
 organization to elicit broad public support.
 Effective political participation is not possible
 outside the party or the party-sanctioned
 organizations.
 
 
 801
 To an extent the party invites the opinions and
 recommendations of nonparty organizations (for
 example, from cooperatives' associations) on policy
 proposals in which they have an interest. It appears
 that deliberation within the party about proposed
 policies and actions can be somewhat open, but
 decisions once made and handed down by the leadership
 are to be- loyally followed.
 Although more than one-third of the members of the
 national assembly are women, there are few women at
 top levels in the government or party. None of the
 nineteen members of the council of ministers, and
 only one of the thirteen members of the politburo is
 female. The party officially espouses the
 enhancement of the role of women in Hungarian
 society, but results to date are limited.
 The Hungarian National Trade Union Council (SZOT) is
 one of the party's mass organizations and is subject
 to party control and direction. It serves the dual
 purpose of educating workers in party policy and
 promoting worker interests. The secretary general of
 SZOT is a member of.the party politburo. ' He leads
 SZOT delegations in regularly scheduled meetings with
 the party leadership and with the government over
 labor policy, economic planning, prices, wages, and
 other economic issues. On the local' and enterprise
 level, SZOT has established a system of shop
 distribution of bonus money, profit sharing,
 enterprise-controlled housing, health care, union
 vacation plans and other benefits. Stewards can veto
 management decisions on personnel actions, plant
 safety and other issues which do not comply with
 stated agreements. Disputed questions are referred
 to higher authorities for arbitration.
 The Hungarian constitution does not provide for the
 right to strike, but as a number of Hungarian
 commentators have pointed out recently, strikes are
 not prohibited by law. The secretary general of SZOT
 stated in October 1980 that localized strikes of a
 few hours duration had occurred in Hungary due to the
 failure of management and the local union officials
 to implement existing agreements.
 3.     Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Hungarian government regards outside charges and
 investigations of alleged human rights violations as
 interference in its internal affairs. Hungary has
 nevertheless shown a willingness to engage in
 mutually beneficial discussions with other countries
 on all aspects of the Helsinki Final Act, including
 its human rights provisions. In certain elements of
 its bilateral dialogue with some other countries,
 Hungary has been willing to discuss quietly some
 
 
 802
 individual problem cases, particularly ones dealing
 with emigration.
 4.     Economic and Social Circumstances
 Although an industrialized, non-market economy,
 Hungary has many economic features which are unique
 in Eastern Europe. Most state-owned enterprises
 enjoy a high degree of autonomy. Central government
 economic authorities do not as a rule impose specific
 production quotas on enterprises, but usually rely on
 macroeconomic policy tools to guide the economy.
 Some consumer prices, especially for food items, are
 set by free market forces. Professional and skilled
 workers have extensive employment opportunities, on a
 part-time or full-time basis, in the private and
 quasi-private sectors. There are no food shortages
 in Hungary. Private farming activities have long
 been encouraged on state and collective farms. Such
 private farming accounts for about one-third of
 Hungary's total farm production. Moreover, the
 Hungarian government has recently begun encouraging
 private enterprise-type activities in the consumer
 services sector and in small industrial enterpribes.
 However, while the significance of private industrial
 activities is growing, the "private sector" is not
 expected to become a large component of Hungarian
 industry. In short, through the combination of
 flexible prices and enterprise autonomy, as well as
 through government encouragement of private farming
 and private enterprise-type activities, Hungary has
 produced an economic system far more sensitive to
 consumer needs than other CEMA economies.
 One area of the consumer sector where Hungary may lag
 behind is housing. In 1980, there was an average of
 1.5 persons per room in Hungarian dwellings.
 Although this reflects some overcrowding, this figure
 is a substantial improvement over 1970 when the
 average was about two persons per room. A.
 substantial portion of this improvement in housing
 conditions can be attributed to the government's
 encouragement of private house construction.
 A milestone in Hungary's progress toward a more
 decentralized economic system was achieved on October
 1, 1981, when a unified rate of exchange for both
 tourist and commercial transactions was established.
 This rate of exchange is set at a realistic level
 (generally in line with free market rates in Western
 Europe) and regularly adjusted. Any comparison of
 East European economic indicators must take into:
 account the fact that only Hungary (among European
 CEMA countries) has a realistic rate of exchange for
 all transactions. Food, shelter, health care, and
 education are available to all Hungarians regardless
 of race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or
 political opinion. The following indicators drawn
 from World Bank and other sources reflect the
 satisfactory levels of health, education, and other
 social services in Hungary: GNP per capita (in U.S.
 dollars, 1979), *3,8501 life expectancy at birth
 (1979), 71; infant mortality rate per 1,000 live
 births (1979), 24; literacy rate (1976 percentage),
 98, population growth rate (average annual, 1970-79),
 0.41 adjusted primary school enrollment ratio
 (1978)e total, 97; male, 96; female, 97.
