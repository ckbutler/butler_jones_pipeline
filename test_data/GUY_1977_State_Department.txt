 GUYANA
 
 Guyana is a democratic country with a parliamentary
 system on the British model. Since the early 1960s
 Guyana, led by Prime Minister Forbes Burnham, has
 followed an avowedly socialist path toward political
 and social development. The country and its present
 leaders remain rooted in the Anglo-Saxon tradition
 of respect for individual rights and of observance
 of the principles of law. Elections are held every
 five years and are contested by various political
 parties. The next elections are scheduled for the
 fall of 1978.
 The racial composition of the population (53% East
 Indian and 42% Black) has created strains within
 the Guyanese'political and social structure. However,
 the Government has voiced its full support for the
 protection of human rights and has condemned violations.
 Reports of discrimination against the East Indian popula-
 tion have surfaced in recent years, but so far there has
 been no substantial evidence to support them.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no evidence that torture has been used.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment or punishment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There are no indications of arbitrary arrest or imprisonment.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are no reports of denial of fair public trial.
 However, Amnesty International in November 1977 sent
 to Guyana a representative to attend the trial of a
 Guyanese accused of killing a policeman. The Opposition
 (169)
 
 22-145 0 - 78 - 12
 
 
 Party, the People's Progressive Party, charged that
 the trial was politically inspired and that it amounted
 to political persecution against one of its members.
 In December 1977, after a third trial, the accused
 was found not guilty by the jury and released.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are few reports of invasion of the home.
 Some homes have been searched for contraband
 without a warrant.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Government is conscious of the basic needs of
 its population and is striving to meet them within
 the limits of the resources available. Some East
 Indian Guyanese claim that the present Black leader-
 ship of Guyana givqes Preference to the Black population
 -fiu-sch areas as_low cost.housina and Governmentlobs..
 Hoever', East Indian rice farmers have been principal
 beneficiaries of the Government's agricultural policies.
 There is little evidence to substantiate reports of-
 corruption to the benefit of the nation's political
 rulers and the Black minority.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 The Government of Guyana has partial control of
 the media. It owng one radio station (there is no TV
 in Guyana) and two of the three daily newspapers and
 one of two leading weeklies. The Government owned
 media reflect Government policies faithfully. The
 opposition papers--one daily published by the Opposi-
 tion Party, the Peoples Progressive Party, and the
 weekly Catholic Standard by the Catholic church --
 engage in uninhibited and consistent criticism of the

 Government. During 1975 and 1976 these newspapers
 occasionally were hampered by Go~iernment restraints on
 import of newsprint and equipment, but in 1977 there
 were no indications that the Government prevented
 them from obtaining supplies. At an October 1977
 meeting of the Inter-American Press Association, several
 speakers stated that there is "grave danger to the
 freedom of the press in Guyana" because of Government
 interference. This allegation was strongly denied by
 the Government.
 There are no reports of interference in the right
 of assembly or religious affiliation. During 1976
 the Government assumed financial and management
 responsibility for all educational institutions in
 Guyana, including those run by the various churches.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 In Guyana there is no restriction on travel within
 or without the country nor is there any obstacle to
 emigration. The only exception applies to certain
 disputed border areas over which Venezuela and Surinam
 make claims.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 In the general elections of 1968 and 1973 charges of
 fraud and rigging were widespread. Although those
 making these charges have been unable to substantiate
 their allegations in court, it is widely believed
 that fraud and rigging were practiced. The Opposition
 Party alleges publicly that because of this fraud
 and rigging it is inadequately represented in the
 Parliament. The Government rejects these allegations.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government of Guyana permitted a November, 1977 visit
 by an Amnesty International representative, as noted
 under ld. Guyana is not a member of the OAS and the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission has not visited
 Guyana.
