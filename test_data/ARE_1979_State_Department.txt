 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven
 small traditional Arab shaikhdoms formed in 1971 when
 Great Britain relinquished its 150-year-old special
 treaty relationship with their rulers. The Emirates are
 unequal in size, population, natural resources, and
 economic development, with Abu Dhabi, the largest and
 wealthiest, playing a predominant role in the federation.
 Under Abu Dhabi's ruler, Shaikh Zayid, who is also Presi-
 dent of the UAE, there has been considerable progress to-
 ward formation of a centralized and effective federal
 government. Nevertheless, individual emirates continue
 to exercise extensive authority over their own economic
 resources and development planning, police and security
 forces, law courts, and social welfare policies. The
 Emirates' eqalitarian Islamic and bedouin traditions have
 shaped their outlook on political organization and their
 attitude toward human rights. The provisional federal
 Constitution, adopted initially for five years and since
 extended to December 1981, contains numerous guarantees -
 for integrity of the person and for basic civil lib-
 erties while preserving effective political control in
 the hands of the hereditary ruling families in each emirate.
 The seven rulers (or their deputies) comprise the Supreme
 Council which is the UAE's highest executive and legis-
 lative body. Its Chairman, the UAE Chief of State, ap-
 points the Prime Minister and his cabinet.
 One particular feature of the UAE is that fewer than
 thirty percent of its nearly 900,000 inhabitants are
 citizens. Expatriates recruited from South Asia, other
 Arab countries, Western Europe, and the US make up most
 of the work force, many occupying key managerial, pro-
 fessional, and technical posts in the public and oil sec-
 tors. UAE nationals enjoy certain benefits and privileqes
 denied to the alien majority, few of whom are offered
 UAE citizenship. This large and diverse foreign popu-
 lation is regarded as a potentially serious security (as
 well as social and cultural) problem for the UAE, but
 is tolerated because its skills and labor are essential
 to the country. Aliens deemed security threats or trouble-
 makers are swiftly deported. Most foreign workers find
 high wages and employment opportunities often unavailable
 in their homelands. Harsh'or arbitrary security measures
 have rarely been employed to maintain stability and order
 in the UAE.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The Department of State has found no instances of torture.
 The Constitution clearly prohibits such practices.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading treatment.
 Some emirates, notably Ab Dhabi, apply traditional
 
 (843)
 
 
 844
 Islamic legal procedures and penalties in criminal cases
 which are tried in Sharia courts. Other emirates have
 a criminal court system based on European models. Some
 crimes, like rape, have been punished by public
 flogging as well as by fines, imprisonment and, in the
 case of expatriates, deportation. Muslims may also be
 lashed for transgression of Islamic laws against drinking
 alcohol and violating the Ramadan fast. Theoretically,
 the amputation of a hand for theft can be imposed by the
 Sharia courts, but in practice such sentences have been
 commuted to imprisonment and/or deportation. All capital
 sentences must be approved by the ruler of the emirate.
 Capital punishment has been administered three times in
 the past two years to the best available information. All
 three executions involved individuals convicted of pre-
 meditated murder, including the political assassination of
 a UAE cabinet minister in October 1977. Prison con-
 ditions, while not comfortable due to crowding and lack
 of air conditioning, are tolerable. Prison diet and
 medical care are adequate. Prisoners are allowed visits
 from family members, lawyers and -- if foreigners --
 consular representatives. There are no reports that the
 authorities condone ill-treatment of prisoners or that
 ill-treatment is common either in detention or after
 transfer to prison.
 c. Aribtrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 UAE law allows summary arrest and detention, especially
 when the security of the state is involved. No arrest
 warrant is required. Prolonged detention without trial
 is rare. One current case involves a member of the rul-
 ing family of Sharjah. In 1972 he mounted an unsuccess-
 ful coup in which the ruler was killed; the alleged
 murderer was never tried and remains under house arrest.
 The Department of State has no reports of other individu-
 als currently under arrest or detention in the UAE for
 political reasons.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE courts provide fair and public trials before
 experienced civil or religious judges drawn mainly from
 other Arab countries. There are no jury trials. The
 accused may be represented by counsel of his choice, but
 no public defender system exists. Crimes and punishments
 are defined by law and the accused is presumed innocent.
 Public access to trials involving sensitive security or
 political aspects may be restricted. The assassin of
 Minister of State Saif Ghubbash was tried and convicted
 in camera by a special court in 1978.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The provisional Constitution guarantees freedom from
 arbitrary search, and presentation of a search warrant
 is usually required before police officials may enter a
 home. In extraordinary circumstances, however, police
 have been known to conduct searches without warrants,
 especially when state security was involved.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 
 
 845
 with oil revenues of about $11.5 billion in 1979, the
 UAE has ample funds for economic and social development.
 The UAE has one of the highest per capita incomes in the
 world. Many infrastructure and industrial projects have
 been completed or are in progress. The UAE has also
 made a major effort to fulfill the basic needs of its
 citizens for food, shelter, health care, and education.
 The benefits of such programs are distributed unevenly
 among the emirates, with the wealthier oil-exporting
 emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai generally able to pro-
 vide more and better quality social services than the
 other five emirates. Education and, increasingly, health
 care and shelter are provided the less-well-off emirates
 through federal government projects funded principally
 by Abu Dhabi.
 The economic system is essentially a form of statism with
 joint government and private ownership of major industrial
 or utility concerns. Private property rights are protect-
 ed under both Sharia and civil law. In accordance with
 both Islamic law -and local custom, the right to real prop-
 erty is vested in the rulers who in turn sell or make liberal
 usufruct gifts of land to UAE citizens. Most emirates re-
 strict ownership of land to UAE citizens. Citizens are also
 usually given preference in issuance of business licenses
 or in sale of shares in public enterprises.
 Shelter continues to be a problem, especially in rural
 areas of the non-oil exporting emirates where some families
 still live in reed huts. Laissez-faire government policies
 have led in some emirates to a surplus of relatively ex-.
 pensive housing along with a shortage of lower-income
 shelter. Programs to expand the number of low-cost hous-
 ing units are being undertaken by both the federal and,
 emirate governments. In some emirates, e.g., Abu Dhabi,
 water and electricity are also provided residential users
 at subsidized prices.
 With little arable land and sparse water resources, the
 UAE must import most of its food. In the Abu Dhabi and
 Dubai emirates, citizens are eligible to buy basic com-
 modities at subsidized prices in special markets. In
 1979 for the first time these subsidies were extended
 also to citizens living in other emirates. A recent UNICEF
 study shows that serious malnutrition affects many UAE
 nursing infants. UNICEF has recommended a widespread edu-
 cational and health-care program aimed at improving nutri-
 tional practices in the home.
 Education is compulsory from ages six to twelve and is
 free for all academically qualified children from kinder-
 garten through university. Modern schools now exist in
 all the major towns, and new schools -- including board-
 ing facilities for secondary students -- are being built
 in hitherto remote rural areas. The overall literacy rate
 is still low, about 25 percent, but most boys of school
 are now in school. Women as well as men have access to
 secondary and university level education although classes
 are conducted separately. Family conservatism and the
 still-common practice of girls marrying soon after pub-
 erty have prevented many women from continuing their edu-
 cation beyond the primary stage.
 
 
 846
 Health care, sometimes uneven in quality, is available
 increasingly, in government hospitals and clinics, even
 in some remote areas. Treatment is free to all citizens
 and non-citizens; citizens may also be treated abroad at
 government expense.
 The rapid pace of economic development and a laissez-
 faire business environment have led to some malfeasance
 and profiteering. Local prohibitions against corrupt prac-
 tices or conflict of interest are few-and not particularly
 effective. Given the high per capita income and the country's
 extensive social welfare programs, corruption has not
 significantly diverted resources from the poor.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Citizens of the UAE are constitutionally guaranteed the
 freedoms of speech, communication, religion, and assembly
 "within the limits of the law." Individual UAE citizens
 feel free to express their views on a wide range of pub-
 lic issues without fear of retribution. Radio and tele-
 vision are controlled by the Ministry of Information and
 Culture or by individual emirate governments, and a state-
 owned corporation publishes the country's principal Arabic
 and English dailies. The UAE official media use syndicat-
 ed material from a wide range of sources, and there are
 also several privately-owned newspapers and periodicals.
 Mild criticism of government actions or policies appears
 in the printed media, even in the official press, but
 "irresponsible" opposition to the government is discour-
 aged. One newspaper was closed in 1978 and the expatriate
 editor of another discharged following sharp attacks on
 cabinet ministers. Visits by foreign journalists require
 Ministry of Information approval. In the past year sever-
 al journalists have been denied entry.
 Books, films, and periodicals are subject to censorship of
 matter considered pornographic, derogatory of the Arabs or
 of Islam, favorable to Israel, or politically subversive.
 In practice, because of the UAE's loose federal structure,
 material banned from publication or distribution   in one
 emirate sometimes has been able to appear in another. Clubs
 and other organizations must be licensed by the federal or
 emirate governments. The Lions Club in Dubai was ordered
 disbanded for being unlicensed. By refusing to issue per-
 mits, individual emirates have been able to prohibit gath-
 erings they consider prejudicial to public order.
 The Constitution establishes Islam as the religion of the
 state. Non-Muslims, virtually all of whom are aliens, may
 practice their faiths so long as this "does not conflict
 with public policy or violate public morals." Christian
 churches and schools are officially tolerated. However,
 there are restrictions on proselytizing by non-Moslims, and
 conversion from Islam to another religion is discouraged.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is no restraint on freedom of movement within the
 country, although visits to certain areas, e.g., oil
 
 
 847
 installations, require prior permission from security
 authorities. Foreign travel and emigration for all
 citizens are unrestricted.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Political parties or movements are unknown among UAE
 citizens, and there is no provision for their organiza-
 tion in the provisional Constitution. Nevertheless, in
 the tribal tradition of the emirates that comprise the
 UAE, citizens are encouraged to express their views dir-
 ectly to their leaders. Most UAE emirate rulers, includ-
 ing Shaikh Zayid, hold regular sessions (majlis) at which
 ordinary citizens are welcome to present petitions or air
 grievances. Government decisions in the individual emir-
 ates are normally made after consultation with leading
 members of the society, although in only one emirate --
 Abu Dhabi -- has this consultation assumed a formal char-
 acter through creation of an appointed consultative coun-
 cil. At the federal level, there is a National Assembly
 of forty members selected by the rulers of the seven
 emirates. It must be consulted on all matters of federal
 legislation presented by the Council of Ministers to the
 rulers for approval. Sentiment is growing in the UAE
 that at least some of these representatives should be
 popularly elected. Agreement on how to provide for for-
 mal popular participation in the political process is
 unlikely, however, until definitive government structures
 have been developed and a permanent Constitution for the
 federation is adopted.
 The status women in the UAE is affected by traditional
 values. Women may own property, including bank accounts,
 in their own right. A small but growing number are find-
 ing employment with government and private business as
 engineers, policewomen, teachers and social workers. Under
 the patronage of the UAE President's wife and women from
 other UAE ruling families, a federation of women's organi-
 zations has been formed to provide adult education, handi-
 craft training, and recreational outlets for their members.
 Limitations on the greater participation of women in UAE
 public life stem from the fact that few adult UAE women
 have yet attained the kind of education needed in a modern
 society, as well as from family and societal pressures to
 remain in "traditional" roles within the home.
 Expatriates are expected to refrain from political activity
 that in any way would affect or involve the UAR. As vir-
 tually the entire labor force is foreign, labor is not per-
 mitted to organize. There are no trade unions in the UAE.
 There is no legal provision for the right to strike or to
 engage in collective bargaining. A few strikes have oc-
 curred but their leaders, almost invariably aliens, were
 usually deported. Conciliation of individual labor griev-
 ances is administered by the Ministry of Labor.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The UAE Government is aware of human rights issues in
 international affairs. The local press has published
 articles based on the 1977 and 1978 reports to the Congress
 on the UAE's human rights practices. To the knowledge of
 the Department of State, no international investigations by
 human rights organizations have been conducted or proposed
 for the UAE.
