 ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS
 St. Christopher and Nevis, which became independent from the
 United Kingdom in 1983, has a government modeled on the
 British parliamentary system, with elections at least every 5
 years. The political opposition is active and vocal. The
 Constitution provides the smaller island of Nevis considerable
 self-government, as well as the right to secede from the
 federation if certain enumerated procedures are followed.
 Security forces consist of a small police force, which
 includes a Special Service Unit that receives some light
 infantry training.
 St. Christopher and Nevis has a mixed economic system. Most
 commercial enterprises are privately owned, but the sugar
 industry--the country's largest--and 85 percent of all arable
 land are owned by state corporations.
 The country's human rights record remained good in 1986.

 The current Government is a coalition of two of the three
 major political parties: the People's Action Movement, led by

 Party, headed by Simeon Daniel, the Premier of Nevis. In the
 June 1984 national election, the coalition strengthened its
