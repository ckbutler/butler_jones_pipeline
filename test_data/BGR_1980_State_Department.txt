 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a Balkan nation of nine million people which
 has been governed by a Communist regime since the end of
 World War II. Long a part of the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria
 regained its independence from the Turks in 1878 and was a
 fully independent kingdom between 1908 and 1944. The
 Bulgarian government imposes restrictions on individual
 liberties and on expressions of political and economic
 views. It does not permit the people to have an effective
 means of participating in the selection of their
 government or in the determination of its policies. Tight
 restrictions are maintained on political, civil and
 economic liberties and citizens are not permitted to
 exercise such internationally recognized rights as
 participation in the government, freedom to travel abroad,
 expression of dissenting political opinions, formation of
 free labor unions, and free access to information. There
 is no organized dissident movement or organized opposition
 to the government.
 The Bulgarian government has pursued a course of economic
 and social development which has raised the living
 standards of the Bulgarian people and provided for basic
 social needs of the citizenry including pensions, free
 universal public education, and guaranteed employment for
 all.
 I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 15 of Chapter 2 of the Bulgarian penal procedures
 code states "no coercive measures may be taken against
 citizens participating in penal procedures, other than in
 cases and according to procedures stipulated in this
 code." While there is no direct evidence indicating
 torture is carried out or condoned by the Bulgarian
 gvernment, Amnesty International has expressed concern
 about reports it has received concerning the treatment of
 prisoners in Sofia. According to these reports, prisoners
 have been subjected to long and repeated interrogations,
 deprived of sleep, and severely beaten with fists and
 rubber truncheons.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been reports of severe prison conditions in
 Bulgaria, particularly for those persons sentenced to hard
 labor. Prisons are said to be crowded. Diet is adequate,
 but medical care is inadequate. Prisoners have alleged
 that during pre-trial detention, they were confined in a
 psychiatric clinic and forcibly given drugs. Family
 visits are allowed on a monthly basis for all but
 political prisoners, i.e., those sentenced for espionage
 or anti-government activity. Legal counsel is permitted,
 though often such counsel is chosen by the government and
 presumably is government-influenced. It is not known
 whether international organizations interested in prisoner
 welfare have received access to detainees, though several
 are reported to have made inquiries regarding such
 access. There are no indications of summary executions.

 c. Disappearances
 In the past, there have been occasional reports of that
 persons have been held clandestinely for limited periods.
 There are no current reports of disappeared persons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Amnesty International is investigating the cases of 23
 Bulgarians regarded by Amnesty as possible political
 prisoners. Additionally, six Protestant activists were
 arrested in March 1979 on charges of illegal currency
 transactions, although accusations published abroad charge
 religious persecution. At least one activist has recently
 been released. Other estimates of the numbers of
 political prisoners are not available. The Bulgarian
 government-does not recognize the existence of political
 prisoners in the Bulgarian penal system.
 The principle of habeas corpus exists under the Bulgarian
 criminal code, and is followed in practice except in a few
 cases which the government considers politically
 sensitive. The law provides for "preliminary detention"
 in cases where evidence indicates some justification for a
 later indictment, though the law states that there will be
 a ten-day limit on such detentions. In all cases, the
 accused must be informed of the charges pending against
 him. How rigorously these procedural safeguards are
 observed in practice has not been determined.
 Banishment to remote villages has reportedly been used to
 discourage political dissidence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bulgarian law and-general practice provide for public
 trial in.criminal cases. Defendants are entitled to
 .counsel, but only after a preliminary investigation has
 been completed and an indictment has been prepared. In
 the meantime, the accused may be detained without access
 to counsel. There are special.court procedures for cases
 involving state security. A trial may be held in camera
 to preserve a state secret or to protect "socialist
 morality." Amnesty International:reports that it has
 recedved reports-.that in-political cases, witnesses have
 'been intimidated by the police into testifying against the
 -accused and that the defendant's family and friends have
 been barred from the courtroom during the trial. Total
 party and executive branch control over the legal process
 rather than an independent judicial system is the rule.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 By law,.the sanctity of the home is safeguarded. Police
 authorities may search property legally only with prior
 permission from a responsible court or prosecutor. Such
 searches may, however, be legally undertaken in urgent
 cases by the preliminary investigation authorities prior
 to approval by judicial authorities. Whether these legal
 provisions are effective safeguards has not been
 determined. Illegal entries are reported to take place.

 2. Government   Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Bulgaria endeavors to provide for the material needs of
 its citizens. The per capita gross national product in
 1979 was $2230. The Bulgarian government claims a growth
 rate of six percent, but the figures may not be accurate.
 All citizens are guaranteed a job and officially there is
 no unemployment. The average monthly salary of about 150
 leva ($175 at the official exchange rate) allows
 Bulgarians an adequate, if frugal, existence, particularly
 in light of low rents, very inexpensive public
 transportation, and low-priced staple food.
 Real incomes were affected in November 1979 when major
 increases in wages and prices went into effect. Prices of
 a wide variety of products -- especially staple food
 items, alcoholic beverages, heat, and energy -- were
 increased from 20 to 100 percent. At the same time, wages
 were increased on the average of only 25 percent. There
 are no figures on inflation. Prices generally are stable
 except for the above mentioned price hikes.
 Today more than one million of Bulgaria's nine million
 people live in Sofia and, in spite of administrative
 restrictions,the rural exodus is continuing. A primary
 explanation for the trend is that the money income of
 agricultural workers has decreased in comparison to that
 of other employees. Bulgaria has its share of poor
 people, but there are no great disparities between poverty
 and wealth. Success brings admission to the privileged
 class rather than great personal wealth. Most individual
 taxes are included in the price of goods. Some
 necessities (e.g., public transportation, rents, food) are
 subsidized by the state. There are limits on private
 property ownership; a person may own his own home, a
 country villa, a car, a small number of livestock and a
 plot of land normally not exceeding 2.5 acres. In
 practice few people can afford these luxuries.
 Bulgaria's leaders are concerned about the country's low
 birth rate (which was 16.5 per thousand in 1976 while the
 death rate was 10.1 per thousand) and have established-
 official monetary incentives to encourage families to have
 children. 1978 government statistics show one doctor for
 every 432 citizens, one dentist for every 1960 persons,
 and 88 hospital beds per 10,000.
 Extensive construction of new public apartment buildings
 in the past decade has improved the general housing
 situation. Shortages still exist, however, and Bulgarians
 still wait years for their turn for a new apartment.
 Education is free through the university level. There is
 a general system of merit selection for admission to
 universities which is alloyed by some advantages for the
 privileged; children of Party officials usually have
 easier access to higher education than does the general
 population. No appreciable differences in the standard of
 primary and secondary education exist between urban and
 rural areas. Literacy is high.
 Bulgarian education laws and policies do not discriminate
 against women, and in some cases promote equal access for
 
 
 743
 women. One half of the openings for university students
 available each year are reserved by law for women.
 While there is no evidence that widespread corruption
 exists, some Bulgarians complain that they must make sub
 rosa payments in order to receive basic services which are
 nominally free, such as medical care. Favors are also
 exchanged, for example, to obtain materials in short
 supply.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Bulgarian constitution of 1971 guarantees certain
 basic rights including rights to citizenship, work, rest,
 access to health care and free education, speech, press,
 association and demonstration, freedom of worship, and the
 right of privacy of correspondence and communication
 except in cases of national emergency. Women are
 guaranteed equal rights with men, and all citizens are
 declared to be equal before the law, regardless of
 national origin, creed, social status, education or sex.
 These freedoms are circumscribed in practice. Genuine
 political freedom does not exist. The state controls the
 press, decides which political organizations may exist,
 and determines which political demonstrations may take
 place. Laws severely punish anyone accused of "founding
 an illegal anti-state organization" and criticizing the
 state (articles 108, 109, 113 of the Bulgarian penal
 code). Article 273 proscribes the dissemination of
 "untruthful remarks which might increase mistrust of the
 state power or cause confusion in society." Domestic
 opposition to the state or Party is not tolerated; if
 found, it is dealt with promptly and severely with prison
 sentences. The public does send criticisms, suggestions,
 and complaints by letter to newspapers and to National
 Assembly representatives on a broad range of topics such
 as inadequate service from public agencies and housing
 shortages. The government allows this open criticism to
 take place, and evidently seeks to investigate complaints
 and respond to them.
 Bulgaria jams the Bulgarian-language radio broadcasts of
 Radio Free Europe. It does not jam the Voice of America
 or the BBC Bulgarian services.' It does not permit the
 open sale of Western periodicals except for occasional
 very small numbers of newspapers sold in hotels frequented
 primarily by foreigners. Mail from Western countries is
 periodically screened, and items found offensive to the
 state or pornographic are confiscated. Although
 censorship does not exist officially, the media must
 operate within well-understood Party and state guidelines
 and practices (e.g., international news is usually limited
 to the government news agency or official Soviet
 sources). Forbidden topics in the Bulgarian press include
 the unauthorized criticism of Party and state leaders, of
 socialist ideology, and of the USSR and other socialist
 countries. All media are government-controlled.
 Opposition views have not been aired since 1947, when the
 last independent newspapers were taken over by the State.
 Literature and art are censored.
 
 
 744
 Religion may be practiced within limits by believers in
 denominations recognized by the government, especially the
 Bulgarian Orthodox Church. However, being a church member
 or being active in religious affairs has a decidedly
 negative effect on admission to higher government and
 Party positions. Amnesty International has reported that
 Moslem believers in Bulgaria, both members of the Turkish
 minority and ethnic Bulgarians, have been persecuted and
 imprisoned because of religious activities or their ethnic
 background. There have also been reports that'members of
 Pentacostal sects have been punished by the government for
 religious activities.
 Although theoretically there is separation of church and
 state, the government and the Party exert very strong
 influences over the church. The state uses the
 overwhelmingly predominant Orthodox Church to support its
 'policies in areas where the objectives bf the church
 coincide with those of the state, e.g., propaganda for
 peace and disarmament.
 The government closely monitors and circumscribes
 organized religion in Bulgaria through.numerous
 restrictions, e.g., on the importation of Bibles, and on
 the distribution of religious publications other than
 those of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. The inadequate
 supply of Bibles and the prohibition on their importation
 have been a cause of conflict between the government and
 believers .who have attempted to bring or send Bibles to
 Bulgaria. onetheless, the state has allowed the
 Bulgarian Orthodox Church some privileges, e.g., to
 operate a seminary, to distribute publications, and to
 sell religious artifacts. It has also taken some measures
 to preserve and protect Judaism. Jewish cultural, social,
 and religious institutions receive financial support from
 the state. There are no Jewish schools or rabbis. The
 government also allows all religions to hold church
 services and to take up collections at those services.
 Roman Catholic, Uniate, Congregational, Methodist,
 Baptist, Pentacostal, Seventh Day Adventist, Armenian, and
 Islamic religious organizations are also active in
 Bulgaria.
 In practice, assembly is a right granted only to legally
 constituted organizations and only for approved purposes.
 Public assemblies are never spontaneous affairs, but are
 always Party or State organized to achieve a particular
 purpose. There are no independent trade unions in
 Bulgaria and workers are not free to negotiate or strike
 for better pay or work conditions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement, in Bulgaria and abroad, is neither
 guaranteed under law nor respected in practice. Within
 the country, Bulgarians may normally travel freely and
 visit all areas except certain designated border zones.
 Bulgarians must carry internal passports, however, and
 inform police of their destination. The government
 strictly controls the right to change residence within the
 'country.
 
 
 745
 Travel by Bulgarian citizens to other East European
 countries is somewhat limited, and travel to the West is
 severely restricted. A citizen's application for an exit
 document may be refused for several reasons, but most
 often because the travel is deemed "not in the interests
 of the state." Arbitrariness is notable in cases of
 applications to visit the West, especially when the
 applicant wishes to visit a relative who left Bulgaria
 without the permission of the government.
 Emigration is provided for by law, but rarely permitted.
 A few intending emigrants are subjected to overt
 government persecution. Most are not unless they have
 engaged in "anti-state" actions. Improvements in everyday
 life, however, such as promotions, new jobs, and
 educational opportunities, usually are not given to
 intending emigrants, even if the state approves their
 departure. Those emigrating soon after completion of
 higher education are often required to pay the government
 for part of the cost of this education. Many times,
 Bulgarian citizens desiring to visit the United States, or
 to travel to the United States to join their relatives,
 have not received Bulgarian government approval of their
 applications. In the case of applications to visit
 relatives in the United States, however, approvals of such
 requests by the Bulgarian government have noticeably
 increased in recent years.
 The constitution grants the right of asylum to foreigners
 persecuted for actions, such as "defending the interests
 of the working class," which have a strong Marxist
 flavor. The Bulgarian policy on voluntary repatriation is
 not known. Bulgaria has, however, cooperated in the past
 35 years in the repatriation of various national
 minorities, particularly Turks and Jews. Such
 repatriation efforts are not currently active.
 Approximately 150 Bulgarian refugees annually request
 admission to the United States, and the total number of
 Bulgarians fleeing to Western Europe annually is probably
 considerably higher than this number. Bulgaria insists on
 forced repatriation of citizens caught in other Communist
 countries attempting to flee to the West. Bulgarian
 policy on emigration, travel and refugee questions
 seemingly does not involve discrimination on the basis of
 sex.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Bulgaria terms its political system a two-party system
 composed of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the co-opted
 rump of the Bulgarian Agrarian Union. These two parties,
 together with labor, youth, and other organizations,
 comprise the Fatherland Front, an umbrella organization of
 Communist and non-Communist "progressive" elements
 established in 1942. In practice, however, Bulgaria has a
 one-party system, for the Fatherland Front as well as its
 various organizations are all ultimately controlled by the
 Communist Party. Article 1 (3) of the constitution gives
 clear primacy to the Communist Party. The Agrarian Party
 runs separate candidates, and holds about one fourth of
 the seats in the National Assembly, but candidacies are
 worked out jointly with the Communist Party in advance.
 Candidates of the two parties do not run against one
 
 
 746
 another, nor do they face any other opposition. Real
 opposition parties have remained effectively outlawed
 since the late forties.
 Women officially have equal rights with men and their
 status has steadily improved in recent years. A national
 women's committee produces a monthly publication and
 otherwise takes an active role in promoting women's
 interests. Women continue to be overrepresented in manual
 occupations in areas such as farming and light industry,
 as well as in some prestigious professions, such as
 medicine. Women are underrepresented in the highest
 decision-making bodies of the government and Party (only
 two of the 14 full Politburo members and one of the five
 candidate-members are women). Traditional stereotypes of
 women's roles in society and the work place remain strong
 in Bulgaria.
 An active trade union movement exists, but totally within
 the Party/state framework. Unions do not have the right
 to strike, to bargain collectively, or to lobby. Their
 functions are looking after the social welfare of their
 members and working to increase the quantity and quality
 of production.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Regarding investigations by non-Bulgarian groups on human
 rights violations, Bulgaria has not admitted any
 independent group to investigate such questions. It
 maintains that the question of human rights is strictly an
 internal matter for each government to resolve. There are
 no organizations in Bulgaria which observe, report, or act
 on human rights violations.
