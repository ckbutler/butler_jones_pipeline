 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy with a
 mixed economy emphasizing the private sector. It is a member
 of the British Commonwealth. A Governor General, appointed by
 the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister, represents the
 Queen, while the elected Prime Minister, the leader of the
 majority party in Parliament, is the country's chief
 executive. The Parliament is comprised of the elected House
 of Representatives (currently 60 members) and the appointed
 Senate of 21.
 Two major political parties have alternated in power since the
 first elections were held in 1944. The Jamaica Labour Party's
 (JLP) leader, Edward Seaga, has been Prime Minister since
 November 1980. The Constitution requires that general
 elections be called at least once every 5 years; the last
 general election was held in December 1983. The People's
 National Party (PNP) boycotted that election and the JLP won
 all 60 seats in the House of Representatives. The next
 parliamentary elections must be held before March 15, 1989.
 The PNP boycott created an unprecedented situation for
 democratic Jamaica. The JLP has attempted to compensate for
 the absence of an elected parliamentary opposition by
 appointing independent senators to the upper chamber and by
 enhancing opportunities for citizens to appear and address the
 House. Jamaica's nationwide elections for local parish
 council seats held in July 1986, in which the opposition PNP
 won a majority, were an affirmation that Jamaican democracy
 continues to function despite the anomalous situation created
 by the 1983 national parliamentary election.
 The small, apolitical security apparatus comes under the
 Ministry of National Security and consists of the Jamaica
 Constabulary Force (JCF - police), the Jamaica Special
 Constabulary Force (JSCF), and the Jamaica Defence Force
 (JDF). The JDF includes an air wing and a coast guard and has
 regular and reserve elements. Since 1974, the JDF has been
 authorized to conduct joint operations with the JCF in order
 to maintain the peace under the Suppression of Crime Act.
 In 1986 human rights generally were respected in Jamaica.
 violent crime remains a major social problem, especially in
 the Kingston area. The use of excessive violence by the
 police in dealing with suspected criminals has been criticized
 in newspaper editorials, by Jamaican and U.S. human rights
 advocates, and by the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Police
 Commissioner. Problems associated with the poorly trained,
 underpaid and overburdened police force continue to generate
 the country's most persistent human rights concerns.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Officially sanctioned murder of political opponents does not
 occur in Jamaica. At the same time, Jamaica suffers from a
 high level of violent crime, some of which has political
 overtones. Both major parties, as well as the Workers Party
 of Jamaica, which is Communist, have supporters who
 occasionally resort to violence in order to advance their
 
 
 552
 JAMAICA
 political agenda or to punish those believed to have harmed
 their party's interests. The legal system has not been
 effective in dealing with these cases because of a code of
 silence adhered to by suspects, victims, and witnesses alike,
 and because of the reluctance of the police to get involved in
 political disputes. Cooperation between the major parties to
 minimize violence made the island-wide 1986 local elections
 the most peaceful in many years.
 b. Disappearance
 There was no evidence of abduction, hostage-taking, or
 disappearances perpetrated by security forces. In most
 incidents where people disappear and are later discovered
 dead, the victims were involved in criminal activities or were
 suspected of being police informers.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 The Government does not sanction or condone the use of
 torture. However, criminal suspects are often beaten or
 mistreated by police while being held in local police
 stations. Some individuals have brought suit successfully
 against the police for unlawful actions and the Government has
 had to pay damages.
 Violence associated with the police, particularly the
 excessive use of lethal force in dealing with suspected
 criminals, continues to spark impromptu demonstrations in
 various communities. The problem of police violence receives
 frequent coverage and comment in the media. Both the
 Parliamentary Ombudsman and the National Police Commissioner
 have commented publicly on the need for qualitative
 improvement in police performance. More selective recruitment
 and better training are being stressed. The overall pace of
 reform, however, has been slow.
 Lynching of criminal suspects by local inhabitants occurs with
 some frequency, especially in rural Jamaica. Such incidents
 are often reported in the media, but comprehensive nationwide
 statistics are not available. Victims of lynching are
 typically caught stealing crops or cattle or are suspected of
 housebreaking or rape. Prosecutions of vigilantes are rare.
 Prison conditions in Jamaica are substandard. The
 Parliamentary Ombudsman reported that conditions have
 deteriorated further since 1984, when he released a study
 detailing the deplorable state of facilities and degrading
 conditions in the nation's jails. Overcrowding, unsanitary
 conditions, inadequate food and limited medical care for
 inmates are the primary problems in the island's two maximum
 security prisons and its many police stations. The Ombudsman
 said that conditions in police stations are worse generally
 than those in the prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Suppression of Crime Act, which has been extended
 for 6-month intervals since its adoption in 1974, security
 forces do not need a warrant to detain persons "reasonably"
 suspected of having committed a crime. Although the Act is
 conceived of as an extraordinary measure, security forces rely
 on it extensively. Detention of suspects without a warrant
 occurs regularly, particularly in poor neighborhoods. Almost
 all detainees eventually are released without being charged.
 
 
 553
 JAMAICA
 Police must record the fact of a detention and are responsible
 for seeing that detainees appear before a justice of the peace
 within 24 hours. However, some detainees are held for 2 weeks
 or longer without being brought before a judicial officer as
 required by law. Many detainees are unaware of their right to
 a timely judicial review of the grounds for detention. The
 Jamaica Council for Human Rights reports that 90 percent of
 its daily caseload involves assisting people attempting to
 locate and gain the release of detained family members. The
 Council reports that in both 1985 and 1986, under the
 administration of the new Police Commissioner, supervisory
 officers have been more cooperative than in the past in
 providing information about detained persons.
 For suspects charged with a crime, a functioning system of
 bail is available. Bail is set by the local police supervisor
 in minor cases, but a judicial officer sets bail for those
 suspected of more serious crimes. Individuals unable to make
 bail while waiting for a judicial hearing often are detained
 for lengthy periods. Outsiders are permitted access to the
 accused.
 There are no political prisoners in Jamaica.
 The Constitution does not specifically address the matter of
 forced or compulsory labor. However, Jamaica is a party to
 the International Labor Organization Convention prohibiting
 compulsory labor. There have been no allegations of this
 practice in Jamaica.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent. Persons who have been charged
 with a criminal offense have access to legal representation,
 and legal counsel is provided to indigents in criminal cases.
 The Court of Appeal and the.Parliament may refer cases to the
 Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United
 Kingdom. The legal system is overburdened, and many cases
 take years to come to trial. In addition to the regular
 courts, the Gun Court was established in 1974 as an
 extraordinary means of dealing with violent crime. The Gun
 Court considers cases involving the illegal use or possession
 of firearms and ammunition. There are restrictions on public
 attendance and less stringent rules of evidence are used. In
 capital cases, hearings before the Gun Court serve as
 preliminary hearings to jury trials under the jurisdiction of
 the Supreme Court. The 1983 Gun Court Amendment Act
 eliminated several of the special exceptions to normal
 judicial rules and procedures which had applied to the Gun
 Court. A committee of senior judges continues to review and
 revise the sentences of persons given life terms prior to the
 adoption of the Gun Court Amendment Act.
 Intimidation of witnesses in criminal cases is a chronic
 problem hampering criminal prosecutions in Jamaica. Jurors
 also have reported receiving threats from associates of
 criminal defendants. Some convictions have been obtained for
 such attempts to subvert the judicial system, and the police
 will provide assistance to any witness who requests protection.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State
 into the private life of the individual. Individual rights
 
 
 554
 JAMAICA
 are protected. Under the Suppression of Crime Act, search
 warrants are not required to enter homes or businesses when a
 crime is "reasonably" suspected of having been committed by an
 individual in such a location. This authority is sometimes
 abused by the police, especially in poor neighborhoods.
 Regulations approved by Parliament in 1980 require that every
 effort be made by security forces to have the owner or
 occupant of the premises present during any search.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed in the Constitution
 and are observed in practice within the broad limits of libel
 laws and the State Secrets Act. There is no censorship or
 interference in academic studies. Jamaica's'principal
 privately owned newspaper, The Daily Gleaner, has been
 critical of Jamaican governments through the years. Several
 small newspapers and magazines are also published. Foreign
 publications are widely available. The government-owned and
 operated Jamaica Broadcasting Company (JBC) includes two radio
 stations and the island's only television channel. The
 officially owned television and radio networks often have been
 accused of bias in favor of the Government by whichever party
 is in opposition.
 The only other broadcasting company is privately owned Radio
 Jamaica (RJR). Although the Government owns stock in RJR, the
 company is independent and its networks are often critical of
 government policies. A new media policy, announced in 1985 by
 the Government, will provide for one privately leased
 television channel and one channel for public programing.
 Under this policy, the Government also promised to lease out
 some of the JBC radio broadcasting facilities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are guaranteed in the
 Constitution. A large variety of professional groups and
 private associations function freely. Public demonstrations
 and rallies are staged by all political parties; such events
 require a police permit, which is usually granted. The
 nationwide local elections held in July were preceded by many
 large public rallies held by both major parties.
 Freedom of association includes the right to join a trade
 union. The Labor Relations and Industrial Disputes Act
 (IRIDA) of 1975 sets forth workers' rights regarding union
 membership and collective bargaining. No worker is compelled
 to join a union as a prerequisite for employment, and union
 membership is not compulsory when employment is found. Unions
 are free to elect their own representatives, draw up their
 constitutions, and determine their action programs. Jamaica's
 major unions are affiliated with the democratic International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the Caribbean Congress
 of Labour. The small Independent Trade Union Action Council
 and several industrial federations are affiliated with the
 Communist World Federation of Trade Unions.
 New amendments to the IRIDA were passed in 1986. One allows
 the Minister of Labour unilaterally to refer a dispute to the
 Industrial Disputes Tribunal if he detetmines that the dispute
 is causing harm to the national interest. Unions charge that
 the legislation works against free collective bargaining.
 
 
 JAMAICA
 Jamaica has several strong trade unions which are among the
 most active organizations in the country. The two major
 unions, the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) and the
 National Workers Union (NWU), are affiliated with the ruling
 JLP and the opposition PNP respectively, although the BITU and
 the NWU can and do act independently of the parties. There
 are approximately 100 registered trade unions but only about
 20 are active.
 There is no right to strike in either common or statutory
 law. In practice, however, the freedom to strike exists, and
 Jamaican workers have consistently exercised it over the
 years. There have been differing legal rulings on the "right
 to strike." Workers may exercise their "freedom" to strike
 and be immune from criminal liability. There is no parallel
 guarantee that striking workers will retain their jobs.
 Jamaican labor laws are applicable to both domestic industry
 and export free trade zones. There have been continuing
 complaints from workers at the Kingston Export Free Zone about
 forced overtime, inadequate eating facilities, and dismissal
 without notice. Ministry of Labour officials indicate that
 legal requirements for working conditions are adhered to in
 the Free Zone, while conceding the need for more employee
 facilities. Only 2 of the 17 companies operating in the
 Kingston Export Free Zone have union representation.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution and is
 well established in Jamaica. A great variety of religious
 groups and cults operate freely. More than 80 percent of the
 population belongs to one of several Christian denominations
 represented on the island. Evangelical Christian movements
 have gained increasing followings in recent years, and foreign
 evangelists visit Jamaica freely and regularly to preach.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees Jamaican citizens freedom of
 movement, the right to reside wherever they choose, and
 immunity from expulsion from the country. There are no
 restrictions on foreign travel or emigration. Citizenship is
 not revoked for political reasons.
 Jamaica does not have a declared general policy on refugees,
 but rather deals with them on a case-by-case basis. The
 country does not often accept asylum seekers, primarily for
 domestic economic reasons. Jamaica is a party to the 1951
 United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status
 of Refugees.
 Section 3   Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 The Prime Minister and his Cabinet of Ministers exercise
 executive power. The executive usually takes the initiative
 in legislative matters and is responsible to the House of
 Representatives. The Constitution requires that an election
 be held not later than 5 years after the first sitting of
 Parliament; the Prime Minister can call national elections
 anytime within that period.
 
 
 556
 JAMAICA
 Beginning in August 1983, a periodic reenumeration of all
 individuals of voting age commenced. In December, prior to
 completion of the reenumeration, Prime Minister Seaga called a
 snap election. The PNP boycotted the election, complaining
 that the JLP previously had agreed not to call new national
 elections until voter lists had been updated. As a result of
 PNP nonparticipation and the failure of any of the 7
 third-party candidates to win election, the JLP took all 60
 seats in the House of Representatives. Jamaica consequently
 has a one-party House but is not a one-party state. The 1983
 election was constitutional and conformed to all relevant
 laws, but the PNP has continued to question its legitimacy.
 The Government has thus far resisted calls for new elections
 before the expiration of its term in 1988.
 Parliament postponed nationwide local elections, held to fill
 seats in parish councils, until July 1986. These elections
 were to have been held in July 1984, but disputes over a
 reduction in the number of council seats and a redrawing of
 local constituency boundaries caused the delay. Despite the
 fact that parish councillors have little real authority and no
 control over public funds, the elections were bitterly
 contested by both major parties. The campaign focused on
 national, not local issues, and both parties expended
 considerable money, effort, and prestige during its course.
 The leaders of the PNP and the JLP, Michael Manley and Edward
 Seaga respectively, campaigned vigorously. The PNP received
 57 percent of the vote; the JLP, 43 percent.
 The July local elections amply demonstrated that despite the
 unprecedented situation caused by the one-party Parliament,
 the democratic tradition remains strong in Jamaica. All
 parties operated freely and had opportunities to state their
 positions at rallies and in the print and electronic media.
 The elections were also noteworthy for the absence of
 widespread violence that marred previous elections. However,
 notwithstanding a joint appeal by party leaders Seaga and
 Manley to their followers to refrain from violence, three
 persons were killed.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In September 1986, Americas Watch visited Jamaica to
 investigate alleged systematic human rights violations by the
 Jamaican police. It commended the Government's cooperation
 and openness during the investigation.
 While the Commissioner of the JCF and the Minister of National
 Security criticized the resulting report for being biased, the
 Government recognized and is acting on the need for signficant
 improvement in the professionalism and discipline of the JCF.
 Subsequent to the Americas Watch report, a senior JCF
 commissioner was assigned to try to ensure better respect for
 human rights by the police.
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations in
 Jamaica. The Jamaica Council for Human Rights (JCHR), the
 only independent human rights organization, has been vigorous
 in citing police abuses and calling for police reforms. The
 JCHR is active on a number of international human rights
 issues, especially the treatment of blacks in South Africa.
 The Government is a strong advocate of human rights in
 international forums. Jamaican leaders including Prime
 
 
 557
 JAMAICA
 Minister Seaga and Foreign Minister Shearer have spoken before
 regional and international bodies in opposition to apartheid.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Jamaican women are accorded full equality under the
 Constitution, and the 1975 Employment Act guarantees them
 equal pay for equal work. The legal status of women is
 reflected in the number of influential positions they hold in
 the civil service and the Government. Nevertheless, because
 of cultural and social values, women often suffer economic
 discrimination. This discrimination frequently evidences
 itself in hiring practices. Access to higher paying jobs and
 positions outside traditional "female" areas is limited. The
 higher-paying senior positions in business and commercial
 areas are still predominantly held by men. The 1975 Act has
 helped to narrow the gap between men's and women's salaries,
 but disparities remain.
 The Government has a number of programs to help women and has
 created a National Advisory Committee for Women's Affairs.
 Family law reforms based on a report from the Family Law
 Committee set up in 1975, however, have not been acted upon by
 Parliament.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Government's wage policy is based on freely negotiated
 settlements. New minimum wages were introduced in January
 1985.
 A Juvenile Act provides that no child under age 12 shall be
 employed except by parents or guardians. Such employment can
 only be in domestic, agricultural, or horticultural work.
 Children under age 12 cannot be employed at night or at any
 industrial site. Despite the laws on child labor, children
 under 12 are often seen peddling goods and services on the
 streets.
 Under the Factories Act, all plants must be registered and
 approved by the Ministry of Labour before they can begin
 operations. The Ministry's industrial safety division is
 required to make yearly inspections of all facilities. In
 practice, because of budget constraints, these site
 inspections often are not performed. The Ministry has no
 authority to oversee private sector work sites and other
 places of employment which do not meet the statutory
 definition of a factory. Other acts of Parliament establish
 minimum standards for working conditions.
