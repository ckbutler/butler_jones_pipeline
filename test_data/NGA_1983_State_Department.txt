 NIGERIA
 The following report, which covers the human rights situation
 in Nigeria in 1983, was prepared before December 31, 1983, when
 Nigerian military forces removed the civilian government. The
 new military government has declared its motives for taking
 power were to clean up economic mismanagement, rampant
 corruption and abuse of office of its predecessor government,
 and to save the nation from economic collapse. It has also
 charged widespread rigging in the 1983 elections. The Federal
 Military Government has suspended certain portions of the 1979
 Constitution, including those dealing with elected and appointed
 office and has banned all political parties. Former President
 Shagari and many members of his government have been taken
 into custody.
 With an estimated population of 80-100 million, Nigeria is the
 most populous country in Africa. Nigeria emerged from British
 colonial rule in 1960. The country initially chose a parliamen-
 tary system of government. Ethnic tensions, however, created
 strains that were difficult for the new Government to handle.
 A military coup in January 1966 led to more than 13 years of
 military rule. In 1979 the military voluntarily relinquished
 power to a civilian government. The military prepared the way
 by supporting the drafting and adoption of a new Constitution
 for the country.                    I
 Nigeria's 1979 Constitution delineates a basic pattern of govern-
 ment similar to that of the United States. The President
 (currently Shehu Shagari) is head of government, Commander in
 Chief of the Armed Forces, and also chief of state. There is a
 bicameral National Assembly, consisting of a Senate and House' of
 Representatives, each with an elected governor and unicameral
 legislature. Nigeria has an independent judiciary.
 Civil rights are generally respected in Nigeria. The Nigerian
 Constitution contains detailed provisions for the protection
 of fundamental rights, including those to life, dignity,
 personal liberty, privacy of the home, assembly and conscience.
 There have been few reported instances of gross violations of
 those rights. Nigeria's active press and judiciary are alert
 to any violations and neither the Federal nor the state
 governments condone such violations.
 Economically, Nigeria's population is mostly rural and depend-
 ent on agricultural production. The Federal Government has
 sought to spread the fruits of development to all regions. Yet
 many of the benefits of development, such as road networks,
 public health facilities, public school systems, airports,
 electrification, and mass communications are more accessible to
 city dwellers than the rural majority. The direction of the
 economy and its pace of growth is subject to government deci-
 sions and regulation. Nevertheless, there is scope for private
 investment. Private property and wealth are protected by the
 Constitution against confiscation without proper compensation.
 There are many sizable private businesses in Nigeria.
 With the Nigerian economy suffering from a drastic fall in oil
 revenues and with growing unemployment, the Nigerian Government
 acted in January-February 1983 to expel hundreds of thousands of
 undocumented aliens. The Government cited economic and security
 reasons for the expulsion. Although Nigeria has an unquestioned
 
 
 268
 right to regulate the presence of aliens on Nigerian territory,
 the short timeframe and lack of planning for the expulsion
 caused great hardship to many of the deportees.
 The August-September 1983 general elections were a major test for
 democracy in Nigeria. The election process was marred by organi-
 zational deficiencies, numerous reports of voting fraud, and by
 some incidents of post-election violence. Nevertheless, the
 holding of these first civilian-run free elections since 1966
 was a landmark event. Six parties contested the elections. The
 Nigerian people were offered genuine alternatives. The five
 opposition parties had access to the media and unfettered oppor-
 tunities to campaign. On the national level, the governing
 National Party of Nigeria was returned with a stronger mandate
 than it won in 1979. At the state level, the National Party of
 Nigeria took 12 out of 19 governorships. In the main, the
 balloting was peaceful, but there were some serious incidents
 of post-election violence. There were widespread reports of
 rigging and other fraudulent practices during the voting. A
 number of defeated candidates sought remedy through the courts.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The Federal Government of Nigeria has not been associated with
 attempts unlawfully or arbitrarily to deprive anyone of life.
 Neither the police, the military, nor any other security
 organization has been charged with such behavior.
 Sporadic incidents of violence during the elections of 1983 did
 result in some loss of life. The Nigerian police force says more
 than 100 persons were killed, 8 of them police officers. Most
 of the deaths seemed to have been the result of politically
 inspired feuds, and occurred in waves of mob action rather than
 as the result of calculated and premeditated actions. Some
 people were said to have lost their lives as the result of police
 shootings. The police have responded that these isolated cases
 were legitimate self-defense, with the officers in question
 protecting themselves or others from an unruly or threatening mob.
 Trial and sentencing are public, and counsel is provided to
 indigent defendants.
 Nigeria is currently free of local terrorist or insurgent groups
 which use killings as a form of political action.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no cases or charges of politically inspired kid-
 nappings or disappearance in Nigeria during 1983. One political
 spokesman was allegedly held incommunicado by police authorities
 for a day or two before his release. He was arrested for holding
 a political rally without a necessary permit, but the charges
 were eventually dropped.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Nigerian Constitution outlaws torture or the mistreatment of
 
 
 269
 of prisoners during interrogation and imprisonment by overzealous
 police or prison officials. Nigerian law provides that such
 excesses may be criminally or civilly prosecuted, but no recent
 cases of prosecution of the police for abuse of prisoners can be
 cited. Members of one political party have asserted that they
 were subjected to mistreatment while under detention in August
 1983. The charges have been widely covered in the press.
 Corruption among the ranks of the police is considered a wide-
 spread problem in Nigeria. The Government has stated it accords
 high priority to efforts to weed out corruption.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No secret or preventive detention takes place in Nigeria.
 Nigerians who are arrested are accorded protections based on
 the British common law, including habeas corpus. The Nigerian
 authorities generally observe the legal provision that a suspect
 must be formally charged within 24 hours of arrest.
 Spokesmen for several opposition political parties have publicly
 charged the police with arresting and detaining their members or
 supporters on spurious charges for political reasons during and
 following the nationwide elections held in 1983. Many people
 indeed have been arrested on charges of election-related violence
 or disturbances. Government officials assert that those being
 detained are charged with having committed common crimes and as
 such will be tried in accordance with Nigerian law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Nigerian Constitution guarantees a fair, public trial within
 three months from the date of arrest, notification of charges,
 and access to legal counsel. No secret trials ire held.
 Individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution are respected
 during legal proceedings. The Nigerian judiciary is independent
 of the executive branch, and has rendered decisions unpopular
 with the executive branch. Harassment of the judiciary or
 defense counsel by the Government is virtually nonexistent.
 Civilians are not tried by military courts. There are no
 special courts to deal with security and political cases. In
 capital cases, the Government provides counsel for indigent
 defendants.  In other cases, indigents must rely for counsel
 on the Nigerian Legal Aid Society which has limited resources.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Nigerian society is generally free of arbitrary interference by
 the state in the private lives of citizens. In accord with
 the Constitution, privacy in homes, correspondence, and oral
 electronic communication is "guaranteed and protected."
 General surveillance of the population by the state is not
 practiced in Nigeria. There is no compulsory membership in
 political organizations, and there is no political enforcement
 of social, cultural, or religious codes. Local police agents
 are occasionally criticized for entering private premises
 without appropriate warrants, but such cases usually represent
 ad hoc decisions taken in circumstances deemed to require
 immediate action.
 
 
 270
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The 1979 Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and the
 press. The Constitution also reserves the right to own and
 operate television and radio stations to the Federal and state
 governments. Anyone can own and operate print media.
 The present Government has upheld these constitutional provisions
 and has allowed free expression and dissemination of news without
 official censorship. Criticism of government is tolerated in
 the media, especially in the printed media. Television and radio
 enjoy less freedom, but there is competition between federally
 owned radio and television and those owned by the different
 states. Opposition parties freely criticize the central
 Government and each other using the television and radio of
 states they control.
 The print media are both privately and state owned. The
 Government owns 100 percent of one large daily and 60 percent
 of another. Most state governments operate their own newspaper.
 The many privately owned newspapers include three large
 circulation dailies. This competition provides free and open
 airing of issues.
 There were several cases of arrests of journalists in 1983. Two
 of the cases received wide publicity. Some local observers
 described the cases as politically inspired, others as a personal
 feud between the newsmen and the Inspector General of Police.
 Both journalists were cleared in court, but they did spend time
 in detention. The charge against one was publishing classified
 documents in violation of the Nigerian Secrecy Act. The other
 journalist was charged with murder after he had written a column
 in which he mentioned that evidence of official corruption could
 go up in smoke. The next day the National Telecommunication
 Building was partially gutted by fire. Three people died.
 Rumors and accusations of arson triggered the arrest and the
 charges. All the other cases in which journalists were detained
 or called to the police station for questioning ended either in
 acquittals in court or dropped charges.
 State-owned newspapers or radio stations were closed down by
 newly elected administrations in Kano, Gongola, and Oyo states
 after the 1983 elections. There were also reports of journalists
 harassed by politicians, but neither the state governments nor
 the Federal Government have systematic censorship practices.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Nigerian Constitution guarantees that "every person shall be
 entitled to assemble freely and associate with other persons, and
 may form or belong to any political party, trade union or any
 other association for the protection of his interests...    These
 rights are respected. Nigeria has thousands of organizations and
 associations of many varieties, some legally registered and
 incorporated, but many not.
 There are at present six political parties legally recognized and
 registered by the Federal Electoral Commission. Other groups
 without Federal Electoral Commission registration are free to
 express their political views, but they cannot contest elections.
 
 
 271
 To obtain registration, an applicant party must show that it
 has some degree of support throughout the country, and not just
 in one region. This requirement reportedly is designed to avoid
 parties composed of one ethnic group and to foster further
 evolution from tribal-based politics.
 Nigeria has over 40 industrial unions under one national labor
 center--the Nigerian Labor Congress--plus additional professional
 unions and senior staff associations not under the Congress. At
 present the Nigerian Labor Congress claims a total industrial
 union membership of about three million, approximately one-tenth
 of the work force.
 In theory, additional unions could be formed by applying to the
 Federal Government's Registrar of Trade Unions for certification,
 but such approval would not be granted if the applicant union
 impinged upon the jurisdictional area of one of the existing
 unions. Alternative organizations are sometimes tolerated,
 although not legally recognized as trade unions. Interna-
 tionally, the Nigerian Labor Congress leadership remains much
 closer to the World Confederation of Free Trade Unions than the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions; but in
 accordance with its mandate, the Congress is not affiliated
 with either. Several individual unions belong to international
 trade secretariats affiliated with either of them. The Nigerian
 Labor Congress belongs to the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and Nigeria is a member of the International Labor
 Organization.
 Many Nigerian trade organizations and professional groupings
 enjoy the right of association guaranteed in the Constitution.
 They are free to gather peacefully at any time they choose and
 may conduct nonsubversive activities nationally and interna-
 tionally with other recognized international bodies as they
 please. Registration with the Federal Ministry of Commerce is
 required but is merely a formality.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The strictures on freedom of religion, religious practice, and
 religious education in the Nigerian Constitution are generally
 observed throughout the country. The country's population is
 approximately one-half Muslim, and more than one-third Christian,
 with the remainder having primary attachment to other traditional
 beliefs. Religious intermarriages occur frequently. Where
 polarization between the two major religions does occur, it is
 often where a "religious difference* is associated with
 geographic or ethnic differences.
 There is a Muslim-Christian competition for converts and
 influence in the belt of states between the predominantly Muslim
 north and predominantly Christian south. In October 1982,
 rioting between Muslims and Christians in Kano, apparently over
 the expansion of a Christian church, caused a number of deaths.
 There were no significant incidents between the two communities
 in 1983.
 In 1982 the Government banned the Muslim Maitatsine sect after
 charging that the movement violated Nigeria's criminal laws.
 This is the only publicized case of the proscribing of a
 religious sect in Nigeria, but there are constitutional prohibi-
 tions against "secret societies." In general, the constitutional
 guarantees for freedom of conscience and religion are honored
 in Nigeria.
 
 
 272
 Although each of the principal political parties is generally
 identified with an ethnic or religious group, an effort is made
 in each party to reflect Nigeria's ethnic/religious diversity.
 In the 1983 elections, for example, the parties typically
 offered a Presidential and Vice Presidential ticket balanced
 between a Muslim and a Christian. Despite the country's primary
 northern-Muslim/southern-Christian axis, minority communities
 generally live under peaceful conditions scattered throughout
 the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution entitles Nigerian citizens "to move freely
 throughout Nigeria and to reside in any part thereof." The same
 provision states that 'no citizen of Nigeria shall be expelled
 from Nigeria or refused entry thereto or exit therefrom.* There
 have been no known cases in 1983 of any Nigerians denied internal
 freedom of movement, being expelled from the country, or having
 been denied the right to return home.
 Nigerians are free to travel abroad, subject at the present time
 only to restrictions on the amount of Nigerian currency that may
 be converted for use outside the country. Many Nigerians are
 studying outside their country, over 30,000 in the United States
 alone. Exit visas are not required to leave the country.
 No known penalties have been levied on Nigerians who have
 emigrated, settled abroad, or acquired another nationality.
 In January 1983, the Nigerian Government issued an edict order-
 ing undocumented aliens to leave the country with only a few
 weeks' notice. The Government cited illegal employment and
 alien involvement in religious disturbances in Nigeria as reasons
 for the order. Hundreds of thousands of foreign Africans left--
 over a million according to some estimates. The short timeframe
 and lack of prior consultations with the other governments whose
 citizens were involved contributed to the disruption, loss of
 property, and privation experienced by the deportees. The initial
 refusal of the Ghanaian Government to open its land borders to
 its deported citizens caused some neighboring countries to
 restrict the transit of deportees, and many of the people being
 expelled were caught at border points without adequate provision
 for water, food, shelter, and sanitary facilities. Several weeks
 were required to complete the movement of the deportees to their
 respective countries.
 The 1983 expulsion of undocumented foreign workers in Nigeria did
 not include people in refugee status. Nigerian law and practice
 permit temporary refuge and asylum in Nigeria for political
 refugees from other countries. As an example, some 5,000
 Chadians were granted temporary settlement and assisted by
 Nigerian authorities during the Chadian civil war of 1979-80.
 Most of these refugees returned to Chad after Hissene Habre
 assumed power in Chad in 1982. Other long-term refugees, such
 as the Equatorial Guineans who fled to southeastern Nigeria in
 the mid-1970's, have been assimilated without incident. The
 Nigerian Government has not provided figures on how many
 political refugees have been given safehaven in Nigeria.
 
 
 273
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 In a series of elections lasting over a period of more than 5
 weeks, Nigerian citizens in 1983 voted for the President and
 Vice President, governors of 19 states, 96 Senators, 450 Members
 of the House of Representatives, and more than 1,000 state
 legislators in 19 houses of assembly.
 President Shehu Shagari was reelected in August with a stronger
 plurality than his first victory 4 years ago. His nearest two
 challengers received a combined total of votes almost equal to
 his own 12 million. Somewhat more than 25 million votes were
 cast in the race. The President's National Party of Nigeria
 also gained an improved position in the Federal legislature,
 returning with absolute majorities in both the Senate and
 the House of Representatives. At the state level, the National
 Party of Nigeria increased its governorships from 7 to 12, and
 also strengthened its representation in many of the state houses
 of assembly. The opposition parties fared worse in the 1983
 elections than in 1979, although in a few cases they beat back
 strong efforts by National Party of Nigeria challengers.
 Although the Nigerian elections of 1983 remain a significant
 event in the country' s political history, they are nevertheless
 marred by many allegations of rigging and fraudulent behavior.
 Virtually all of the parties blame defeat in some elections on
 the fraudulent practices carried out by their opponents.
 Several announced election returns were met by violence#
 particularly in two states where the results were greeted by
 rioting and other disturbances which ended in deaths and
 property destruction. Many results were subject to legal
 petitions. Petition tribunals and appeal courts in some cases
 overturned published results. Several political figures whose
 fortunes were adversely affected by the voting results publicly
 endorsed the judiciary as their hope for justice.
 Nigeria has a history of violent elections, and many prominent
 politicians concede that rigging did take place in the 1983
 elections. Although the results of many elections contain
 figures that appear to be highly inflated, one cannot say with
 certainty what would have been the results in a fair contest.
 Most parties say that in at least some races their candidates
 were defeated only because of rigging by their opponents.
 Some observers, both Nigerian and foreign, believe that public
 officials were also directly responsible for altering results in
 some elections.
 The Nigerian Constitution delineates a separation of executive,
 legislative, and judicial powers similar to that existing in the
 United States. Although the Nigerian executive branch appears
 to have more discretionary authority than its counterpart in the
 United States, the legislature in the first four years of the
 Second Republic was not a rubber stamp. Feeling its way
 gingerly into its proper role after 13 years of military rule,
 the first Nigerian National Assembly was relatively restrained
 in attempting to influence the executive branch.
 Although Nigerian politics still bears the imprint of ethnic
 loyalties, there is no systematic exclusion of minorities from
 public life. -On the contrary, the public is aware of the con-
 stitutional requirement that the composition of government
 
 
 274
 bodies reflect the "federal character of Nigeria" and "the
 diversity of the peoples." The Shagari Administration uses
 talent from all regions of the country, and the other
 political parties typically make a point of having an
 ethnically diverse hierarchy.
 Nigerian political parties are required by law to have branch
 offices in various parts of the country.
 Women are active in politics in various degrees, probably more
 so in the south, reflecting the earlier introduction of western
 education and the weaker impact of Islamic and other traditional
 codes which restricted participation in public life. The Shagari
 Administration of 1979-83 had one woman cabinet member. The
 second Shagari Administration has two women cabinet members. Two
 women were elected to the 450-seat House of Representatives in
 1979, and none to the 95-seat Senate. One woman was elected to
 the Senate in 1983, while preliminary results for the House show
 four women members. A few women have served and continue to
 serve in the various state houses of assembly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Nigeria has been and continues to be a relatively open society.
 Investigations of government behavior generally do not cause
 retribution.
 Within Nigerian society, a Human Rights Committee of the
 Nigerian Bar Association specifically concerns itself with
 monitoring the domestic situation. It is not known to be
 particularly active, but this may be due to the paucity of
 allegations of human rights violations in Nigeria.
 In its 1983 report Amnesty International was concerned about
 detention without trial of suspected supporters of a religious
 leader, Alhaji Mohammed Marwa, and about the death penalty in
 Nigeria, but was unable to ascertain the number of deaths or
 executions. Freedom House rates Nigeria 'free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Nigeria has a free market economy, one in which property rights
 are respected and guaranteed. The Government plays a major role
 in important sectors of the economy, but there is also a strong
 market orientation. Many entrepreneurs of modest origins have
 succeeded in business, and some have acquired considerable wealth.
 There are indigenization laws which reserve some business areas
 for Nigerians and which require foreign firms to maintain speci-
 fied levels of Nigerian participation.
 The major change in the nation's economic life during the past
 year has been the need to adjust to the declining oil income.
 The austerity program set in place in April 1982 has forced
 postponement of some of the Government's economic development
 programs.
 While the Government does not discriminate and seeks to eliminate
 economic and social discrimination, there are ethnic, religious,
 and sex-based prejudices in Nigeria's large, diverse, and
 complex population, and those prejudices.have economic conse-
 quences.
 
 
 275
 An unmarried woman who is 21 or above has the legal capacity to
 sue and be sued, to buy and sell property, to engage in business
 or a profession, and to choose her own residence. However, a
 married woman cannot own property or enter into loan or purchase
 agreements without the consent of her husband, nor can she obtain
 a passport or travel outside the country without her husband's
 consent. Further examples of discrimination against women
 include an absence under customary law of a woman's right to her
 husband's property or income, apart from the right to support,
 and limitations on the right of divorced women to remarry. There
 is no law against a married woman working but, except in govern-
 ment service, there is no guarantee of equal pay for equal work.
 No statistics are currently available on the degree of participa-
 tion of women in business or the professions, although there are
 significant numbers in law and medicine. Almost all marketing in
 southern Nigeria is controlled by women, who often belong to
 politically powerful market women's associations. No statistics
 on numbers of women in civil service are available, although they
 seem to be employed generally at lower levels. The federal and
 state governments and women's groups, such as the National
 Council of Women, are actively working on women's problems and
 rights.
 The most visible economic hardship in Nigeria is found in the
 urban slums. Nigeria is experiencing the classic developing
 country movement of people from the rural areas to the cities,
 particularly Lagos, where the inadequate infrastructure of water,
 electricity, housing, and other services has been overwhelmed.
 Poor urban dwellers face high unemployment, squalid living condi-
 tions, rising costs, and serious crime, but few return to the
 rural areas. Although detailed statistics are not available,
 urban unemployment has increased considerably during the past
 18 months as shortages of imported raw materials and spare parts
 have forced businesses to cut back.
 The present Nigerian Government has demonstrated its commitment
 to rapid expansion of the educational system. A campaign for
 universal primary education was begun in 1976, with rapid expan-
 sion of secondary schools as well. The number of Federal univer-
 sities has jumped from six in 1970 to 18 in 1983. A number of
 state universities have been established and more are planned.
 In addition, the popularity of an opposition party's program of
 free primary and secondary education in the states it controls
 led the governing party to make free primary and secondary edu-
 cation a part of its platform in the just-completed elections.
 Late in the election campaign, President Shagari guaranteed
 there would be no increase in fees at Federal universities. It
 is now theoretically possible for a poor Nigerian to receive an
 almost free education through the university level. There
 remains a problem of finding funds and personnel to staff the
 educational system. As the numbers of students increase,
 maintaining availability and quality of education is difficult.
 The World Bank estimated Nigeria's population in 1983 to be 85
 million, compared to estimates by U.S. experts of 90 million, and
 the 100-million estimate widely accepted in Nigeria. According
 to 1980 figures, life expectancy at birth is 48.6 years, and in
 1983 infant mortality was 135.6 per 1,000 live births (a figure
 considered low by many rural medical workers and some inter-
 national organizations). The primary school enrollment in
 World Bank 1977 statistics was 79 percent, doubled from a decade
 
 
 276
 earlier. Adult literacy was estimated by the World Bank in 1980
 at 29.9 percent. The average Nigerian in 1977, according to the
 same source, received 83 percent of the daily nutritional
 requirements, but there is virtually no starvation in Nigeria,
 and although there have been periodic shortages of imported
 foodstuffs during the past year, the people generally appear
 adequately fed. Nevertheless, as in most developing countries,
 there is probably considerable malnutrition in Nigeria, which is
 difficult to document accurately. The World Bank in 1981
 estimated per capita gross national product (GNP) in current
 dollars at $874. This figure probably declined slightly in
 the last 18 months. The per capita GNP figure can also be
 misleading as oil exports account for most of the country's
 revenue, and a large part of the rural population is only
 marginally involved in Nigeria's cash economy.
