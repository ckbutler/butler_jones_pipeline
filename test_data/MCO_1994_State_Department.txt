 MONACO
 Monaco is a constitutional monarchy in which the sovereign Prince plays a lead-
 ing role in governing the country. The Prince appoints the four-member Govern-
 ment, headed by a Minister of State chosen by the Prince from a list of candidates
 proposed by France. The other three members are Counselors for the Interior (who
 is usually French), for Public Works and Social Affairs, and for Finance and the
 Economy. Each is responsible to the Prince. Legislative power is shared between the
 Prince and the popularly elected 18-member National Council. There are in addition
 three consultative bodies, whose members are appointed by the Prince: the 7-mem-
 ber Crown Council; 12-member Council of State; and 30-member Economic Council,
 which includes representatives of employers and the trade unions.
 In addition to the national police force, the "Carabiniers du Prince" carry out se-
 curity functions. Both forces are controlled by government officials.
 The principal economic activities in Monaco are services and banking, light manu-
 facturing, and tourism.
 Individual human rihts are provided for in the Constitution and respected in
 practice. The Constitution distinguishes between those rights that are guaranteed
 for all residents and those that apply only to the 5,000 who hold Monegasque na-
 tionality. The latter enjoy free education, financial assistance in case of unemploy-
 ment or illness, and the right to vote and hold elective office. Women traditionally
 have played a less active role than men in public life, but this is changing;, women
 currently hold both elective and appointive offices.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices. The authorities respect this prohibition.
 There were no reports of violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution bars arbitrary arrest.
 Arrest warrants are required, except when the detainee is arrested while commit-
 ting an offense. The police must bring the detainee before a judge within 24 hours
 to be informed of the charges and of detainees' rights under the law. Most detainees
 are released without bail, but the investigating magistrate may order detention on
 grounds that the suspect might either flee or tamper with the investigation of the
 case. The magistrate may extend the initial 2-month detention for additional 2-
 month periods, indefinitely. Detainees have the right to ounsel, at public expense
 if necessary. They have ready access to attorneys. The magistrate may permit fam-
 ily members to see the detainee.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Undr the 1962 Constitution, the Prince delegated
 his judicial powers to an independent judiciary. The law provides for fair, public
 tria  an    e authorities respect these provisions. The defendant has the right to
 be present and the right to counsel, at public expense if necessary. As under French
 law, a three-judge tribunal considers the evidence amassed by the investigating
 magistrate and hears the arguments presented by the prosecuting and defense at-
 torneys. The defendant enjoys a presumption of innocence and the right of appeal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The in-
 dividual's right of privacy in personal and family life, at home, and in correspond-
 ence is guaranteed by the Constitution and respected in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press.-Freedom of expression is guaranteed. The
 Monegasque Penal Code, however, prohibits public denunciations of the ruling fam-
 ily. Several local periodicals are published in'Monaco. Foreign newspapers and mag-
 azines circulate freely, including French ones that specifically cover news in the
 Principality. Foreign radio and television are received without restriction. Stations
 
 
 902
 that broadcast from the Principality operate in accordance with French and Italian
 regulations. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution gives
 Monegasque nationals the rights of peaceful assembly and association. Outdoor
 meetings require police authorization, which is not withheld for political or arbitrary
 reasons. Formal associations must be registered and authorizedby the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Roman Catholicism is the state religion. Free practice of
 all religions is guaranteed in law and respected in fact.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Residents of Monaco move freely within the country and across its open
 borders with France. Moneaue nationals enjoy the rights of emigration and repa-
 triation. They can be deprived of their nationality only for specified acts including
 naturalization in a foreign state. Only the Prince can grant or restore Monegasque
 nationality, but he is obliged by the Constitution to consult the Crown Council on
 each case before deciding.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 1962 Constitution cannot be suspended, but it can be revised by common
 agreement between the Prince and the National Council. The Prince plays an active
 role in government. He names the Minister of State (in effect the Prime Minister)
 from a list of names proposed by the French Government. Re names as well the
 three Counselors of Government (of whom the one responsible for the interior is
 usually a French national). Together the four compose the Government. Each is re-
 sponsible to the Prince.
 Only the Prince may initiate legislation, although the 18-member National Coun-
 cil may send proposals for legislation to the Government. All legislation and the
 adoption of the budget require the Council's assent. Elections, which are held every
 5 years, are based on umversal adult suffrage and secret balloting. Two political
 parties are currently represented on the Council. There is one independent member.
 The Constitution provides for three consultative bodies. The seven-member Crown
 Council (composed exclusively of Monegasque nationals) must be consulted by the
 Prince regarding certain questions of national importance. He may choose to consult
 it on other matters as well. The 12-member Council of State advises the Prince on
 reposed legislation and regulations. The 30-member Economic Council advises the
 overnment on social, financial, and economic questions. One-third of its members
 come from lists proposed by the trade union movement, and one-third from lists pro-
 posed by the employers' federation.
 Women are active in public service. The Mayor of Monaco and one member of the
 National Council are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While the Government imposes no impediments to establishment or operation of
 local groups devoted to monitoring human rights, there are none. There have been
 no requests from outside groups to investigate human rights conditions in Monaco.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides that all Monegasque nationals are equal before the law.
 It differentiates between rights that are accorded nationals (including preference in
 employment, free education, and assistance to the ill or unemployed) and those
 guaranteed to all residents (e.g., freedom of religion, inviolability of the home).
 Women.-Women are fairly well represented in the professions; e.g., they con-
 stitute 6 of Monaco's 18 lawyers (including a formerpresident of the bar), 5of 42
 physicians, and 8 of 26 dentists. Women are less well represented in the business
 world. The law governing transmission of citizenship provides for equality of treat-
 ment between men and women who are Monegasque by birth. However, women who
 acquire Monegasque nationality by naturalization cannot transmit it to their chil-
 dren, whereas naturalized male citizens can. Reported instances of violence against
 women are rare. Marital violence is strictly prohibited, and any woman who is a
 victim of it may bring criminal charges against her husband.
 Children.-There is no particular pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has mandated that public buildings
 provide for access for the disabled, and this has been largely accomplished.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have been free to form unions since the end
 of World War II. Fewer than 10 percent of workers belong to unions, and relatively
 
 
 903
 few of these reside in the Principality. Unions are independent of both the Govern-
 ment and the Monegasque political parties. The Monegasque Confederation of
 Unions is not affiliatd with any largerlar organization.
 The Constitution specifies that workers enjoy the right to strike in conformity
 with relevant legislation. Government workers, however, may not strike. No strikes
 of major consequence occurred in 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the free
 exercise of union activity. Workers are guaranteed by law the same wages as are
 received by comparable workers in the neighboring area of France plus 5 percent.
 They are free to negotiate higher wages with their employers if they can. Agree-
 ments on working conditions are negotiated between organizations representing em-
 ployers in a given sector of the economy and the res  *ve union. Antiunion dis-
 crimination is prohibited. Union representatives can be fired only with the agree-
 ment of a commission that includes two members from the empoyers' association
 and two from the labor movement. Allegations that an employee has been fired for
 union activity may be brought before the Labor Court, which can order redress such
 as the payment of damages with interest.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsoy Labor.-Such practices are outiawed and
 do not occur.
 d. Minimum Aae for Employment q' Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 16 years. Special restrictions apply to the hiring, work-times, and other conditions
 of workers aged 16 to 18.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for full-time work is
 $1,202 (6,309 French francs) per month, which corresponds to the French minimum
 plus 5 percent. Most workers receive more than the minimum. The legal workweek
 39 hours. Health and safety standards are fixed by law and government decree.
 These standards are enforced by health and safety committees in the workplace and
 by the government Labor Inspector.
