 ITALY
 Italy is a functioning, democratic, multiparty republic with a
 parliamentary system of government based on a constitution
 approved in 1947. Legislative power is vested in the
 Parliament, which is directly and freely elected on the basis
 of universal adult suffrage. Executive authority is
 concentrated in the Council of Ministers. Italy has an
 independent judiciary. The Chief of State, the President, is
 elected by Parliament. Since 1947, the Christian Democratic
 Party has been the dominant party of government, though it has
 ordinarily ruled in coalition with one or more smaller
 parties. The current Prime Minister, Bettino Craxi, is from
 the Socialist Party.
 The drafters of Italy's post-World War II Constitution were
 strongly influenced by Roman Catholic and social democratic
 traditions. The Constitution contains strong guarantees of
 political and civil rights that are rigorously observed in
 practice.
 Terrorist violence of both the left and right has declined in
 recent years due to the effective work of police and
 magistrates. Although political violence has yet to be
 completely overcome, its considerable reduction has freed law
 enforcement resources for the struggle against organized crime,
 which continues to be a serious problem.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy ranking among the
 top ten in the world in gross national product. It is
 characterized by sizable government ownership in the primary
 industrial sectors and by a dynamic private sector, especially
 at the level of small and medium-sized companies.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There was only one confirmed instance of a terrorist killing in
 1984, marking a continued decline over the previous year. The
 victim was an American, Leamon Ray Hunt, Director General of
 the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers which has its
 administrative headquarters in Rome. Efforts over past years
 by terrorists of the far left and far right to provoke the
 forces of order into taking extreme security measures have
 failed. Government and law enforcement agencies have used the
 emergency powers granted them to fight the terrorist threat
 with care and moderation. There are indications that Italian
 terrorists have received some support from outside the country,
 particularly from extremist Middle Eastern groups, and there
 are continuing allegations of direct or indirect East European
 support. Foreign terrorist organizations have occasionally
 been active in Italy.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no cases of disappearance linked to or condoned
 by the state or its agents. There were no kidnappings by
 political terrorist groups in Italy in 1984. However, an
 apparently foreign group continues to claim responsibility for
 the 1983 disappearance of a teenage Italian girl, Emanuela
 Orlandi. The group has called for the release from prison of
 
 
 1023
 ITALY
 Mehmet Ali Agca, who is serving a life sentence for the
 attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in 1981. Ms.
 Orlandi is still missing.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. In March, 1984, an appeals court confirmed, with
 reduced sentence, the conviction of four members of Italy's
 special anti-terrorist police accused of having abused a
 suspect to obtain information. The verdict has again been
 appealed. Cruel and degrading punishment is forbidden by law
 and not employed by officials. Conditions of confinement vary,
 and some places of detention are outdated and crowded but not
 inhuman or degrading. Prisoners charged or convicted of
 terrorist acts are generally separated from other prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police procedures in Italy are carefully circumscribed by law
 and judicial oversight. Arbitrary arrest is not practiced.
 Anyone detained by the authorities must be charged within 48
 hours. Habeas corpus does not exist under Italian law.
 However, as a safeguard against abuse, *liberty tribunals* are
 empowered to review evidence in cases of persons awaiting trial
 and to decide whether continued detention is warranted.
 In normal criminal cases, the duration of pretrial detention
 permitted varies according to the gravity of the crime. When
 1984 began, pretrial detention could extend up to 3 years prior
 to the initial trial; thereafter, detention could theoretically
 continue up to 3 times that long through the appeals process.
 In serious cases involving persons charged with acts of
 terrorism or involvement in organized crime activities,
 detention through appellate procedures could extend for up to
 10 years before a final verdict was rendered.
 A reform of laws governing preventive detention was passed by
 the Italian Parliament during 1984 and began going into effect
 in August. The reform has been implemented in stages and will
 not be fully in effect until February 1985, although this
 timetable may be extended by supplementary legislation. The
 new law limits the maximum that any person may be held in
 preventive detention, even for the most serious crimes, to 6
 years and to no more than 2 years at each step of the trial and
 appeals process. Maximum periods of preventive detention are
 substantially less for lesser crimes. The reform also contains
 measures aimed at streamlining Italian judicial procedures and
 speeding trials. Authorities hope that the reform will assist
 in reducing the number of prisoners awaiting trial or appeals
 in Italian jails, which now stands at over 20,000.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial is assured by law and observed in
 practice. Counsel for the accused is mandatory and provided
 free if necessary. The judiciary is independent of the
 executive, and there are no political or security courts. All
 cases may be appealed to the highest appellate court, the Court
 of Cassation. There are no political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In Italy, the concept of privacy of the home is legally
 safeguarded and generally respected by the authorities.
 Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only
 under judicial warrant and in carefully defined circumstances.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and a free press are assured under Italy's
 democratic political system, which allows full expression of a
 wide spectrum of political views. Although there is no
 censorship, publications may be seized for violation of
 obscenity laws or for defamation of state institutions or
 political or ecclesiastical leaders. These powers are seldom
 invoked. Government-run radio and television are politicized
 at the administrative level but are open to widely differing
 views. A large number of private broadcasters air vigorous
 debate on political and social issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Italian citizens' right to free assembly is curtailed only in
 cases where security or public safety is endangered. Unions
 are not government-controlled, and their rights to organize,
 engage in collective bargaining, and strike are fully
 protected. They associate with international labor bodies
 freely and without interference. According to government
 figures, about 40 percent of the work force is organized.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Until 1984 Italy's relations with the Roman Catholic Church
 were governed by the Lateran Pact of 1929, which guarantees the
 Church's independence and sovereignty in religious affairs. In
 early 1984 Italy concluded negotiations with the Vatican on a
 revised concordat updating the 1929 agreement. The new
 agreement is currently awaiting ratification. The new
 concordat recognizes the rights and position of the Church but
 withdraws Catholicism's status as Italy's state religion. At
 the same time, the state has undertaken to reach agreements
 with other religious groups, including evangelical Christian
 denominations and Italy's Jewish community, clearly defining
 their rights and legal standing. The Roman Catholic Church
 continues informally to enjoy special standing in Italy through
 the facts that the Vatican is located within Italy and the
 overwhelming majority of Italians are at least nominally Roman
 Catholic. Nevertheless, all religions are free to organize and
 proselytize within the limits imposed by the laws governing
 public order. Individuals may profess and practice any
 religious faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Italian citizens may travel freely both within the country and
 abroad. Emigration is unrestricted. Citizens who leave are
 guaranteed their right to return, and the Constitution forbids
 deprivation of citizenship. Italy has been a haven for many
 persons fleeing persecution in other countries. There were no
 cases of forced repatriation of political refugees in 1984.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Italy is ruled democratically under its free parliamentary
 system. Although the Fascist Party is outlawed by the
 Constitution, there exists a wide range of organized and active
 political parties from the far left of the political spectrum
 to the far right. Election campaigns are free and open, and
 voting is by secret ballot. The two chambers of Parliament and
 regional, provincial, and municipal councils are elected
 periodically. Opposition groups are active and are frequently
 able to alter or reject government policies. The regions of
 Trentino-Alto Adige and Val D'Aosta are organized under special
 statutes aimed at safeguarding the rights of their respective
 German- and French-speaking minorities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Italian Government and non-governmental human rights
 organizations support human rights throughout the world. Italy
 participates fully in international human rights
 organizations. Non-governmental organizations are free to
 investigate conditions in Italy, attend trials, and to publish
 their findings. Political parties and religious groups
 participate in activities related to human rights. Amnesty
 International has five offices in Italy. Other prominent
 organizations are the Official Interministerial Committee for
 the Rights of Man, the Italian Consultative Committee for the
 Rights of Man, the Institute of Human Rights, and Caritas
 International. Amnesty International's major concern in recent
 years has been the excessive length of time some defendants are
 held in preventive detention (see Section I d). In 1984, the
 Italian Government established an independent human rights
 commission. Freedom House rates Italy 'free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government provides special funds for investment in
 southern Italy, whose development, for historical reasons, has
 been slower than that of the north. Despite this historical
 complication, education and economic and social services are
 generally available to all without discrimination of any kind.
 As a country possessing an industrial market economy, Italy
 encourages the ownership of property alone or in association
 with others. Italy is a prosperous, developed country with a
 healthy population of 57 million (1984). Life expectancy at
 birth was 74.4 years and the infant mortality rate per 1,000
 live births was 11.2 in 1984. Per capita gross national
 product in 1982 was $6,843.
 Women have equal status under the law, but they are engaged in
 a continuing effort to maintain and strengthen their rights.
 Women participate freely in social and political life and
 continue to expand their economic role, although they are
 underrepresented in the professions and management. There are
 legal limitations on womens' property rights within marriage,
 which derive from traditional Italian social values. Strong
 private-sector demand for female labor has ensured a very low
 level of unemployment among women. Women constitute about 27
 percent of the labor force. Public economic and social
 services are extended on a nondiscriminatory basis.
