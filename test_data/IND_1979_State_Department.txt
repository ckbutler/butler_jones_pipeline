 INDIA
 India has a vigorous democratic political system, an inde-
 pendent judiciary and a flourishing free press. Fundamental
 human rights are guaranteed in the Constitution, and dis-
 crimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or
 place of birth is prohibited.
 India's Constitution mandates the promotion of the educa-
 tion and economic interests of the disadvantaged- sections
 of society. These aims are reflected in economic policies
 which give priority to    developing      India's rural
 areas and to increasing employment opportunities.
 One of the aims of government since independence has been
 to promote harmony among and the advancement of India's
 diverse peoples and castes. Through legislation and govern-
 ment programs the negative effects of the traditional
 social and economic systems have been reduced. During the
 past year, India has been particularly active on human
 rights matters in the United Nations.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Indian Penal Code. There have
 been few reports of major violations of these provisions.
 In such cases, the state governments, which have responsi-
 bility for police administration, generally respond by
 instituting judicial or magisterial commissions of inquiry.
 The state governments use the findings of these commissions
 for subsequent criminal proceedings and administrative
 action against the officers involved.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment or punishment is proscribed by law. There
 are occasional and probably credible press reports of harsh
 police treatment toward those involved or detained following
 demonstrations and civil disturbances. Judicial inquiries
 normally have been instituted in such cases by authorities
 at the state level, and when offenders can be identified,
 official action has been taken.
 The Indian press, parliament and judiciary increasingly
 have shown concern about conditions in Indian jails. A
 national conference of Inspectors General of Police in
 April 1979 decided to: establish state-level committees to
 investigate prisoners' grievances; educate prisoners about
 their rights, provide them with legal advice and assist
 them in securing bail; and revise outdated jail regulations
 during the coming year. They also called upon the central
 government to allocate adequate financial support for
 constructing new jails and improving existing facilities.
 A blue ribbon commission appointed by the Government in
 1977 to review police administration recently submitted its
 report. It has not been made public because Parliament,
 (738)
 
 
 739
 before which official reports must be tabled, is not in
 session.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Constitution provides that a person detained in custody
 must be informed of the grounds for arrest as soon as
 possible, and shall have the right to be represented by
 counsel. Such persons must be brought before a magistrate
 within 24 hours of arrest and not be detained further with-
 out the magistrate's authority. No information has appeared
 during the past year to suggest that these provisions are
 not generally respected in practice.
 However, the Constitution also permits preventive detention
 laws to "prevent threats to the public welfare and safe-
 guard national security." It requires that these laws
 provide for certain limits on the length of detention and
 for review of such detention. A move in the Indian Parlia-
 ment in 1978 by human rights activists to repeal the consti-
 tutional authorization for preventive detention laws failed,
 however, and there now are two national preventive detention
 ordinances -- the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and
 Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act and the recently-
 promulgated Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of
 Supplies of Essential Commodities Ordinance. The number of
 persons being held under the former law as of July 1, 1979
 was 100. The second ordinance, promulgated in October 1979
 despite opposition from some state governments, is aimed at
 stemming nationwide inflation by striking at suspected
 hoarders and profiteers. It contains a number of procedural
 safeguards against misuse for political purposes and provides
 for judicial review. Most state governments have announced
 they will not use the ordinance. As of October 1979, no
 arrests had been made under its provisions.
 In addition, four states have preventive detention laws --
 Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Jammu and
 Kashmir. As of December 15, 1978, there were 14 detainees
 in Jammu and Kashmir. No one was under detention in Uttar
 Pradesh as of March 1, 1979. Figures for the other two
 states are not available.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no constitutional guarantee of public trial. The
 Criminal Procedure Code provides for open trial but also
 permits the judiciary to close the proceedings in part or
 in whole. The Official Secrets Act also permits proceedings
 to be closed on the pleas that publication of any evidence
 or statements would be prejudicial to the safety of the
 state. The Act requires, however, that the passing of
 sentence take place in public.
 In India, there are effective legal procedures to assure
 fair trial. One problem, however, is that of "undertrials,"
 the large number of prisoners awaiting trial, in some cases
 for as long as ten years. In many states, the percentage
 of undertrials to the jail population varies from 50 to 80
 percent. In March 1979, the Indian Supreme Court ruled
 that speedy trial was a fundamental right of the citizen
 and ordered two state governments to release all undertrial
 
 
 740
 prisoners who had been in jail longer than they would have
 been had they been tried and convicted. The Court directed
 five other states to furnish details of undertrials held
 in their prisons for more than six months. The Supreme
 Court's decision is expected to benefit nearly 10,000 of
 India's estimated 82,000 undertrials.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Criminal Procedure Code requires warrants for searches
 and seizures, but it also permits the police in the course
 of a criminal investigation to institute searches without
 warrant if otherwise there would be undue delay. In such
 a case, the officer must state in writing the grounds for
 making the search without a warrant and specify the object
 of the search. There is no   indication that this provision
 has been abused in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 About 46 percent of India's population, or 290 million
 people, live below the Government's official poverty line.
 A significant shift in policy orientation occurred under
 the Janata Party administration, in office from March 1977
 to July 1979, favoring the rural sector. A policy statement
 issued in 1977 placed highest priority on developing India's
 rural areas, where 80 percent of the population lives. This
 is reflected in the country's sixth.annual five year plan
 (1978-83) which allocates well over half of all planned
 investment expenditures in the rural sector. These include
 not only agricultural development but such sectors as rural
 electrification, transportation, education and health. The
 World Bank has described the plan's principal objectives
 as:  (i) the removal of unemployment and significant under
 employment; (ii) an appreciable rise in the standard of
 living of the poorest of the poor; and (iii) the provision
 of basic needs to low income groups. Among the specific
 goals of the plan are: a 35 percent increase in irrigated
 areas; higher yields per acre and a doubling of the agri-
 cultural growth rate; the creation of 49 million new jobs;
 increased school attendance from 69 percent to 90 percent
 of all children six to fourteen years; an extension of rural
 health workers, health centers, drinking water facilities,
 roads and electrification; and making 68 million more per-
 sons literate. While the newly elected government in New
 Delhi has not had an occasi6n to spell out its attitude on
 these points in detail, it is likely that the sixth plan
 will remain the basic framework of its investment and devel-
 opment strategy. Government programs, initiated in the
 past, which provide special assistance to the economically
 disadvantaged classes also continue. These include such
 affirmative actions for designated castes and tribes as the
 reservation of a percentage of educational admissions and
 public sector jobs, as well as land redistribution.
 
 
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The Constitution of India guarantees freedom of speech and,
 by extension, press, religion and assembly, and these
 guarantees are honored in practice. There are no restric-
 tions on the activities of trade unions, which trace their
 roots to Mahatma Gandhi and the-beginning of the Indian
 independence movement.
 Stating the nation's ideal, the Constitution of India
 prohibits discrimination by the state against any citizen
 on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of
 birth. No citizen can be subject on such grounds to any
 disability or restriction with regard to public shops and
 accommodations, public wells and water places, or public
 employment. The Constitution also abolishes "untouchabil-
 ity" and forbids its practice in any form. Implementing
 legislation was enacted in 1966. It was further amended
 and strengthened in 1976 and renamed the Protection of
 Civil Rights Act. Enforcement of the law is the responsi-
 bility of the state governments. The record of redress of
 grievances varies from state to state and often reflects
 the social attitudes of local officials.
 In practice, there has been progress since independence in
 the economic sphere in -ameliorating the effects of the dis-
 crimination inherent in the caste system. Caste-based
 social customs in the cities have also broken down to a
 considerable extent, primarily because the urban environ-
 ment is not a favorable climate for the maintenance of
 traditional caste customs. De facto discrimination con-
 tinues to exist throughout t-es- gity, however, in jobs,
 education, public accommodations, housing and personal
 relations. The constitutionally-mandated Commissioner for
 Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the most recently
 published annual report noted that such discrimination is
 deeply rooted in the fabric of Indian society, is wide-
 spread in rural India where 80 percent of the population*
 resides, and continues despite legal provisions and state
 efforts to the contrary. The Commissioner further noted
 that the need to enact more stringent civil rights laws
 after thirty years of independence bears "ample testimony
 of the fact that we continue with our sin of denying basic
 human rights to quite a sizeable section of our people."
 Outbreaks of violence between various ethnic, religious
 and caste groups increased during the past year. According
 to the Home Ministry's May 1979 report, there were 230
 communal incidents in 1978, compared to 188 in 1977 and
 169 in 1976. The number of persons killed and injured
 during these disturbances is not known, and no impartial
 dataare available. While the government has not condoned
 this violence, the sporadic inability of the local police
 to either prevent or contain it has become a major polit-
 ical issue in India and was one of the reasons cited for
 public dissatisfaction with the Desai Government.
 
 
 A bill introduced in 1978 that would have banned religious
 conversions met strong opposition from the Indian Christian
 and Muslim communities. Although individual members of the
 then-ruling Janata Party backed it, it did not receive the
 official support of the Government as a whole. The pro-
 posal subsequently died.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is full freedom of movement within India for all
 citizens, except for a long-standing requirement for per-
 mits to enter sensitive border areas. Foreign travel and
 emigration are without political restrictions. The rules
 for obtaining a passport have been liberalized, new
 regional passport offices have been opened and the pro-
 cedure regarding the issue of passports has been simplified.
 Foreign exchange regulations aimed at conserving foreign
 exchange restrict Indian nationals to $500 in foreign
 exchange conversion privileges every two years. Some 1.2
 million Indians were issued passports in 1978, as against
 981,075 in 1977. There are 3 million Indian citizens
 living abroad, and their number continues to increase.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 All citizens of India -- regardless of religion, race,
 caste, sex, or place of birth -- are free to participate
 in the political process on an equal basis. There is a
 plethora of political parties ranging from Marxists to
 organizations representing religious groups. Many of
 these have participated in the government at the national
 and state levels. Popular participation is large and
 enthusiastic, with 60 percent and more turnout at the
 polls the norm.
 Access to the nation's political life is symbolized by the
 three leading contenders for Prime Minister during the
 1979-80 parliamentary elections -- a woman, an "untouchable"
 and a rural middle caste leader.
 By law, a certain number of seats in the national and state
 legislatures are reserved for members of designated castes
 and tribes.
 Women serve in the legislatures and cabinets at both the
 national and state level.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Amnesty International sent a mission to India from
 December 31, 1977 to January 18, 1978 "to obtain a first-
 hand account of the many serious human rights violations
 during the Emergency period" (June 1975-March 1977) and
 "to acquaint itself with the measures announced by the new
 government for the restoration of the rule of law". In
 their report of January 10, 1979, the mission delegates
 indicated that they "received full cooperation from
 officials throughout their stay". The Department of State
 has learned of no international investigation of the human
 rights situation in India since that time.
 Within India, a fact-finding non-governmental committee
 appointed by the People's Union for Civil Liberties in
 March 1979 investigated press reports alleging violations
 of civil rights in a rural district of Bihar. The Commit-
 tee found evidence of several cases of violation of civil
 rights and stated that it was subjected to harassment by
 local officials.
