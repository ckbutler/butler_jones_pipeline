 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES *
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty system and free elections.
 There is no constitution; a series of "basic laws" provide for fundamental rights. The
 legislature, or Knesset, has the power to dissolve the Government and limit the au-
 thority of the executive branch. Likud party leader Binyamin Netanyahu is Prime
 Minister and heads a center-right coalition government. The judiciary is legally
 independent but, in practice, it usually acquiesces with the Government's position
 in security cases.
 Since its founding in 1948, Israel has been in a state of war with most of its Arab
 neighbors. It concluded a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and with Jordan in 1994.
 As a result of the 1967 war, Israel occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East
 Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. The international community does not recognize
 Israel's sovereignty over any part of the occupied territories. Throughout its exist-
 ence, Israel has experienced numerous terrorist attacks.
 An historic process of reconciliation between Israel and its neighbors began with
 the Madrid Conference in 1991 and continued with the September 1993 signing of
 the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles (DOP). In September 1995, Israel
 and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Interim Agreement on
 the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which provided for the election and establish-
 ment of a Palestinian self-governing authority, transfer of civil authority, Israeli re-
 deployment from major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, security
 arrangements, and cooperation in a variety of areas. In January 1997, Israel and
 the PLO concluded the Hebron Agreement, which established security arrangements
 for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian-populated areas of Hebron,
 and set out a road map for mutual implementation of other Interim Agreement com-
 mitments. On October 23, Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization signed
 the Wye River Memorandum, which, among other things, calls for the continuation
 of the process of Israeli further redeployments from the West Bank.
 Internal security is the responsibility of the General Security Service (GSS-also
 known as Shin Bet, or Shabak), which is under the authority of the Prime Min-
 ister's office. The police are under the authority of the Minister of Internal Security.
 The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are under the authority of a civilian Minister of
 Defense. The IDF includes a significant portion of the adult population on active
 duty or reserve status and plays a role in maintaining internal security. The For-
 *The human rights situation in the occupied territories is discussed in the annex appended
 to this report.

 eign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Knesset reviews the activities of the IDF
 and the GSS. Members of the security forces committed human rights-abuses.
 Israel has an advanced industrial economy, and citizens enjoy a high standard of
 living, with a per capita income-of $17,000. Unemployment among citizens rose to
 8.7 percent by year's end, but was substantially higher in the country's peripheral
 regions and among lower-skilled workers. Along with rapid economic growth in re-
 cent years, there has been an increase in income inequality. The longstanding gap
 in levels of income between Jewish and non-Jewish citizens continues. Regional in-
 come disparities appear to be growing, with unemployment in some areas reaching
 more than double the national average. A heavy reliance on foreign workers, prin-
 cipally from Asia and Eastern Europe, is a source of economic and social problems.
 Such workers generally are employed in agriculture and the construction industry
 and constitute about 10 percent of -the labor force. Since the implementation of an
 economic itabilization plan in 1985, Israel has moved gradually to reduce state
 intervention in the economy. The Government has been committed to market-ori-
 ented structural reforms, especially deregulation and rapid privatization of the econ-
 omy. Despite the Government's continued dominant role in the economy, individuals
 generally are free to invest in private interests and own property. The Government
 owns and manages 77 percent of the country's land area, and as a matter of policy
 it does not sell land. The Jewish National Fund (an organization established in 1897
 for the purchase and management of land for the Jewish peopl6) owns 8 percent of
 the country's land area, including a considerable amount transferred directly from
 the Government, and manages another 8 percent on behalf of the Government. The
 Jewish National Fund's statute prohibits the sale or leas'e of land to non-Jews, al-
 though exceptions sometimes are made. Foreigners are allowed freely to purchase
 or lease land in the remaining 7 percent of Israel.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide citizens with means of dealing with instances of abuse. Israel's
 main human rights problems have arisen from its policies and practices in the occu-
 pied territories, and from- its fight against terrorism. The redeployment of the IDF
 from major Palestinian population areas in the West Bank in December 1995, and
 its previous withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, have reduced significantly the scope
 of these problems. Israeli security forces abused Palestinians suspected of security
 offenses. The Government continues to detain without charge numerous Palestin-
 ians, some of them for lengthy periods, although the number decreased significantly
 during the year. Detention and prison conditions, particularly for Palestinian secu-
 rity detainees held in Israel, do not meet minimum international standards in some
 cases.
 The Government responded to terrorist and security incidents by periodically de-
 taining hundreds of Palestinians without charge and tightening existing restrictions
 on the movement of persons (and sometimes goods) across borders with the West
 Bank and Gaza and between PA-controlled areas inside the West Bank.
 The Government took few tangible steps to address discrimination and violence
 against women, although several court cases set important precedents regarding
 certain types of discrimination. Trafficking in women for prostitution, particularly
 from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, is a problem. The Government
 made little headway in reducing institutionalized legal and societal discrimination
 against Israel's Christian, Arab, and Druze citizens, who constitute just over 20 per-
 cent of the population, but do not share fully the rights -provided to, and obligations
 imposed on, the country's Jewish citizens. However, there was positive court action
 in this area as well.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Israeli forces killed Amal faction
 leader Hussam Al Amin in Lebanon with fire from a helicopter gunship on August
 24. Two Palestinian "security" detainees died in government custody, one from an
 alleged suicide attempt (see Section l.a. of the annex).
 During the year, 8 Israelis were killed and over 100 were wounded in terrorist
 attacks carried out by Palestinian groups or individuals seeking to halt the Middle
 East peace process (see Section 1.a. of the annex).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Israeli security forces abuse, and in some cases torture, Palestinians suspected of
 security offenses. Although laws and administrative regulations prohibit the phys-
 ical abuse of detainees, they frequently are not enforced in security cases. The Gen-
 eral Security Service (GSS) was responsible for the widespread abuse of Palestin-
 
 
 1689
 
 ians suspected of security offenses. The head of the GSS is empowered by govern-
 ment regulation to authorize security officers to use "moderate physical and psycho-
 logical pressure" (which includes violent shaking) while interrogating detainees.
 These practices often led to excesses (see Section 1.c. of the annex).
 Despite repeated challenges, the High Court of Justice has avoided ruling on the
 legality of the practices of "shaking' and other forms of coercion. The Government
 claims that these practices are justified as "special measures" to be used in "special
 circumstances" in the fight against terrorism. During the year, the High Court of
 Justice continued to hear abuse-related cases (almost all asking for an injunction
 to halt the torture of a specific individual). In addition, the High Court dropped nu-
 merous cases before beginning formal hearings when the GSS announced that it no
 longer needed to use "special measures." Human rights groups believe that the great
 majority of cases alleged to involve torture do not reach the court. In some cases,
 the High Court of Justice-issued injunctions prohibiting the use of certain forms of
 physical pressure after hearing evidence presented in secret by the GSS and not
 made available to defense attorneys. However, according-to Israeli human rights ad-
 vocates and legal experts, itbrutinely lifted such injunctions at the request of the
 GSS. In no case did the High Court overrule a GSS decision to use "moderate phys-
 ical pressure."
 Hashem Mufieh, arrested on August 18, claims to have been hooded and shackled
 in a painfully contorted position for periods of up to 24 hours. This treatment con-
 tinued until he "confessed." He was subseqjuently sentenced to 18 months in prison
 for mnembershi in a banned organization.'
 Abdel Razek    asib, detained on September 20, alleged that he was not permitted
 to sleep for a 12-day period, that he was shackled in a painfully contorted position
 for extended periods of time, and that he was hit by his interrogators. Mr. Khasib
 also claimed that his interrogation continued even aftr he had given his statement.
 In 1996 the Government presented draft legislation to define the basis for and
 limits of GSS activities. This legislation was rejected by the Knesset's Law and Con-
 stitution Committee because it gave the GSS too broad a role in "preserving democ-
 racy." The latest proposed legislation made no reference to the use of physical pres-
 sure in interrogations. The Knesset Law and Constitution Committee rejected a
 draft bill that would have prohibited retroactively Palestinians from seeking redress
 for damages (including death or incapacitating injury) caused by Israeli military
 personnel in the occupied territories.
 Government attempts to seize Israeli Arab land near Umm El Fabrm sparked vio-
 lent demonstrations on September 27, leading to close to 100 arrests and 90 inju-
 ries, including 25 injured police officers (see Section 2.b.).
 Conditions vary in incarceration facilities in Israel and the occupied territories,
 whicha  administered by the Israeli Prison Service (IPS), the IDF, or the national
 police. IPS prisons, which generally house Israeli citizens convicted of common
 crimes, usually meet minimum international standards. In general, IPS inmates are
 not subject to physical abuse by guards, food is adequate, and prisoners receive
 basic necessities. Inmates receive mail, have television sets in their cells, and re-
 ceive regular visits. Prisoners receive wages for prison work and benefits for good
 behavior. Many IPS prisons have drug treatment, educational, and recreational pro-
 grams. The IPS has established an investigatory committee to look into charges of
 violence by guards against inmates.
 Since the closure in 1995 of the main IDF detention camps in the occupied terri-
 tories, all security detainees (i.e., those detained and held without charge by secu-
 rity forces) from the occupied territories who are held for more than a few days are
 transferred to facilities within Israel. Security detainees during the year usually
 were held in IDF camps in Israel, but also in IPS facilities and in special sections
 of police detention facilities. Prisoners incarcerated for security reasons are subject
 to a different regimen, even  in IPS facilities. They orf en are denied certain privi-
 leges given to prisoners convicted on criminal charges. Security detainees include
 some minors. Detention camps administered by the IDF are limited to male Pal-
 estinian detainees and are guarded by armed soldiers. The total number of Palestin-
 ian prisoners and administrative detainees held by Israel, approximately 3,565 at
 the beginning of the year, fell to 1,634 by year's end. The number of administrative
 detainees (held without charge or trial) varied between 354 and 51 during the year,
 and stood at 83 at year's end. One of these detainees has been held without charge
 or trial since 1994.
 Conditions in IDF detention camps have been criticized repeatedly over the years.
 Conditions at the Russian Compound, which houses a combination of security and
 common prisoners and detainees inerusal      were  Itiie   in 1997 as not fit
 to serve as lock-up" by High Court of Justice President Aharon Barak. Conditions
 in other IDF facilities have improved in some respects. For example, inmates are
 
 
 1690
 given more time for exercise outside their cells. Nevertheless, recreational facilities
 remain minimal, and there are strict limitations on-family visits to detainees. Visits
 were prevented for long periods during closures of-the borders with Gaza 'and the
 West Bank.
 Conditions at some national police detention facilities can fall below minimum
 international standards. Such facilities are intendedto hold criminal detainees prior
 to trial but often become de facto prisons. Those held include some security detain-
 ees and some persons who have been convicted and sentenced. Inmates in the na-
 tional police detention facilities often are not accorded the same rights as prisoners
 in the IPS. Moreover, conditions are worse in the se parate facilities-for security de-
 tainees maintained both in police facilities and in IPS prisons.
 In 1996 the Government began a reform program     or the colantrfs detention fa-
 cilities. Thus far, improvements in prison conditions have been limited in scope.
 Continued problems include dilapidation' and overcrowding, which was aggravated
 by the closure of IDF detention facilities in the occupied territories in 1995. New
 legislation that took effect during 1997 provided for the right to live in conditions
 that would not harm the health or dignity of the detainee, access to adequate health
 care, the right to a bed for each detainee, and access to exercise and fresh air on
 a daily basis. While the legislation is a positive step, there has been little practical
 improvement to date.
 Children's rights groups have expressed particular concern over the separate sec-
 tions of holding facilities set-aside for the detention of children. Overcrowding, poor
 physical conditions, lack of social workers, and denial of visits by parents are among
 the key problems. In addition to some Israeli minors held in criminal cases, there
 are juveniles among Palestinian detainees. Children's rights activists have rec-
 ommended the construction of a separate detention facility for children.
 Two Palestinian prisoners died in custody during the year. One allegedly commit-
 ted suicide, and the other died following heart surgery (see Section 2.c. of the
 annex).
 All incarceration facilities are monitored by various branches of the Government,
 by members of the Knesset, by the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC), and by human rights groups. While monitoring is judged to be effective
 overall, in some instances human ri hts groups were demed timely access to specific
 detainees, usually Palestinians held without charge or trial for alleged security of-
 fenses (see Section 1.d. of the annex).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest of citi-
 zens, and the Government- generally observes this prohibition. Defendants are con-
 sidered innocent until proven guilty and have the right to writs of habeas corpus
 and other procedural safeguards. HOwever, a 1979 law permits detention without
 charge or trial, which is used in security cases. The Minister of Defense may issue
 a detention order for a maximum of 1 year. Within 24 hours of issuance, detainees
 must appear before a district judge who may confirm, shorten, or overturn the
 order. If the order is confirmed, an automatic -review takes place after 3 months.
 Detention orders were confirmed in all cases during the year. Detainees have the
 right to be represented by counsel and to appeal detention orders to the High Court
 of Justice; however, the security forces may delay notification of counsel with the
 consent of a judge. According to human rights groups and legal experts, there were
 cases in which a judge denied the Government's request to delay notification of
 counsel. At detention hearings, the security forces may withhold evidence from de-
 fense lawyers on security grounds. The Government also may seek to renew admin-
 istrative detention orders. However, the security services must "show cause" for con-
 tinued detention, and, in some instances, individuals were released because the
 standard could not be met.
 In felony cases, a district court judge may postpone for 48 hours the notification
 of arrest to the detainee's attorney. The postponement may be extended to 7 days
 by the Minister of Defense on national security grounds or by the police inspector
 general to conduct an investigation. Moreover, a judge may postpone notification for
 up to 15 days in national security cases.
 New legislation took effect in 1997 that defined more narrowly the grounds for
 pretrial detention and reduced to 24 hours the length of time a person may be held
 without charge. Children's rights activists have recommended separate legislation to
 define when and how a child may be arrested and how long children may be de-
 tained.
 Most of the protections afforded by law are not extended to Palestinian detainees,
 who fall under the jurisdiction of military law even if they are detained in Israel.
 With IDF redeployment in the West Bank, detention centers there were closed in
 1995. As a result, all Palestinian detainees held for longer than 1 or 2 days are in-
 carcerated in Israel (see Section 1.d. of the annex).
 
 
 1691
 
 At year's end, the Government held 101 non-Palestinian Arabs in detention.
 Those held were a mixture of common prisoners, administrative detainees, and secu-
 rity detainees. The Government continues to deny the ICRC access to two Lebanese
 citizens, Sheikh Mustafa Dirani (held without charge since 1994) and Sheikh Obeid
 (held without charge since 1989). The High Court of Justice ruled in May that the
 Government is entitled to continue holding them for use in a possible exchange of
 hostages to obtain the return of an Israeli who may still be held by hostile forces.
 The High Court's ruling stressed that national security needs take precedence over
 the detainees' individual rights under Israeli and international law. In addition, the
 Government detains 57 other Lebanese citizens, 21 without charge or trial. Eleven
 have completed prison sentences of up to 10 years but still are being held without
 charge. Twelve Lebanese detainees were released from Israeli prisons during the
 year, 10 in exchange for the remains of an Israeli soldier.
 Government attempts to seize Arab Israeli land near Umm El Fahm sparked vio-
 lent demonstrations, leading to nearly 100 arrests and 90 injuries, including 25 in-
 jured police (see Section 2.b.).
 The law prohibits forced exile of citizens, and there is no indication that the Gov-
 ernnent engaged in such practices.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision. In practice, however, the judiciary rou-
 tinely acquiesces to the Government's position in security cases. The judiciary pro-
 vides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The judicial system is composed of civil, military, religious, labor relations, and
 administrative courts, with the High Court of Justice as the ultimate judicial au-
 thority. The High Court of Justice is both a court of first instance (in cases involving
 government action) and an appellate court (when it sits as the Supreme Court).
 Each of the cited courts, including the High Court of Justice, have appellate courts
 or jurisdictions.
 The law provides -for the right to a hearing with representation by counsel, and
 authorities observe this right in practice. A planned regional and national system
 of public defenders operated by the Ministry of Justice was inaugurated in 1996
 with the opening of a Tel Aviv office, although that office has suffered serious budg-
 et shortages. A substantial percentage of criminal cases-are tried with no legal rep-
 resentation for the defendant.
 All nonsecurity trials are public except those in which the interests of the parties
 are deemed best served by privacy. Cases involving national security may be tried
 in either military or civil courts and may be partly or wholly close to the public.
 The Attorney General determines the venue in such cases. The prosecution must
 justify closing the proceedings to the public. Adult defendants have the right to be
 represented by counsel even in closed proceedings but may be denied access to some
 evidence on security grounds. Under the law, convictions may not be based on any
 evidence denied to the defense. In addition, convictions may not be based solely on
 a confession by the accused, although in practice security prisoners have been sen-
 tenced on the basis of the coerced confessions of both themselves and others.
 The legal system often imposes far stiffer punishments on Christian, Muslim, and
 Druze persons than on Jewish citizens. For example, human rights advocates claim
 that Palestinians and Arab Israelis convicted of murder usually receive life sen-
 tences, while Jewish Israelis often receive significantly shorter sentences. To the ex-
 tent that Palestinians are tried in Israeli courts, they receive harsher punishments
 than Jewish Israelis.
 There were no reports of political prisoners during the year.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though privacy of the individual and the home generally are protected by law, au-
 thorities interfere with mail and mohitor telephone conversations. In criminal cases,
 the law permits wiretapping under court order; in security cases, the order must
 be issued by the Ministry of Defense. Under emergency regulations, authorities may
 open and destroy mail on security grounds.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Violence continued in northern Israel, related to attacks in southern Leb-
 anon. According to various reports, an estimated 37 Hizballah guerrillas, 20 Israeli
 soldiers and 22 Lebanese civilians were killed in south Lebanon during the year,
 as Hizballah, Amal, and Palestinian guerrillas on the one hand, and Israeli forces
 and the SLA on the other, engaged in attacks. Hizballah attacked SLA and Israeli
 troops deployed on Lebanese soil. For example, Hizballah forces killed Israeli sol-
 diers in bomb attacks in July, August, and October. In August Hizballah launched
 rocket attacks against northern Israel, ostensibly in retaliation for SLA shelling of
 Lebanese villages. Israeli forces conducted repeated air strikes and artillery bar-
 rages on Hizbalah, Amal, and Palestinian, targets inside Lebanon. For example, in
 
 
 1692
 
 August Israeli planes fired rockets at suspected Hizballah positions in the south. In
 December an Israeli jet bombed a home in eastern Lebanon, killing a woman and
 her six children. In retaliation, Hizballah fired dozeng of rockets into northern
 Israel, wounding 12 civilians. Also in December, Israeli air raids in Janta resulted
 in the deaths of seven civilians. Hizballah retaliated with rocket attacks on northern
 Israel, wounding several Israelis.
 In south Lebanon, there is an average of two or three attacks daily against IDF/
 SLA military positions and a similar number of IDF/SLA counterattacks.
 The Israeli--Lebanese Monitoring Group continued to deal with alleged violations
 of the April 1996 understanding between Israel and Hizballah not to target civilians
 or to launch attacks from civilian-populated areas.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of the press, and
 the Government generally respects this right in practice. The law authorizes the
 Government to censor any material reported from Israel or the occupied territories
 regarded as sensitive on national security grounds. A new censorship agreement
 signed in 1996 between the Government and media representatives continues the
 trend of liberalization of Israel's censorship regime. The agreement provides that
 military censorship is to be applied only in cases involving national security issues
 that have a near certainty of harming Israel's defense interests, and it now applies
 to all media organizations in Israel, including all newspapers. All media organiza-
 tions can appeal the censor's decision to the High Court of Justice. Moreover, a
 clause abolishes the authority of the censor to shut down a newspaper for-a censor-
 ship violation and eliminates the ability of the office ofithe censor to appeal a deci-
 sion against it. News printed or broadcast abroad may be reported without censor-
 ship, which permits the Israeli media to run censored stories that have appeared
 in foreign sources.
 Emergency regulations prohibit anyone from expressing support for illegal organi-
 zations. On occasion in the past, the Government has prosecuted persons for speak-
 ing or writing on behalf of terrorist groups. No such cases were filed during the
 year. Settler Baruch Marzel was investigated for verbally abusing President Ezer
 Weizman in August under a law prohibiting "incitement" to violence.
 Individuals, organizations, the press, and the electronic media freely debate public
 issues and criticize government officials and policies. The Attorney General, while
 condemning hate speech, has concluded that such speech, for the most part, cannot
 be prosecuted.
 All newspapers are privately owned and managed. Newspaper licenses are valid
 only for Israel; separate licenses are required to distribute publications in areas in
 the occupied territories still under Israel's authority.
 Directed by a government appointee, the quasi-independent Israel Broadcast Au-
 thority (IBA) controls television Channel 1 and Kol Israel radio, both major sources
 of news and information. Six cable companies operate under franchises granted by
 government councils. Privately-nwned Channel 2 Television, the first commercial
 television channel, is operated by three franchise companies. There are 13 private
 radio outlets. The Second Television and Radio Authority, a public body, supervises
 both Channel 2 and the regional radio stations.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 of assembly, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. On
 September 27, government attempts to seize land near Umm El Fahm sparked vio-
 lent demonstrations, leading to close to 100 arrests and 90 injuries, including inju-
 ries to 25 police. The violence began when a large police force arrived at the village
 of Maawiya to tear down "protest tents" that were erected after the seizure order
 was issued. Police allegedly -roughed up and arrested some high school students,
 who were the first to arrive at the demonstrations, and the violence ensued.
 The law provides for the right of association, and the Government generally re-
 spects this provision in practice. After the Hebron massacre in 1994, the Cabinet
 invoked the 1948 Ordinance for the Prevention of Terror to ban the ultranationalist
 Kach and Kahane Chai organizations, a ban that remains in effect. The decision
 provides for imprisonment for anyone belonging to, or expressing support for, either
 organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment generally respects this right. Approximately 80 percent of citizens are Jewish.
 Muslims, Christians, Druze, and members of other religions make up the remaining
 20 percent. Each recognized religious community has legal authority over its mem-
 bers in matters of marriage and divorce. Secular courts have primacy over questions
 of inheritance, but parties, by mutual agreement, may bring cases to religious
 
 
 1693
 
 courts. Jewish and Druze families may ask for some family status matters, such as
 alimony and child custody in divorces, to be adjudicated in civil courts as an alter-
 native to religious courts. Christians may only ask that child custody and child sup-
 port be adjudicated in civil courts as an alternative to religious courts. Muslims
 have no recourse to civil courts in family-status matters. Legislation passed in 1996
 allows the rabbinical courts to sanction either party who is not willing to grant a
 divorce.
 Many citizens object to the Orthodox Jewish religious authorities' exclusive con-
 trol over marriage, divorce, and burial, even for non-Orthodox Jews. These authori-
 ties do not recognize marriages or conversions to Judaism performed in Israel by
 Conservative or Reform rabbis. These issues have been a source of sharp division
 within society, particularly in recent years, as thousands of Jewish immigrants from
 the former Soviet Union have brought with them family members not recognized as
 Jewish by Orthodox authorities.
 A large number of Jews who wish to be married in secular or non-Orthodox reli-
 gious ceremonies do so abroad. The Ministry of Interior recognizes such marriages.
 The Government provides proportionally greater financial support to institutions
 in the Jewish sector compared with those in the non-Jewish sector, i.e., Muslim,
 Christian, and Druze. For example, only 2 percent of the Ministry of Religious Af-
 fairs budget goes to the non-Jewish sector, despite the fact that Muslims, Chris-
 tians, and Druze constitute 20 percent of the population. The Ministry's 1998 budget
 actually reduced the percentage. After three hearings during the year, the Court
 ruled that the budget allocation did in fact constitute "prima facie discrimination"
 but that the plaintiffs petition did not provide adequate information about the reli-
 gious needs of the various communities. The Court refused to intervene in the budg-
 etary process on the grounds that such action would invade the proper sphere of
 the legislature.
 Missionaries are allowed to proselytize, although the Church of Jesus Christ of
 Latter-Day Saints has agreed not to do so under an agreement with the Govern-
 ment. A 1977 anti-proselytizing law prohibits anyone from offering or receiving ma-
 terial benefits as an inducement to conversion, but the law has not been applied for
 several years. In 1997 a bill was introduced to impose restrictions on proselytizing
 including a ban on the distribution of written materials encouraging conversions. A
 more restrictive bill that would ban virtually all forms of proselytizing passed a pre-
 liminary reading in the Knesset in April with significant government support. Nei-
 ther bill is expected to be enacted. Christian and other evangelical groups assert
 that the draft bills are discriminatory and serve to intimidate Christian groups.
 Jehovah's Witnesses suffered verbal abuse, assaults, theft, and vandalism during
 the year, apparently by ultra-Orthodox Jewish groups. Jehovah's Witnesses assert
 that police did not adequately investigate two break-ins at a meeting house in Lod
 in February.
 The Government has recognized only Jewish holy places under the 1967 Protec-
 tion of Holy Sites Law, therefore denying government funding for the preservation
 and protection of Christian, Druze, Muslim, Baha'i, and other religious sites. Follow-
 ing a 1997 challenge to this practice, the Ministry of Religious Affairs agreed to con-
 sider funding requests for non-Jewish sites, although none were approved during
 the year.
 A 1995 High Court of Justice ruling allows small numbers of Jews under police
 escort to pray on the Temple Mount, which is the location of two Muslim holy places
 and also the former site of the First and Second Jewish temples.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice for citizens, except with regard to military or security zones or in in-
 stances where citizens may be confined by administrative order to their neighbor-
 hoods or villages. The Government continued to restrict the movements of two Jew-
 ish settlers living in the occupied territories who belonged to extremist Kach or
 Kahane Chai groups, through the use of administrative orders issued by the IDF
 central command (see Section 2.d. of the annex).
 Citizens are free to travel abroad and to emigrate, provided they have no out-
 standing military obligations and are not restricted by administrative order. In 1998
 the Government again permitted Muslim citizens over 30 years of age to perform
 the religious pilgrimage to Mecca, but it denied permission to other Muslims on se-
 curity grounds. The Government asserts that travel to Saudi Arabia, which is still
 in a state of war with Israel, is a privilege and not a right. Christian, Muslim, or
 Druze women who have married men from Arab states or areas controlled by the
 Palestinian authority have complained about losing their Israeli citizenship and
 right to reenter Israel.
 
 
 1694
 
 The Government welcomes Jewish immigrants, their families, and Jewish refu-
 gees, on whom it confers automatic citizenship and residence rights under the Law
 of Return. This law does not apply to non-Jews or to persons of Jewish descent who
 have converted to another faith. Other than the Law of Return and the family re-
 unification statutes, which mainly apply to non-Jews who fled Israel in 1948-49,
 Israel has no immigration law that provides for immigration to Israel, or for politi-
 cal asylum or refugee status. The law does allow individuals to live in Israel as per-
 manent residents.
 The issue of first asylum did not arise in 1998. The Government cooperates with
 the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of the
 forced return of persons to a country where they fear persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully,
 and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage for adult citizens. The last national elections
 were held in May 1996, when voters elected the Prime Minister by direct ballot for
 the first time. New elections are scheduled for May 1999.
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with an active multiparty system in which
 a wide range of political views are represented. Relatively small parties, including
 those whose primary support is among Israeli Arabs, regularly win seats in the
 Knesset. Elections are by secret ballot.
 While there are, no legal impediments to the participation of women and minori-
 ties in government, the are underrepresented. Women hold 9 of 120 Knesset seats,
 compared with 11 female members in the previous Knesset. There are 11 Arabs and
 1 Druze in the Knesset, compared with 7 and 2 prior to the May 1996 election; most
 represent parties deriving their support largely or entirely from the Arab commu-
 nity. Of the Knesset's 12 committees, 2 (including the Committee on the Status of
 Women) are chaired by a woman. There is one woman in the Cabinet, and no Chris-
 tian, Muslim, or Druze ministers or deputy ministers. Three women, but no Arab
 or Druze citizens, serve on the 14-member High Court of Justice. Abdul Rahman
 Zuabi was appointed to a-temporary seat on the High Court and-would be the first
 non-Jewish justice when he officially takes office.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without. government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials gener   cooperate with investigations. However, the Government withheld its
 cooperation from the U.N. Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affect-
 ing the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the occupied
 territories. The Special Committee reported in October that the Government did not
 respond to its communications.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status. The law
 also prohibits discrimination by both Government and non-governmental entities on
 the basis of race, religion, political beliefs, and age. Local human rights groups are
 concerned that these laws often are not enforced, either as a result of institutional-
 ized discrimination, or because resources for implementing those laws, or mecha-
 nisms for their enforcement, are sometimes lacking.
 Women.-Violence against women is a problem. There continued to be action, both
 in and out of government, to reduce violence against women in Jewish and Arab
 communities. The Government has allocated minimal funds for a special campaign
 to combat such violence. Groups that focus on domestic violence include a committee
 established by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs that includes Jewish and
 Arab nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) as well as government representa-
 tives, and a coalition of human rights organizations. Approximately 13 women were
 killed by their husbands or other mle relatives during the year. According to the
 most recent estimates, some 200,000 women suffer from domestic violence each
 year, and some 7 percent of these are abused on a regular basis. According to press
 reports that appeared during the year, an estimated 60,000 women were sexually
 assaulted or abused in 1997. Only a small percentage of victims complained to the
 police. An estimated 60 percent of victims were 18 or under.
 Arab human rights advocates also have formed a coalition to raise public aware-
 ness of so-called family 'honor killings," a term commonly used for the murder of
 
 
 1695
 a female by a male relative for alleged misconduct. At least 5 of the 13 women killed
 during the year by male relatives were killed in family "honor" cases.
 The Government supports 10 shelters for battered women, including 1 exclusively
 for Christian, Muslim, and Druze women and 1 for both non-Jewish and Jewish
 women. Women's rights advocates consider this number inadequate.
 According to the 1991 Domestic Violence Law, a district or magistrate court may
 prohibit access by violent family members to their property. Women's groups cooper-
 ate with legal and social service institutions to provide women's rights education.
 While sentences handed down to men convicted of rape have increased in recent
 years, women's rights activists argue that the penalties are not sufficiently harsh.
 Civil rights groups also expressed concern about an increased incidence of phys-
 ical attacks by Jewish religious extremists, particulariy in Jerusalem, against
 women whom they consider to be dressed immodestly in public.
 Trafficking in women and girls has become a significant problem in recent years.
 According to a study by the Israel Women's Network, every year hundreds of women
 from the former Soviet Union are brought to Israel by well-organized mafia net-
 works and forced through violence and threats to work illegally.
 Women's advocacy groups report that women routinely receive lower wages for
 comparable work, are promoted less often, and have fewer career opportunities than
 their male counterparts. Despite 1996 legislation that provides for class action suits
 and requires employers to provide equal pay for equal work, including important
 side benefits and allowances, women's rights advocates charged that deep gaps re-
 mained.
 Legislation in 1993, reinforced by a 1994 ruling of the High Court of Justice, has
 increased the percentage of women on the boards of two-thirds of government-owned
 companies. However, their numbers remain low overall. One study reported that in
 1996 women made up more than 30 percent of the boards in only 39 of 118 govern-
 ment-owned companies.
 The adjudication of personal status law in the areas of marriage and divorce is
 left to religious courts, where Jewish and Muslim women are subject to restrictive
 interpretations of their rights (see Section 2.c.). Legislation passed in 1995 broad-
 ened the civil sanctions made available to rabbinical courts in cases where a wife
 has ample grounds for divorce-such as abuse-but the husband refuses to agree.
 However, in some cases rabbinical courts have failed to invoke these sanctions. In
 addition, there have been cases in which a wife has failed to agree to a divorce, but
 a husband has been allowed to remarry; this permission is not given to wives. Such
 imbalances have been used by husbands to extort concessions from their wives in
 return for agreeing to a divorce. Rabbinical courts also may exercise jurisdiction
 over and issue sanctions against non-Israeli persons present in Israel.
 Religious law can be even more restrictive for Muslims: Some Islamic law courts
 have held that Muslim women may not request a divorce, but that women may be
 forced to consent if a divorce is granted to a man.
 Jewish women are subject to the military draft but have been barred from combat
 positions. In response to a High Court of Justice ruling, the IAF since 1996 has per-
 mitted women to enter pilot training. This would qualify women for coinbat aviation
 positions, although none has completed the training fully to date. A recent Israeli
 Air Force (TAF) ruling allows female flight surgeons to participate in combat rescue
 missions.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the rights and welfare of children.
 However, in practice resources are sometimes insufficient, particularly with respect
 to low-income families. Education is compulsory to age 15, or until the child reaches
 the 10th grade, whichever comes first. Government ministries, children's rights
 groups, and members of the legislature often cooperate on children's rights issues.
 The Government provides an extensive health care program for children. There is
 a broad network of mother and child clinics, which provide prenatal care as well
 as postnatal follow-up.
 The Government has legislated against sexual, physical, and psychological abuse
 of children and has mandated comprehensive reporting requirements. Although
 there has been a sharp increase in reported cases of child abuse in recent years,
 activists believe that this is largely due to increased awareness of the issue rather
 than a growing pattern of abuse. There are five shelters for children at risk. The
 Ministry of Justice formed a committee with police and NGO representatives that
 is attempting to assess the scope of child prostitution. Children's rights activists es-
 timate that there may be several hundred prostitutes among the nation's children,
 and they warn that the phenomenon is unlikely to be eradicated until the social
 problems that give rise to it-including child abuse and schools that give up too
 readily on dropouts-are addressed.
 
 
 1696
 
 NGO's in the field of children's welfare concentrate their efforts on public edu-
 cation, on promoting the concept of children's rights as citizens, on improving legal
 representation for minors, and on combating the problems of poverty, which are
 most notable for the Bedouin children of the south. There has been concern about
 the children of the country's growing population of foreign workers, many of them
 residing in the country illegally. Children of such families, believed to number in
 the thousands, exist in a legal and social limbo, without access to schools or ade-
 quate health services.
 Privately funded children's rights information centers have been established in
 some communities, and the Government assists in funding additional centers in
 other cities.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government provides a range of benefits, including
 income maintenance, housing subsidies, and transportation support for disabled per-
 sons, who constitute about 10 percent of the population. Existing antidiscrimination
 laws do not prohibit discrimination based on disability, and these citizens continue
 to encounter difficulties in areas such as employment and housing. A law requiring
 access for the disabled to public buildings is not widely enforced. There is no law
 providing for access to public transportation for the disabled. A 1996 law extended
 disability assistance for deaf children from the age of 14 to maturity.
 Religious Minorities.-Tensions between secular and religious elements of Israeli
 society continued to grow during the year. The non-Orthodox Jewish community in
 particular has complained of discrimination and intolerance.
 In civic areas where religion is a determining criterion, such as the religious
 courts and centers of education, non-Jewish institutions routinely receive less state
 support than their Jewish counterparts. The status of a number of Christian organi-
 zations with representation in Israel has heretofore been defined by a collection of
 ad hoc arrangements with various government agencies. Several of these organiza-
 tions seek to negotiate with the Government in an attempt to formalize their status.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government does not provide Israeli
 Arabs, who constitute 20 percent of the population, with the same quality of edu-
 cation, housing, employment, and social services as Jews.- In addition, government
 spending is proportionally far lower in predominantly Arab areas than in Jewish
 areas. According to the press, an Interior Ministry report released during the year
 notes that non-Jewish communities receive significantly less government financial
 support than their Jewish counterparts. Israeli-Arab organizations have challenged
 the Government's "Master Plan for the Northern Areas of Israel," which listed as
 priority goals increasing the Galilee's Jewish population and blocking the territorial
 contiguity of Arab villages and towns, on the grounds that it discriminates against
 Arab citizens.
 Relative to their numbers, Israeli Arabs are underrepresented in the student bod-
 ies and faculties of most universities and in higher level professional and business
 ranks. Well-educated Arabs are often unable to find jobs commensurate with their
 level of education. Arab Ph.D.'s suffer the greatest problems in this regard. A small
 number of Israeli Arabs have risen to responsible positions in the civil service, gen-
 erally in the Arab departments of government ministries. In 1994 a civil service
 commission began a 3-year affirmative action program to expand that number, but
 it has had only modest results. The Government has allocated only very limited re-
 sources to enforce landmark 1995 legislation prohibiting discrimination in employ-
 ment.
 In practice, Israeli Arabs are not allowed to work in companies with defense con-
 tracts or in security-related fields. The Israeli Druze and Circassian communities
 are subject to the military draft, and although some have refused to serve, the over-
 whelning majority accepts service willingly. Some Bedouin and other Arab citizens
 who are not subject to the draft serve voluntarily. Those not subject to the draft
 have less access than other Israelis to those social and economic benefits for which
 military service is a prerequisite or an advantage, such as housing, new-household
 subsidies, and government or security-related industrial employment. Under a 1994
 government policy decision, the social security child allowance for parents who did
 not serve in the military and did not attend a Yeshiva (including Arabs) was in-
 creased to equal the allowance of those who had done so.
 Israeli Arab groups allege that many employers use the prerequisite of military
 service to avoid hiring non-Jews. For example, in 1997 a Haifa employment agency
 ran ads seeking Arabic-speaking telephone operators and listed military service as
 a prerequisite. An Israeli Arab group noted that there was no clear justification for
 this requirement, and it threatened to file a civil suit under a law prohibiting em-
 ployment discrimination, and defining requirements unrelated to actual work as dis-
 criminatory. The employment agency eventually agreed to change the advertisement
 and run it again.
 
 
 1697
 
 The Government has yet to fulfill its commitment to resolve the legal status of
 unrecognized Arab villages. Eight villages have been recognized since 1994, but
 nearly 100 more, of varying size and with a total population of nearly 70,000 per-
 sons, remain in limbo. Such villages have none of the infrastructure, such as elec-
 tricity, water, and sewers, provided to recognized communities. Private efforts have
 supplied some unrecognized villages with water, and the courts have ordered the
 provision of limited health and education services. In April the High Court of Jus-
 tice ordered the Education Ministry to provide electricity to schools in several unrec-
 ognized villages in the Negev. One positive development was the decision, under the
 pressure of another case before the High Court of Justice, of the Ministry of the In-
 terior and the Attorney General to agree that residents of the unrecognized village
 of Husseinya could list their village's name on their ID cards as their place of resi-
 dence.
 Arab children make up about a quarter of Israels public school population, but
 government resources for them are less than proportionate to those for Jewish chil-
 dren. Many schools in Arab communities are dilapidated and overcrowded, lack spe-
 cial education services and counselors, have poor libraries, and have no sports facili-
 ties. Arab groups also note that the public school curriculum stresses Israel's Jewish
 culture and hetge.
 Israeli-Arab students also are not eligible to participate in a special education pro-
 gram to provide academic assistance to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
 A petition was filed with the High Court of Justice in May 1997 charging that the
 Ministry of Education's refusal to provide this program to Israeli-Arab students was
 discriminatory. The Attorney General's office agreed that the policy constituted im-
 paermissible discrimination but asked for 5 years to expand the program to Israeli-
 ab students. The petitioners rejected this proposal as being too slow. The court
 heard the case twice during the year and still had not ruled on the proper imple-
 mentation period by the end of the year.
 Unresolved problems of many years' standing also include claims by Arab groups
 that land expropriation for public use has affected the Arab community dispropor-
 tionately; that Arabs have been allowed too little input in planning decisions that
 affect their schools and municipalities; that mosques and cemeteries belonging to
 the Islamic Waqf (religious endowment) have been expropriated unjustly for public
 use; and that successive governments have blocked the return to their homes of per-
 sons displaced in the early years of Israel's history. The Government has yet to
 agree with the pre-1948 residents of the northern villages of Bir Am and Ikrit, and
 their descendants, regarding their long-time demand to be allowed to rebuild their
 houses; in the meantime, permission has been given to Jewish settlements to in-
 crease their land holdings in the disputed areas.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may join and establish labor organizations
 freely. Most unions belong to Histadrut (the General Federation of Labor in Israel),
 or to a much smaller rival federation, the Histadrut Haovdim Haleumit (National
 Federation of Labor). These organizations are independent of the Government.
 Histadrut members democratically elect national and local officers, and officials of
 its affiliated women's organization Na'amat, from political party lists of those al-
 ready in the union. Plant or enterprise committee members are elected individually.
 During the year, the Histadrut administration continued its drastic reshaping of
 the labor federation, including further reductions in staff and services, as Histadrut
 shifted its concentration to those areas directly related to employment. At year's
 end, membership-which once reached 1.65 million persons-stood at about 650,000.
 The right to strike is exercised regularly. Unions must provide 15 days' notice
 prior to a strike unless otherwise specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
 However, unauthorized strikes occur. Strike leaders-even those organizing illegal
 strikes-are protected by law. If essential public services are affected, the Govern-
 ment may appeal to labor courts for back-to-work orders while the parties continue
 negotiations. There were a number of strikes in both public and private sectors dur-
 ing the year by employees protesting the effects of privatization. Worker dismissals
 and the terms of severance arrangements were often the central issues of dispute.
 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip who work in Israel may not join
 Israeli trade unions or organize their own unions in Israel. Palestinian trade unions
 in the occupied territories are not permitted to conduct activities in Israel (see Sec-
 tion 6.a. of the annex). However, nonresident workers in the organized sector are
 entitled to the protection of Histadrut work contracts and grievance procedures.
 They may join, vote for, and be elected to shop-level workers' committees if their
 numbers in individual establishments exceed a minimum threshold. Palestinian par-
 ticipation in such committees is minimal.
 
 
 1698
 
 Labor laws apply to Palestinians in East Jerusalem and to the Syrian Druze liv-
 ing on the Golan Heights.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international.organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Israeli workers fully exercise
 their legal rights to organize and bargain collectively. While there is no law specifi-
 cally prohibiting antiunion discrimination, the law against discrimination could be
 cited to contest discrimination based on union membership. No antiunion discrimi-
 nation has been reported.
 Nonresident workers may not organize their own unions or engage in collective
 bargaining, but they are      to     resented by the bargaining agent andpro-
 tected by collective bargaining agreements. They do not pay union membership fees,
 but are required to pay a 1 percent agency fee, which entitles them to union protec-
 tion by Histadrut's collective bargaining agreements. The Ministry of Labor may ex-
 tend collective bargaining agreements to nonunionized workplaces in the same in-
 dustrial sector. The Ministry of Labor also oversees personal contracts in the unor-
 ganized sectors of the economy.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor. Neither citizens nor nonresident Palestinians working in Israel are
 subject to this practice. Civil rights roups charge that unscrupulous employers
 often take advantage of illegal workers lack of status (see Section 6.e.) to hold gem
 in conditions amounting to involuntary servitude. The Government specifically pro-
 hibits forced child, labor, and it does not occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Children
 who have attained the age of 15 years, and who are liable to compulsory education
 under the Compulsory Education Law, may not be employed unless they work as
 apprentices under the Apprenticeship Law. Notwithstanding these provisions, chil-
 dren who are 14 years old may be employed during official school holidays. Employ-
 ment of those 16 to 18 years of age is restricted to ensure time for rest and edu-
 cation.
 There are no reliable data on illegal child workers. They are concentrated among
 Israel's Arab population and its most recent Jewish immigrants. Illegal employment
 is found primarily in urban, light-industrial areas. Children's rights groups have
 called for more vigorous enforcement of child labor laws, combined with a parallel
 effort to deal with the causes of illegal child labor. The Government specifically pro-
 hibits forced child labor, and it does not occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legislation in 1987 established a minimum
 wage at 45 percent of the average wage, calculated periodically and adjusted for cost
 of living increases. At year's end, the minimum wage stood at about $700 (roughly
 2,800 New Israeli Shekels) per month. The minimum wage often is supplemented
 by special allowances and is generally sufficient to provide a worker and family with
 a decent standard of living. Union officials have expressed concern over enforcement
 of minimum wage regulations, particularly with respect to employers of illegal non-
 resident workers, who sometimes pay less than the minimum wage.
 By law the maximum hours of work at regular pay are 47 hours a week, 8 hours
 per day, and 7 hours on the day before the weekly rest, which must be at least 36
 consecutive hours and include the Sabbath. By national collective agreements, the
 private sector established a maximum 45-hour workweek in 1988. The public sector
 moved to a 5-day, 42/2 hour workweek in 1989, while the military adopted it in
 1993.
 Employers must receive a government permit to hire nonresident workers from
 the occupied territories, certifying that no citizen is available for the job. All Pal-
 estinians from the occupied territories are employed on a daily basis and, unless
 they are employed on shift work, are not authorized to spend the night in Israel.
 At the end of the year, the Government was considering a change in this provision
 to allow Palestinian workers to remain overnight for a week at a time. Palestinians
 without valid work permits are subject to arrest.
 Nonresident workers are paid through the Employment Service of the Ministry
 of Labor, which disburses wages and benefits collected from employers. The Min-
 istry deducts a 1 percent union fee and the workers' required contributions to the
 National Insurance Institute (NII), the agency that administers the Israeli social se-
 curity system, unemployment benefits, and other benefits. Despite these deductions,
 Palestinian workers are not eligible for all NII benefits. They continue to be insured
 for injuries occurring in Israel and the bankruptcy of a worker's employer. They do
 not have access to unemployment insurance, general disability payments, low-in-
 come supplements, or child allotments. By contrast Israeli settlers in the occupied
 territories who work in Israel have the same benefits as other Israeli workers. The
 International Labor Organization (ILO) has long criticized this inequality in entitle-
 
 
 1699
 ments. The Government agreed to transfer the NII fees collected from Palestinian
 workers to the Palestinian Authority, which is to assume responsibility for all the
 pensions and social benefits of Palestinians working in Israel. Implementation of
 this change is still under way.
 There was increased public debate over the role in the workplace and society of
 foreign workers, who are estimated to number 200,000 or more, perhaps half of
 them undocumented and illegally employed. The majority of such workers come
 from Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, and most are employed in the construc-
 tion and agricultural sectors. The law does not allow such workers citizenship or
 permanent residence in Israel. As a result, they and their families live in a legal
 and social limbo. Government deportations of such workers take place without bene-
 fit of due process.
 Along with union representatives, the Labor Inspection Service enforces labor,
 health, and safety standards in the workplace, although resource constraints affect
 overall enforcement. Legislation protects the employment rights of safety delegates
 elected or appointed by the workers. In cooperation with management, these dele-
 gates are responsible for safety and health in the workplace. Workers do not have
 the legal right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeop-
 ardy to continued employment. However, collective bargaining agreements provide
 some workers with recourse through the work site labor committee. Any worker
 may challenge unsafe work practices through government oversight and legal agen-
 cies.
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 (INCLUDING AREAS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY)
 Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and East Jerusalem
 during the 1967 War. The West Bank and Gaza Strip now are administered to vary-
 ing extents by Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Pursuant to the May 1994
 Gaza-Jericho Agreement and the September 1995 Interim Agreement, Israel trans-
 ferred most responsibilities for civil government in the Gaza Strip and parts of the
 West Bank to the PA, while retaining responsibility in the West Bank and Gaza
 Strip for external security; foreign relations; the overall security of Israelis, includ-
 ing public order in the Israeli settlements; and certain other matters. Negotiations
 to address the permanent status issues including Jerusalem, borders, settlements,
 refugees, water, and other matters began in May 1996 but were adjourned imme-
 diately. In accordance with the Wye River Memorandum, signed in October, the per-
 manent status talks resumed in November. According to the timetable set out in
 the 1993 Israel-Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Declaration of Principles,
 the interim period is to conclude in May 1999.
 In addition to most of the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, which were turned
 over to the PA in May 1994, Israel began redeploying its forces in the West Bank
 and turning over major towns and villages to the PA in late 1995. Pursuant to the
 Interim Agreement and the Hebron Agreement, concluded in January 1997, Israel
 also redeployed its forces in Hebron. On October 23, Israel and the Palestine Libera-
 tion Organization (PLO) signed the Wye River Memorandum which, among other
 things, called for the continuation of the process of Israeli further redeployments
 from the West Bank. Israel continues to control certain civil functions and is respon-
 sible for all security in portions of the occupied territories categorized as Zone C,
 which includes the Israeli settlements. In areas known as Zone B, the PA has juris-
 diction over civil affairs and shares security responsibilities with Israel. The PA has
 control over civil affairs and security in Zone A. The PA also has jurisdiction over
 some civil affairs in Zone C. Accordingly, this report discusses the policies and prac-
 tices of both the Israeli Government and the PA in the areas where they exercise
 jurisdiction and control.
 Israel continues to exercise civil authority in some areas of the West Bank
 through the Israeli Ministry of Defense's Office of Coordination and Liaison, known
 by the Hebrew acronym MATAK, which replaced the now defunct Civil Administra-
 tion (CIVAD). The approximately 163,000 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank
 and Gaza Strip are subject to Israeli law and are treated better by Israeli authori-
 ties than are Palestinians. The body of law governing Palestinians in the Israeli-
 controlled portions of the territories derives from Ottoman, British Mandate, Jor-
 danian, and Egyptian law, and Israeli military orders. In Palestinian-controlled
 areas, laws and regulations promulgated by the PA are also in force. The inter-
 national community considers Israel's authority in the occupied territories to be sub-
 ject to the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Geneva Convention relating to
 the Protection of Civilians in Time of War. The Israeli Government considers the
 
 
 1700
 Hague Regulations applicable and states that it observes the Geneva Convention's
 humanitarian provisions.
 In January 1996, Palestinians chose their first popularly elected government in
 democratic elections, which were generally well-conducted.-The 88-member Council
 and the Chairman of the Executive Authority were elected. The PA also has a Cabi-
 net, newly appointed in August, of 27 ministers. PA Chairman Yasir Arafat contin-
 ues to dominate the affairs of government and to make major decisions. Most senior
 government positions in the PA are held by individuals who are members of, or
 loyal to, Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO. The Council meets regularly and dis-
 cusses a range of issues significant to the Palestinian people and the development
 of an open, democratic society in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Pursuant to the
 agreements signed between the PLO and Israel, the PA has full or partial control
 over most major Palestinian population centers in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
 Israeli security forces in Israeli-controlled parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
 consist of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF); the General Security Service (GSS or
 Shin Bet); the Israeli National Police (INP); and the paramilitary border poice.
 Israeli military courts try Palestinians accused of committing security crimes in
 Israeli-controlled areas. Members of the Israeli security forces committed human
 rights abuses.
 The Palestinian Police Force (PPF) was established in May 1994 and includes the
 Palestinian Public Security Force; the Palestinian Civil Police; the Preventive Secu-
 rity Force (PSF); the General Intelligence Service, or Mukhabarat; the Palestinian
 Presidential Security Force; emergency services and rescue; and the Palestinian
 Coastal Police. Other quasi-military security organizations, such as military intel-
 ligence, also exercise law enforcement powers. Palestinian police are responsible for
 security and law enforcement for Palestinians and other non-Israelis in PA-con-
 trolled areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli settlers in the occupied terri-
 tories are not subject to PA security force jurisdiction. Members of the PA security
 forces committed human rights abuses.
 The economy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is small, poorly developed, and
 highy dependent on Israel. The economy relies on agriculture, services, and to a
 lesser extent, light manufacturing. Israel restricts the movement of persons and
 products into Israel and Jerusalem from the West Bank and Gaza. In addition, since
 1993 Israel has applied "closures," or enhanced restrictions, on the movement of per-
 sons and products for lengthy periods following terrorist attacks. Palestinians and
 their vehicles are reqnired to use permits to cross from the West Bank or Gaza into
 Israel and Jerusalem. Many West B   and Gaza workers are employed at day jobs
 in Israel and Jerusalem, making their employment vulnerable to disruption due to
 these closures. On occasion, Israel imposes a tightened version of closure in the
 wake of terrorist incidents, and when it believes that there is an increased likeli-
 hood of terrorist attacks or unrest in the occupied territories. During these times,
 Israel cancels all travel permits and prevents Palestinians-even those with valid
 work permits-from entering Israel or Jerusalem. It also periodically prohibits most
 travel between select towns and villages within the West Bank (an "internal" clo-
 sure), hampering the flow of goods and persons. According to United Nations econo-
 mists, Israel imposed two days of tightened closure on the West Bank and Gaza
 Strip in the first 6 months of the year. Israel more frequently tightened the closures
 in the latter half of the year due to security incidents or because Israeli officials
 were concerned about the heightened possibility ofurest in the occupied territories.
 Comprehensive closures were also instituted during the Rosh Hashana and Succot
 holiday periods in September and October. During the year, Israel began to imple-
 ment a program to allow selected Palestinian workers to enter Israel to work during
 "tightened closure" conditions after renewing entry permits in a process that lasts
 only a few days, rather than several days or weeks.
 There were some improvements in the human rights situation in the occupied ter-
 ritories, however, both Israel and the PA were responsible for serious human rights
 abuses.
 Israeli security forces committed a number of serious human rights abuses during
 the year. During the year, nine Palestinians were killed in violent confrontations
 with Israeli security units, who at times used live ammunition against Palestinian
 demonstrators and shot at demonstrators indiscriminately. For example, on May 14,
 the 50th anniversary of Israel's independence, Palestinian demonstrators clashed
 with Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Four Palestinians in Gaza
 and one in the West Bank were shot and killed by Israeli forces, who in some cases
 used live ammunition and shot Palestinians in the upper body and head.
 Israeli security forces abused, and in some cases, tortured, Palestinians suspected
 of security offenses. Human rights groups and lawyers say that abuse and torture
 is widespread and that Israeli security officials -use a variety of methods designed
 
 
 1701
 
 to coerce confessions that threaten prisoners' health and inflict extreme pain, includ-
 ing the use of violent shaking. Prison conditions are poor, and Israeli authorities
 arbitrarily arrest and detain persons. Prolonged detention, limits on due process,
 and infringements on privacy rights remained problems. In some cases, Palestinians
 were able to challenge successfuly the length of their administrative detentions and
 in July the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that judges, rather than senior Israeli
 military officers, are authorized to extend a detainee's administrative detention
 order. Israeli authorities placed some limits on freedom of assembly. The Israeli
 Government places limits on freedom of movement.
 PA security forces committed a number of serious human rights abuses during the
 year. For example, two Palestinians died in PA custody. PA officials acknowledge
 that Walid Mahmoud Al-Qawasmi died in August of wounds inflicted by PA
 Mukhabarat officers during his detention. PA officials say that he was not given
 prompt medical treatment.
 PA officials abused, and in some cases tortured, prisoners and detainees. Due
 largely to the decrease in terrorist attacks during the year, PA security forces made
 fewer arrests than in the past, although there continue to be credible accounts of
 torture and abuse of prisoners and detainees. PA prison conditions are very poor.
 PA security forces arbitrarily arrest and detain persons. Prolonged detention and
 lack of due process are problems. At year's end, the PA held about 1,020 Palestin-
 ians in custody, including 315 in administrative detention, according to a Palestin-
 ian human rights group. The courts are inefficient, lack staff and resources, and do
 not ensure fair and expeditious trials. PA security forces infringed on the right to
 privacy. Although the PA claims to respect its citizens' right to express themselves
 freely, the PA limited freedom of speech and of the press. The PA continued to har-
 ass, detain, and abuse journalists. PA harassment has led many Palestinian com-
 mentators, reporters, and critics to practice self-censorship. The PA placed some
 limits on freedom of association. Societal discrimination against women and the dis-
 abled is a problem.
 During the year, three Palestinians died in attacks perpetrated by Israelis while
 Israeli civilians, including settlers, continued to harass, abuse, and attack Palestin-
 ians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In general, settlers are not prosecuted for
 these acts and rarely serve prison sentences when convicted of a crime against Pal-
 estinians.
 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip continued to harass, abuse, and
 attack Israelis, especially settlers. Extremist Palestinian groups and individuals, in-
 cluding the militant Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) and the Palestine Is-
 lamic Jihad (PIJ), killed Israeli civilians in a number of deadly attacks in the Occu-
 pied Territories and Israel, continuing their efforts to undermine the authority of
 the PA and halt progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Members of the Israeli security
 forces killed four Palestinians at military checkpoints and roadblocks inside the oc-
 cupied territories. In these cases, Israeli authorities stated that the individuals were
 shot after failing to obey orders to halt or after Israeli soldiers perceived that they
 were trying to attack the soldiers manning the checkpoints. Palestinians dispute
 these accounts and charge that Israeli soldiers used excessive and unnecessary
 force.
 On March 10, three Palestinian. workers, Jaleb Rajoub, Mohammed Shanada
 Sharawne, and Adman Abu Zneid, were shot and killed by Israeli soldiers when
 their van swung out of a line of traffic and lurched forward. Soldiers said that they
 believed the van driver was trying to run them over. Two other Palestinian pas-
 sengers in the van were wounded in the incident. The three Israeli paratroopers in-
 volved in the incident initially were detained but were released a day later. An
 Israeli military court investigated the incident and decided not to charge the sol-
 diers. The court ruled that because they felt their lives were in danger, they be-
 haved appropriately. On April 6, security forces shot and killed Bilal Naji Al-
 Salayimah, 25, at an Israeli checkpoint in northern Jerusalem. Israeli authorities
 say that he failed to obey orders to stop at the checkpoint.
 Israeli security units also shot and killed several Palestinians who they claim
 were involved in acts of terrorism. On March 6, soldiers of the Israel Defense Force
 (IDF) shot and killed a Palestinian who was trying to cross the Egyptian border into
 Gaza. Israeli authorities claim that he was trying to infiltrate Israel, possibly to
 carry out a terrorist attack. On the evening of June 9, Rafad Mohammed Al-
 Bardawil, 25, was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers outside the Morag settlement
 
 
 1702
 
 in Gaza. Israeli officials say that Bardawil was attempting to infiltrate the settle-
 ment. On September 11, Israeli soldiers and police shot and killed Imad and Adel
 Awadallah, two brothers who were members of the armed wing of HAMAS, outside
 Hebron. Both men were wanted by Israeli and Palestinian authorities for planning
 several terrorist attacks that resulted in the deaths of civilians.
 During the year, violent clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli
 security forces resulted in 16 Palestinian deaths and scores of wounded. IDF regula-
 tions permit the use of both rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition only
 when a soldier's life is in immediate danger, to halt fleeing suspects, to disperse a
 violent demonstration, or to fire on an "individual unlawfully carrying firearms." Ac-
 cording to policy, soldiers should direct fire at the legs only and may fire at a fleeing
 suspect only if they believe that a serious felony has occurred and they have ex-
 hausted other means to apprehend the suspect. It is forbidden to open fire in the
 direction of children or women, even in cases of severe public disorder, unless there
 is an immediate and obvious danger to a soldier's life. Israeli soldiers and police
 sometimes used live ammunition or rubber-coated metal bullets, which can be le-
 thal, in situations other than when their lives were in danger and sometimes shot
 suspects in the upper body and head. During the year, Israeli soldiers shot in the
 head and killed, with rubber-coated metal bullets, three Palestinians under the age
 of 18.
 On March 11 Samer Bassem Karameh, 12, was shot and killed by a rubber-coat-
 ed metal bullet during clashes with the IDF in Hebron that erupted following the
 killing a day earlier of three Palestinian workers by Israeli security forces near He-
 bron. On May 14, Israel's independence day, 4 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and
 1 in the West Bank were shot and killed by Israeli soldiers-and approximately 400
 were wounded during violent clashes. One of the- Palestinians killed during clashes
 in Gaza was a nurse who was shot while in a clearly marked ambulance. Palestin-
 ian officials charged that the IDF use of force was excessive, especially with regard
 to the use of live ammunition, and that Israeli soldiers shot to kill, hitting several
 Palestinians in the upper body and head. Israeli officials say that Israeli soldiers
 in Gaza did not always follow live-fire guidelines but they denied that soldiers delib-
 erately tried to kill protesters.
 On August 1, Fatima Sulayman Auda Rashiydeh, age 60, died from wounds suf-
 fered during a clash between Israeli soldiers and Arab Bedouin demonstrators on
 July 15, according to Palestinian human rights monitors. Her wounds included bro-
 ken bones, contusions, and bruises from being beaten and hit by an army jeep. The
 demonstrators were protesting Israeli attempts to remove grazing livestock from an
 area designated as a military firing range in an Israeli-controlled area. Israeli offi-
 cials said that they were unaware that she had been injured during the demonstra-
 tion or that she had died.
 On September 12, Kamleh Mohammed Al-Nadher died after being shot in the face
 during a clash between Palestinians and Israeli border policemen in the Shofat refu-
 gee camp in Jerusalem. The Palestinians were protesting the death of a Palestinian
 man who had suffered a heart attack and died after the ambulance was delayed
 waiting for its mandatory border police escort.
 On October 8, 20-year-old Amjad Jamal Natsche, a Jordanian citizen, was shot
 with a rubber bullet and died during confrontations between Palestinians and
 Israeli soldiers in Hebron. Witnesses to the shooting say that Natsche was shot
 while his back was turned to Israeli soldiers during a lull in the fighting.
 On October 11, Jihad Abu Rabi'a, a 13-year-old boy from the Jalazone refugee
 camp near Ramallah, was shot in the head by an Israeli border policeman during
 a stone-throwing altercation. Israeli physicians have declared him clinically dead.
 On December 9, Jihad Fidro 'Aiad, age 16, was shot and killed by the IDF north
 of Ramallah during a demonstration. On December 11, Mohammad Sliman, age 18,
 and Kamal Adwan, age 21, were shot and killed by the IDF during a demonstration
 in Qalqilyia. On December 17, Mohammed Ahmed Dahoud was shot and killed by
 the IDF during a demonstration near Ramallah.
 Two Palestinian "security" detainees died in Israeli custody, one from an alleged
 suicide attempt and the other allegedly due to inadequate medical treatment and
 subsequent mistreatment (see Section 1.c.).
 PA security forces were responsible for several extrajudicial killings. In October
 members of the Palestinian Military Intelligence Organization shot 16-year-old
 Wasim Tarifi in the head and killed him during a protest in Ramallah.
 During the year, two Palestinians died in PA custody. At least one of the two died
 after being tortured; one reportedly committed suicide (see Section 1.c.). On August
 9, Walid Marmoub Al-Qawasmi, a 50-year-old resident of Hebron, died in the Gen-
 eral Intelligence Organization prison in Jericho. PA officials say that he died from
 suffocation brought on by swelling of the brain as a result of a head injury that was
 
 
 1703
 
 inflicted during his detention, and PA officials say that he was not given prompt
 medical attention. In August the PA began an investigation into Qawasmi's death
 but it has not revealed the results of its probe.
 On August 30, two Gazans, Kamal Abu Sultan and Ra'id Kamal Abu Sultan, were
 executed by firing squad after PA leader Arafat approved the execution. They had
 been convicted by a Palestinian security court and sentenced to death for murdering
 two men in the course of a personal dispute; however, the arrests, trial, and execu-
 tions followed each other in rapid succession within 3 days, raising concerns that
 the defendants were not accorded due process. Human ights organizations criti-
 cized the executions and charged that the PA did not provide the defendants access
 to independent legal counsel before or during the trial in the PA's controversial Spe-
 cial Security Court.
 Two Palestinians, suspected among other things of selling land to Jews, were
 killed in the West Bank under suspicious circumstances. In 1997 PA Justice Min-
 ister Freih Abu Middein announced that the death penalty would be imposed on
 the Jordanian law in force-in the West Bank that prohibits the sale of land to for-
 eigners.
 On April 6, Mohammed Anqawi, age 50, was found shot to death near Ramnallah.
 Anqawi was suspected of selling land to Jews and collaborating with Israel, and
 family members say that he had been summoned to Palestinian intelligence head-
 quarters in Ramallah immediately prior to his death. The Palestnian Human
 Rights Monitoring Group accused the PA of murdering Anqawi. On April 7, Riboi
 Musfi Awad was found dead in an Israeli-controlled area near Ramallah. Awad, who
 was reputed to be a collaborator, had been shot in the head. Palestinians say that
 he had been summoned to Palestinian police offices to discuss allegations that he
 sold land to Jews. Palestinian authorities say that becaus e  Abody was found in
 an Israeli-controlled area, they did not invesgate the death.
 During theyear, Israeli civilians in the est Bank and Jerusalem killed eight
 Palestinians. On May 6, Ahmed Alan Musa was shot and killed by a settier afr
 Musa stabbed him.
 On May 13, Heiri Alqem, age 51, was stabbed to death by an unidentified 'serial
 stabber" in West Jerusalem. In October Israeli police arrested a 32-year-old Israeli
 man affiliated with Israeli extremist groups for a series of stabbings in Jerusalem
 in which Alqem was killed and six others were injured. Israeli police officials re-
 leased the suspect, saying that there was insufficient evidence to hold him. Later
 that day, 44-year-old Hali Ibrahim, a homeless Palestinian Bedouin, was stabbed
 and killed in Jerusalem. Police were investigating the killing. On December 2,
 Usama Musa Natshe, 41, from the Abu Tor neighborhood in Jerusalem, was stabbed
 to death outside his home. Jerusalem police continue to investigate the killings.
 On June 17 near Hebron, Israeli teenagers from a center for delinquent  dren
 hit Abd Aw-Majid Abu Turki, age 45, on the back of the head with a plank from a
 moving vehicle and killed him. The Jerusalem district court convicted one teenager
 of manslaughter and a second of causing death through negligence.
 On September 17, lyad Qarafish, age 16, was shot and killed during a stone-
 throwing altercation with an Israeli settler near Ramallah. An Israeli settier turned
 himself in after the shooting and, upon the orders of an Israeli court, he was held
 for 2 days and then released to house arrest because the court did not believe that
 the settler had fired the shot that killed the boy. The court prohibited him from en-
 tering the West Bank for a week. Israeli authorities are investigating and have not
 charged anyone formally with the shooting.
 On October 26, Muhan   mad Suliman Az-Zalmut, age 70, was killed near the
 northern West Bank settlement of Itamar. An Israeli court charged an Israeli citi-
 zen, Gur Hamel, with his murder. On December 7, an Israeli shot and killed Naser
 Erekat during disturbances in Abu Dis, near Jerusalem.
 In April a 28-year-old American-Israeli citizen was shot and killed near Hebron
 during an altercation with Palestinians who contended that he was using their land
 illegally. The circumstances of the shooting are unclear and there is conflicting in-
 formation about who shot and killed him.
 During the year, 9 Israelis were killed and over 100 were wounded in terrorist
 attacks carried out by Palestinian groups or individuals seeking to halt the Middle
 East peace process.
 Yael Miver, age 25, was killed by a Palestinian in a drive-by shooting in the West
 Bank in January. On May 6, a Yeshiva student was stabbed to death in Jerusalem's
 
 
 1704
 
 old city while on his way to pray at the Western Wall. Two Israeli settlers were
 shot and killed near the Yitzhar settlement near Nablus on August 5. In November,
 the PA arrested three members of the HAMAS military wing who confessed to the
 killings.
 In mid-August, an elderly rabbi was stabbed and killed by a Palestinian in He-
 bron. Israeli authorities arrested the accused attacker, who claimed to be a member
 of HAMAS, after he wounded 54 Israelis in a grenade attack on a bus station in
 the Israeli city of Beersheba in October. On October 13, Palestinians killed one
 Israeli youth and wounded another at a bathing site near Jerusalem. On October
 26, a 29-year-old Israeli security guard was shot and killed in Hebron.
 On October 29, a Palestinian suicide bomber killed one Israeli soldier and wound-
 ed several other Israelis, including school children who were slightly injured, in a
 bomb attack on a school bus in the Gaza Strip. On November 6, two Palestinians
 died in a suicide bombing in Jerusalem that wounded over one dozen Israelis.
 b. Disappearance.-Two Palestinians who disappeared under suspicious cir-
 cumstances in 1997 remained unaccounted for in 1998. Shafiq Abdul Wahhab, a
 suspected land dealer, disappeared in 1997 and his whereabouts remain unknown.
 The PA, which established a committee in 1997 to investigate his disappearance,
 has failed to locate him. Taysir Hmiadan Ziyadi, a Palestinian who married an
 Israeli woman in 1992 and received an Israeli identification card in 1996, dis-
 appeared in July 1997 during a trip to the Gaza Strip. His whereabouts remain un-
 known.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel,-Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Israeli security forces abuse, and in some cases torture, Palestinians suspected of
 security offenses. There continue to be a high number of complaints of mistreatment
 and torture during interrogation, especially from Palestinians suspected of belonging
 to Islamic groups. Interrogation sessions are long and severe, and solitary conme-
 ment is used frequently for long periods. The GSS systematically uses interrogation
 methods that do not result in detectable traces of mistreatment of the victims, or
 which leave marks that disappear after a short period of time. Common interroga-
 tion practices include hooding; forced standing or squatting for long periods of time;
 prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures; tying or chaining the detainee in con-
 torted and painful positions; blows and beatings with fists, sticks, and other instru-
 ments; confinement in small and often filthy spaces; sleep and food deprivation; and
 threats against the detainee's life or family. Israeli interrogators continued to sub-
 ject prisoners to violent "shaking," which in at least one past case resulted in death.
 In 1997 B'tzelem, a respected rsraeli human rights group, found that a large per-
 centage of Palestinian detainees whom it surveyed had been tortured while in
 Israeli detention.
 In 1987 the Israeli government-appointed Landau Judicial Commission con-
 demned torture but allowed for the use of "moderate physical and psychological
 pressure" to secure confessions and obtain information. In addition, although the
 Israeli Penal Code prohibits the use of force or violence by a public official to obtain
 information, the GSS chief is permitted by law to allow interrogators to employ
 "special measures" that exceed the use of "moderate physical and psychological pres-
 sure" when it is deemed necessary to obtain information that could potentially save
 Israeli lives in certain "ticking bomb" cases. The GSS first permitted interrogators
 "greater flexibility" in applyl g the guidelines shortly after a bus bombing in Tel
 Aviv in October 1994 that killed 22 Israelis. The Government has not defined the
 meaning of "greater flexibility" or what might constitute a "ticking bomb" case. At
 roughly quarterly intervals, the Government has approved the continued use of
 "special measures." In November Israel's ministerial committee on GSS interroga-
 tions reauthorized the use of "special measures," including shaking.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) declared in 1992 that such
 practices violate the Geneva Convention. Human rights groups and attorneys chal-
 lenged the use of "special measures," especially shaking, before the Israeli High
 Court a number of times during the year. in each case, the court either rejected the
 petition or ruled in favor of the GSS.
 Israeli authorities investigate allegations of torture; however, the Government
 generally does not make public the results of such investigations.
 Most convictions in security cases before Israeli courts are based on confessions.
 A detainee may not have contact with a lawyer until after interrogation, a process
 that may last days or weeks. The Government does not allow ICRC representatives
 access to detainees until the 14th day of detention. This prolonged incommunicado
 detention contributes to the likelihood of abuse. Detainees sometimes claim in court
 that their confessions are coerced, but judges rarely exclude such confessions. It is
 likely that some Palestinian detainees fail to make complaints either -from fear of
 retribution or because they assume that such complaints would be ignored. Of the
 
 
 1705
 approximately 100 complaints filed during the year, there were no known cases in
 which a confession was disqualified because of improper means of investigation or
 interrogation.
 Israeli authorities also frequently treat Palestinians in an abusive manner at
 checkpoints. An Israeli military court ruled in September that Israeli soldiers man-
 ning a checkpoint in Hebron exercised poor judgment by refusing to allow a sick
 Palestinian infant and the infant's parents to pass through the checkpoint to receive
 medical care in a timely fashion, contributing in part to the infant's death. Israeli
 soldiers shot and killed four Palestinians at checkpoints (see Section L.a.). In Sep-
 tember an Israeli police inspector in Hebron was fired after being filmed beating
 and kicking a Palestinian cameraman during disturbances in Hebron. In October
 three border policemen were arrested and charged with shooting at a van carrying
 Palestinian workers near Hebron and injuring three of them. They also were
 charged with obstructing justice because they allegedly destroyed evidence and tried
 to cover up the incident. Israeli security forces assigned to checkpoints also often
 act capriciously in honoring permits and travel passes held by Palestinians.
 On March 3, before demolishing a Palestinian home due to lack of a building per-
 mit, Israeli soldiers tied the hands of the homeowners and their children, dragged
 them through rocks and dirt, and stuffed them into the backs of jeeps with their
 feet.
 In April the Jerusalem district court sentenced three border policemen to hard
 labor for assaulting two Palestinians near Bethlehem in August 1997, and dragging
 one of them behind their jeep. In his ruling, the judge said that the incident was
 not an isolated one.
 PA security forces abused, and sometimes tortured, Palestinian detainees. Such
 abuse generally took place after arrest and during interrogation. The PA does not
 prohibit by law the use of force or torture against detainees. In 1995 the Gaza Civil
 Police commander issued to police officers in the West Bank and Gaza a directive
 forbidding torture during interrogation and directing the security forces to observe
 the rights of all detainees. However, the directive does not have the force of law;
 Palestinian security officers have not been issued formal guidelines on the proper
 conduct of interrogations.
 PA security officials abuse prisoners by hooding, beating, tying in painful posi-
 tions, depriving of sleep and food, threatening, and burning detainees with ciga-
 rettes and hot instruments. Palestinians also alleged that they had been violently
 shaken while in PA custody. International human rights monitoring groups have
 documented widespread arbitrary and abusive conduct by the PA. Hman rights
 groups say that Palestinian prisoners frequently are tortured. Human rights work-
 ers say that many prisoners suspected of ties to the radical Islamic group HAMAS
 were abused in the aftermath of the killing of a HAMAS terrorist leader in an explo-
 sion in March.
 In March the Ramallah district court ruled that nine Palestinians who had been
 arrested by the PA's Military Intelligence Organization in 1996 for allegedly killing
 seven other Palestinians should be released because their confessions were obtained
 illegally and under torture. The defendants' attorney said that the nine were denied
 legal counsel for 4 months and were beaten, burned with hot water, tied in painful
 positions, and sexually assaulted. During the year, two Palestinians died in PA cus-
 tody, one after being tortured (see Section l.a.). In comparison, in 1997 two of the
 seven Palestinians who died in PA custody also were tortured. Despite its promises
 to do so, the PA has failed to publicize the results of its investigations or release
 the findings of its investigations to diplomats or human rights organizations.
 In August members of the Preventive Security Force beat journalists and mem-
 bers of the Palestinian Council in A1-Bireh who were protesting the PSF's confine-
 ment to their home of the family of Imad Awadallah, a HAMAS terrorist who had
 earlier escaped from the PSF's custody, and later was killed by the IDF (see Section
 2.a.).
 Israeli settlers harass and threaten Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
 Strip. In August Israeli police detained three teenage youths from the West Bank
 settlement of Kiryat Arba for harassing Palestinians, including allegedly setting fire
 to Palestinian fields and cars. In September settlers in Hebron ransacked the Pal-
 estinian marketplace and threatened Palestinians after an attack that wounded 24
 Israelis. In general settlers are not prosecuted for these crimes and rarely serve
 prison sentences even when convicted of a crime.
 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip continued to harass, abuse, and
 attack Israelis, especially settlers. During the year, members of extremist Palestin-
 ian groups killed and wounded several Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
 There were periodic reports of Israeli cars being stoned by Palestinians in the West
 Bank and Gaza and several reports that Palestinians shot at Israeli motorists there.
 
 
 1706
 Prison conditions in Israeli facilities are poor. Facilities are overcrowded, sanita-
 tion is poor, and medical care is inadequate. Palestinian inmates held strikes and
 protests in support of a number of causes and to protest prison conditions through-
 out the year. Palestinians in Israeli prisons also held several strikes to protest de-
 tention without trial, limits on visits by family members or lawyers, and abuse by
 prison officials. In some Israeli prisons, authorities now allow Palestinian prisoners
 to shower every day, whereas in the past they were only allowed to bathe once every
 several days.
 Two Palestinian prisoners died in custody during the year. On June 22, Youssef
 Diyan Al-Arir, age 60, died in Israeli custody after undergoing heart surgery. His
 family claims that his heart condition was not treated promptly and that he was
 mistreated after his surgery. Israeli prison officials claim he died due to complica-
 tions from his surgery. Israeli authorities say that they are investigating his death.
 Ahmed Asfour, age 23, died in Beersheba prison on October 4. Israeli prison au-
 thorities say that Asfour, who had been detained for 10 months for entering Israel
 without a permit, died from wounds that were self-inflicted during an attempted
 suicide.
 Israel permits independent monitoring of prison conditions, although human
 rights groups and diplomats sometimes encounter difficulties gaining access to spe-
 cific detainees.
 Prison conditions in PA facilities are very poor, although conditions in some PA
 prisons appear to be improving. The Palestinian Independent Commission for Citi-
 zen's Rights claimed that conditions in central prisons have improved greatly, but
 that conditions worsened in other detention centers. In many cases, facilities are
 overcrowded and dilapidated. Food and clothing for prisoners is inadequate and
 must be supplemented by donations from families and humanitarian groups. Pal-
 estinian inmates held periodic strikes and protests throughout the year in support
 of a number of causes and to protest prison conditions and the practice of adminis-
 trative detention. Ghassan AI-Adassi, a Palestinian arrested by the Palestinian Pre-
 ventive Security Force for allegedly participating in the killing of a HAMAS terror-
 ist leader in late March, was prevented from meeting with his lawyer for several
 months.
 Two Palestinians died in PA custody. One died after being tortured (see Section
 L.a.). On February 2, Nazir Hasan Al-Harub died while incarcerated at the Palestin-
 ian police station in the West Bank town of Dura. Palestinian Authority officials say
 that Harub, who was found hanging in his cell after his arrest, committed suicide.
 The circumstances of his death are unclear, and the PA failed to publicize the re-
 sults of its investigation into Harub's death, despite its assurances that it would do
 SO.
 The PA permits independent monitoring of its prisons, although human rights
 groups andlawyers encountered difficulties arranging visits or gaining access to
 specific detainees. Pursuant to an agreement signed in September 1996, the ICRC
 conducts prison visits but can be denied access to a detainee for 14 days. If abuses
 occur, they frequently hap pen during this 2-week period.
 PA security officials in the West Bank appointed an officer to act as a liaison with
 human rights groups. It is unclear what degree of contact the officer has had with
 the human rights community to date.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Israeli authorities arbitrarily arrest and
 detain persons. Any Israeli policeman or border guard may arrest without warrant
 a person who has committed, or is suspected of having committed, a criminal or se-
 curity offense in the occupied territories, except for areas under exclusive PA con-
 trol.
 Israeli soldiers also may arrest without warrant Palestinians and hold them for
 questioning for the same reasons. Most of these arbitrary arrests and detentions are
 for alleged security offenses. Persons arrested for common crimes usually are pro-
 vided with a statement of charges and access to an attorney and may apply for bail.
 However, these procedures sometimes are delayed.
 Israeli authorities issue special summonses for security offenses. Israeli military
 order 1369 stipulates a 7-year prison term for anyone who does not respond to a
 special summons delivered to a family member or posted in the MATAK office near-
 est the suspect's home address. Bail rarely is available to those arrested for security
 offenses. Although Israeli law does not allow Israelis between the ages of 13 and
 16 to be tried as adults, Israeli courts treat Palestinians over the age of 12 as
 adults. Human rights groups estimate that nearly 40 Palestinian minors are in
 Israeli jails.
 Israeli authorities may hold persons in custody without a warrant for 96 hours;
 they must be released unless a warrant is issued. Prearraignment detention can last
 up to 11 days for Palestinians arrested in the occupied territories and up to 8 days
 
 
 1707
 
 for minors and those accused of less serious offenses. Authorities must obtain a
 court order for longer administrative detentions-up to 6 months from the date of
 arrest. At hearings to extend detention for interrogation purposes, detainees are en-
 titled to be represented by counsel, although the defense attorney often is not al-
 lowed to see or hear the evidence against his client. Detainees either are released
 at the end of the court-ordered detention or sent to administrative detention if they
 are not indicted. If there is an indictment, a judge may order indefinite detention
 until the end of the trial. Israeli regulations permit detainees to be held in isolation
 during interrogation. Detainees have the right to appeal continued detention.
 Although a detainee generally has the right to consult with a lawyer as soon as
 possible, in security cases authorities may delay access to counsel for up to 15 days.
 Higher-ranking officials or judges may extend this period. Access to counsel is de-
 nied routinely while a suspect is being interrogated, which sometimes can last sev-
 eral weeks. Authorities must inform detainees of their right to an attorney and
 whether there are any orders prohibiting such contact.
 A number of factors hamper contacts by Palestinians in Israeli prison and deten-
 tion facilities with their lawyers, families, and human rights organizations. Israel's
 policy of transferring detainees from the occupied territories to prisons in Israel
 makes visits of lawyers and family members difficult, and in some cases, impossible.
 Israeli authorities have been known to schedule appointments between attorneys
 and their detained clients, only to move the clients to another prison prior to the
 meetings. Authorities reportedly use such tactics to delay lawyer-client meetings for
 as long as 90 days. Palestinian lawyers also have trouble traveling to see their cli-
 ents during Israeli-imposed closures. Israel requires Palestinian attorneys to acquire
 permits to enter Israel to see their clients held in prisons there. Human rights
 groups say that Palestinian lawyers from the Gaza Strip have a harder time obtain-
 ing these permits than their West Bank counterparts and that they are more fre-
 quently denied entry into Israel than West Bank lawyers. Relatives of Palestinian
 prisoners also complain that sometimes they only learn that visitation rights are
 canceled when they arrive at the prison following a trip of many hours from the oc-
 cupied territories.
 Family access to Palestinian prisoners improved slightly during the year. Never-
 theless, male family members between 16 and 40 years of age, and any family mem-
 bers with security records, are still barred from visiting relatives in facilities in
 Israel. Due to travel restrictions, the ICRC temporarily suspended its family visits
 program to detainees in Israeli prisons several times during the year.
 Israeli authorities claim that they attempt to post notification of arrest within 48
 hours. Nevertheless, Palestinian suspects often are kept incommunicado for longer
 than 48 hours. Even if an arrest becomes known, it is often difficult to get informa-
 tion on where a detainee is being held or whether he has access to an attorney. Pal-
 estinians generally locate detained family members through their own efforts. Pal-
 estinians can check with a local ICRC office to determine whether it has information
 on the whereabouts of a family member. A senior officer may delay for up to 12 days
 notification of arrest'to immediate family members and attorneys. A military com-
 mander may appeal to a judge to extend this period in security cases for an unlim-
 ited time. In a change from past practice, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled
 in July that judges, rather than military officials, can renew administrative deten-
 tion orders beyond the initial 6-month period.
 According to the Government, as of December 26, 83 Palestinians were in admin-
 istrative detention in Israel, compared with 382 at the end of 1997. Several have
 been held for more than one year. Human rights organizations say that the decrease
 is due largely to the fact that there were no major terrorist attacks during the year,
 in the past, Israeli officials arrested hundreds of Palestinians suspected of terrorist
 links after major terrorist attacks. Many Palestinians under administrative deten-
 tion during the past 2 years have had their detention orders renewed repeatedly
 without meaningful chance of appeal. However, in January Adnan Abdallah Yusuf
 Dhiyab successfully challenged his administrative detention order and was released
 from prison. In his ruling, the judge said that the evidence against Dhiyab, a Pal-
 estinian who had been held in administrative detention for over a year for allegedly
 belonging to HAMAS, was not sufficient to warrant continued detention over and
 above the time already served.
 Evidence used at hearings for administrative detentions is secret and unavailable
 to the detainee or his attorney. During hearings to appeal detention orders, the de-
 tainee and defense lawyer are required to leave the courtroom when secret evidence
 is presented. Israeli authorities maintain that they are unable to present- evidence
 in open court because doing so would compromise the method of acquiring the evi-
 dence. Detainees may appeal detention orders, or the renewal of a detention order,
 before a military judge, but their chances for success are very limited. During the
 
 
 1708
 year, a handful of detainees succeeded in persuading the courts to shorten their de-
 tentions.
 At year's end, 1,634 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were incarcerated in
 Israeli prisons, military detention centers, and holding centers, a decrease from
 3,565 in 1997. The Israeli Government routinely transfers Palestinians arrested in
 Israeli-controlled areas of the occupied territories to facilities in Israel, especially
 Megiddo militarr detention center-near Afula.
 PA security forces arbitrarily arrested and detained persons. The PA does not
 have a uniform law on administrative detention, and security officials do not always
 adhere to the existing laws in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Laws applicable in
 Gaza, which are not observed in the West Bank, stipulate that detainees held with-
 out charge be released within 48 hours. These laws allow the Attorney General to
 extend the detention period to a maximum of 90 days during investigations. Human
 rights organizations and the PA Ministry of Justice assert that PA security officials
 do not always adhere to this regulation. Prevailing law in the West Bank allows a
 suspect to be detained for 24 hours before being charged. The Attorney General may
 extend the detention period. Following terrorist bombings in Gaza and in Jerusalem
 in October and November, respectively, the PA arrested several hundred Palestin-
 ians suspected of involvement with terrorist groups in the West Bank and Gaza
 Strip.
 PA authorities generally permit prisoners to receive visits from family members,
 attorneys, and human rights monitors, except for prisoners held for alleged security
 offenses. PA security officials do not always permit lawyers to see their clients. In
 principle detainees may notify their families of their arrest, but this is not always
 permitted.
 PA security services have overlapping or unclear mandates that often complicate
 the protection of human rights. Under existing law in the West Bank, only the PA's
 civil police force is authorized to make arrests. In practice all security forces are
 known to detain persons at various times. The operating procedures and regulations
 for the conduct of PA security personnel in the various services still are not well
 developed and have not yet been made fully available to the public.
 There are many detention facilities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip adminis-
 tered by the overlapping PA security services, a situation that complicates the abil-
 ity of families, lawyers, and even the Ministry of Justice to track detainees' where-
 abouts. Security services, including Preventive Security, General Intelligence, Mili-
 tary Intelligence, and the Coast Guard have their own interrogation and detention
 facilities. In general these services do not, or only sporadically, inform families of
 a relative's arrest. Most PA security officers remain ignorant of proper arrest, deten-
 tion, and interrogation procedures, as well as basic human rights standards. Human
 rights groups continue to provide basic human rights training to PA security serv-
 ices. During the year, human rights groups provided training to representatives of
 all the PA security services, including the PA Military Intelligence Service. During
 the year, at least 430 PA security officials participated in human rights courses,
 bringing the total number of security officials who have graduated from human
 rights courses to more than 1,300 since the PA's establishment in 1994, according
 to human rights groups. The Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens
 Rights states that there has been a slight, incremental improvement in the Palestin-
 ian security services' respect for human rights.
 PA security forces continued to arrest arbitrarily and detain journalists, political
 activists, and human rights advocates, who criticized the PA and its policies. In
 March two human rights workers were summoned to PA police headquarters in
 Ramallah and kept there incommunicado for nearly 12 hours. They were asked to
 refrain from criticizing the PA's human rights practices and were released only after
 the intervention of senior PA officials. Following the signing of the Wye River
 Memorandum, PA security forces in Gaza arrested and detained for 2 hours several
 journalists who were trying to interview-HAMAS spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmad
 Yassin (see Section 2.a.). Some of the journalists' equipment, including videotapes,
 was confiscated and the PA temporarily ordered that journalists clear with the PA
 all moves to report on political and security manners. Also, Palestinian police ar-
 rested some individuals who spoke out against the agreement including Sheikh
 Hamid Al-Bitawi, a prominent Islamic scholar and preacher in Nablus with sus-
 pected ties to HAMAS, for declaring that the Wye River Memorandum was "against
 Islam." Following a HAMAS suicide bombing attack in Gaza on October 29, the PA
 placed HAMAS founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yasin in house arrest.
 Yasin was released from house arrest in late December, after spending nearly 2
 months confined to his home.
 
 
 1709
 
 Human rights organizations estimate that the PA has held approximately 400
 persons for more than a year without charge, and that the total number of Palestin-
 ians in PA jails reached over 1,000 by the end of the year.
 Neither the Israeli Government nor the PA forcibly deported any Palestinians
 from the occupied territories during the year.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Palestinians accused by Israel of security offenses
 in Israeli-controlled areas of the occupied territories are tried in Israeli military
 courts. Security offenses are defined broadly and may include charges of political ac-
 tivity, such as membership in outlawed organizations. Charges are brought by mili-
 tary prosecutors. Serious charges are tried before three-judge panels; lesser offenses
 are tried before one judge. Defendants have the right to counsel and to appeal ver-
 dicts to the Court of Military Appeals, which may accept appeals based on the law
 applied in the case, the sentence, or both. The right of appeal does not apply in all
 cases and sometimes requires court permission. The Israeli military courts rarely
 acquit Palestinians of security offenses, but sentences sometimes are reduced on ap-
 peal.
 Trials sometimes are delayed for several reasons: Witnesses, including Israeli
 military or police officers, do not appear; the defendant is not brought to court; files
 are lost; or attorneys fail to appear, sometimes because they have not been informed
 of the trial date or because of travel restrictions on Palestinian lawyers. These
 delays add pressure on defendants to plead guilty to minor offenses; if they do, an
 "expedited" trial may be held, in which a charge sheet is drawn up within 48 hours
 and a court hearing scheduled within days.
 By law most Israeli military trials are public, although access is limited. Dip-
 lomats are allowed to attend military court proceedings involving foreign citizens,
 but there have been delays in gaining admission. Most convictions in military courts
 are based on confessions. Evidence that is not available to the defendant or his at-
 torney may be used in court to convict persons of security offenses. There is fre-
 quently no testimony provided by Palestinian witnesses either for or against Pal-
 estinians on trial. Israeli authorities maintain that this is due to the refusal of Pal-
 estinians to cooperate with the authorities. Physical and psychological pressures and
 reduced sentences for those who confess can induce security detainees to sign con-
 fessions. Confessions usually are spoken in Arabic but translated into Hebrew for
 the record because, authorities maintain, many Israeli court personnel speak Arabic
 but few read it. Palestinian detainees seldom read Hebrew and therefore often sign
 confessions that they cannot read.
 Crowded facilities and poor arrangements for attorney-client consultations in pris-
 ons hinder legal defense efforts. Appointments to see clients are difficult to arrange,
 and prison authorities often fail to produce clients for scheduled appointments.
 Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip accused of security and ordinary
 criminal offenses are tried under Israeli law in the nearest Israeli district court. Ci-
 vilian judges preside, and the standards of due process and admissibility of evidence
 are governed by the laws of Israel, not military occupation decrees. Settlers con-
 victed in Israeli courts of crimes against Palestinians regularly receive lighter pun-
 ishment than Palestinians convicted in Israeli courts of similar crimes against ei-
 ther Israelis or other Palestinians.
 The Israeli judiciary is legally independent of executive influence, but in practice,
 it usually acquiesces with the government's position in security cases.
 The PA inherited a court system based on structures and legal codes predating
 the 1967 Israeli occupation. In the civil court system, cases are initially tried in
 courts of first instance. There are two appeals courts, one located in Gaza City and
 the other in Ramallah, which handle appeals from the lower courts. The appeals
 courts also function as the Palestinian Supreme Court. The decisions of the Su-
 preme Court are not always respected by the executive or enforced by the Palestin-
 ian security agencies. In 1995 the PA established state security courts in Gaza and
 the West Bank to try cases involving security issues. Three military judges preside
 over each court. A senior police official heads the state security court in Jericho, and
 three judges preside over it. There is no right of appeal, but verdicts may be either
 ratified or repealed by the PA Chairman, Yasir Arafat. The PA Ministry of Justice
 has no jurisdiction over the state security courts, which appear to be subordinate
 only to the Chairman of the PA. Two death sentences were carried out in August.
 Other Palestinians convicted by the state security courts received sentences ranging
 from several years in prison to life in jail with hard labor.
 The Gaza legal code derives from British Mandate Law, Egyptian law, and PA
 directives and laws. Pre-1967 Jordanian law applies in PA-controlled areas of the
 West Bank. Bodies of law in the Gaza Strip and West Bank have been modified sub-
 stantially by Israeli military orders. According to the Declaration of Principles and
 the Interim Agreement, Israeli military decrees issued during the occupation theo-
 
 
 1710
 retically remain valid in both areas and are subject to review pursuant to specific
 procedure. The PA states that it is undertaking efforts to unify the Gaza and West
 Ba legal codes, but it has made little progress.
 The court system in general is recovering from years of neglect; many of theprob-
 lems predate PA jurisdiction. Judges and staff are underpaid and overworked and
 suffer from a lack of skills and training. Court procedures and record keeping are
 archaic and chaotic. The delivery of justice is often slow and uneven. The ability of
 the courts to enforce decision Is extremely weak, and there is administrative confu-
 sion in the appeals process.
 The PA Ministry of Justice appoints all civil judges for 10-year terms. The Attor-
 ney General, an appointed official, reports to the Minister of Justice and supervises
 judicial operations in both the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
 The PA usually ignores the legal limits on the length of prearraignnent detention
 of detainees suspected of security offenses. The PA also does not ensure defendants'
 right to due process. Defendants often are brought to court without knowledge of
 the charges against them or sufficient time to prepare a defense. Defendants typi-
 cally are represented by court-a ppointed lawyers. Court sessions often take place on
 short notice in the middle of the night and without lawyers present. In some in-
 stances, security courts try cases, issue verdicts, and impose sentences in a single
 session lasting several hours.
 In 1997 Palestinian Attorney General Fayez Abu Rahme acknowledged that the
 PA held at least 100 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family Home, or Correspondence.-Israeli
 military authorities in areas of the West Bank under their control may enter private
 Palestinian homes and institutions without a warrant on security grounds when au-
 thorized by an officer of the rank of lieutenant colonel or above. In conducting
 searches, the IDF has forced entry and sometimes has beaten occupants and de-
 stroyed property. Israeli authorities say that forced entry may occur lawfully only
 when incident to an arrest and when entry is resisted. Authorities say that beatings
 and arbitrary destruction of property during searches are punishable violations of
 military regulations, and that compensation is due to victims in such cases. The
 Israeli Government states that it does not keep consolidated information  n the
 claims against the Ministry of Defense for damages resulting from IDF actions.
 Israeli security forces may demolish or seal the home (owned or rented) of a Pal-
 estinian suspected of terrorism withouta ta The ento seal or demolish a Pal-
 estinian's house is made by several high-level Israeli officials, inciuding the coordi-
 natr of the MATAK (formerly C      iVAD) and the Defense Minister. Residents of
 houses ordered demolished have 48 hours to appeal to the area commander; a final
 appeal may be made to the Israeli High Court. A successful appeal generally results
 in the conversion of a demolition order to sealing. After a house is demolished mili-
 tary authorities prohibit the owner from rebuilding or removing the rubble. Israelis
 suspected of terrorism are subject to Israeli law and do not face the threat of home
 demolition.
 Israeli authorities destroyed one Palestinian home for security reasons in 1998;
 in 1997 they destroyed eight.
 Since 1994 the Israeli Government has allowed owners to apply to regional mili-
 tary commanders for permits to rebuild or unseal homes closed or demolished due
 to security offenses committed by themselves or a family member after their re-
 lease-or the release of their family member-from prison. In 1998, as in 1997, the
 Israeli Government did not allow any homes to be rebuilt or unsealed; it allowed
 one home to be unsealed in 1996.
 In the Gaza Strip and PA-controlled areas of the West Bank, the PA requires the
 Attorney General to issue warrants for entry and searches of private property.
 These requirements frequently are ignored by Palestinian security services. PA po-
 lice searched homes without the consent of their owners. In some cases, police forc-
 ibly entered premises and destroyed property. In August PA security forces confined
 the family members of an escaped HAMAS militant to their home (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Israeli Government generally respects free-
 dom of speech in the occupied territories but prohibits public expressions of support
 for Islamic extremist groups, such as HAMAS and other groups dedicated to the de-
 struction of Israel. Continuing a policy it began in 1994, the Israeli Government did
 not enforce its prohibition on the display of Palestinian political symbols, such as
 flags, national colors, and graffiti, acts that are punishable by fines or imprison-
 ment.
 Overall, Israeli censorship of specific press pieces continued to be low. Israeli au-
 thorities continue to monitor the Arabic press based in Jerusalem for security-relat-
 
 
 1711
 
 ed issues. Military censors review Arabic publications for material related to the
 public order and security of Israel Reports by foreign journalists also are subject
 to review by Israeli military censors for security issues, and the satellite feed used
 by many foreign journalists is monitored.
 Israel often closes areas to journalists when it has imposed a curfew or closure.
 Israeli authorities have denied entry permits to Palestinian journalists traveling to
 their place of work in Jerusalem during closures of the territories.
 In March Israeli soldiers shot and wounded nine journalists who were covering
 rioting in Hebron. One journalist, a Palestinian who worked for Reuters, reported
 that he was shot in the back and side with rubber bullets while he was on the
 ound, after he had been shot in the head. In October, a journalist was shot in
 the head by Israeli security forces with a rubber-coated metal bullet while covering
 clashes between Israeli security officials and Palestinians.
 The IDF requires a permit for publications sold in the occupied territories still
 under its control. Publications may be censored or banned for anti-Semitic or anti-
 Israeli content. Possession of banned materials is punishable by a-fine and impris-
 onment. In 1998 Israel refused to allow publications, including newspapers, into the
 Gaza Strip on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, when Israel tightened its closure
 of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
 The PA limited freedom of speech and of the press, although it professes to toler-
 ate varying political views and criticism. In general PA authorities do not permit
 criticism ofYasir Arafat or his policies or style of government. Press freedom in PA-
 controlled areas is subject to a 1995 press law that does not adequately protect the
 press. PA security services further stifle the independence of the press by periodi-
 cally harassing or detaining media members. In May Palestinian police arrested
 Bashm Momeni, a Palestinian journalist who worked for Reuters, for distributing
 a taped interview with a HAMAS leader who accused the PA of killing a HAMAS
 terrorist leader. The PA closed a private television station in Bethlehem in February
 and several others in December for advocating policies on Iraq contrary to those of
 the PA. Palestinian security forces beat journalists covering the confinement of a
 HAMAS activist's family to their home (see Section 1.c.). In October following the
 signing of the Wye River Memorandum, the PA detained journalists for 2 hours and
 prevented them from interviewing and filming HAMAS founder and spiritual leader
 Sheikh Ahmad Yassin without PA permission (see Section 1.c.). After a HAMAS
 member carried out a suicide bomb attack in October in Gaza, the PA temporarily
 required foreign journalists to request permission to cover stories. Human rights
 groups say that Palestinian journalists, commentators, and critics practice self-cen-
 sorship to avoid problems with Palestinian authorities.
 In July the PA allowed Al-Istiqlal, a newspaper in Gaza affiliated with an Islamic
 extremist group, to reopen after the PA ordered it closed in 1996.
 Israeli-imposed closures severely disrupted the operations of West Bank and Gaza
 universities, colleges, and schools during the year. Educational institutions in the
 West Bank and Jerusalem closed for periods of time as a result of internal closures
 in the West Bank. Significant numbers of students and staff could not travel to the
 schools from neighboring towns and villages. Gaza students routinely are denied
 permits to attend West Bank universities.
 The PA has authority over all levels of education in the West Bank and Gaza
 Strip. The PA did not interfere with education in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
 during-the year; there was one instance of interference with academic freedom in
 1997.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Israeli Government places
 some limits on freedom of assembly. Israeli military orders ban public gatherings
 of 10 or more persons without a permit. Since the 1993 signing of the Declaration
 of Principles, Israel has relaxed enforcement of this rule except in cases of Palestin-
 ian-demonstrations against land seizures or settlement expansions.
 Israeli security forces killed 14 Palestinian demonstrators in violent clashes in
 May, July, November, and December (see Section l.a.).
 The PA does not impose restrictions on freedom of assembly, although it does re-
 quire permits for rallies, demonstrations, and large cultural events. These permits
 rarely are denied. In Gaza police approval is required for "political" meetings at sev-
 eral specific large meeting halls. Written permission is also required for buses to
 transport passengers to attend political meetings. In West Bank cities, the PA re-
 quires permits for outdoor rallies and demonstrations and prohibits calls for vio-
 lence, a display of arms, and racist slogans, although this is not always enforced.
 Private Palestinian organizations are required to register with the Israeli authori-
 ties in areas under Israeli control, though some operate without licenses. The au-
 thorities permit Palestinian charitable, community, professional, and self-help orga-
 nizations to operate unless their activities are viewed by Israeli authorities as a se-
 
 
 1712
 
 curity problem. In previous years, Israeli authorities have forced some Palestinian
 organizations in East Jerusalem to close because of alleged links to the PA.
 The PA placed some limits on freedom of association. There were periodic com-
 plaints during the year from Palestinian political parties, social and professional
 groups, and other nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) that the PA tried to limit
 their ability to act autonomously. In March 1996 Yasir Arafat outlawed the armed
 wings of several Palestinian political groups, including Islamic opposition groups.
 While it is not illegal to belong to the non-military components of Islamic opposition
 groups, during times of tension between these organizations and the PA, the Au-
 thority has been known to harass and even detain members of the political parts
 of these organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Israeli Government respects freedom of religion and
 does not ban any group or sect on religious grounds. It permits all faiths to operate
 schools and institutions. Religious publications are subject to the Publications Laws
 (see Section 2.a.).
 The PA does not restrict freedom of religion. There are periodic allegations that
 a small number of Muslim converts to Christianity are sometimes subject to societal
 discrimination, and harassment by PA officials. The PA states that it investigates
 such complaints, but it has not shared or publicized the results of these investiga-
 tions with any outside party. However, there was no pattern of PA discrimination
 and harassment against Christians (see Section 5.).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within The Occupied Territories, Foreign Travel, Emigra-
 tion, and Repatriation.-The Israeli Government places limits on freedom of move-
 ment. Israel requires that all West Bank and Gaza residents obtain identification
 cards to qualify for permits to enter Israel and Jerusalem. However, Israel often de-
 nies applicants permits with no explanation, and does not allow effective means of
 appeal. Palestinian officials with VIP passes 'including PA cabinet .officials and
 members of the Palestinian Council, were subjected to long delays and searches at
 Israeli checkpoints in the West Bank, even though they were traveling on special
 passes issued by Israel. In August Israeli authorities did not allow a senior Palestin-
 ian police official traveling on a VIP pass to cross through checkpoints that Israeli
 authorities set up around Hebron following the murder there of a rabbi. In general
 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip find it difficult to obtain permits to
 work, visit, study, or obtain medical care outside of the West Bank or Gaza. Pal-
 estinian residents of Jerusalem sometimes are prohibited from entering PA-con-
 trolled areas of the West Bank, and they require written permits from Israel to trav-
 el to the Gaza Strip. Residents of the Gaza Strip rarely are able to obtain permis-
 sion to travel to the West Bank, or residents of the West Bank to enter the Gaza
 Strip; this is even true of residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip who regularly
 receive permission to enter Israel. Israeli authorities permit only a small number
 of Gazans to bring vehicles into Israel and infrequently permit West Bank vehicles
 to enter Jerusalem or Israel. It is also difficult for Palestinians married to Jerusa-
 lem residents, but not themselves Jerusalem residents, to obtain permission to live
 there. A Palestinian with a West Bank identification card, for example, must apply
 to the Israeli Government for permission to live with his or her Jerusalem resident
 spouse in Jerusalem. The Israeli Government occasionally issues limited-duration
 permits and also issues a limited number of Jerusalem identification cards as part
 of its Family Reunification Program. Except for senior PAofficials, Palestinians of
 all ages crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel are not permitted to travel by
 car across the main checkpoint. Instead, they must travel along a narrow walkway
 almost a mile-long. Israelis moving into and out of the Gaza Strip are permitted
 to use their cars. According to the October Wye River Memorandum, Israel and the
 PA are due to implement arrangements in the 1995 Interim Agreement to establish
 "safe passage" to facilitate travel between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
 Israel continues to apply its policy, begun in 1993, of closure of the West Bank
 and the Gaza Strip following terrorist attacks. On occasion Israel also imposed a
 tightened version of closure in the wake of terrorist incidents and when it believed
 that there is increased likelihood of terrorist attacks or unrest in the occupied terri-
 tories. During these times, Israel tends to cancel all travel permits and prevents
 Palestinians, even those with valid work permits, from entering Israel or Jerusalem.
 Israel also may impose an "internal closure' during "an initial limited period." An
 "internal closure" prohibits Palestinians from traveling between West Bank towns
 and villages. Tightened closures, especially when in combination with an internal
 closure, severely hamper the flow of food, medicine, students, doctors, and patients
 into and out of the occupied territories, and seriously disrupt commercial activity.
 Israel imposed tightened closures before Israeli holidays, when officials claimed that
 an increased potential for terrorist attacks against Israelis existed, after security in-
 cidents in the occupied territories, and in anticipation of Palestinian unrest. Israel
 
 
 1713
 
 did not impose a full-scale "internal closure" on the West Bank during the year, al-
 though on several occasions it imposed closures around West Bank cities where se-
 curity incidents occurred.
 Israel imposed a closure on Hebron after the murder of a Jewish settler there in
 August and also in September and October as a result of terrorist attacks. During
 those times, Israel established checkpoints around the city and restricted or prohib-
 ited the passage of persons out of Hebron as well as restricted or prohibited the pas-
 sage of persons and goods into Hebron. During the closure of Hebron in August, two
 infants, one a newborn and the other a 3-month-old, who were not allowed to pass
 through Israeli checkpoints to medical facilities in a timely fashion, died. The IDF
 investigated the death of the 3-month-old infant and concluded that the soldiers
 manning the checkpoint had exercised poor judgment in preventing the infant's
 timely passage.
 Israel continued to impose periodic curfews in areas of the West Bank under its
 jurisdiction in anticipation of incidents or during what it considered high-threat
 times, such as Israeli and religious holidays. Israelis are generally free to move
 about during curfews, while Palestinians are confined to their homes. Curfews were
 imposed on the Israeli-controlled section of downtown Hebron three times during
 the year. During these curfews, Israeli settlers were free to move about while Pal-
 estinian residents were confined to their homes, and Palestinian schools and busi-
 nesses were forced to close.
 In September Israel began implementing a "continuous employment program"
 that allows selected Palestinian workers who have been approved by the Ministry
 of Defense and who are married, are over 28 years old, and have worked in Israel
 a long time, to enter Israel to work in the event of a tightened closure. Under the
 new program, these workers can renew their entry permits within a few days, rath-
 er than within the several days to weeks that previously was the case.
 The Israeli Government restricted travel for some Israeli settlers, prohibiting
 them from entering sensitive locations in the West Bank.
 The Israeli Government requires all Palestinian residents in areas under its con-
 trol to obtain permits for foreign travel and has restricted the travel of some politi-
 cal activists. Bridge-crossing permits to Jordan may be obtained at post offices with-
 out a screening process. However, some East Jerusalem Palestinians hesitate to
 travel due to fear of losing their residency permits. Palestinian males between the
 ages of 16 and 25 who cross into Jordan must remain outside the occupied terri-
 tories for 9 months. Restrictions on residence, tourist visas, reentry, and family re-
 unification only apply to Palestinian residents of the occupied territories.
 Palestinians who live in the part of Jerusalem that was occupied during the 1967
 War generally do not accept Israeli citizenship. They are, therefore, issued a resi-
 dence permit or Jerusalem identification card by the Israeli Government. Israel ap-
 plies the 1952 Law of Permanent Residency and its 1974 amendments to Jerusalem
 identification card holders. This law stipulates that a Jerusalem resident loses the
 right of residence if the resident leaves Israeli territory for more than 7 years, ac-
 quires the nationality of another country, or acquires permanent residence in an-
 other country. Such persons are permitted to return only as tourists and sometimes
 are denied entry. The Israeli Government does not apply these same restrictions to
 Israeli citizens. Israeli government officials deny that more stringent enforcement
 of the Jerusalem residency requirements reflects a concerted policy to decrease the
 Palestinian population in the city. As of August, human rights groups report that
 346 Palestinian residents had their residency permits revoked during the year.
 Invoking the 1952 law, Israeli officials routinely tell Palestinian residents of Jeru-
 salem who possess other nationalities that they have to renounce all other nationali-
 ties in order to retain the right to live in Jerusalem.
 Israeli authorities also place restrictions on family reunification. Most Palestin-
 ians who were abroad before or during the 1967 War, or who have lost their resi-
 dence permits for other reasons, -are not permitted to reside permanently with their
 families in Jerusalem or the occupied territories. Foreign-born spouses and children
 of Palestinian residents also experience difficulty in obtaining permission to reside
 with their family members.
 Israeli security authorities single out young (often unmarried) Palestinian males
 for more stringent restrictions, than other Palestinians, citing them as more likely
 to be security risks. They generally are prohibited from working in Israel.
 The PA issues passports and identification cards for Palestinians residing in the
 West Bank and Gaza. Bearers of Palestinian passports do not need special exit per-
 mits from the PA, but when leaving through Ben Gurion Airport they do require
 permits in order to transit Israel to reach the airport. They may travel both over
 the Allenby Bridge to Jordan and via Ben Gurion airport in Israel. Palestinians who
 hold Jerusalem identification cards, issued by the Israeli Government, must obtain
 
 
 1714
 
 travel documents from the Israeli -Government to travel abroad. Human rights
 groups report that Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem often do not apply for
 Israeli travel documents because they fear that their application might prompt a re-
 examination of their residency status and lead to the revocation of their identity
 cards. On request, the Jordanian Government also issues travel documents to West
 Bank Palestinians, including those resident in formerly Jordanian-controlled East
 Jerusalem. Palestinians who wish to travel to Jordan must leave their Israeli identi-
 fication documents with Israeli authorities at the Allenby Bridge.- There is also a
 requirement that Jerusalem Palestinians have a special permit to cross the Allenby
 Bridge, available for $40 (125 New Israeli Shekels) from the Ministry of Interior.
 Palestinians who are residents of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or Jerusalem, are
 not allowed to cross between the occupied territories and Jordan at the Sheikh Hus-
 sein or Arava crossings.
 Palestinians with passports from other countries are required by Israel to exit and
 enter (either via Ben Gurion airport or via land crossings) with a Palestinian pass-
 port. Israel asserts that the requirement results from the Interim Agreement. Pal-
 estinian officials dispute this interpretation and characterize this requirement as
 "harassment." When Israel tightened its closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
 during the year, the Government at times restricted the foreign travel of all those
 who hold Palestinian passports or those whom Israeli authorities deem to be Pal-
 estinians-even if they have passports from other countries. This sometimes re-
 sulted in Palestinians being unable to leave or to enter Israel. At all times, West
 Bank and Gazan Palestinians require a special permit, issued by Israel, to enter Je-
 rusalem.
 In August members of the PA Preventative Security Force confined the family
 members of an escaped HAMAS terrorist to their home (see Sections 1.c. and 1.f.).
 The PA does not control its borders. All persons entering PA-controlled areas
 must be granted permission by Israel.
 The issues of Palestinian refugees and borders are matters to be discussed be-
 tween Israel and the PA in permanent status negotiations.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Palestinian residents of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem' chose their
 first popularly-elected Government in 1996. They elected an 88-member Council and
 the Ra'ees (President or Chairman) of the Executive Authority of the Council. Yasir
 Arafat won almost 89 percent of the vote in a two-person race for Chairman. Some
 700 candidates ran for Council seats. Council members were elected in multimember
 electoral districts. As many as 35 of the elected members were independent can-
 didates or critics of Arafat and his Fatah faction. International observers concluded
 that the election could be reasonably regarded as an accurate expression of the will
 of the voters, despite some irregularities. During the year, the Council debated nu-
 merous draft laws and resolutions. Some members of the Council complained of its
 relative lack of power in relation to the executive branch of government; the Council
 and the executive authority work within the boundaries set out in the 1995 Interim
 Agreement. The Council's mandate runs to mid-1999, the end of the interim period
 set out in the accords.
 Most Palestinians in Jerusalem do not recognize the jurisdiction of the Municipal-
 ity of Jerusalem. Only a very small percentage of Jerusalem's Palestinian popu-
 lation voted in the fall municipal elections. No Palestinian resident of Jerusalem sits
 on the city council.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. There are 5 women in
 the 88-member Council, and 1 woman serves in a ministerial-level position.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violationsof Human Rights
 Many local groups-Israeli, Palestinian, and international-monitored the Israeli
 Government's human rights practices. The Israeli Government-normally cooperates
 with human rights organizations; officials normally agree to meet with human
 rights monitors. The Israeli Government permits human rights groups to publish
 and hold press conferences-
 However, some individual human rights workers have been subjected to inter-
 ference. In July Israeli security authorities aggressively questioned the director of
 a Palestinian NGO operating in Jerusalem about his organization and its work, and
 questioned employees and neighbors about the organization's activities.
 Local human -rights groups, most of which are Palestinian, as well as several
 international human rights organizations, monitored the PA's human rights prac-
 tices. The PA generally cooperates with these organizations and PA officials usually
 
 
 1715
 meet with their representatives. Several Palestinian human rights organizations
 work behind the scenes with the PA to overcome abusive practices in certain areas.
 They also publish criticism if they believe that the PA is not responding adequately
 to private entreaties. Ali Jarbawi, the General Director of the Palestinian Independ-
 ent Commission for Citizens' Rights, said in October that since the establishment
 of the Palestinian Authority, the PA has become more cooperative and is more re-
 sponsive to the organization's queries. However, PA officials are said to be less re-
 sponsive to the organization's queries on the PA's policies towards and treatment
 of members of Islamist opposition groups.
 The ICRC operates in the PA areas under the terms of a memorandum of under-
 standing signed in September 1996 between the ICRC and the PLO. The memoran-
 dum accords the ICRC access to all detainees held by the PA and allows regular
 inspections of prison conditions. In accordance with the agreement, the ICRC con-
 ducted routine visits of PA-run prison facilities and to PA-held prisoners throughout
 the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Under the complex-mixture of laws and regulations that apply to the occupied ter-
 ritories, Palestinians .are disadvantaged under Israeli law and practices compared
 with the treatment received by Israeli settlers. This includes discrimination in resi-
 dency, land use, and access to health and social services.
 Women.-The problems of rape, domestic violence, and violence related to "family
 honor" have gained greater attention in the Palestinian community, but public dis-
 cussion generally remains muted. Victims often are encouraged by relatives to re-
 main quiet and are themselves punished or blamed for the "shame" that has been
 brought upon them and their families. A 14-year-old girl who was raped in May sub-
 sequently was beaten to death by her uncle and brother to "protect" family honor,
 according to press -reports. The girl's brother is awaiting trial on murder charges.
 Women's groups seek to educate women on these problems, but women's rights ad-
 vocates claim that few resources are available to shelter the victims of violence be-
 cause women's shelters are not accepted culturally in Palestinian society. They also
 maintain that society has not been receptive to providing counseling or outreach
 services to victims of problems that these advocates see as more widespread than
 is acknowledged. According to women's groups, there are no reliable data on the in-
 cidence of violence against women. Spousal abuse, sexual abuse, and "honor
 killings" occur, but societal pressures prevent most incidents from being reported,
 and most cases are dealt with informally by family members. During the year, lead-
 ers of the HAMAS organization threatened and tried to intimidate Palestinian
 women who are involved in programs aimed at empowering women and helping
 abused women.
 Palestinian women in both the Israeli- and PA-controlled areas of the occupied
 territories endure various forms of social prejudice and repression within their own
 society. Because of early marriage, girls frequently do not finish the mandatory level
 of schooling. Cultural restrictions sometimes prevent women from attending colleges
 and universities. While there is an active.women's movement in the West Bank, at-
 tention has shifted only recently from nationalist aspirations to issues that- greatly
 affect women, such as domestic violence, equal access to education and employment,
 and laws concerning marriage and inheritance.
 A growing number of Palestinian women work outside the-home, where they tend
 to encounter discrimination. There are no special laws providing for women's rights
 in the workplace. Women are underrepresented in most aspects of professional life.
 Despite the fact that there is a small group of women who are prominent in politics,
 medicine, law, teaching, and in NGO-related work, women for the most part are se-
 riously underrepresented in the decisionmaking positions in these fields.
 Personal status law for Palestinians is based on religious law. For Muslim Pal-
 estinians, personal status law is derived from Shari'a (Islamic law). In the West
 Bank -and Gaza, Shari'a pertaining to -women is part of the Jordanian Status Law
 of 1976, which includes inheritance and marriage laws. Under the law, women in-
 herit less than male-members of the family do. The marriage law allows men to
 take more than one wife, although few do-so. Women are permitted to make "stipu-
 lations" in the marriage contract, to -protect them against divorce -and questions of
 child custody. However, only an estimated 1 percent-of women take advantage of
 this section of the law,- leaving most women at a disadvantage when it comes to di-
 vorce or child custody. Following legal protests, the PA Ministry of Civil Affairs in
 1996 rescinded a law that required women to obtain the written consent of a male
 family member before it would issue them a travel document.
 
 
 1716
 
 Children.-The PA requires compulsory education up to 12 years of age. However,
 early marriage frequently prevents girls from completing the mandatory level of
 schooling. Current British Mandate, Jordanian, and military laws, from which West
 Bank and Gaza law is derived, offer protection to children under the Labor and
 Penal Codes, While there is no juvenile court system, judges specializing in chil-
 dren's cases generally sit for juvenile offenders. In cases where the child is the vic-
 tim, judges have the discretion to-remove'the child from a Situation deemed harm-
 ful. However, 'the system is not advanced in the protection afforded children.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children among Palestinians.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no mandated accessibility to.public facilities in
 the occupied territories under either Israeli or Palestinian authority. Approximately
 130,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are disabled. Some Palestinian in-
 stitutions care for and train disabled persons; however, their efforts are chronically
 underfunded. Many Palestinians with disabilities are segregated and isolated from
 Palestinian society; they are discriminated against in most spheres, including edu-
 cation, employment, transportation, and access to public buildings and facilities.
 Religious Minorities.-There are periodic allegations that a small number of Mus-
 lim converts to Christianity in the Palestinian community are sometimes subject to
 societal discrimination and harassment by PA officials. The PA states that it inves-
 tigates such complaints, but it has not shared or publicized the results of these in-
 vestigations with any- outside party. However, there was no pattern of PA discrimi-
 nation and harassment against Christians (see Section 2.c.).-
 Section 6, Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Labor affairs in the West Bank came under Palestin-
 ian responsibility with the signing of the Interim Agreement in September 1995.
 Until a new law being drafted by PA authorities comes into effect, labor affairs in
 the West Bank are governed by Jordanian Law 21 of 1965, as amended by Israeli
 military orders, and-in Gaza by-PA decisions. The law permits workers to establish
 and join unions without government authorization. The earlier Israeli stipulation
 that all proposed West Bank unions apply for a permit no longer is enforced. Israeli
 authorities previously have licensed about 35 of the estimated '185 union branches
 now in existence. Following a-process to consolidate trade unions in the West Bank,
 there-are now 12 trade unions there.
 Palestinian workers in Jerusalem are governed by Israeli labor law. They are free
 to- establish their own unions. Although the Government restricts Jerusalem unions
 from joining West Bank trade union federations, this restriction has not been en-
 forced. Palestinian workers in Jerusalem may belong simultaneously to unions affili-
 ated- with West Bank federations and the Israeli Histadrut Labor Federation.
 West Bank unions are not affiliated with the Israeli Histadrut Federation. Pal-,
 estinians who work in Israel or Jerusalem -are not full members .of Histadrut, but
 they are required to contribute 1 percent of their wages to Histadrut. Negotiations
 between Histadrut and West Bank union officials to return half of this fee to the
 Palestinian Union Federation were completed in 1996, but funds have yet to be
 transferred.
 Palestinians who work in Israel are required to contribute to the National Insur-
 ance Institute (NII), which provides unemployment insurance and other benefits.
 Palestinian workers are eligible for some, but not all, Nil benefits. According to the
 Interim Agreement, Palestinians -working in Israel continue to be insured for injuf-
 ries occurring in Israel, the bankruptcy of a worker's employer, and allowances for
 maternity-leave. The Israeli Government has-transferred the NII fees collected from
 Palestinian workers to the PA, which is to assume responsibility for the pensions
 and social benefits of Palestinians working in Israel.
 The great majority of West Bank unions .belong to the Palestinian General Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions (PGFTU). The PGFTU acted as the informal coalition in
 the completion of the negotiations with Histadrut regarding workers' fees. The reor-
 ganization of unions under the PGFTU is intended to enable the West Bank unions
 and Gaza unions to better represent the union members' interests; the reorganiza-
 tion had not yet been finalized at year's end.
 An estimated 88,000 workers in the West Bank are members of the PGFTU, the
 largest union bloc, which is comprised of 12 trade unions in the West Bank and 8
 in Gaza. The organization has 43,455 members in Gaza. The PGFTU estimates ac-
 tual organized membership, ie., dues-paying members, at about 30 percent of all
 Palestinian workers.
 No unions were dissolved by administrative or legislative action during the year.
 Palestinian unions that seek to strike must submit to arbitration by the PA Miri-
 istry of Labor. If the union disagrees with the final arbitration and strikes, a tribu-
 nal of senior judges appointed by the PA decides, what, if any, disciplinary action
 
 
 1717
 is to be taken. There are no laws in the-territories that specifically protect the rights
 of striking workers. In practice, such workers have little or no protection from an
 employer's retribution.
 The PGFTU has applied for membership in the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The PGFTU has not been accepted as a member be-
 cause the PA is not a state, but the PGFTU participates in the ILO in observer sta-
 tus.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-A majority of workers in the
 occupied territories are self-employed or unpaid family helpers in agriculture or
 commerce. Only 35 percent of employment in the territories consists of wage jobs,
 most with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the PA, or in
 municipalities. Collective bargaining is protected. Labor disputes are adjudicated by
 committees of 3 to 5 members in businesses employing more than 20 workers.
 Existing laws and regulations do not offer real protection against antiunion dis-
 crimination.
 One industrial zone is being developed in the Gaza Strip.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-PA law does not specifically pro-
 hibit forced or compulsory labor, including by children, and there were no reports
 of such practices during the year (see Section 6.d.).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum working age in the West Bank and Gaza is 14 years. Most observers agree
 that a significant number of Palestinian children under the age of 16 years work.
 Maniy children under the age of 12 years are engaged in some work activities. Most
 of this employment is believed to involve work on family farms, in family shops, or
 as urban street venders. Some employment of children also is reported to occur in
 small manufacturing enterprises, such as shoe and textile factories. The law does
 not prohibit specifically forced or compulsory labor by children (see Section 6.c.).
 The PA's capacity to enforce existing laws is limited. It has only 40 labor inspec-
 tors to inspect an estimated 65,000 enterprises. The International Labor Organiza-
 tion and UNICEF are working with the PA to study the nature and extent of the
 problem and to develop the capacity to enforce and update child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is currently no minimum wage in the
 West Bank or Gaza Strip. The average wage for fll-time workers appears to pro-
 vide a worker and family with a decent standard of living. In the West Bank, the
 normal workweek is 48 hours in most areas; in Gaza the workweek is 45 hours for
 day laborers and 40 hours for salaried employees. There is no effective enforcement
 of maximum workweek laws.
 The PA Ministry of Labor is responsible for inspecting work places and enforcing
 safety standards in the West Bank and Gaza. The Ministry of Labor states that new
 factories and work places meet international health and safety standards but that
 older ones fail to meet minimum standards. There is no specific legal protection af-
 forded workers that allows them to remove themselves from an unhealthy or unsafe
 work setting without risking loss of employment.
