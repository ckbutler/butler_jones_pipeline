
 LATVIA
 An independent Baltic state between the two World Wars, Latvia
 was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as a constituent
 republic of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
 (U.S.S.R.). The United States does not recognize the forcible-
 incorporation of Latvia into the U.S.S.R..
 Latvia is subjected to the same centralized rule, the same
 constitution and judicial system, the same restrictions on
 civil and political liberties, and the same police controls as
 in the Soviet Union. During the second half of 1988, Latvians
 became active in demanding greater autonomy to determine their
 political, economic, and social development.
 The influx of Slavic migrants has reduced the proportion of
 Latvians in Latvia to less than 50 percent of the total
 population. In Riga, the capital of Latvia, Latvians comprise
 only 40 percent of the total population. Latvian unofficial
 groups in 1988 demanded a halt to the migration of
 non-Latvians to Latvia.
 Like the other Baltic states, Latvia in general is more
 prosperous than the rest of the Soviet Union. The continued
 use of scarce resources for unwanted and environmentally
 threatening projects, however, prompted numerous public
 demonstrations and other expressions of concern.
 The human rights atmosphere in Latvia improved markedly in
 1988 as the authorities tolerated far-reaching expressions of
 Latvian national sentiment as well as large public
 demonstrations. Human rights activists and independence
 advocates were occasionally detained in the first half of the
 year, and there was one known political trial which ended in
 acquittal. 'New unofficial groups were established, such as
 the People's Front of Latvia, which published its platform for
 increased national and democratic rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known politically motivated murders in Latvia in
 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In Latvia, as in the Soviet Union, prisoners reportedly
 continue to suffer both mental and physical abuse during
 interrogation, trial, and confinement. Life in prison
 continues to be marked by isolation, poor diet, compulsory
 hard labor, beatings, frequent incarceration in punishment
 celis for violations of camp rules, and inadequate medical
 caze.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The number of arbitrary arrests substantially decreased in
 1988. About 10 persons were allegedly detained for
 participating in the demonstrations on March 25, 1988, to
 commemorate the thousands of Latvians who were deported by the
 Soviets in 1949. At least one person, Linards Grantins, a
 leader of the human rights group Helsinki 86, was forced to
 emigrate before the demonstration.
 The late Juris Ziemelis, who served as the de facto head of'
 the Riga Section of Helsinki 86 until he died of cancer in
 December, had reportedly been detained briefly in August.
 Modris Lujans, an environmental activist, was arrested and
 charged under articles 206 (hooliganism) and 190-1 (slandering
 the Soviet State and social order) of the Soviet criminal
 code. Lujans was reportedly imprisoned from July 27 to
 September 5. A demonstrator who participated in one of the
 numerous demonstrations on Lujans' behalf was arrested and
 charged with "hooliganism." He served 15 days and was
 released but reportedly received arr apology from-the
 authorities after the Latvian cultural unions took up his
 case. Lujans was subsequently acquitted of the charges
 against him in Riga in September at a trial which his friends
 were apparently allowed to attend.
 Promised changes in the Soviet criminal code have not yet been
 made, and the apparatus of repression remains in place.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 It is difficult to say with any certainty to what degree the
 changes in the political atmosphere have improved the
 possibilities of receiving a fair trial. Scattered evidence,
 including the case of Modris Lujans discussed above, suggests
 that the judiciary in Latvia is increasingly independent
 minded. Continued Communist Party control of the legal and
 judicial system, however, undercuts constitutional guarantees
 of the objectivity and independence of the judicial process.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Through the use of informers, mail censorship, electronic
 monitoring of telephones, and other means, government
 authorities have the ability--widely exercised--to interfere
 in every aspect of personal life. Constitutional provisions
 to the contrary, Soviet investigative agencies do not abstain
 from forced entry and illegal searches. Surveillance of
 persons suspected of nationalist activity continues to be
 pervasive. Interference with telephone communications and
 mail, however, appeared to diminish during 1988.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties as long as their exercise accords with the
 strengthening and security of the Socialist system. In
 practice, the authorities tailor these constitutional
 guarantees to suit the convenience of the State. During 1988
 the freedom to criticize past Soviet leaders and policies
 
 
 1114
 LATVIA
 considerably expanded, but the authorities continued to be
 sensitive to any criticism of the present leadership.
 Nevertheless, the ability of private citizens openly to
 express opinions at variance with the official line increased,
 and previously banned topics, such as the secret protocols to
 the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Russification of the Baltics,
 and the mass deportations of Latvians under Moscow rule, were
 discussed with a greater degree of candor, particularly in the
 Latvian-language media. The Latvian Supreme Soviet
 (parliament) in September decided to make the flag of
 independent Latvia the national flag, although it must not
 interfere with the display of the Soviet Latvian flag.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Peaceful assembly is controlled by the authorities under a
 U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet decree of July 28, 1988, granting them
 the power to refuse permission to those desiring to convene
 public meetings. In practice, however, the authorities have
 been more permissive than in the past in allowing public
 demonstrations.
 Nonparty organizations ranging from the Latvian National
 Independence Movement, which promotes Latvian sovereignty, to
 the Environmental Protection Club and the recently formed
 People's Front of Latvia met regularly. Demonstrations called
 to commemorate significant events in pre-Soviet Latvian
 history drew tens and even hundreds of thousands of
 participants. The Environmental Protection Club held a public
 meeting in April to protest the planned construction of a
 metro system in Riga. Laige rallies were held in March to
 commemorate the 1949 deportations of Latvians, in June for the
 victims of Stalinism, and in August to mark the signing of the
 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which led to the annexation of Latvia
 by the Soviet Union. A 2-day congress of the People's Front
 of Latvia, attended by about 1,800 delegates and supported by
 tens of thousands of people at a stadium rally, was held in
 Riga in October without official interference.
 About 10 demonstrators were reportedly detained for their role
 in the earliest of these demonstrations, the March 25 rally
 for the victims of the 1949 deportations. Environmental
 activist Modris Lujans was arrested for his part in the
 commemoration of the victims of Stalinism and charged for
 allegedly displaying a placard juxtaposing the names of eight
 current Latvian party officials with a caption linking them to
 the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (see Section l.d.).
 The right of association is provided for in the Constitution,
 but this right has been limited by legislation and regime
 policy. After being harassed during the first half of 1988,
 human rights activists and unofficial groups were tolerated
 later in the year. The founding of the People's Front of
 Latvia in October was a landmark event. The group called for
 the radical restructuring of Latvia in accordance with the
 principles of democratic socialism and humanism, the
 democratization of society, moral renewal, and economic and
 cultural autonomy.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.

 LATVIA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Constitutional guarantees notwithstanding, religious activists
 in Latvia are subject to systematic harassment. Church
 activities are tightly circumscribed, and the party and
 Government promote atheism through all possible channels.
 However, religious services were resumed at the Lutheran
 Cathedral in Riga in October, after it had been used as a
 concert hall for 30 years.
 The Baptist minority experiences the same degree of harassment
 in Latvia that it does in the Soviet Union.  Baptist Minister
 Mukhin and a parishioner, Dr. Nikolai Romanov, were reportedly
 interrogated by the Committee for State Security (KGB) and
 threatened with expulsion because of their campaign to force
 the return of confiscated churches for religious use.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is neither provided for by law nor
 respected in practice. As in the Soviet Union, the right-to
 emigrate is not guaranteed in Latvia. Permission to leave
 continues to be dispensed in an arbitrary fashion.
 Nonetheless, the increase in issuance of exit permit- by the
 Soviet Government has resulted in the emigration of an
 increased-number of Latvian Jews.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of Latvia, like those of the Soviet Union, are not
 free to change the party and government leaders or the system
 of government. The Communist Party continues to hold a
 monopoly on political power. Nongovernmental organizations,
 such as the People's Front of Latvia or the Environmental
 Protection Club, have demonstrated an ability, because of
 their large popular base, to influence government strongly in
 certain areas. Popular sentiment in effect forced the
 Government to legalize the Latvian national flag and to
 consider the restoration of the preannexation national
 anthem. The activist stance adopted by Latvia's official
 cultural unions, many of whose participants are members of the
 party, and the presence of party members within the ranks of
 the People's Front of Latvia has blurred what was once the
 absolute distinction between unofficial and government-
 sponsored political activity. Unofficial group
 representatives have nonetheless been subjected to criticism
 by the Latvian press and are the object of KGB surveillance.
 Women in general play a limited role in the Latvian Communist
 Party and in political life.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government has created an Administration for
 Humanitarian and Cultural ties in the U.S.S.R. Foreign
 Ministry, which has carried out detailed discussions with
 foreign representatives of human rights cases in the Soviet
 Union. As a result of these discussions, additional
 information was obtained on a number of Latvians who are under
 detention, and Soviet agreement to release certain prisoners
 was obtained. The attitude of the Latvian Government toward
 
 
 1116
 LATVIA
 investigation of human rights complaints is nonetheless
 basically negative. The number of human rights activists
 being held has declined, however, and no additional people
 were sentenced to prison under the "political" articles of the
 Soviet or Latvian Constitutions in 1988.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited in the Constitution. Since its annexation, Latvia,
 with its population of about 2.7 million, has been an
 industrial workshop and trading center for the Soviet Union.
 Industrialization has been accompanied by a large influx of
 Slavic workers from the Soviet Union and has brought about a
 shift in the ethnic balance, aggravated by Latvians' low birth
 rate. The large proportion (now about 52 percent) of
 non-Latvians in the population has increased ethnic frictions
 and placed the Latvian language and culture in jeopardy. The
 last few years have seen a marked increase in Latvian
 nationalist sentiment as more Latvians have become alarmed at
 the precarious position of their language and culture.
 Latvians complain that while they must learn Russian, few
 Russians residing in Latvia bother to learn Latvian. Concern
 over the fate of the Latvian language led the Latvian Supreme
 Soviet in 1988 to establish Latvian as the official language.
 The marked increased in Latvian nationalist sentiment has
 increased tensions between Latvians and Russians in the
 Republic. There have been reports of brawls between Latvian
 and Russian high school students. Placards carried at some
 demonstrations have at times had an anti-Russian character.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, and an
 extensive system of day-care service and maternity benefits
 enables women to obtain and retain employment outside the
 home. In general, however, women hold less remunerative
 positions than men do in the same occupations.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Soviet law and practice are enforced in Latvia. There is no
 right of association as defined by the International Labor
 Organization. Although the Constitution grants citizens the
 right to form trade unions, any attempt to exercise this right
 independently of state-controlled unions is repressed.
 Workers do not have the right to strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in Latvia may not organize or engage in collective
 bargaining. There are no economic incentive zones or special
 industries in which labor standards differ from those
 elsewhere in Latvia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Most prisoners are confined to camps where they are forced to
 labor, often under harsh and degrading conditions.
 
 
 1117
 LATVIA
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum age for employment of children is 16,
 and the standard workweek is 40 hours. There is no indication
 of widespread violation of these norms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor conditions in Latvia are similar to those in-the Soviet
 Union. According to the Soviet State Statistical Coommittee,
 the average monthly wage in the U.S.S.RP. for blue- and
 white-collar workers in mid-1988 was $350 and for collective
 farm workers was $250 at the official exchange rate. The
 minimum monthly wage in the U.S.S.R. was $132. (The ruble is
 not a convertible currency, and its value here in terms of the
 U.S. dollar does not represent actual purchasing power for
 international purposes.) Although specific information is not
 available, average wages in Latvia are believed to be higher
 than average wages in the U.S.S.R. as a whole.
 The average workweek is 40 hours for most white-collar workers
 and 48 hours for most blue-collar workers. Soviet law
 establishes minimum conditions of health and safety. Press
 reports suggest, however, that the laws on maximum hours of
 work and safety standards are widely ignored.
