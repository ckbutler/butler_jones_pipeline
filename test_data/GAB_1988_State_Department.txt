 GABON
 Gabon is ruled by President Omar Bongo, the head of Gabon's
 sole political party, The Democratic Party of Gabon (PDG).
 Bongo has been reelected three times in uncontested elections,
 most recently in November 1986. The Constitution was amended
 in 1983 to provide that only the President-Founder of the
 party (President Bongo) may be the candidate for the
 presidency. In practice, presidential power is somewhat
 limited by a complex governmental structure, which includes a
 46-member Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister. A 120-member
 National Assembly has no real power. All major ethnic groups
 and regions are represented in the Government, Political
 Bureau, and Central Committee of the party.
 The armed forces comprise approximately 4,000. army, navy, and
 air force personnel. Internal security is shared by the
 Gendarmerie, a paramilitary force of 2,700, and-the National
 Police, consisting of 2,000 troops, which works with the
 Gendarmerie to maintain law and order in Librevilre, Port
 Gentil, and other provincial capitals. Uncontrolled
 immigration is of particular concern. Security forces monitor
 the presence and activities of tens of thousands of illegal
 aliens, and-sometimes, as in June 1988, conduct campaigns to
 find and deport them.
 Gabon's relatively high per capita income ($2,750 in 1987) is
 based on oil revenues, but it belies the underdevelop@d nature
 of the country and its economy. Although endowed with oil,
 manganese, uranium deposits, and vast timber resources, Gabon
 has little developed agriculture and industry and must import
 most of its food and manufactured goods. Jungle covers 85
 percent of the country, and approximately two-thirds of the
 populace lives in isolation. But the TransGabon railroad,
 completed in 1986, now connects the coastal capital of
 Libreville to Franceville in the southeast interior. The
 Government has imposed austerity measures to meet World Bank
 and International Monetary Fund program criteria, due to the
 precipitous fall in revenue from oil exports. A massive
 onshore oil field has been discovered in southern Gabon and
 should boost petroleum output by 50 percent by 1990.
 Gabon maintained tight restrictions on political and civil
 liberties in 1988, but there were no known political detainees
 or prisoners at the end of the year. In June the Gendarmerie
 rounded up almost 3,500 undocumented Equatorial Guineans.
 There were unconfirmed allegations of deaths at that time of
 persons held in custody by the security forces.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings or summary executions
 in 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of abductions or disappearances
 ascribed to government security forces or any other group.

 GABON
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Gabonese security and law enforcement officials use beatings
 as part of the interrogation process.
 Prison conditions are harsh. Amnesty International's (AI)
 1988 report notes there were reports in 1987 that a number of
 criminal suspects and alleged illegal aliens had been beaten
 and tortured at Central Prison in Libreville. Central Prison
 is described as having poor hygiene, inadequate medical
 facilities, and insufficient food.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Gabonese law protects against arbitrary detention according to
 clearly articulated judicial procedures (in the French
 tradition) which are usually observed.
 In security cases, however, the Government can detain persons
 indefinitely without charge. The Constitution specifies that
 "acts against the security of the State" and "actions against
 the Chief of State,' which can include advocating a multiparty
 system, are punishable crimes. There were, however, no known
 political detainees or prisoners being held at the end of the
 year.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control nor as a
 sentence for a convicted criminal. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The regular court system, modeled on the French system, has
 several levels: the Trial Court (Tribunal de Premier
 Instance) hears questions of fact and law in civil,
 commercial, social, criminal and administrative cases; the
 appellate level is divided into two courts, with a separate
 appeals court for criminal cases; and the highest level, the
 Supreme Court, has four chambers. Outside of the normal court
 system, there is a military tribunal to handle all offenses
 under military law, a State Security Court, and a special
 criminal court which deals with fraud and embezzlement of
 public funds by officials. The right to a fair public trial
 is provided for in the Constitution and generally has been
 respected in criminal cases. However, court officials are
 appointed by the President, who can also transfer and dismiss
 them by decree, and the judiciary is susceptible to
 intervention by the executive, particularly in political or
 security cases.
 In 1988, on New Year's Day and on the 20th anniversary of the
 ruling PDG, President Bongo commuted the sentences of first
 offenders who were not convicted of first degree murder or
 armed robbery.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government periodically monitors communications. Search
 warrants may be obtained after the fact or, as in the case of
 the Equatorial Guineans who were detained in June, not at
 all. There were credible reports that in many cases the homes
 of those detained were ransacked by security forces who
 confiscated personal effects. Membership in the ruling PDG is
 
 
 123
 GABON
 not mandatory, and Gabonese citizens' livelihoods are not "
 compromised by failure to join the party.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are restricted. Neither direct public
 criticism of the President nor advocacy of a multiparty
 political system is permitted. Individual Gabonese citizens
 with access to the President can express their views,
 including criticisms, directly to him in private meetings
 without fear of retribution. Public media--radio, television,
 and the sole daily newspaper L'Union--are controlled by the
 Ministry of Information and disseminate government views and
 communiques. The media carry copious wire service material
 (mostly Agence France Presse) which gives the public some
 coverage of world events. The President encourages journalists
 to point out failures of individual government officials or
 ministries and to highlight inefficiency and corruption.
 Foreign books and magazines containing "scurrilous" material
 have been banned in the past; but this has not occurred in
 recent years.
 Academic freedom is permitted as long as it does not entail
 public criticism of the President or of the political system.
 There were reports in 1988 that professors had considered (but
 never implemented) protest action against cuts in their
 allowances.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government limits assembly and association to recognized
 organizations. Permits and police notification are required
 for all outdoor meetings. The Government generally permits
 such meetings only if they are- organized by the ruling party
 (and its ancillary units such as the womens', youth, and labor
 movements), cultural and entertainment impresarios, and
 recognized church groups. Demonstrations are not permitted.
 Students at Libreville's Omar Bongo University went on strike
 in late April to protest the serving of contaminated food in
 the university cafeteria. The nonviolent protest and
 occupation of the university were defused when President Bongo
 met with student leaders at the palace and funded hotel-catered
 meals until new management could take over the cafeteria.
 International service organizations, such as Rotary and Lions
 Clubs, are active in Gabon.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion, and the Constitution provides for
 religious freedom. Because their activities were considered
 by the Government as fostering disunity, Jehovah's Witnesses
 and several small syncretistic sects were banned by
 presidential decree in 1970. The decree was reiterated in
 1985. As recently as 1987, the courts sentenced 24 Jehovah's
 Witnesses to short or suspended terms for belonging to a
 banned organization.
 Catholic and Protestant churches are the primary organized
 faiths; there are a few Muslims (including President Bongo)
 
 
 124
 GABON
 and numerous adherents to traditional religions. Foreign
 missionaries, including Americans, are engaged actively in
 evangelical and administrative capacities. To head off a
 schism caused by a leadership struggle within the important
 Protestant Evangelical Church of Gabon, President Bongo set up
 a high-level commission headed by the First Vice Prime
 Minister (himself an evangelical) to harmonize the differences
 between the two factions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement of both Gabonese citizens and expatriates within the
 country is not restricted formally, but travelers occasionally
 encounter gendarmerie control points where identity cards and
 other documents are examined. While Gabonese citizens may
 return freely to Gabon from abroad, they must obtain exit
 permits from the police, and government employees must obtain
 permission to travel abroad.
 There are approximately 200,000 non-Gabonese resident in
 Gabon, many of whom are from Equatorial Guinea or Cameroon.
 Immigration laws and presidential decrees promulgated in 1986
 imposed heavy monetary guarantee requirements on non-French
 and non-American expatriates working in Gabon and levied exit
 visa fees for each departure from the country. In June the
 Gendarmerie detained approximately 3,500 undocumented
 Equatorial Guineans over a 3-day period. They were placed in
 a holding camp under harsh conditions, and, according to
 unconfirmed reports, several allegedly died in custody. Most
 of the detainees were released after paying fines and bribes,
 but at the end of June over 200 Equatorial Guineans still were
 incarcerated. A few relatives of documented refugees were
 detained but quickly released, and U.N. officials subsequently
 began issuing indentification documents to all members of
 refugee families. In July the Government of Equatorial Guinca
 arranged for the voluntary repatriation from Gabon of about
 1,500 of its citizens. President Bongo accepted on a
 temporary basis 12 Iranians and 3 Turks (Kurds) expelled from
 France in December 1987 and arranged for their voluntary
 repatriation 1 month later to Spain, Great Britain, Sweden,
 and France.
 The Government encourages "regroupment"--the voluntary
 consolidation of small rural communities into larger villages
 along a road--by enhancing the delivery of public services
 such as water, electricity, and schooling in the larger
 villages.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The present political system does not accord citizens the
 right to change their government through the electoral
 process. The Democratic Party of Gabon (PDG) is the sole
 political party of Gabon. A party constitution amendment
 (March 1983) restricts candidacy for presidential elections to
 the Founder-President of the PDG. Among party members, there
 is competition for elections to the National Assembly and for
 positions on the Central Committee; but this maneuvering is
 within the party--no other political parties are permitted.
 Presidential elections are held during the 7th year of the
 President's term; National Assembly members are elected for 5
 years. The Council of Ministers, which meets under the
 chairmanship of the President or, occasionally, the Prime
 
 
 125
 GABON
 Minister, approves all government decisions proposed by the
 President. The 46-member Cabinet (reshuffled slightly in
 October) includes representatives of major ethnic groups from
 all regions of the country. This large Cabinet allows the
 various interest groups to have a review role in policy
 formulation, a share in political patronage, and a
 consultative role on national resource distribution.
 Women play a secondary role in political life. Gabon's
 Cabinet includes 1 woman at full ministerial rank-(Minister of
 Justice) and 4 secretaries of state; 5 women are members of
 the Political Bureau of the party; and 17 women are delegates
 in the National Assembly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although Gabon has not been the object of such investigations
 in recent years, President Bongo in the past has invited
 representatives of AI and other human rights organizations to
 visit Gabon. There are no local human rights groups. In the
 cabinet reshuffle of January 1987, responsibility for human
 rights questions was given to the Secretary of State for
 Promotion of Women.
 A Gabonese state counselor was elected in November 1987 as the
 first chairman of the Organization of African Unity's new
 African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights. The third
 session of the Commission met in Libreville April 18-28, 1988.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Gabon's relative prosperity has enabled the Government to
 extend health and social security benefits to all its people,
 regardless of tribal affiliation or region. Recent
 difficulties in maintaining these benefits have been due to
 severe budget cutbacks rather than to discriminatory practices.
 Women increasingly are moving into the professions due to
 educational opportunities, including in technical training
 institutions in the urban areas. Government and party
 policies are supportive. But in rural Gabon women still fill
 largely traditional roles built around family and village,
 e.g., hauling water, tending fields. The gradual introduction
 of piped-in water and electricity has had the effect of
 improving living standards for rural women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Labor unions may organize, but must be affiliated with the
 government-sponsored Labor Confederation of Gabon (COSYGA),
 which is a specialized organ of the PDG and the sole labor
 federation. It is estimated that over half of Gabon's 90,000
 salaried private sector workers are unionized.
 Under Gabonese law, the right to strike continues to be*
 seriously restricted; strikes are-illegal if they occur before-
 remedies prescribed under the Labor Code (1978)-have been
 exhausted. In November and December, utilities workers in
 Gabon's oil capital of Port Gentil staged several work
 stoppages to protest government-ordered cuts in salaries and
 
 
 126
 GABON
 personnel at the state-owned utilities company. Also, in
 December Air Gabon employees struck to protest elimination of
 their Christmas bonus. These incidents were resolved
 peaceably.
 Government employees are not permitted to belong to unions.
 COSYGA is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and maintains ties with the American Federation of Labor
 and Congress of Industrial Organizations. It participates in
 meetings of the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions in each sector negotiate with management over specific
 pay scales, working conditions, and benefits applicable to
 their industry. Representatives of labor; management, and
 government meet annually to agree on the minimum wage, which
 is determined within guidelines provided by the Government.
 Agreements reached between labor and management in each sector
 also apply to nonunion and expatriate labor. According to the
 Labor Code, workers may individually or collectively take
 complaints of code violations to arbitration and may appeal to
 labor and national courts. These provisions are respected in
 practice. Labor legislation is applied uniformly throughout
 the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law, except that the ILO
 Committee of Experts has for many years noted that provisions
 of the Merchant Shipping Code are incompatible with ILO
 Conventions on forced labor. The Government has reiterated
 that it is in the process of amending the Code.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 No minor below the age of 16 may work without the
 authorization of the Ministries of Labor, Public Health, and
 Education. It is granted rarely, and few employees in the
 modern wage sector are below the age of 18. Children are
 involved in traditional, family farm labor in the rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Code (1978) and the General Convention of Labor
 (1982) govern working conditions and benefits for all
 sectors. Labor legislation provides broad protection to
 workers. The minimum wage for unskilled labor since April
 1985 has been about $200 per month for Gabonese and about $150
 for foreigners. Owing to labor shortages, most salaries are
 much higher. These wages provide a decent living for workers
 and their families. Work over 40 hours per week must be
 compensated with overtime, and the workweek must include a
 minimum rest of 48 consecutive hours. Pregnant women have a
 right to 14 weeks of leave during pregnancy, including 6 weeks
 before delivery. The Labor Code provides for occupational
 health and safety standards to be established by decree of the
 Minister of Health. These standards are enforced by the
 Government. There has been little unemployment for Gabonese
 wishing to enter the wage economy, although it is increasing
 as the economy reacts to the drop in world oil prices.
