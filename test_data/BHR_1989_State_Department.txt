 BAHRAIN
 The extended family of the Al Khalifa has ruled Bahrain since
 the late 18th century and dominates its society and
 government. The Constitution confirms the Amir as hereditary
 ruler. The current Amir, Shaikh Isa bin Sulman Al Khalifa,
 governs Bahrain with the assistance of his brother, the Prime
 Minister; his son, the Crown Prince; and an appointed Cabinet
 of Ministers. The Government has suspended some provisions of
 Bahrain's 1973 Constitution, including those articles relating
 to the National Assembly which the Government disbanded in
 1975. There are few judicial checks on the Amir and his
 Government.
 Bahrain is one of the more heterogeneous societies in the
 Gulf, where social ties and interpersonal associations are
 formed in a complex web of family, tribal, economic, and
 religious affiliations. Bahrain is divided between the Shi'a
 and Sunni sects of Islam, with the Shi'a comprising over
 two-thirds of the indigenous population. There are important
 sectarian-divisions among the Shi'a. Despite their numerical
 disadvantage, the Sunnis predominate because the ruling
 family, supported by powerful merchant families, is Sunni.
 Two clandestine fundamentalist political groups with links to
 Iran, drawing support from some Shi'a, and two underground,
 secular, leftist groups advocate violent political change.
 Recently, there has been a splintering of the latter,
 accompanied by an increase in fundamentalist rhetoric from
 those groups supported by Iran, the main source of
 anti-Bahrain subversion and terrorist actions.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security.
 Under its auspices the police force and the Security and
 Intelligence Service (SIS), with approximately 8,000 to 10,000
 employees combined, are responsible for maintaining internal
 order and preventing sectarian violence and terrorist actions.
 Bahrain's leaders seek to foster the open social and
 commercial environment needed to attract international
 business, while protecting the ruling family's preeminence,
 preventing sectarian violence, and thwarting externally
 inspired subversion. Faced with limited oil resources,
 Bahrain has diversified its financial base, attracting
 companies doing business in financial services,
 petrochemicals, and light manufacturing. Bahrain has used its
 oil revenues to build an advanced infrastructure in
 transportation and telecommunications, and has become a
 leading xegional financial center. The economy benefited from
 the region's economic boom in the 1970's and early 1980's, but
 suffered from the decline in oil prices beginning in 1986.
 The human rights situation in Bahrain was basically unchanged
 in 1989, and-civil liberties remain greatly restricted. Major
 human rights concerns include arbitrary detention and alleged
 abuse of detainees held on security grounds, lack of fair
 -trials in security cases, and restrictions on freedom of
 speech and press, assembly and association, women's rights,
 and the right of citizens to change their government.
 Expatriate workers from developing countries tolerate limited
 trade union rights for fear of loss of employment and
 deportation.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law, and there is no evidence of a
 policy of systematic physical mistreatment of criminal
 offenders. There were several unconfirmed reports in 1989
 charging mistreatment and torture at the hands of the SIS.
 There are no reliable reports about what happens during
 detention in security prisons (where questioning may continue
 after sentencing) since visits by nongovernment persons are
 generally prohibited. In its 1989 Report, covering 1988,
 Amnesty International (AI) noted that it had received new
 allegations of physical and psychological torture and
 ill-treatment of detainees, apparently to obtain confessions.
 It said that, in a number of cases, detainees were reportedly
 made to stand upright for many hours, were deprived of sleep
 for long periods, beaten or suspended, and threatened while
 detained incommunicado and in lengthy solitary confinement.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Political activity is strictly controlled by the security
 forces, and persons are sometimes detained and arrested
 arbitrarily on suspicion of antiregi-me activity. Activities
 that could lead, under provisions of the security law, to
 detention, questioning, warnings, or arrest include membership
 in subversive, illegal organizations; painting antiregime
 slogans on walls; joining antigovernment demonstrations;
 possessing or circulating antiregime writings; preaching
 sermons with an extreme fundamentalist or a radical political
 tone; or harboring or associating with persons committing such
 acts.
 According to the State Security Act of 1974, persons may be
 detained for a period not to exceed 3 years. Detained persons
 have the right to appeal after a period of 3 months, and, if
 the appeal is denied, every 6 months thereafter from the date
 of the original detention. According to AI, some Shi'a were
 detained briefly before Shi'a religious occasions; others
 reportedly were detained after 'Ashoura (a Shi'a commemoration
 of the martyrdom of Husayn) or other religious gatherings at
 which antigovernment or anti-American political statements
 were made. In the past, detainees have sometimes been held
 incommunicado for lengthy periods, although family members can
 usually find out where the detainee is being held.
 Confessions following such detention are common. Persons
 imprisoned for political offenses are sometimes released on
 the condition that they immediately go into exile.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 
 
 1341
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A person arrested may be tried in either an ordinary criminal
 court or the Security Court. Civil trials provide procedural
 guarantees including open trial, the right to counsel (with
 legal aid available when necessary), and the right to appeal.
 Security cases, however, are tried directly by the Supreme
 Court of Appeal, sitting as the Security Court. Such trials
 are held in secret, there is no right to judicial review of
 the legality of arrests, and the court is exempted from
 adhering to the procedural guarantees of the penal code. All
 records pertaining to trials by the Security Court are
 regarded as state secrets. Sentences imposed by the Security
 Court can, at the discretion of the Court, be referred to the
 Amir for clemency.
 The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) maintains a separate court
 system for military personnel accused of offenses under the
 military code. These courts do not review cases involving
 civilian criminal or security offenses.
 Some estimates indicate that fewer than 50 persons are now
 being held for political reasons. In its 1989 Report, AI
 estimated the number of political prisoners at well over 100.
 Among them were 14 alleged supporters of the banned Bahrain
 National Liberation Front and 18 alleged supporters of the
 Islamic Enlightenment Society.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Interior Ministry can authorize entry into private
 premises without judicial authorization. Telephone calls and
 correspondence are subject to monitoring by the SIS. Police
 informer networks exist.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for the right "to express and
 propagate opinions," but in practice Bahrainis cannot freely
 challenge the legitimacy of the regime in speech or writing.
 Political meetings are not permitted; gatherings which might
 take on a political tone are monitored through informers.
 Criticism of government policies and programs in such areas as
 municipal services, unemployment, and education is tolerated
 and commonly seen in the press.
 The Information Ministry exercises wide powers over the local
 media, and the press generally follows official policy
 closely. In the past, minor deviations have brought closure
 of the offending newspapers. In 1989 an Arabic-language daily
 was closed for 3 days for printing articles found to be
 insulting to Islam; the paper reported the lurid details of a
 divorce case, which the Minister of Justice had denied
 occurred. Bahrain is generally open to international media,
 but the Government does not condone unfavorable coverage of
 its domestic affairs; it is not uncommon for the Government to
 revoke the press credentials of foreign journalists. Since
 the Ministry of Information also sponsors the journalists,
 residency permits, such actions are tantamount to deportation.
 The State owns all radio and television stations and blocks,
 As do all its Gulf neighbors, Iranian television broadcasts.
 
 
 1342
 BAHRAIN
 Only senior government officials may own and use satellite
 dishes. All newspapers are privately owned and exercise
 self-censorship in reporting on antiregime activities and in
 criticizing the Government. Former Information Ministry
 officials serve as editors of the two Arabic daily papers,
 which are regarded as semiofficial.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution affirms the right of free assembly,
 public political demonstrations or meetings are prohibited.
 Professional organizations are pernitted. The large number of
 social and sports clubs have traditionally served as forums
 for discreet political discussion. The Government monitors
 the activities of these organizations, which are generally
 small and limited in scope. Groups seeking to hold meetings
 in public places must obtain permits. Permits for religious
 ceremonies, including those of the Shi'a, are routinely
 granted.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 trade unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is overwhelmingly Muslim, and Islam is the
 state religion. Christians and other non-Muslims, including
 Jews, Hindus, and Baha'is, enjoy considerable freedom to
 practice their religion. Some maintain places of worship, but
 some small groups practice in their homes. Religious tracts
 of all Islamic sects and publications of other religions are
 readily available in bookstores.
 Proselytizing is not encouraged, and anti-Islamic writings are
 prohibited. Both Sunni and Shila sects are subject to
 government control and monitoring, but there is no
 interference with routine worship or religious activities.
 Public religious events, most notably commemorative marches by
 the Shi'a, are permitted but are closely watched by the
 police. There appear to be no restrictions on the number of
 Bahrainis permitted to make pilgrimages to Shi'a shrines and
 holy sites in Iraq. However, religious study in and
 pilgrimages to Iran are strongly discouraged. Conversions
 from Islam to another religion are tolerated.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country and change their
 place of residence or work. Passports can be denied on
 political grounds. Bahrainis living abroad who are suspected
 of political offenses may face imprisonment without public
 trial upon return'to Bahrain. Refugees are not repatriated to
 countries they have fled, but are obliged to depart Bahrain
 immediately. There are some Iranian emigres who have fled
 Iran sinue 1979 and have permission to remain in Bahrain, but
 they have not been granted citizenship. Travel to Iran,
 especially by Shi'a, is discouraged by the Government.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right or ability peacefully to change
 their government or their political system. With the
 abolition of the National Assembly, there are no formal
 
 
 1343
 BlAHRAIN
 democratic institutions, and neither political parties nor
 opposition organizations are permitted. Bahrain is ruled by
 the Al Khalifa family, headed by the Amir. -All government
 positions are appointive. About one-third of the cabinet
 ministers are Shi'a, although they do not hold key
 portfolios. The average Bahraini can attempt to influence
 government decisions only through the submission of written
 petitions and informal contact with senior officials,
 including appeals to the Amir at his regular public
 audiences.
 Four clandestine political groups agitate for change in
 Bahrain. The Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, the
 group responsible for the 1981 coup attempt, is almost
 exclusively militant Shi'a in its makeup. It calls for
 violent revolution. The Islamic Call Party advocates a
 relatively moderate form of populist Islam and demands reforms
 in the social and economic structure of Bahrain. Both have
 ties to Iran, call for the establishment of an Islamic
 ,Republic, and attract some support from the younger,
 disaffected Shi'a. Public displays of their activism have
 decreased. Two underground, secular leftist groups, the
 Popular Front-for the Liberation of Bahrain and the pro-Soviet
 National Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, have ties with
 radical Arab regimes and Arab nationalist organizations.
 Their influence in Bahrain appears to have decreased in recent
 years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No internal human rights organizations exist. No
 nongovernmental investigations occurred in 1989. AI notes in
 its 1989 report that it proposed in 1988 a follow-up visit to
 one it conducted in 1987 and that it provided recommendations
 for improvements in human rights practices. The Government
 did not respond.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 Although there are notable exceptions, Sunni Muslims enjoy a
 more favored status in Bahrain than the Shi'a, who form
 approximately two-thirds of the population. Sunnis receive
 preference for employment in sensitive positions, including in
 -the Bahraini Defense Force and the managerial ranks of the
 public sector. Statistics are unavailable, but Shila tend to
 be employed in lower paid, lesser skilled jobs. Social and
 municipal services in most Shi'a neighborhoods, particularly
 in rural villages, are markedly inferior to those found in
 Sunni urban communities. The Government has tried to remedy
 social discrimination, improve living conditions for the
 Shi'a, and encourage sectarian integration through the
 development of government-subsidized housing complexes, open
 to all Bahrainis on the basis of financial need.
 Legal rights of concern to women are subject to Islamic law.
 Specific rights very according to Shi'a or Sunni precedent, as
 determined by the person's faith. Bahraini women have the
 freedom to wear the clothing of their choice (a large
 percentage wear Western dress outside the home), to work
 outside the home, to drive a car without escorts, and to
 travel outside the country.
 
 
 1344
 BlAHRAINi
 Islamic law (Shari'a) governs the legal rights of Bahraini
 women. Specific rights vary according to Shila or Sunni
 interpretations of I.slamic law, as determined by the person's
 faith or the court in which various contracts have been
 made--as in the case of marriage. In distinction to Sunni
 women, Shi'a women do have the right to initiate a divorce and
 are, theoretically, equal to men in all other respects. Women
 of either sect may own and inherit property. Women may
 represent their own interests in all public and legal
 matters. According to Islamic tradition, a woman generally
 loses custody of her children after they reach the age of 7,
 but, in the case of proven incompetence on the husband's part,
 this is not applied. According to national custom, a
 non-Bahraini woman automatically loses custody of her children
 if shb is married to, and divorces, a Bahraini man. Women can
 obtain passports without permission of a male head of the
 household and can exit the country without permission.
 With the development of the Bahrain economy, women have
 increasingly taken jobs previously reserved for men. Women
 now constitute about 18 percent of the Bahraini work force.
 The Government has encouraged the hiring of women, has enacted
 special laws to promote female'entry into the work force, and
 is itself a leading employer of women. Generally, women work
 outside the home during the years between secondary school or
 university and marriage. Women make up the majority of
 students at Bahrain's universities.
 The status of women is a continuing subject of debate. There
 are women's organizations which have as a goal the betterment
 of the status of women under both civil and Islamic law.
 These organizations are supported by the Government.
 There is little information available regarding violence
 against Bahraini women. More evidence exists regarding
 violence against expatriate women working in Bahrain as
 domestics. Cases of domestics beaten badly enough to require
 hospitalization have been reported to the police and in the
 newspapers. Although many victims of employer violence may
 fear dismissal and deportation, cases of successful complaints
 by employees abused by their sponsor are on record.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Although the Constitution recognizes the right of workers to
 organize, there are no trade unions, primarily because the
 Government actively discourages them. Strikes are not
 permitted. In response to labor unrest in the mid-1950's and
 in 1965 and 1974, the Government encouraged--and now closely
 controls--the formation of elected workers' committees in
 major companies. Since 1982, when the Government granted
 permission to form the first Joint Labor Management
 Consultative Committee (JCC), 12 JCC's have been established
 in the major industries. The JCC's represent close to 70
 percent of the island's labor force. Nonindustrial expatriate
 workers, about 60 percent of the work force, are denied even
 these limited "rights." Bahrain has been a member of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) since 1977 but has
 ratified neither ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of Association
 nor Convention 98 on Collective Bargaining.
 
 
 1345
 BAHRAIN1
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There are no collective bargaining units or contracts. As
 noted above, in 12 key industries employing significant
 numbers of Bahrainis, the Government has sanctioned the
 formation of Joint Consultative Committees comprised of
 representatives from management and employees. These JCC's
 are empowered to resolve labor disputes, organize workers'
 services, and discuss wages, working conditions, and raising
 productivity. But the workers have no independent, recognized
 vehicle for addressing these or other labor-related issues.
 Labor law and practice are uniform throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Government prohibits the use of forced or compulsory
 labor. The press, however, regularly reports instances where
 private-sector employers compel expatriate workers from
 developing nations to perform work not specified in their
 contracts. Once a complaint has been lodged by a worker with
 a grievance, the Labor Ministry opens an investigation and
 often takes appropriate action.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14 years. Juveniles between
 the ages of 14 and 16 receive special protection under the
 labor laws. They may not be employed in hazardous conditions
 or at night and may not work over 6 hours per day or on a
 piecework basis. Child labor laws are enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Bahrain's labor law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs, provides for acceptable conditions of work for
 all adult workers, including adequate standards regarding
 hours of work (maximum 48 hours per week), and occupational
 safety and health. Minimum wage scales, which exist for both
 private and public sector employees, generally afford a decent
 standard of living for a worker and his family.
 In practice, however, expatriate workers are seriously
 disadvantaged by the requirement that all foreigners must be
 sponsored by Bahrainis or Bahrain-based institutions and
 companies in order to work. Under this system, sponsors can
 cancel the residence permit of any person under their
 sponsorship and thereby blacklist individuals so that they
 cannot obtain entry or residence visas from another sponsor.
 Such power contains the potential for exploitation since
 foreign workers are often unwilling to report abuses of their
 rights for fear of forced repatriation. Instances of
 expatriate workers being denied their guaranteed holidays,
 days off, and vacations without compensation, have been
 reported by the English-language daily, which serves as an
 unofficial ombudsman for expatriate workers. In 1989 some
 expatriate housemaids charged their employers with sexual
 harassment.
 The Government has initiated a plan to replace 20,000
 expatriate workers in the private sector. The official
 unemployment rate in 1987 was 3.2 percent; however, a Ministry
 of Labor official announced in May 1989 that the indigenous
 unemployment rate was about 10 percent.
 
 
 1346
 BAHRAfI
 Bahrain's labor law does not recognize the concept of equal
 pay for equal work. Asian workers are paid lower wages than
 their Bahraini counterparts. Westerners and Bahraini workers
 are paid comparable wages; women are generally paid less than
 men. However, women are entitled to 60 days of paid maternity
 leave and nursing periods during the day.
