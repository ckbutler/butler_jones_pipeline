 LIBERIA
 Throughout 1991 Liberia remained a nation divided into two
 parts and three armed camps as a result of the war. The
 Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), headed by
 President Amos Sawyer, represented a broad range of political
 views, but it exercised administration over only Monrovia and
 its immediate environs. About 50 percent of the total
 population in Liberia resided in this area which is totally
 within the defensive perimeter of the Economic Community of
 West African States' (ECOWAS) Cease-fire Monitoring Group
 (ECOMOG). The National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly
 Government (NPRAG), based on and supported by the National
 Patriotic Forces of Liberia (NPFL), led by Charles Taylor,
 exercised political sway throughout the remaining 90 percent'of"
 the country. The two other former warring parties, the
 Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL), led by
 Prince Johnson, and the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) were
 encamped in Monrovia. Both INPFL and AFL factions, .while
 monitored by ECOMOG, retained arms within their respective
 camps, and the INPFL sometimes acted independently. Johnson on
 several occasions killed a number of people, most of them
 members of his force.
 The economy, based primarily on iron ore, rubber, andtimber,
 was ravaged by the civil war. Gross domestic product for 1991
 was no more than'25 percent of prewar levels. U.S. and other
 Western relief agencies and nongovernmental organizations
 initiated massive emergency operations in- late 1990 to prevent
 widespread starvation in both parts of the country. Those
 operations continued through 1991.
 When compared to-the appalling civil war conditions of 1990,
 there was some improvement in the human rights situation in
 1991, especially in the Monrovia area controlled by ECOMOG
 forces. However, the Interim Government's  authority was
 limited, and all Liberian military forces committed serious
 human rights violations in 1991, including summary executions.
 The NPFL in particular detained several thousand West Africans
 throughout much of 1991, and NPFL soldiers reportedly killed
 many Krahn residents of Grand Gedeh in midyear.
 As a police force had only begun to be reconstituted in 1991,
 and only in Monrovia, and most of them remained unarmed, ECOMOG
 assumed this-function to a large extent in Monrovia. The NPFL
 policed the territory under its control, and, to a large '
 extent, both the INPFL and AFL carried out this function within
 their camps. Soldiers from the warring factions regularly
 abused their position by mistreating civilians, usually in
 attempts to.extort money and goods. Despite the continuing
 unstable security situation, there was some hope at year's end
 for a political solution following peace initiatives conducted
 by West African nations which led to general agreement on the
 need for free, internationally supervised elections in 1992.
 Implementation of the agreements is not assured. At the end of
 1991, it.was estimated that as many as 20,000 to 30,000
 Liberians may have died in the conflict and approximately
 600,000 more were refugees in neighboring countries.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Indiscriminate killings declined sharply from the previous
 year, although many incidents continued to be reported (see
 Section l.g.). Prince Johnson, the leader of the INPFL, was
 believed responsible for the killing in July of several
 soldiers of his own movement, including senior Commando Moses
 Varney. The INPFL Leader maintained that the soldiers had been
 tried under internal procedures and executed when found
 guilty. No details of the trials were made public. The IGNU
 condemned the killings. Johnson was also reportedly
 responsible for killing some civilians in September, but no
 action was taken against him as a consequence.
 According to two Liberian religious leaders, NPFL soldiers
 killed 20 Ghanaians in Sinoe county in mid-February, and in
 July several Ghanaian women from Fanti fishing communities
 informed an international organization's representative in Cote
 d'Ivoire that the NPFL had killed-their husbands. These
 reported killings continued a pattern from the previous year
 when NPFL followers allegedly killed Ghanaians and other West
 Africans in retribution for their respective nations' role in
 the conflict (see Section I.b. and l.d.).
 NPFL Leader Charles Taylor reportedly ordered several NPFL
 members executed following an aborted coup attempt in late
 August. While Taylor publicly denied there had been a coup
 attempt, he acknowledged that an NPFL officer had been
 executed, ostensibly for killing five NPFL soldiers. According
 to Monrovia's media, which claimed to have interviewed ex-NPFL
 soldiers following the failed coup, up to 75 NPFL members were
 executed (see also Section l.g.).
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances were much less common in 1991 than in 1990, but
 little new information surfaced about persons missing as a
 result of the war. Many families remained divided among those
 living in Monrovia, those in NPFL areas, and those who fled
 Liberia and have not returned. Although there were many
 returnees during the year, movement between Monrovia and the
 NPFL areas was very difficult for most people. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) began a family
 tracer program but located only about 30 percent of the missing
 persons brought to its attention.
 According to a Liberian religious leader, several Ghanaian
 children disappeared in March in Buchanan following a visit by
 ECOMOG intended to build confidence between it and the NPFL.
 The Ghanaian children warmly welcomed ECOMOG vehicles, some
 manned by Ghanaian soldiers. This affectionate display was
 said to have enraged some NPFL soldiers who were believed
 responsible for the children's disappearance shortly
 thereafter.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 During the height of the civil war, many members of the three
 warring factions rampantly indulged in acts of inhumanity.
 
 
 201
 LIBERIA
 Abuses in 1991 declined sharply but cases of inhuman treatment
 continued. The most widely pub .cized incident occurred in
 February when INPFL forces infl -ted inhuman treatment on nine
 members of the IGNU, including a cabinet minister-designate and
 several members of the Interim Legislative Assembly. They were
 stripped and flogged, and one was forced to sit in a mound of
 driver ants while another was made to lick feces. Under
 pressure from ECOMOG, the ICRC, and the Interim Government,
 INPFL Leader Johnson released the detainees, excusing his
 actions as necessary to call attention to alleged ECOMOG abuse
 of INPFL soldiers.
 Prior to the 1989 civil war, conditions in the nation's jails
 were inhuman and hazardous to life and health. Prisoners were
 often denied access to family and medical care; cells were
 small, crowded, and filthy. Conditions at the notorious,
 maximum security facility at Belle Yella had long been of
 concern.
 During 1991 none of Liberia's prewar prisons were believed to
 be still functioning, although the IGNU was ireported to be
 refurbishing one in Monrovia. NPFL Leader Charles Taylor
 announced in March that the Belle Yella Prison would be
 closed. He directed that its remaining prisoners be
 transferred to their respective counties for retrial. There
 was no information about the results of the transfer order.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were few juridical protections to prevent arbitrary
 arrest, even in the ECOMOG-controlled areas, as the INPFL
 detention and abuse of nine Interim Government members for 3
 days in February demonstrated (Section l.c.). In theory the-
 1985 Constitution provides specific legal safeguards for the
 rights of the accused, including warrants for arrests and 'the
 right of detainees to be charged or released within 48 hours.
 Even before the civil war, these rights were frequently
 violated, particularly in cases allegedly involving national
 security. The Interim President repeatedly affirmed that his
 Government would respect the 1985 Constitution and its
 procedural safeguards, and in practice attempted to do so. In
 late 1990, the IGNU outlawed the use of military stockades for
 detaining civilians, a practice common under the previous
 regime.
 Early in 1991, undisciplined elements of the AFL on occasion
 detained and threatened civilians deemed to be "rebel
 sympathizers." After AFL commanders called for greater
 discipline and in July formed a I' rd of inquiry to investigate
 citizens' complaints of abuse, there appeared to have been some
 lessening of AFL abuses.
 NPFL forces detained up to 4,000 West African nationals,
 primarily Nigerians and Ghanaians, behind NPFL lines during
 much of 1991. The NPFL forces viewed the West Africans as
 enemies and reportedly executed many in reprisal against
 ECOMOG, which fought the NPFL in October-November 1990. In
 March NPFL Leader Charles Taylor "released" the West Africans
 from the detention camps but prohibited them from-traveling to
 Monrovia or crossing into neighboring countries. Approximately
 300 to 500 Nigerians as well as a number of Ghanaians
 eventually managed to make their way in small groups to
 Monrovia. In late August, the NPFL announced "the first phase
 of the repatriation process" for West Africans and allowed over
 100 Nigerians to cross safely into Cote d'Ivoire. The ICRC
 
 
 202
 LIBERIA
 assisted in the repatriation, and the Nigerians were followed
 by several other groups, including Ghanaians and other West
 Africans.
 Following the September incursion by anti-NPFL Liberians into
 western Liberia from Sierra Leone after an earlier NPFL
 invasion into Sierra Leone, the NPFL forcibly detained 4
 Western and 35 Liberian relief personnel working in the area,
 accusing them of being "spies." In response the U.N. and
 nongovernmental relief agencies suspended all relief operations
 in NPFL areas until the detainees were freed. While the 4
 Western nationals were released 2 days later, the 35 Liberians
 were held fog another 8 days.
 A'number of other foreigners were detained by the NPFL for
 varying periods; all were eventually released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The structure of Liberia's legal system is closely modeled on
 that of the United States, with the Supreme Court at its apex.
 In practicebefore the civil war, the system afforded little
 protection for defendants due to corruption among court
 officials, lack of training, and inordinate executive
 interference. By mid-1990, the system had completely collapsed
 along with the rest of civil authority, with justice in the
 hands of military commanders of the warring factions. Many
 public records in Monrovia, including those of the courts,
 churches, and schools were looted and badly damaged during the
 civil war. The registrar of public records estimated that over
 80 percent of national record holdings were damaged, and 30 to
 40 percent destroyed.
 The IGNU began in 1991 slowly to reconstitute the court
 system. Early in the year, it reestablished several
 magistrate's courts in Monrovia, and in September swore new
 circuit court judges into office. The IGNU, in an
 unprecedented move, asked the Bar Association to recommend
 candidates for judgeships. At the end of September, following
 new West African peace initiatives, the IGNU and NPFL agreed
 upon the composition of a five-member ad hoc Supreme Court.
 The Court's stated purpose is to adjudicate electoral disputes,
 but the full scope of its jurisdiction is still undecided. At
 the end of the year, the Court had not yet been inaugurated.
 In the areas under NPFL control, legal and judicial protections
 were almost totally lacking. There were reports that the
 authorities imposed capital punishment for armed thefts.
 Another report said the NPFL executed suspected murderers after
 "tribunal trials in life-for-life retributive justice."
 Another source reported that armed robbery was discouraged in
 NPFL areas because "the death penalty is automatic."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Serious abuses of privacy by soldiers of all three forces
 continued in 1991 although not on the scale of 1990. AFL
 soldiers committed many armed robberies in the downtown
 Monrovia area, including seizure of several vehicles assigned
 to Interim Legislative Assembly members. They also illegally
 occupied some private homes. The.AFL brigade commander
 publicly requested citizens to report abuses by AFL soldiers to
 the proper authorities and ordered-.soldiers to respect the
 rights of civilians but with only marginal effect. Only when
 
 
 203
 LIBERIA
 ECOMOG increased its patrols in downtown areas at midyear did
 the situation improve somewhat, but abuses continued throughout
 the year.
 The situation was worse in NPFL-held areas. According to
 Liberians who returned to Monrovia from Lofa County, NPFL
 soldiers regularly demanded food and personal possessions from
 village residents and often robbed and abused citizens. To
 escape the harassment, many Liberians moved their families to
 remote areas. Soldiers assigned to checkpoints demanded money
 and goods for passage, from both Liberians and expatriate
 relief workers.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Following the November 1990 cease-fire, fighting between the
 three warring factions and the use of excessive force against
 civilians-sharply declined but did not end.
 Perhaps the largest number of deaths occurred between July and
 August when the NPFL moved through Grand Gedeh County.
 According to survivors interviewed by the Western media and
 human rights groups in Cote d'Ivoire, as many as 1,500 people,
 mostly of the Krahn ethnic group of former president Samuel
 Doe, may have died. Others interviewed stated that the NPFL
 entered their villages shooting indiscriminately. Independent
 observers who visited the area confirmed that entire villages
 were destroyed and that many inhabitants.had fled into the bush.
 There were many other instances of the use'of excessive force
 and violations of humanitarian law during the year. In January
 over 1,000 new refugees, mostly Krahn, fled to refugee camps in
 Tai, Cote d'Ivoire. They reported that the NPFL was conducting
 secret killings, raping women, looting homes, and stealing
 cattle. In July-August, approximately 10,000 people, mostly
 Krahns, fled across the border to Cote d'Ivoire reporting that
 the NPFL had attacked their villages, indiscriminately killing
 men, women, and children. Independent observers reported
 seeing jailed Krahns in chains.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There was increased freedom of speech and press in 1991,
 especially in Monrovia. However, people still had to be
 careful in criticizing the various factions. Although NPFL
 leader Charles Taylor affirmed publicly on several occasions
 that his government supported free speech and criticism, both
 Liberians and expatriates have been detained by his supporters
 for comments made about the NPFL.
 There was no press censorship in Monrovia, and the number of
 newspapers in Monrovia grew rapidly, with as many as 13
 separate newspapers reflecting a variety of opinion being
 published at different times in 1991. A shortage of newsprint,
 however, reduced this number by the end of the year. Unlike
 the previous Doe regime, the Interim Government did not publish
 its own newspaper. The INPFL sponsored a newspaper, The
 Scorpion, with articles highly favorable to Prince Johnson and
 the INPFL. The NPFL printed a monthly newspaper, The Patriot,
 which was also sold in Monrovia but which stopped publication
 late in the year. In December two newspapers describing
 
 
 204
 LIBERIA
 themselves as independent appeared in Gbarnga, capital of
 NPFL-controlled territory.
 Press freedom was not complete even in Monrovia. For example,
 ECOMOG reacted negatively to an article published in May by The
 Inquirer which alleged complicity by the ECOMOG field commander
 with a reputed arms merchant. The editor was briefly detained
 and asked to reveal the source of his information, which he
 refused to do. As a result of this incident, the Interim
 Government publicly called upon the press to be more
 responsible in its reporting. This, in turn, was publicly
 criticized by the Press Union of Liberia which claimed it had
 "an intimidating" effect on the press.
 The Interim Government supported a shortwave radio station
 (ELBC), and its broadcasts from Monrovia were heard across most
 of the country. ELBC news reports were generally favorable to
 the IGNU. The Catholic Church-operated FM radio station,
 previously shut down by the Doe Government, resumed operations
 in May. The NPFL operated three radio and two television
 stations in its areas. NPFL news programs supported Charles
 Taylor and the NPFL, while discussing economic and social
 problems in NPFL territory. The NPFL's FM station, part of
 whose appeal is the current American music it broadcasts,
 acquired increased power in October and can now be heard by the
 majority of Liberians, including those in Monrovia.
 When Monrovian journalists accompanied ECOMOG in May to the
 opening of the NPFL's legislative assembly in Gbarnga, a senior
 NPFL military leader, who later was appointed its chief of
 staff, attempted to detain two reporters and confiscate their
 equipment for having interviewed local residents. He also
 attempted to arrest a Monrovia radio reporter for "treason" for
 having broadcast news about Interim President Sawyer. ECOMOG
 press officers intervened to prevent the arrest.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In 1991 political parties and other groups in Monrovia were
 able to organize and to hold public meetings.  New political
 organizations appeared, including the True Whig Party which
 Samuel Doe had outlawed shortly after seizing power in 1980.
 Under IGNU sponsorship, a coalition of organizations held a
 mass rally in August attended by up to 5,000 people to show
 public support for the ECOMOG peacekeeping effort.
 Freedom of assembly and association was generally more
 restrictive in NPFL areas than in Monrovia. For instance, none
 of the prewar political parties were known to have reorganized
 or to have held public meetings during 1991 in NPFL areas.
 According to Western and Monrovian press reporters on the
 scene, some Liberians in NPFL areas who greeted ECOMOG soldiers
 during the initial confidence-building visits in March with
 chants of "we want Taylor," later spontaneously broke out into
 chants of "we want peace" and "we want ECOMOG." Some reporters
 stated that the people had been forced to assemble and chant
 pro-NPFL slogans and that many were later punished for their
 praise of ECOMOG. One Western news service reported five
 people died from NPFL beatings following ECOMOG visits to
 Kakata and Buchanan. However, NPFL justibe minister Laveli
 Supuwood dismissed the reports as "malicious."
 
 
 205
 LIBERIA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The 1985 Constitution states that freedom of religion is a
 fundamental right'of all"Liberian'citizens, and in practice
 there are'no-restrictions in Monrovia on freedom of worship.
 There is nb established state religion. Christianity has long
 been the religion of the political and economic elite, while
 the majority-of the rural population continues to follow
 traditional religions. Muslims account for about 20 percent of
 the population. Mandingos, who are predominantly Muslim, were
 targeted during the civil'war by the NPFL as being pro-Doe, and
 most mosques were closed in NPFL territory during the war.
 However, other Liberian Muslims did not receive the same
 treatment, and the action against the Mandingos was based
 primarily on ethnic/political considerations rather than an
 effort to repress religious freedom.
 d., Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 While the Constitution provides every percon the right to move
 freelythroughout Liberia and to -leave or enter the country at
 will, the previous:Doe regime required exit visas for those
 wishing to leave the country, and it maintained a "black list"
 of those who were not permitted to depart. The Interim
 Government announced in March that it was abolishing this
 "unconstitutional" policy.
 Throughout the year reuniting families and returning displaced
 persons were hampered by NPFL checkpoints, which made travel
 very difficult on roads in and out of Monrovia. The NPFL
 required employees of.the various international relief agencies
 to have passes approved monthly. -In spite of difficulties,
 many Liberians transited the lines, often by paying bribes or
 using guile to reach ECOMOG- controlled areas. During the
 period April-September, nearly 60,000 moved to Monrovia through
 these means.
 Because of'civil war abuses, appr6ximately 600,000 Liberians,
 about 20 percent of the prewar population, remained as refugees
 in nearby countries, mostly in Cote D'Ivoire and Guinea.
 Smaller numbers are in Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Nigeria.
 Following the NPFL incursion into Sierra Leone in March, the
 125,000 Liberians'who had originally sought refuge near the
 border in Sierra Leone were forced to flee to safer areas in
 that country, or to Guinea or NPFL-held territory in Liberia.
 Many who reached Sierra Leone's cdapital subsequently returned
 to Monrovia by ship. Some refugees have also repatriated to
 Liberia from Guinea, Cote d'IVoire, Ghana, and Nigeria. The
 NPFL incursion also put Sierra Leonians to flight, and a
 reported 12,000 sought refuge inside Liberia near the border at
 Cape Mount.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Despite constitutional and legal guarantees of free and fair
 elections, Liberians could not exercise their right to change
 their government in 1991. However, there was limited progress
 in the search for new political formulas to restore unity under
 popularly elected leadership. In March-April, a second
 All-Liberia Conference (ALC) occurred in Monrovia (the first
 was held in August 1990 in The Gambia). The NPFL initially #
 participated, but later withdrew. The second ALC created a new
 
 
 206
 LIBERIA
 Interim Legislative Assembly (ILA). The six political parties
 and the NPFL selected representatives according to their own
 internal procedures, while the county representatives were
 selected informally from among members of the respective
 communities resident in Monrovia. Two seats were also allotted
 to the country's 18 registered interest groups, and filled by
 leaders from the Teachers' Association and the Trade Union
 Federation. In August the INPFL representatives resigned from
 the ILA after their leader, Prince Johnson, withdrew his
 support for the Interim Government. (The NPFL maintained its
 separate legislature, The National Patriotic Reconstruction
 Assembly, in Gbarnga.) The second ALC reaffirmed through a
 more widely based conference the interim administration which
 had resulted from the first ALC at Banjul. The IGNU is a
 relatively broad-based government with representation from the
 major political parties. Amos Sawyer was originally chosen
 President by the participants at the first ALC, and he was
 reaffirmed in that office by the participants in the second ALC.
 Neither the legislature in Monrovia nor that in Gbarnga was
 truly representative. However, the ILA in Monrovia purported
 to function as a separate branch of government and both
 confirmed and rejected IGNU appointees following public
 confirmation hearings. It also subpoenaed members of the
 executive to explain the actions of the Interim Government. In
 contrast, the NPFL legislature was generally viewed as
 subservient to NPFL leadership views.
 Following a new series of peace initiatives during the second
 half of 1991, conducted by the heads of numerous West African
 nations in Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire, the Interim Government
 in Monrovia and the NPFL in Gbarnga agreed to hold free and
 fair elections which, if the process continued, were expected
 to take place during the first half of 1992. Under the
 Yamoussoukro formula, the three warring factions would encamp
 and disarm their military forces under ECOMOG supervision.
 Subsequently an elections commission and an ad hoc Supreme
 Court were established by IGNU and the NPFL, and the members
 were appointed by mutual agreement. The electoral commission
 held its first meeting on December 31 and was formally sworn in
 several days later. By year's end, the ad hoc Supreme Court
 had not yet met.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 On numerous occasions, Interim Government President Sawyer
 declared the IGNU's commitment to human rights. Two fledgling
 human rights groups formed in 1991 and conducted public
 meetings and other activities. One issued the first of what it
 hopes will become a regular publication on human rights. The
 attitude of the NPFL government was not clear. Its conduct to
 date has been less than exemplary. One human rights
 organizations based in NPFL territory was established in 1991.
 In August a representative of Africa Watch visited Monrovia and
 later successfully traveled to NPFL areas. However, a
 delegation of the New York-based Lawyers' Committee on Human
 Rights, which also visited Monrovia in August, did not go to
 NPFL areas because an NPFL escort failed to meet the delegates
 as previously arranged.
 
 
 207
 LIBERIA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 The roots of the civil conflict can be found in the historical
 division between the Americo-Liberians, who for over 150 years
 dominated the political, economic, and cultural life of the
 country, and the ethnic groups in the interior. The latter
 frequently complained of government discrimination in many
 areas, such as access to education and civil service jobs and
 to infrastructure development. The coup mounted by Sergeant
 Doe and other noncommissioned officers in 1980 was seen as a
 revolution, with the interior groups taking power from the
 Americo-Liberian elites. However, Doe's authoritarian,
 military-based regime exacerbated ethnic tensions while
 subverting the democratic reform process, exemplified in the
 1985 Constitution, through rigged elections. During the Doe
 regime, resentment grew over domination by, and government
 favoritism toward, his tribe, the Krahns.
 The 1985 Constitution prohibited discrimination based on ethnic
 background, race, sex, creed, place of origin or political
 opinion. However, it also provides that only "persons who are
 Negroes or of Negro descent" may be citizens or own land,
 denying full rights to many who have lived their lives in
 Liberia. There was no indication that this prohibition had
 been relaxed by either Monrovia's Interim Government or
 Gbarnga's NPFL government.
 The status of women in Liberian society varies by region, with
 women holding some skilled jobs, including cabinet-level
 positions, in both the IGNU and NPFL Governments. In urban
 areas and along the coast, women can inherit land and
 property. In rural areas, where traditional customs are
 stronger, a woman is normally considered the property of her
 husband and his clan and is not usually entitled to inherit
 from her husband. Women in rural areas are responsible for
 much of the farm labor and have had only limited access to
 education. According toa recent U.N. study, females in
 Liberia receive only about 28 percent of the schooling given to
 males. In the massive violence inflicted on civilians during.
 the conflict, women have suffered the gamut of abuses,
 especially rape. Even prior to the war, domestic violence
 against women was extensive but never seriously addressed by
 the Government or women's groups as an issue. There were no
 statistics on domestic violence against women, but it was
 considered to be-fairly common. Female circumcision was, and
 almost certainly still is, widely practiced in rural areas.
 During the height of the civil war, a person's language was
 used to identify him or her by ethnic group. Those from groups
 considered hostile frequently were summarily executed. The
 cease-fire in late 1990 stopped most of these abuses. However,
 NPFL reprisals against the Krahn, particularly in Grand Gedeh,
 continued well into 1991 (see Section l.g.).
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution states that workers have the right to
 associate in trade unions. Over 20 trade unions were
 registered with the Ministry of Labor before the civil war,
 representing roughly 15 percent of the work force in the wage
 economy. Ten national unions were members of the Liberian
 Federation of Labor Unions (LFLU). However, the actual power
 
 
 208
 LIBERIA
 these unions exercised was limited. The previous government
 did not recognize the right of civil servants or employees of
 public corporations to unionize or strike. Like virtually all
 other organized activity in the country, unions disappeared
 during the height of the war in mid-1990, and union activity
 remained limited in 1991. While some large-scale operations
 involving rubber and other extractive industries partially
 resumed in NPFL areas, it is not known if union activity
 associated with these industries resumed.
 In April 1990, the U.S. Trade Representative announced that
 Liberia's status as a beneficiary of trade preferences under
 the Generalized System of Preferences program had been
 suspended as a result of the Doe government's failure to take
 steps to provide internationally recognized worker rights. The
 suspension remained in effect throughout 1991.
 Labor unions have traditionally affiliated with international
 labor groups.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In 1991 workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively
 were moot because of the lack of economic enterprise,
 especially in Monrovia where only a few businesses resumed
 operations, usually with reduced staffing. With the important
 exception of civil servants and employees of public
 corporations, prior to the civil war workers enjoyed the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Labor laws had the same
 force in Liberia's one export processing zone as in the rest of
 the country.
 The 1991 report of the Committee of Experts (COE) of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) reiterated that Liberian
 labor legislation fails to provide workers adequate protection
 against discrimination and reprisals for union activity, fails
 to protect workers' organizations against outside interference,
 and does not give eligible workers in the public sector the
 opportunity to bargain collectively.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor, but even before the
 civil war this prohibition was widely ignored in rural areas,
 where farmers were pressured into providing free labor on
 "community projects" which often benefited only local leaders.
 Forced labor was used by some or all of the warring factions
 during the civil war, especially for moving equipment and
 supplies. Some vestiges persisted in 1991; for example, a
 local newspaper reported that following the incursion into
 Sierra Leone in March, the NPFL used forced labor in Lofa
 County to move supplies to the border. According to the same
 source, forced labor was also used to clean up several major
 towns in Lofa County. There was at least one report of the
 NPFL forcing local villagers to set up a communal farm to feed
 its soldiers, also in Lofa County.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under the Doe government, the law prohibited employment of
 children under age 16 during school hours in the wage sector.
 Enforcement by the Ministry of Labor, however, was very
 limited. Even before the civil war, small children continued
 to assist their parents as vendors-in local markets and on

 LIBERIA
 INPFL recruited yQung children,- some less than 12 years of age,
 as soldiers. Many of these children had been orphaned during
 the war. Whilq some children remained under arms, neither
 group was believed to have recruited additional children as
 soldiers in 1991.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor law provides for a minimum wage, paid leave,
 severance benefits, and safety standards. Before the economy
 collapsed, the legal minimum wage varied according to
 profession but still did not provide a decent standard of
 living for a worker and his family and had to be supplemented
 by other sources of income, including subsistence farming.
 There had also been health and safety standards, in theory
 enforced by the Ministry of Labor. In view of the low level of
 economic activity in divided Liberia during 1991, these various
 regulations were not adhered to by many employers, and there
 was no attempt at enforcement.
