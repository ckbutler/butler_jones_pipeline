 INDONESIA
 Indonesia, the world's fifth most populous nation, contains
 a wide diversity of ethnic, social, linguistic, religious
 -and geographic groups. The government stresses national
 unity through a secular political philosophy. The themes
 of public policy emphasize independence, economic develop-
 ment, public order and nationalism.
 Indonesia became an independent constitutional democracy in
 1945. After only one election, the government became
 increasingly authoritarian under Indonesia's first President,
 Sukarno, with power divided among the president, the army,
 and the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). The unsuccessful
 attempt of the PKI to seize Power by force in 1965 set off
 a chain of traumatic events which culminated in the formal
 transfer of power from Sukarno to the current president,
 Suharto, in 1967. The 1965 events and their accompanying
 turmoil were a watershed event and influence the perceptions
 of the nation's current leaders and public. Indonesia
 currently has a limited representative government dominated
 by the military. Two of the three national elections since
 independence have been held by the current government.
 During 1980, there were significant human rights develop-
 ments in a number of fields. There has been a mushrooming
 of private groups concerned with focusing more public
 attention tbroughout Indonesia on the preservation and
 improvement of civil and human rights. Student dissident
 trials were completed with minimum sentences and little, if
 any, jail time to be served. Of the 23 Class A political
 detainees (those charged with the most serious offenses
 including murder) remaining in 1980 from the 1965 abortive
 coup attempt, 22 cases have reportedly been completed by the
 court. Expedited action was taken by presidential decree on
 Indonesian citizenship papers or naturalization for the
 ethnic Chinese minority. Indochinese refugees continued
 to be accepted into the Galang Island refugee center.
 The humanitarian relief operation by international organi-
 zations in East Timor obtained its primary goals and the
 government initiated a comprehensive development program
 for this historically under-developed area. The economic
 growth rate for Indonesia remained an impressive 7.5 percent.
 Remaining human rights issues include: the government's
 broad powers of detention without charges or trial and its
 use of indirect pressure on dissidents and the press;
 the reintegration of former political prisoners into
 society; the draft criminal procedures law (to replace
 still existing colonial lawsl, which is still being
 debated by parliament; the need to improve prison treatment
 and conditions; allegations about disappearances and other
 human rights abuses in East Timor; and the continuing
 struggle for more rapid progress in resolving economic
 problems such as income disparities, unemployment, and
 corruption.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Indonesia's legal codes make no specific reference to
 torture or cruel punishment. According to human rights
 lawyers, the legal restriction against it is derived
 
 
 601
 through legal interpretation of the "presumption of
 innocence" clause in Chapter 1 or paragraph 8, Law 14
 of 1970. Some former detainees and their lawyers have
 over the years alleged beatings and other abuse of accused
 criminals and of some political dissidents, particularly
 PKI (Indonesian Communist Party) and extremist Muslims.
 Charges of torture or brutality over the past year related
 for the most part to prisoners held for alleged terrorist
 acts or affiliation with alleged Muslim subversive groups in
 Sumatra. In August, the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute
 (LBH) charged that as the result of torture three detainees
 in Medan, picked up in a drive to combat rising urban crime,
 died either in or after release from a detention institution.
 These charges were denied by responsible authorities;
 inquiries into these cases are continuing.
 Since 1978, Minister of Defense Jusuf has taken a strong
 position against abuses of prisoners and has suggested
 reform measures aimed at protecting the rights of detainees.
 There has been greater public attention to allegations of
 wrongdoing and International Red Cross inspections of
 prisons have continued. Some of the old detention centers
 in Jakarta have been closed. The 1979 release of Category
 B detainees also resulted in the closedown of some of the
 outer island detention centers, such as Buru Island, which
 had been the subject of international cr iticism.
 Indonesian human rights groups believe there has been a
 trend toward better treatment of prisoneis. They credit the
 public statements of General Jusuf and other key officials
 for sensitizing lower ranking officials in this regard.
 Lapses in treatment of prisoners do occur, however, and
 there are variations of attitudes by locality.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Overcrowded conditions, minimal food, inadequate prison
 budgets and occasional mixing of political detainees with
 ordinary criminals have given rise to charges of abuse.
 Student detainees generally enjoy special facilities, as
 do certain other classes of political prisoners. Separate
 detention facilities are maintained for women.
 There have also been allegations of inhumane treatment of
 prisoners in detention camps in East Timor. The Indonesian
 government does not yet permit Red Cross inspection of
 detainee centers in East Timor.
 There have been no reported incidents of summary executions
 over the past year. Capital punishment is implemented
 sparingly. At least 22 prisoners, sentenced to death for
 participation in the abortive communist coup attempt in
 1965, including former Foreign Minister Subandrio and Air
 Force Chief of Staff Omar Dhani, remain in prison with their
 sentences held in abeyance. When early in the year two
 common criminals convicted of multiple murders were executed
 by firing squad, the first executions in two years, reaction
 was such that a public drive for the abolition of capital
 punishment gained wide support, including that of Vice
 President Malik. Traditional Islamic corporal punishments
 are not permitted under Indonesian law.
 
 
 602
 c. Disappearances
 Disappearances have been reported in East Timor and among
 persons thought to be members of extremist Muslim groups
 classified by the government as subversive. One human
 rights group charged early in the year that over 175
 individuals in such categories have been held without formal
 charge by government security forces, some for as long as
 three years, without notification, in some cases, of their
 families and associates.   These cases were brought to the
 attention of the Legal Aid Institute and, as a result of
 their representations, the facts of arrest and detention
 were disclosed by the authorities showing that some had
 been tried and many had been released for insufficient
 evidence.
 Amnesty International has compiled a list of 22 persons who
 reportedly disappeared in East Timor "after surrender or
 capture by Indonesian forces." Inquiries by international
 humanitarian organizations are continuing at this writing,
 but efforts to obtain verified information regarding these
 and other alleged disappearances in East Timor are hampered
 by a number of factors:
 -- Frequently only very limited information regarding
 the person or persons in question is provided. Often only
 a name is given without further details regarding place of
 residence, relatives in East Timor or other data which
 would be useful in initiating a search.
 -- As a result of the social disruptions and popu-
 lation displacements which occurred during the previously
 existing wartime conditions in East Timor, many official
 records and other basic sources of information have been
 lost or are no longer of any value.
 -- Local authorities in East Timor, preoccupied with
 immediate problems in the areas of relief and rehabilitation,
 have been unable to devote sufficient attention to gathering
 and collating information on population movements.
 Some Indonesian officials have been helpful in facilitating
 efforts to trace missing persons, but on the whole, the
 Indonesian government has not devoted adequate attention and
 resources to resolving the question of disappearances in
 East Timor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Following the government's release by the end of 1979 of
 approximately 30,000 political detainees believed by the
 government to have been associated with or sympathetic to
 the PKI and the events leading up to the 1965 upheaval
 (so-called Class B detainees), there remained 23 Class A
 (persons charged with serious crimes such as murder)
 prisoners to be remanded for trial in 1980. According to
 a government report, the trials of all but one, considered
 too incapacitated because of illness, have now been
 completed. For one of the 22, the case was "closed" in
 pre-trial proceedings, and the prisoner freed. Of the
 remaining 21, all but two were tried in civil courts.
 The two, both ex-military, were tried in military courts.
 One, a former Army captain, was sentenced to 14 years,
 the sentence reduced by time spent in detention.
 The other, a former warrant officer, was sentenced to
 14 years and 6 months, without reduction of sentence.
 
 
 603
 The remaining 19, tried in civil courts, received sentences
 ranging from 3 to 19 years, all with sentences reduced by
 time spent in detention. Available data is insufficient to
 correlate sentences with time already served, but the
 general assumption is that the majority were released after
 trial, their sentences having coincided with prior detention
 time. No special judicial proceedings were reported to have
 been used for these trials.
 Amnesty International listed 657 Class A prisoners still in
 prison at the end of 1979. This figure includes the 23
 persons listed above as well as 634 persons already tried
 and convicted. A November 1979 presidential instruction
 permitted political prisoners to have their sentence
 reduced on the same terms as criminal offenders and most
 Class A prisoners received credit for time already served
 before sentencing. As a result of these actions, it is
 believed that a substantial number of Class A prisoners
 have been released, although no firm statistics are avail-
 able.
 Integration of the released prisoners into Indonesian
 society remains an acknowledged problem, though there have
 been no reports of rearrests. Many reportedly found that
 because of hostility and suspicion they were not readily
 accepted back into their old communities, and some were
 even rejected by their own families. While there are a
 number of voluntary agencies which seek to assist the former
 prisoners, there is no one central authority responsible
 for their welfare, and reports on their progress remain
 impressionistic, based on necessarily limited samples.
 The major problem seems to be in the employment field,
 in a society where unemployment and under-employment are
 perennial problems. Numbers of the former prisoners have
 not practiced their professions for extended periods of
 time, and are considered of advanced age by societal
 standards. Employment in the civil service, the armed
 forces, or "essential industries" (which remain undefined)
 is denied to them by government edict. No one can say
 with any certainty what percentage of former prisoners
 remains on the rolls of the unemployed, but the percentage
 is generally considered to be high.
 The right of habeas corpus, as well as bail bonding, does
 not exist in law, although habeas corpus is sometimes employed
 in practice in criminal cases. Both have reportedly been
 accepted by the government for a new criminal procedures
 code. Nonetheless, political detentions of indefinite
 duration continue.
 Under existing criminal law procedures, police may detain
 and investigate suspects for 20 days, prosecutors may
 detain suspects for 30 days, and the court may authorize
 extension of this period every 30 days for a period of up
 to one year.
 This does not apply to security and subversion cases, for
 which the period of detention has no legal limit.
 The Indonesian government has detained opposition students
 and their advisors, other political activists, and persons
 accused of corruption. A few have been brought to trial
 under existing legal codes, most have been released after
 questioning and others have been detained for periods of
 up to fifteen years without charges. During the past few
 years, detentions fell into two groups: students and
 opposition leaders arrested .during the protests surrounding
 
 
 604
 the electoral process in 1977/78, and suspected Muslim
 extremists believed to have instigated or participated
 in illegal anti-government activities during the elections
 or ensuing acts of violence or criminal acts such as robbery
 and murder.
 Trials of the 12 remaining students from the group of 35
 arrested in connection with the 1978 anti-government demon-
 strations were completed during 1980. All 23 were convicted
 of defaming the head of state but given relatively light
 sentences ranging from 9 to 18 months. In several cases,
 this was covered by time already served. All have been free
 during the trials and it is generally believed that even
 those with time remaining will not return to jail.
 No students were arrested for political activities in 1980.
 Some have been detained on criminal charges for their role
 in anti-Chinese rioting in November, which resulted in
 extensive property damage and some loss of life.
 Fifty-one persons variously identified as bandits or Muslim
 extremists were released in August 1980 after several years
 detention because of insufficient evidence to charge them.
 Press reports indicate that persons associated with the same
 or similar groups have been arrested over the past year.
 At least eight persons arrested in connection with the Aceh
 Merdeka movement in North Sumatra have also been tried and
 sentenced, some for minimal periods, and several for periods
 up to twenty years. Four other Aceh Merdeka leaders are
 known to have been released and it is believed that a number
 of low level Aceh Merdeka followers have also been set free.
 Verifiable figures on the number of Aceh Merdeka cadre
 still in prison are not available but it is probable that
 there will be more trials resulting in relatively lenient
 sentences (except for those with uncompromising separatist
 attitudes) and that most low level sympathizers will be
 released without trial. However, these releases often are
 not announced publicly nor fully documented, so that it will
 continue to be difficult to match claims regarding numbers
 detained with data on trials and releases. Furthermore,
 the situation is in continual flux as a result of new
 arrests of Aceh Merdeka cadre, which are believed to total
 between 20 and 30 in 1980.
 According to best estimates, 300-400 persons are imprisoned
 currently in East Timor. This includes both criminals and
 persons associated with the Fretilin liberation movement.
 Approximately 200 persons reportedly were arrested in the
 period immediately following a Fretilin-inspired incident
 in Dili in June. About 100 of these were released shortly
 thereafter leaving a total of about 100. Since that time,
 additional releases have brought the total down to 85 in
 early October, the last point for which a definite figure
 is available. It is believed that several additional
 persons were released subsequently bringing the present
 figure at the end of December down to about 80.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Paragraph 17 of Chapter 11, Law 14 of 1970 states: "Court
 investigating sessions are open to the public unless regu-
 lated separately by the law." This applies only to courts
 of first instance, not to appeals courts where hearings are
 conducted primarily on the basis of legal briefs, with no
 personal appearances. The regulations implementing the law
 cited above have never been issued. It therefore has been
 left to the discretion of judges to decide when court
 sessions should be closed in the reported interest of
 
 
 605
 national security, public order or propriety. In practice,
 most trials are open as were the 1979-80 student trials.
 There have been occasional complaints, however, that in the
 past, particularly in some security and political cases,
 public attendance was discouraged by the requirement that
 those wishing to attend register and sign their names.
 Many convicted defendants, particularly political ones,
 claim that government pressure has influenced their trials
 in favor of the prosecutor. There have been clear examples
 of courts rejecting government charges such as the acquittal
 in 1979 of a student charged with insulting the president.
 A second example was the dismissal of charges against one
 Class A detainee mentioned above.
 Security authorities have the option of holding individuals
 or turning them over to the attorney general for trial.
 Civilians generally are not tried by military courts.
 Indonesia's judicial system is complex. The judiciary is
 not constitutionally independent since judges and prose-
 cutors are civil servants responsible to the minister of
 justice. Proceedings are based on old Dutch law, traditional
 law and to some extent Islamic law. The applicable law in
 a given case is thus not always clear.
 A new criminal procedures law designed to provide a frame-
 work for Indonesian jurisprudence was introduced into
 parliament in late 1979 and has undergone extensive debate
 during 1980. There were complaints from some human rights
 activists and members of parliament that the draft gave
 more power to arresting and prosecuting authorities and
 provided less protection for the defendant than the old
 Dutch law currently in force. Those criticizing the bill
 succeeded in persuading the government to compromise on
 many of the major areas of disagreement. A vote on the
 new law may take place during the current parliamentary
 year.
 In recent years, it has become common practice for suspects
 and detainees to be provided in most cases with legal
 counsel, although there is no obligatory right to counsel
 under current law except in instances of capital offenses.
 The Indonesian Bar Association advocates enhancement of
 civil and humanitarian rights and has facilitated the
 establishment of legal aid societies in most major cities.
 These societies are permitted to advertise publicly.
 Farmers increasingly have sought legal aid in land disputes
 involving government and local land owners. There are only
 500 attorneys registered with the Bar (in a population of
 140 million). Anyone with a college degree, however, can
 serve as a defense attorney.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Judicial warrants for searches of private property are
 required except in cases of action by security agents or in
 cases of economic crime and corruption, but it is difficult
 to ascertain the degree to which they are followed.
 Forced entry by security authorities has been alleged in the
 past but no cases have come to light this year. There have
 been no known cases of "bugging", demolition or sealing of
 doors and windows.

 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 A major portion of President Suharto's independence Day
 address in August 1980 reemphasized the government's top
 priority comitment to economic development. Current develop-
 ment strategy stresses economic growth with social equity.
 Priority is given to job creation, agricultural production,
 population control, and efforts to meet basic economic and
 human needs, particularly for the rural poor. Inflation,
 at a crippling 640 percent in 1966, has averaged in the
 10-15 percent range for the past five years. Since 1974,
 real economic growth has averaged about 7.6 percent annually,
 and this trend is likely to continue.
 Infant mortality is about 115 per thousand, but lowering;
 life expectancy is now 48 years, and increasing. Current
 per capita income has been raised to an estimated $431
 in 1980.
 Population pressure, insufficient food production, inadequate
 employment opportunities, and landlessness are probably the
 greatest constraints on the ability of the economy to
 satisfy basic needs and improve income distribution.
 The island of Java, for example, has approximately 80
 million people and one of the highest population density
 rates in the world; 53 percent of rural families on Java are
 landless. Ipdonesia's family planning program has lowered
 birth rates and reduced population growth to less than two
 percent. It is also seeking to reduce Java's population
 pressures and increase agricultural production through an
 accelerated transmigration program to the outer islands; 4.9
 percent of the budget is devoted to manpower and trans-
 migration.
 Agricultural output has increased by about 3.8 percent
 annually during the past decade, one of the best agricultural
 performances of any major developing country. Good weather
 combined with better farming techniques fostered a bumper
 rice crop in 1980. As a result of rising consumption,
 however, Indonesia remains a large grain importer, especially
 of rice, despite increased agricultural production. During
 the past few years, the government increasingly has stressed
 non-rice production, particularly in areas not suited to
 rice cultivation. In the current budget, 14.7 percent is
 devoted to agriculture and irrigation, an increase of 2.7
 percent from the previous year.
 The material well-being of the bulk of the population,
 including the lowest income groups, has improved since
 the early 1970's. 2.8 percent of the fiscal year 1981
 budget is devoted to low-cost housing. Wide income
 disparities remain, however, and studies by both government
 and private experts point to the need to increase income of
 the rural and urban poor. While the present five year plan
 for economic development (1979-1984) places high priority
 on creation of employment, the need to create jobs for about
 1.5 million new job seekers each year remains a formidable
 and elusive goal. Through devaluation of the rupiah before
 the plan went into effect, the government has tried to
 stimulate labor intensive industries and agricultural exports.
 In 1980, there was considerable improvement in the agri-
 cultural export picture, but creation of more labor-intensive
 industries remains slow. The government is also seeking
 to improve the employment situation by expanding programs
 to employ rural workers in infrastructure construction in
 the poorest areas.
 
 
 607
 The literacy rate is 65 percent, a five percent increase
 from 1971. Primary school enrollment has increased from
 71 percent in 1960 to 86 percent in 1980, and consideration
 is being given to making primary education compulsory.
 In higher education, the trend is to increase agricultural
 and rural studies and, especially, to train mid-level
 technicians. In the current budget, 11.4 percent is
 devoted to education and culture.
 The necessity for adequate public health care is acknow-
 ledged in the current five-year plan (1979-84), and the
 health minister is committed to the development of a primary
 health care strategy which will provide health and nutritional
 care to all needy Indonesians by the year 2000. Whereas the
 first five year plan allocated only 50 cents per capita in
 the health sector, the current plan provides almost $6.
 Emphasis is on the development of public hdalth centers,
 infectious disease control, and nutritional improvement.
 Development has been hindered by limited availability of
 qualified medical personnel and health facilities. The ratio
 of physicians per capita has, however, increased from
 1:41,000 in 1960 to 1:12,000 today, with over 1,000 doctors
 being graduated each year. The number of regional health
 centers, maternal child health centers and polyclinics has
 been increasing, and there are now over 4,300 public health
 centers throughout the country, with at least one in every
 sub-district, about 50 percent of which are staffed with at
 least one physician.
 Differences in the fulfillment of basic economic rights
 between the city and countryside in Indonesia vary widely.
 In some rural areas the inhabitants enjoy a standard of
 living approximately equal to their counterparts in the
 cities. In those more remote rural areas, however, where
 transportation facilities are inadequate, the standard of
 living is significantly lower.
 Shelter in tropical Indonesia is less a problem than in
 temperate climates. As rural income increases, the tradi-
 tional straw and bamboo construction is giving way to brick
 and tile housing.
 Corruption is an endemic problem and has diverted an in-
 determinate amount of resources from meeting basic human
 needs. As a result of an anti-corruption campaign begun
 in 1977, some senior officials, both military and civilian,
 have been sentenced to prison terms. The minister of
 defense and security has approved measures designed to
 ensure proper use of military funds and resources and to
 curtail luxurious living at top military levels. He has
 also stressed that soldiers who disobey the law will be
 prosecuted. Despite these efforts, corruption remains
 a serious, widespread problem at all levels of government
 and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
 Although Indonesian women traditionally are important income
 earners for their families and modern legislation guarantees
 equal treatment, they are still not fully represented in the
 decision-making structure or the modernization process.
 In 1980, there was improved participation of women's groups
 in development-related projects involving nutrition, family
 planning, and home economics. But no woman has held a full
 cabinet portfolio since 1966. Although well represented in
 the professions (academic, judicial and medical), they hold
 no governorships, ambassadorships, or top offices in the
 national and local assemblies or national and provincial
 
 
 608
 development planning bodies. At the rural level, women
 are losing traditional economic pursuits, but are not being
 included in adopting the modern techniques. While Indonesia
 has comprehensive labor legislation to protect female wage
 earners, women do not receive equal pay for equal work,
 partly because there is no minimum wage law and also because
 women are restricted from holding certain jobs in industry.
 Conditions in East Timor, where many thousands have died of
 hunger and warfare since 1975, improved during 1980 in
 large part as a result of internationally supported relief
 efforts. The emergency situation of 1979, when large numbers
 of people were threatened with malnutrition and near starva-
 tion, has now been largely overcome. The attention of the
 Indonesian government and international donors thus has
 shifted to the longer range economic development of this
 historically underdeveloped and poverty-stricken area.
 Particular emphasis is being placed upon improving health
 care, expanding agricultural production, and upgrading the
 very inadequate communications infrastructure so that the
 basic needs of the population can be satisfied. Many of
 these projects are in the planning stages; some implementation
 is expected in 1981.
 3.   espect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Article 28 9f Indonesia's 1945 constitution states that
 freedom of association and assembly, of expressing thoughts
 orally and in writing, shall be prescribed by statute.
 Religious freedom is more specifically guaranteed in
 Article 29, paragraph 2 of the constitution which says that
 the state shall guarantee freedom to every resident to
 adhere to his religion.
 The press is carefully controlled in Indonesia. In 1980,
 stories reporting political opposition activities, such as
 the Petition of 50 at parliament (see Section 3c for further
 details), and containing allegations considered derogatory
 toward government officials were disseminated through
 foreign broadcasts and newspapers. This led to the govern-
 ment's refusing to renew the stay permits of two foreign
 journalists and applying more strictly an earlier rule that
 foreign news agency stories on Indonesia cannot be dissemi-
 nated automatically in the country. The government in 1980
 also revoked the licenses of two semi-monthly anti-government
 university papers on the grounds that they were not abiding
 by publication rules.
 The government exercises censorship prerogatives over foreign
 films and publications. Readers thus occasionally find
 portions inked out of magazines and newspapers from abroad.
 Communist writings are prohibited, as are lurid magazines or
 pictures. The government has allowed, however, former
 political prisoners to publish books and articles in leading
 magazines and newspapers.
 There are numerous research institutions in Indonesia
 issuing publications in a wide variety of fields.
 There have been no reported cases of government inter-
 ference with academic inquiry in the natural or social
 sciences.
 Limits on freedom of assembly are imposed by government
 policy. Nevertheless, some opposition can be expressed.
 Students in 1980 staged peaceful demonstrations at parlia-
 
 
 609
 ment, and opposition elements used parliamentary legal
 procedures and publications to register protests about
 policies and leaders. In October, there was a physical
 confrontation between students and the military that
 resulted in fourteen students being hospitalized, but this
 is the only example of violent confrontation in 1980.
 Indonesia is a secular state and its constitution provides
 for religious tolerance. Traditional tensions between
 Indonesia's predominantly Muslim community and other
 religious sects occasionally resurface, however. Because of
 some agitation against missionary activities, President
 Suharto made a special effort to reaffirm publicly in
 July 1980 the government's policy of guaranteeing religious
 freedom and of assuring religious tolerance and harmony.
 On occasion, there are clashes between the government
 and a religious group. At the end of the fasting month,
 there were complaints from the Muslims that freedom of
 religion was impinged upon when government security agents
 interrupted sermons critical of the government being delivered
 in several mosques.
 Although the Indonesian population is overwhelmingly Islamic,
 no particular discrimination is directed against those of
 other faiths, and numbers of members of the minority religions
 rank high in government councils.
 There is a considerable body of Indonesian law designed to
 protect the rights of the individual worker, and certain
 types of trade union activity are permitted. By law, any
 employer with 25 or more employees must recognize and
 negotiate with them as a trade union upon worker demand.
 The results of these negotiations are the collective labor
 agreements, the number of which has grown enormously: in
 mid-1980, there were 1,197 registered with the government
 while in 1975, there were 30. Even where there is no union,
 companies are required, after consultation with the
 employees, to post written regulations covering labor
 matters.   The partial right to strike (and to lock-out)
 exists in the private sectors except in those industries
 which the government considers "vital". It is government
 policy to intervene in labor disputes before they reach a
 strike/lock-out confrontation. When serious labor unrest/
 disagreement occurs, the government may mediate directly
 or the matter can be referred to a special series of labor
 courts. Only when all remedies have failed may a strike
 be declared legal. Illegal or hon-legal strikes do occur,
 usually over wages but sometimes over working conditions.
 According to a senior trade unionist, no striker or strike
 leader has been jailed for involvement in an illegal strike.
 Low level police harassment does occur.
 Employees of the government and government-owned industries
 are not permitted to unionize but can affiliate with a
 government employees association which has branches in
 most government offices. Government employees cannot
 strike or engage in collective bargaining.
 In 1978, the government inaugurated a mandatory social
 insurance program providing for workers' accident and
 life insurance and for a savings scheme, a "provident
 fund". By mid-1980, over 1 million employees were covered.
 Individual workers' rights against arbitrary dismissal are
 established by Indonesian labor laws. There is strong
 enforcement of legislation in the job security area.
 
 
 610
 Organized in 1973 with the encouragement of the government,
 the National Trade Union Federation is one of the few
 broad-based mass organizations in Indonesia and it is
 composed of 21 industrial unions in the private sector.
 Government figures estimate trade union membership at
 2,001,675 in mid-1980. A 1977 government decree authorized
 check-off but the system is not widespread and is not a
 significant source of union funding.
 While many senior trade unionists are active politically in
 their personal capacities, the trade union movement itself
 is not officially aligned with any political party or
 grouping.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Exit permits are required of persons leaving the country,
 but they are usually obtainable without difficulty upon
 presentation of identification papers and fee payment.
 There has been some criticism in recent months of alleged
 government denial of exit permits to leading members of
 opposition groups. East'Timorese seeking to leave Indonesia
 also frequently encounter difficulties in obtaining exit
 permits.
 The government requires a permit to change residence,
 primarily to control the further movement of population
 from the rural areas into the already overcrowded cities.
 Permits reportedly are not difficult to obtain for persons
 able to prove that they have employment in the city.
 Former detainees are free to travel domestically, but are
 required to notify authorities of travel outside their
 home areas. There have been charges from abroad of former
 political detainees associated with the 1965 coup attempt
 forced to transmigrate, but no proven cases. There is some
 indication, in fact, that government policy is to discourage
 congregations of ex-political prisoners in transmigration
 centers.
 Similar charges of forced resettlement have been made
 concerning East Timor. In view of the serious food
 shortages and the lack of adequate infrastructure that
 occurred in 1978/79, there has been no short-term alter-
 native to the emergency relief and care of large numbers
 of Timorese in resettlement centers. As the security
 situation has eased so also have the rules for entrance
 to and exit from the centers. Reports from East Timor
 indicate that restrictions on movement have eased
 considerably during the past year. Trucks carrying
 relief supplies frequently encounter hitch-hikers who
 turn out to be people moving to a different settlement
 area, usually one closer to their original home.
 These people are normally in possession of official travel
 documents provided by the local authorities.  Also, attempts
 to trace people in some settlements have been complicated by
 the fact that they have moved elsewhere, in a number of
 cases to Dili.
 Further evidence of increased freedom of movement is the
 fact that people in certain settlements have been given
 official permission to travel, on a regular basis, to other
 locations in order to receive medical treatment or to obtain
 food. Also people in the overcrowded Uatolari area have
 begun moving back into the nearby mountain area where their
 agricultural land is located. In general, freedom of move-
 ment has been greater in the more secure western districts
 
 
 611
 of the province but these recent developments in Uatolari
 indicate that the situation is easing in the eastern part of
 the island as well. Travel Between East Timor and other
 parts of Indonesia is restricted and a government permit is
 required to leave East Timor.
 One thousand five hundred and sixty-five Portuguese citizens
 were repatriated from East Timor in 1976 following the
 integration of that province into Indonesia. Indonesia has
 stated its willingness to allow 3,200 additional Portuguese
 citizens in Timor to be repatriated if Portugal agrees, but
 efforts to deal with this problem through diplomatic inter-
 mediaries (Indonesia and Portugal have no relations) have
 thus far not been successful and discussions are continuing.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross has obtained
 approval for the repatriation to Portugal of 72 persons (32
 separate cases) to be reunited with first degree relatives
 (husbands and wives or parents and children) there. Seven
 of these have already departed East Timor and the remainder
 (except for three who have changed their minds) are expected
 to do so over the next six months. There is also an agree-
 ment between Indonesia and Australia for the repatriation
 of Timorese with relatives in Australia. 613 persons have
 been identified for this program and, as of October 15, 1980,
 305 had already been moved.
 The -president issued two decrees in 1980 to improve markedly
 the opportunity of foreign passport holders, particularly
 PRC/Taiwan, and stateless ethnic Chinese to opt for Indonesian
 citizenship. The government estimates that at this writing
 at least 500,000 Chinese applications have been made.
 A few Indonesians remain in communist countries where they
 chose to reside after the 1965 upheaval. Permission from
 the government must be obtained through Indonesian embassies
 abroad for them to return home. Such permission is being
 determined on a case-by-case basis.
 Women generally are treated the same as men in matters of
 internal or foreign travel, emigration or repatriation.
 The Indochinese refugee camp on Indonesia's Galang Island
 has been developed'by the government and United Nations
 High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) into an excellent
 refugee facility. In addition to accepting over 57,000
 first asylum Indochinese refugees since 1979, pending
 their resettlement in third countries, the Indonesian
 government has offered to provide one of the region's
 two processing centers to hold refugees transferred from
 camps in other Association for Southeast Asian Nations
 (ASEAN) countries, to date principally Thailand, where
 pressure has been heaviest. The transfer of refugees from
 Thailand to Galang began in July 1980 and is continuing
 consistent with space made available by the departure of
 first asylum refugees and the completion of the new pro-
 cessing center. No Vietnamese refugees are known to have
 been pushed off Indonesian shores. Indonesia has not
 accepted any Vietnamese for permanent settlement.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Indonesia has a limited representative government dominated
 by the military. All adult citizens except prisoners and
 members of the armed forces are enfranchised, and a specific
 number of seats in parliament are reserved for appointed
 members of the armed forces. Elections for parliament (DPR)
 are held every five years with the next election scheduled
 
 
 612
 
 for 1982. The president is elected by an assembly (MR)
 consisting of the parliament plus an equal number of
 appointed members in a special sitting every five years with
 the next set for 1983. The 1975 law on political parties
 limits the number to three, a Muslim party, an association
 of former nationalist and Christian parties, and the
 government-sponsored party (GOLMAR) or functional groups.
 Because of its government affiliation, the latter has
 certain advantages in presenting its policies and views.
 It won the 1971 election with 62.8 percent of the vote
 and the 1977 election with 62.1 percent.
 Political activity by the parties in the period between
 elections is centered largely on the national and regional
 legislative bodies because of a prohibition on operations at
 the village level. This restriction is lifted during the
 election campaign. Government regulations during the 1977
 election limited the freedom of all three political groups
 to criticize each other and government policy. The communist
 party and & Muslim party involved in separatist revolts
 during the 1950's have been banned; members of the former
 and some leaders of the latter are not allowed to run for
 office.
 An informal 50-man opposition group consisting of retired
 military officers, some elements of the Muslim community and
 former student leaders have gained some prominence this year
 by submitting a petition critical of the government leader-
 ship to Parliament. The authorities have reacted by
 terminatin4 the employment of those with official positions,
 withdrawing their right to travel abroad and cutting off
 their access to government contracts or financing.
 Several members of this group have also reportedly lost
 their jobs in the private sector as a result of government
 pressure. However, despite such official discouragement,
 the group remains politically active through private
 meetings and privately distributed tracts. There are also
 numerous student and intellectual groups, some of them
 formally organized as think-tanks, which are sharply
 critical of the government, especially on economic develop-
 ment issues. These groups remain generally free of government
 interference and frequently publish magazines and articles
 conveying the views of themselves and other government
 critics.
 The Javanese, who comprise about forty-five percent of
 the total population, have a preeminent role in the country's
 political leadership as a result of historical and cultural
 factors. Other ethnic groups are represented at the highest
 levels of government, but the majority of non-Javanese ethnic
 groups are somewhat under-represented in the mid and lower
 levels of the military and bureaucracy. There is deep
 resentment of the Chinese minority which plays a dis-
 proportionately large role in the nation's economy.
 This racial tension sometimes is translated into anti-
 Chinese violence such as occurred in central Java in November.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The government accepts a program of visitations by the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to prisons
 and detention centers. Discussions are in progress for a
 team from the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) to
 conduct a survey of human rights conditions. In recent
 years, Amnesty International representatives have been
 refused access to Indonesia because of the government's
 disagreement with findings of Amnesty International's reports.
 
 
 613
 Since 1979, at the invitation of the Indonesian government,
 the ICRC and Catholic Relief Services have undertaken relief
 efforts in East Timor. Both organizations have staff on the
 island and are carrying out humanitarian relief programs in
 cooperation with nine international agencies and seven
 foreign governments, including the United States. The govern-
 ment during 1980 has also expanded access to East Timor by
 Western journalists, TV teams, academicians, members of the
 diplomatic corps and members of the United States Congress.
 For the past nine years, a Jakarta-based legal aid institute
 (LBH) has contested human rights violations by defending or
 representing aggrieved parties in open court and through
 stimulating press attention and discussion. It issued its
 firm's annual report on fundamental human rights in Indonesia
 in 1979 and planned to issue another one late in 1980 (not
 available at this writing).   The efforts of the LBH have
 inspired the formation of similarly interested groups around
 the country. There are now about 60 legal aid institutions
 or societies in the country, about half of which are asso-
 ciated with law schools, and private efforts are being made
 to coordinate their activities. In late 1979, Human Rights
 Day was observed throughout the country for the first
 time and prizes were awarded by Vice President Adam Malik
 in ceremonies sponsored by the LEH and the Indonesian
 Journalists Association for the most outstanding journa-
 listic efforts in the fields of human rights. During 1980,
 the LEH also opened a new and impressive headquarters
 building in Jakarta.
 With one reported exception in the provinces, attorneys
 associated with the legal aid societies did not experience
 government harassment this past year. The Jakarta City
 government, in fact, regularly provides annual funding to
 the LBH.
 The government participates in the yearly sessions of the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission where it has to
 provide a report under 1503 proceedings. Members of the
 LBH's have contact with similar groups abroad.
 The government is not party to the universal declaration of
 human rights nor any of the related covenants. It is also
 not party to the protocol relating to the status of refugees,
 although it nonetheless has been generous in receiving
 Indochinese refugees.
 United Nations' resolutions have been adopted in recent
 years expressing deep concern over the situation in East
 Timor and reaffirming the right of the people of East
 Timor to self-determination.
