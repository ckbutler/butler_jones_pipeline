 HUNGARY
 Except for a brief period in 1956, one-party rule has been
 a fact in Hungary for more than three decades. The Commu-
 nist Party has maintained a monopoly of political power.
 Although a number of citizens' rights are prescribed by the
 constitution, as in other communist countries, such rights
 are qualified by the interests of "socialist society".
 Prior to the 1956 revolution, the Hungarian government
 followed rigid Stalinist policies. Beginning in the early
 1960's, Hungary gradually has eased internal controls, per-
 mitting a degree of modest economic well-being and cultural
 diversity. This easing of controls represents an attempt to
 accommodate popular opposition to rigid restrictions.
 Political expression still is tightly controlled and effec-
 tive participation in the political process is not possible
 without approval of the Communist party. The Party has
 sought public support through an explicitly-stated policy
 of "alliance" between it and the general population under
 the tenet, "who is not against us is with us", and through
 mass organizations such as the Patriotic People's Front.
 Available information indicates that the number of political
 prisoners is about fifty. Emigration is possible within
 limits; visits abroad, including to western countries, are
 possible within wider limits. Practice of religion is
 tolerated to a considerable extent. Secret police and pro-
 secutorial discretion, powers, and methods have been
 somewhat curtailed. In this last connection, party and
 government officials claim to have eradicated many of the
 abuses of socialist legality which characterized the
 pre-1956 period.
 There are approximately 60,000 Soviet soldiers currently in
 Hungary. With dependents the number of Soviet nationals in
 Hungary exceeds 100,000.
 1.    Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The 1972 constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic
 states the following in paragraph 57 (1): "In the Hungarian
 People's Republic, citizens have the right to the protection
 of life, integrity of the body, and the preservation of good
 health." There are no known recent instances of torture or
 violation of the above provisions.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no known summary executions in Hungary in
 recent years (although some reportedly occurred during--and
 a much larger number after--the suppression of the 1956 re-
 volution). Mistreatment is believed to have ceased
 gradually after the end of the so-called consolidation phase
 in 1960-62. Citizens may sue the police for brutality, and
 in at least one case, a person has done so.
 There are three levels of punitive incarceration in Hungary:
 "workhouse", with somewhat liberal visiting, outside work,
 
 
 807
 and outside leave possibilities; "jail", which is more
 punitive; and "prison", maximum-security penitentiary.
 Prison conditions vary in relation to the category level,
 but all levels are believed to provide adequate diet and
 health care. Hardened criminals are confined separately
 from those convicted of petty crimes. With varying degrees
 of frequency, depending on levels of imprisonment, prisoners
 have visitation rights by family members, other relatives,
 and friends. There does not appear to be deliberate and
 willful or other systematic mistreatment of prisoners.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no disappearances in Hungary in the past
 year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Citizens generally are free from arbitrary arrest. Upon
 arrest, a detainee must be informed in writing of what he
 or she is suspected, and can be held at a police station
 for a maximum of 72 hours before charges must be filed.
 There is no right of bail or provisional pretrial liberty.
 Although authorities have some discretion to grant pretrial
 liberty, they do so rarely. In cases of suspicion for
 major crimes, a person can be held in jail 30 days before
 trial, renewable twice for a maximum of three months.
 On July 1, 1979 Hungary adopted a new penal code which
 somewhat narrows the range of acts defined as crimes and
 provides for modest reduction of penalties for some types
 of offenses. The new penal code retains an article on
 incitement which permits officials to prosecute for a wide
 range of utterances or statements. Official Hungarian
 statistics show that 230 cases of incitement arose in 1977
 and 214 in 1978. Apparently not all these cases involved
 political matters. Frequently such cases result in short
 or suspended sentences.
 Another penal code provision on "espionage" provides for
 punishing "a person who obtains, collects, or gives out
 data which can be used against the Hungarian People's
 Republic with the purpose to forward them to a foreign
 government or organization..." Neither the nature of the
 data transmitted nor the nature of the recipient organiza-
 tion is closely defined.
 In general, the new penal code is more lenient than the
 previous one. It provides for lesser penalties for so-
 called political crimes on a small scale such as offhand
 statements against the party or government. Many such
 crimes are now misdemeanors with the first offense often
 resulting in a short (three months) suspended sentence and
 a fine (usually about $43.00). At the same time the new
 penal code has taken a harder line against corruption.
 Crimes of this nature often result in more severe penal-
 ties. It appears to be difficult to get reduced or
 suspended sentences in corruption cases.
 A public statement by the Hungarian Minister of Justice in
 October 1980 indicated that two-tenths of one percent of
 all Hungarians in jail can be classified as political
 prisoners, with an actual total of less than fifty indi-
 viduals. The minister described political prisoners as in
 
 
 808
 three categories: war crimes, espionage and "incitement
 against the Hungarian constitution". There is no informa-
 tion either to substantiate or rebut the minister's
 statement.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution (Article 49) stipulates that all court
 proceedings are open except for cases specifically exempted
 by law (those involving morals or state secrets); and that
 "all courts are independent" (Article 50(2)) and "subject
 to laws." All courts deal with criminal, political and
 security cases. There are very few trials which are closed
 in Hungary. Those few which are closed usually are con-
 nected in some way to national security. Defendants in
 closed trials are guaranteed the same rights as in any
 other trial.In general, judicial procedures resemble con-
 tinental Western European practices in that they are
 investigatory rather than adversarial in nature. There is
 no trial by jury. Defendants have the right to choose
 counsel in all cases. Courts normally seek to apply the
 law in a methodical fashion. Political pressure by the
 Communist Party presumably is applied when necessary, but
 discreetly.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution guarantees citizens' personal freedom and
 inviolability, as well as the secrecy of correspondence and
 privacy of tile home. Such guarantees are couched "in the
 interests of socialism" and will be breached in the name of
 that interest, but Hungarian practice appears to afford due
 process. For example, search warrants are necessary in all
 cases. House searches require a court order and must be
 carried out in the presence of two witnesses. A written
 inventory must be prepared of items removed from the pre-
 mises. Available information corroborates adherence to
 these procedures. It is assumed that procedural steps such
 as issuance of search warrants may be "expedited" in
 instances of special interest, such as state security cases.
 2.     Government  Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Hungary has undergone rapid industrialization since the end
 of World War II, transforming a predomrnantly agricultural
 society with some feudal overtones into a moderately
 developed, industrial communist state. Agriculture cur-
 rently employs about 20 percent of Hungary's total work
 force. The city of Budapest has 20 percent of Hungary's
 total population of approximately 10.7 million people; 34
 percent live in smaller cities or towns and the remaining
 46 percent live in villages or rural settlements.
 Hungary's gross domestic product grew by 2.6 percent in
 1979 totaling about $29.2 billion or $2,700 per capita. In
 mid-1979 Hungary undertook to utilize reform mechanisms
 dating from 1968 to make its economy more efficient and
 more competitive with world trading partners, including
 those in the West. Due to world market conditions and
 internal factors, Hungary is currently in a period of
 austerity with higher consumer prices and the prospect of a
 
 
 809
 static or slightly diminished standard of living over the
 next five years. Under the economic reform program which
 increasingly has opened Hungary to the inflationary pres-
 sures of the world economy, inflation reached approximately
 12 percent in 1980.
 The Hungarian government has been relatively forthcoming in
 informing the public about economic problems. At the
 twelfth party congress in March 1980 Party First Secretary
 Kadar and other officials stated that Hungary would seek to
 increase exports in order to pay for and maintain the
 standard of living Hungary had achieved.
 The government took steps in 1980 to reinforce the standard
 of living through the introduction of increased quantities
 and varieties of Western consumer goods, and through cer-
 tain measures designed to remove excess controls and to
 improve services to the consumer especially in the grocery,
 restaurant and repair fields.
 The average Hungarian monthly wage in 1979 was about $152.
 Many Hungarians (perhaps as many as two-thirds of the
 working population) earn additional income from unofficial
 part-time employment outside of their regular jobs. Infor-
 mation on the average division of wages is not extensive.
 One mid-1979 set of statistics indicated that 76 percent of
 wage earners received between $89 and $216 per month; six
 percent received less than $87 and 18 percent received more
 than $216, including .6 percent receiving more than $432
 per month. Actual income disparities are undoubtedly higher
 as, for example, between pensioners, and individuals who
 supplement their official salaries with inror~e from moon-
 lighting or tips.
 Housing is the major social problem in Hungary particularly
 in the overcrowded capital of Budapest. While the
 Hungarian government assigns high priority to housing
 construction, and in recent years the number of new units
 constructed has hovered around 90,000, the number of people
 waiting to occupy their own homes has remained close to
 400,000 nationwide. In Budapest the number of applicants
 for new homes was 187,000 in mid-1980, including a large
 number of young people.
 As Hungary is a communist country, ownership of all means
 of economic activity is vested either in the state or in
 cooperatives, except for a private sector of small stores
 and artisans' shops and small agricultural plots. There is
 also an important unofficial or second economy outside of
 government control (but tolerated by the government), where
 many people work to supplement their income. Although the
 right to own personal property is protected, there are
 strict limits on the amount of real property which can be
 privately held.
 Virtually everyone in Hungary has access to medical care at
 nominal cost through an extensive system of medical bene-
 fits. Quality of patient care depends greatly on the
 patient's ability to offer substantial extra money or
 material gifts to receive quality or specialized profes-
 sional treatment. Senior party, government and military
 persons have access to special and better medical
 facilities.
 
 
 810
 Alcoholism is a major health and social problem. There has
 also been a recent trend among a minority of young people
 to abuse legitimate pharmaceutical drugs. Abuse of heroin
 and other illegal narcotics is not a problem. Hungary has
 a high rate of suicide and divorce and a low birth rate.
 Education is free with nominal fees or costs at the univer-
 sity level.
 The constitution guarantees equal rights for men and women.
 A large percentage of women hold permanent employment and
 appear to participate freely in all major sectors of social
 activity, especially in medicine and education. The govern-
 ment provides for extended periods of maternity leave as
 well as subsidies for women who choose to take extended
 leave from their jobs in okder to raise children at home.
 The goal of this program is to encourage women to have
 larger families. Women do not lose their jobs if they elect
 to take extended leave. A system of child care centers has
 been established in Hungary but it is often difficult for
 parents to find a place for their children because of the
 limited places.
 3.     Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of conscience, religious
 practice, free speech, free press and assembly, and the
 right to form associations. The latter four rights are
 qualified by the need to conform to the "interests of
 socialism and the people". In practice, if a Hungarian
 citizen accepts the communist form of government and does
 not publicly oppose Hungary's alliance with the Soviet
 Union, he or she is free to pursue a range of thought and
 activity. If these limits are not respected, he or she may
 be subjected to varying measures of admonition, harassment,
 and punishment. The constitution does not protect the
 citizen who exceeds the generally understood boundaries of
 expression, and pervasive self-censorship in media and
 cultural circles serves to remind the citizen where the
 boundaries are. Despite the absence of formal censorship,
 authorities have banned circulation of particular books or
 articles.
 There is no organized dissent in Hungary in the sense of
 identifiable groups or continuing movements. This is due
 in part to the disparate interests of political dissidents
 as well as a carefully implemented government policy.
 There are reported to be scattered dissident groups which
 meet irregularly for private discussions of political and
 other topics. Privately printed (samizdat) publications
 circulate. The government has sought and obtained both
 tacit support from much of the populace, and the active
 participation by broad groups of intellectuals and others
 in national life. Hungary's economic progress over the
 last decade, its emphasis on consumerism and its willing-
 ness to permit more frequent travel to the west than most
 other Warsaw Pact nations have all contributed to the rela-
 tive lack of overt dissidence. The government has improved
 relations with the hierarchies of most of the major
 religious denominations. The churches do not act as
 
 
 811
 organizing centers for dissent. The government has also
 shown a willingness to weather without explicit reply or
 rejoinder some incidents of dissent which occasionally
 emerge. It has occasionally expelled or permitted the
 emigration to the West of outspoken opponents of the
 political system. In at least two cases such individuals
 later have returned to Hungary and resumed residence.
 In October 1979, 254 intellectuals signed petitions
 protesting trials of Czechoslovak dissidents and expressing
 support for Charter 77. Most of the signers were questioned
 about their support for the petition. A small number lost
 their jobs or suffered some other penalty such as suspen-
 sion of publication rights. None apparently was arrested.
 In August 1980 seven Hungarian intellectuals were prevented
 from traveling to Poland to express solidarity with striking
 Polish workers. Their passports reportedly were confis-
 cated, but they were not arrested. There do not appear to
 have been continuing actions in Hungary in 1980 on behalf
 of Charter 77. As mentioned earlier, persons have been
 sentenced for "incitement".
 Hungarian press, radio, and television are centrally
 managed media. They are governmentally owned and observe
 current party guidelines and the maxim that the role of a
 "journalist" is to further the cause of communism. Censor-
 ship does not exist in a formal sense but is exercised by
 writers and editors themselves in terms of certain basic
 premises of domestic and foreign policy. Some carefully-
 nuanced differing views occasionally appear in the press
 and literature, but they are usually well within the
 general constraints. Infrequently, Western viewpoints can
 be heard on Hungarian radio and television. These may be
 the views of a western spokesman broadcast together with
 those of other participants in a panel discussion, or
 straight reporting of a Western official's comments on a
 topical international issue such as the Strategic Arms
 Limitation Talks. Hungary does not jam Western radios, and
 Austrian and Yugoslav radio and television broadcasts reach
 much of the country. Hungary permits a degree of access to
 Western literature and films, including some television
 programs and about twenty American films annually. Some
 western periodicals are available in limited quantities in
 Hungary, usually at newsstands frequented by foreigners.
 The practice of religion in Hungary is neither encouraged
 nor rigorously impeded by the state which--albeit stead-
 fastly committed to atheism--has come to profess the
 acceptability of both believers and nonbelievers working
 together in the interest of socialist society. In this
 connection major religious denominations have represen-
 tatives in the parliament and state honors have been
 bestowed on prominent churchmen such as the Roman Catholic
 Primate, Cardinal Laszlo Lekai, and the chief Jewish rabbi,
 Laszlo Salgo. A Hungarian's religious beliefs can limit
 advancement in government and in society in general.
 Sizeable religiousgroups in Hungary include Roman
 Catholics (5.25 million), Calvinists (2 million),
 Evangelical Lutherans (0.5 million), and Jews (100,000).
 There are some 19 religious denominations in Hungary
 
 
 812
 recognized by law plus several minor sects, such as
 Jehovah's Witnesses. The total number of persons
 manifesting some religious belief is estimated at 8.5
 million.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 All adult citizens are issued an identification bdoklet and must
 carry it with them for travel, and register with local
 police when moving from one locality to another. Permanent
 transfer from rural areas to Budapest is permitted, but
 because of overcrowding of the capital, is not encouraged
 and can be difficult because of the scarcity of housing.
 Hungarian emigration law is ostensibly restrictive in that
 it stipulates that a person can normally apply to emigrate
 only if over 55 years of age and joining a parent, spouse,
 or child abroad. However, the law provides for exceptions
 in individual cases, and approximately 90 percent of
 Hungarians who apply to emigrate receive permission.
 Persons who are refused may appeal and reapply; reapplica-
 tions are sometimes successful, particularly if special
 humanitarian considerations emerge. There are no systematic
 official sanctions, such as loss of employment, imposed on
 persons who seek to emigrate, and emigrants may take a
 modest amount of personal property with them.
 Hungary follows a cautiously liberal practice in regard to
 permitting, visits to the West. Some 355,000 Hungarians cur-
 rently visit the West annually, 3 to 4 million make visits
 to other eastern European countries.
 Substantial numbers of Hungarians can visit the West at
 regulated intervals if they wish . It is possible to pay
 for trips to Western Europe and beyond, including North
 America, in Hungarian currency. Private travelers can
 receive a modest hard-currency allotment once every three
 years to defray hard-currency expenses; biennial or, in
 the case of older persons, annual trips are possible if
 relatives or friends abroad pay the costs.
 Exit permission for both visitors and emigrants can be and
 occasionally is denied for vague reasons of state. The
 right of travel remains a gift of the state rather than a
 prerogative of the individual. In one recent instance a
 distinguished Hungarian writer's exit permit was delayed
 beyond the date of a privately organized open conference in
 the U.S. on Hungarian literature, reportedly because the
 Hungarian government considered other persons participating
 in the conference to be undesirable.
 Persons who have emigrated from Hungary legally have a
 legal right to return. Persons who leave Hungary as
 visitors with exit permission to stay abroad only tem-
 porarily and who then remain away are subject to
 prosecution if they return. Hungary appears to follow,
 however, a discretionary practice of regarding such per-
 sons, if they return, with benign neglect. Prosecution may
 not occur or, when it does, may amount to a formality
 leading to a suspended sentence. Returnees probably would
 not be granted the privilege of visiting abroad again for
 
 
 813
 up to five years, and there is no assurance that more assi-
 duous prosecution and other sanctions, such as deprivation
 of former employment, would not occur.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The constitution emphasizes that the Hungarian Socialist
 Workers (Communist) Party represents the "working class"
 and the "interests of the whole of the society." The Com-
 munist party retains a monopoly of political power in
 Hungary and uses Party-sanctioned organizations such as the
 Patriotic People's Front, trade unions, and the Young Com-
 munist Organization to elicit broad public support.
 Effective political participation is not possible outside
 the party or the party-sanctioned organizations.
 The party invites the opinions and recommendations of
 nonparty organizations to an extent, for example, from
 cooperatives' associations on policy proposals in which
 they have an interest. It appears that deliberation within
 the party about proposed policies and actions can be
 somewhat open, but decisions once made and handed down by
 the leadership are to be loyally followed.
 Although more than one-third of the members of the National
 Assembly are women, there are few women at top levels in
 the government or party. Only one of twenty-one current
 members of the Council of Ministers is a woman and one of
 thirteen members of the Politburo. The party is officially
 committed to enhancing the role of women in Hungarian
 society, but results to date are limited.
 The Hungarian National Trade Union Council (SZOT) is one of
 the party's mass organizations and is subject to party
 control and direction. It serves the dual purpose of
 educating the workers in party policy and promoting worker
 interests. The Secretary General of SZOT is a member of
 the party politburo. He leads SZOT delegations in
 regularly scheduled meetings with the party leadership and
 with the government over labor policy, economic planning,
 prices, wages, and other economic issues. On the local and
 enterprise level, SZOT has established a system of shop
 stewards who have responsibility for such matters as the
 distribution of bonus money, profit sharing, enterprise-
 controlled housing, health care, union vacation plans and
 other benefits. Stewards can veto management decisions on
 personnel actions, plant safety and other issues which do
 not comply with stated agreements. Disputed questions are
 referred to higher authorities for arbitration.
 The Hungarian constitution has no provision permitting the
 right to strike, but a number of Hungarian commentators
 have pointed out recently on the other hand that strikes
 are not legally prohibited. The Secretary General of SZOT
 stated in October 1980 that localized strikes of a few
 hours duration had occurred in Hungary due to the failure
 of management and the local union officials to implement
 existing agreements. Various possible areas for expanding
 the role of the unions were on the agenda of the SZOT
 National Congress scheduled for December 1980.
 
 
 814
 4.     Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Hungarian government regards outside charges and
 investigations of alleged human rights violations as
 interference in its internal affairs. Hungary has never-
 theless shown a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial
 discussions with other countries on all aspects of the
 Helsinki Final Act, including its human rights provisions.
 In certain elements of its bilateral dialogue with some
 other countries, Hungary has been willing to discuss
 quietly some individual problem cases, particularly ones
 dealing with emigration.
