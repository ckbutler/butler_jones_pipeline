 NIGERIA
 General Sani Abacha, who seized power in a palace coup in November 1993, re-
 mained Nigeria's Head of State throughout 1995. Under Abacha, the main decision-
 making organ was the exclusively military Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), which
 ruled by decree. The PRC oversees the 32-member Federal Executive Council com-
 posed of military officers and civilians, including several prominent politicians.
 Pending a new constitution, some provisions of the 1979 and 1989 constitutions
 were observed, although the decree suspending the 1979 constitution was not re-
 pealed, and the 1989 constitution was never implemented. In his October 1 Inde-
 pendence Day speech Abacha announced a transition timetable which purports to
 return Nigeria to democratically elected civilian government by October 1, 1998.
 However, by year's end, little progress had been made in the transition.
 The Government continued to enforce its arbitrary authority through the Federal
 Security System (the military, the state security service, and the national police),
 and through decrees blocking action by the opposition in the courts. All branches
 of the security forces committed numerous serious human rights abuses.
 At the end of the year, the economy continued its downward slide. While the coun-
 try's elites continued to proser, unemployment, underemployment, and inflation in-
 creased markedly. Nigeria depends on oil exports for over 90 percent of its foreign
 
 
 197
 exchange earnings and over 75 percent of its budget revenues. In order to cope with
 reduced oil revenues, the Government implemented a national Structural Adjust-
 ment Program (SAP) from 1986 to 1991. While the SAP was a success in some re-
 spects, economic conditions for the average citizen remained very difficult, and suc-
 cessive military governments increasingly abandoned reform by printing money the
 fueled inflation. Endemic corruption further hindered the functioning of the econ-
 I&Te human rights record worsened in 1995. Throughout the year, the Government
 cracked down hard on the opposition. The most prominent outspoken critics of the
 regime remained in detention or self-imposed exile abroad, although four detainees
 were released on December 31.
 General Abacha's Government relied regularly on arbitrary detention and mass
 arrest to silence its many critics. The winner of the annulled June 1993 presidential
 election, Chief Moshood K. 0. Abiola, remained in detention on charges of treason.
 Security forces used excessive force to combat a growing wave of violent crime, kill-
 ing and wounding a number of persons, including innocent civilians. Police tortured
 and beat detainees, and prison conditions remained life threatening;, many prisoners
 died in custody. Citizens do not have the right to change their government. To con-
 tinue its hold on power, the regime enacted or extended a series of harsh decrees
 restricting press freedom and civil liberties which, like other military decrees, con-
 tained clauses prohibiting judicial review of any government action. Prominent writ-
 er, environmentalist, and minority rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others
 were executed November 10, following a trial by special tribunal completely lacking
 in respect for due process for the murder of four Ogoni politicians in May 1994.
 Former Head of State Olusegun Obasanjo, his erstwhile deputy and outspoken Na-
 tional Constitutional Conference delegate, Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, and more than 20
 others were charged, convicted, and sentenced by a secret military tribunal for their
 roles in alleged March coup plot. Abacha announced in October that the PRC had
 confirmed the Tribunal's verdicts, he also announced that the Government had com-
 muted many of the death sentences. Obassanjo was sentenced to 15 years' imprison-
 ment instead of life, and Yar'Adua's death sentence was commuted to 25 years' im-
 prisonment. Four military officers were given life sentences.
 Security  services  continued  routine  harassment of human    rights  and
 prodemocracy groups, including labor leaders, journalists, and student activists.
 Other human rights problems included violence and discrimination against women
 infringements o freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, travel, and political
 and labor affiliation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-As in previous years, police and se-
 curity services commonly engaged in extrajudicial killings and excessive use of force
 to quell antimilitary andprodemocracy protests. Credible, although unconfirmed, re-
 ports by Nigerian human rights groups indicate numerous deaths of suspects in po-
 lice custody. These reports are generally accepted by the public and are consistent
 with other credible reports of police abuse, including the use of torture to extract
 criminal confessions. The Government seldom holds police and security services ac-
 countable for their use of excessive, deadly force or the death of individuals in cus-
 tody. The Government's actions have fostered a climate of impunity in which these
 abuses flourish.
 Minority rights and environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others were
 executed on November 10 after their conviction by a tribunal which, although le-
 gally constituted, did not conform to the internationally accepted norms for a fair
 trial(see Section i.e.).
 In January 52-year-old Uwanogho Obire died while in detention at Oghara Police
 Station (Ethiope West), Delta state. Witnesses testified before a judicial panel of in-
 quiry that police interrogators tied Obire to a bar suspended between two wooden
 frames and whipped him with an electric cable and iron rods. In February the Gov-
 ernment dismissed two Ondo state policemen for flogging to death two robbery sus-
 pects during interrogations at the Ondo town police station. The Movement for the
 Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) publicized the case of Clement Tusiima, an
 Ogoni who died while in government custody in August. In May 1994, the Rivers
 state internal security task force had arrested Tusiima, a skilled automobile techni-
 cian, in Port Harcourt in connection with the killings of four prominent Ogoni politi-
 cians. Reportedly tortured by soldiers for several months at Bori military camp
 Tusiima was transferred to the State Intelligence and Investigation Bureau and
 
 
 subsequently to Port Harcourt prison. MOSOP alleged that Tusiima was denied ur-
 gently needed medical treatment following his ordeal and died of brain damage.
 Extrajudicial killings remained common. Increasing and widespread violent crime
 prompted police to employ roadblocks and checkpoints where extortion, violence
 and lethal force is reportedly common. On January 25, ikeja (Lagos) police shot and
 killed two university students, Bola Afilaka and Ayodele Adeju be, after Afilaka re-
 fused to stop his car at a checkpoint. Following a pursuit, poce reportedly appre-
 hended the pair, shot them, then detained both at Adeniji Adele police station. Nine-
 teen-year-old Afilaka was found dead in the cell the next morning. On February 1,
 14-year-old roadside merchant Mabel Ugwumanu was killed by stray bullets fired
 by plice attempting to stop a motorist at a checkpoint in Thiala.
 Mobile anticrlme police patrols routinely shot people suspeted of armed robbery.
 According to the Human Rights Monitor (URM) organization, in May a police patrol
 in Kaduna state shot and kfled three suspected armed robbers. The police main-
 tained that they shot the three suspects to halt their escape while conveying them
 to Kano. HRM noted that the police shot all three men in the chest, not in the back
 as would be expected of people fleeing. In June Zaria police shot and killed 11 rob-
 bery suspects in two separate encounters. Police killed eight suspects during a high-
 way shootout and three others while attempting to apprehend them at a Zaria hotel.
 Police maintain that all were trying to escape. In August Lagos state police commis-
 sioner James Danbaba claimed that plice killed 30 suspected armed robbers during
 a series of late July raids on their hideouts scattered throughout the state.
 There were credible reports that "Lagos State Environmental Task Force" (see
 Section 1c.) members killed several citizens who refused to stop at checkpoints or
 failed to comply with task force orders. In January task force members pursued and
 shot two men who refused to stop at a checkpoint. On April 12, task force members
 shot and killed a minibus driver after he refused the use of his vehicle to pursue
 another vehicle. On May 9 members shot and killed a 17-year-old boy after he alleg-
 edly tried to flee from the premises of the Lagos state Transport Corporation office
 in Oshodi. On March 16 three officials of the Akure (Ondo state) Local Government
 Environmental and Sanitation Revenue Task Force killed merchant Esther
 Akinbayajo in Akure during a minor argument in which officials reportedly used ex-
 cessive force.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 However, government detention practices have the effect of causing many detainees
 to be "missing" for extended periods (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1979 constitution (suspended) and the 1989 constitution (never implemented)
 prohibit torture and mistreatment of prisoners and provide criminal sanctions for
 such excesses. The Evidence Act of 1960 prohibits the introduction of evidence ob-
 tained through torture. Nevertheless, detainees frequently die while in custody (see
 Section L.a.), and there were credible reports that police seeking to extract confes-
 sions regularly tortured and beat suspects. There were widespread and credible re-
 ports that military interrogators beat and nearly tortured to death detained coup
 plot suspects, including colonels Lawan Gwadabe and R.S. Bello-Fadile. In February
 Defense Intelligence Service agents reportedly tortured an Air Force sergeant whom
 they accused of spying. Detainees are regularly kept incommunicado for long periods
 of time (see Section 1.d.).
 In its early months in power, the Abacha regime formed the Lagos State Environ-
 mental Task Force, as part of its "war on indiscipline and corruption." Under the
 direct supervision of the Lagos State Administrator, Colonel Olagunsoye Oyinlola
 the task force used brutal force on individuals in its attempts to rid Lagos of illegal
 street traders and copious accumulated garbage. Task force soldiers routinely beat
 and arrested anyone they perceived as "undisciplined," usually unarmed market
 women and traders, but also including jaywalkers, errant drivers, children, and
 young street hawkers. Task force soldiers at a Lagos bus stop routinely arrested and
 punished people who failed to use a nearby pedestrian bridge. Those arrested were
 ined, public humiliated for several hours, and subsequently released. On February
 25 soldiers brandishing automatic weapons, whips, and billy clubs destroyed 'illegal
 markets" on Ikoyi and Victoria islands, confiscated goods, and extorted money from
 petty traders.
 In March Oyo state military administrator Colonel Chinyere Ike Nwosu ordered
 motorists and taxi passengers from their vehicles at the Egebda taxi and lorry
 motor park in badan for allegedly violating Oyo "Sanitation Day" exercise. Nwosus
 mobile court fined scores of motorists and forced them to kneel down in the hot sun.
 On April 25, Nwosu's military aides attacked and beat a bank manager in Ibadan
 after the bankers car narrowly avoided colliding with Nwosu's convoy of vehicles.
 According to press reports, armed soldiers battered the man with rifle butts, render-
 
 
 ing him unconscious. The Government neither acknowledges nor denies that these
 practices occur, and their perpetrators go unpunished.
 Prison conditions remain life threatening. Lack of potable water inadequate sew-
 age facilities, and shortage of medical supplies result in deplorable sanitary condi-
 tions. Disease runs rampant in the cramped, poorly ventilated facilities. Prison in-
 mates are seldom allowed outside their cells for recreation, and many inmates must
 provide their own food. In those cases, only those with money or whose relatives
 bring food regularly have something to eat. Poor inmates rely on handouts from oth-
 ers to survive. There are credible reports that prison officials and police deny in-
 mates food and medical treatment as a form of punishment or to extort money from
 them. In October the convicted coup plotters were dispersed to various prisons
 around the country, inhibiting access to their families and food. The prisoners re-
 portedly also are denied adequate medication and medical care. Severe overcrowding
 worsens the problem. For example, Ikoyi prison in Lagos, built to house about 800
 inmates holds over 2,000.
 The overnment derives considerable savings from the practice of leaving many
 children born in prison with their jailed mothers rather than placing them in foster
 homes.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The regime repeatedly engaged in arbi-
 trary arrest and detention. Police are empowered to make arrests without warrants
 if they believe there is reasonable suspicion of an offense; they often abuse this
 power. The law requires that the arresting officer inform the accused of charges at
 the time of arrest and take that person to a station for processing within a reason-
 able time. By law, police must provide suspects with the opportunity to engage
 counsel and to post bail. However, police generally do not adhere to these sale-
 guards. They often hold suspects incommunicado under harsh conditions for ex-
 tended periods without charge; arbitrary detention occurs frequently. Police also
 commonly place relatives and friends of wanted suspects in detention without crimi-
 nal charge in an effort to induce suspects to surrender to arrest.
 The State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree of 1984 (Decree Two) provides
 that the Government may detain without charge persons suspected of acts preju-
 dicial to state security or harmful to the economic well-being of the country. Wen
 invoked by the Vice President, the decree suspends the detainee's civil liberties and
 precludes judicial review. Many citizens consider Decree Two the main threat to
 their basic freedoms because the judicial ouster clause encourages arbitrary deten-
 tion and fails to define what constitutes acts prejudicial to state security or national
 economic well-being. Decree 11 of 1994 authorizes the PRC vice chairman or the
 Commissioner of Police to detain persons for up to 3 months. Decree 14 of 1994 for-
 bids courts to order the Government to produce prisoners in court, effectively sus-
 pending the right of habeas corpus.
 Throughout the year, especially following an abortive March 1 coup plot, the PRC
 relied heavily on arbitrary arrest and detention. Government security forces ar-
 rested and detained hundreds of military personnel and scores of civilians. On
 March 13, security forces arrested and detained former head of state Olusegun
 Obassanjo without charge in Lagos for 10 days, before security agents returned him
 to his Ota (Ogun state) farm, where they placed him under house arrest. Police also
 arrested Obassanjo's erstwhile deputy andNational Constitutional Conference dele-
 gate, Shehu Musa Yar'adua March 9, and detained him in Abuja before transferring
 him to Lagos' Kiri Kiri maximum security prison. On June 5, the Government con-
 vened a secret special military tribunal, chaired by Brigadier General Patrick Aziza,
 and formally charged 16 soldiers and 7 civilians with treason and conspiracy (see
 Section i.e.). On July 14, the Government announced that the tribunal had inves-
 tigated 51 suspects, of which it had convicted and sentenced 40, including
 Obassanjo's and Yar'adua, for treas      onspiracy, and concealment of treason.
 Three persons were declared "wanted" for their alleged roles in the coup plot; seven
 were released; and one was cleared of some charges, but was kept in detention for
 unspecified further investigations (see Section i.e.).
 The Government also arrested and detained without charge several prominent
 journalists, prodemocracy activists, and human rights campaigners for their alleged
 roles in the coup plot. On March 15, security agents arrested the publisher and edi-
 tor-in-chief of The Sunday Magazine, Chris Anyanwu, in response to her magazine's
 feature article entitled Coup Update: Blood Bath Soon." In May the Government
 arrested Tell magazine assistant editor George Mbah, The News magazine editor
 Kunle Ajibade, and Weekend Classique editor Ben Charles Obi. It detained them
 at Directorate of Military Intelligence headquarters in Lagos. On July 26 state secu-
 rity servie agents arrested Olatunji Abayosmi, one of Obassanjo's attorneys and
 Human Rights Africapresident; Tell Magaine correspondent Wole Adeyemu; and
 British Broadcasting Co ration assistant correspondent, Femi Shibewa. Adeyemu
 
 
 200
 and Shibewa were detained and interrogated overnight and released. On July 27,
 the Government arrested Beko Ransome-Kuti, chairman of the Campaign for De-
 mocracy (CD), after he criticized Abayomi's arrest and questioned the veracity of the
 alleged coup plot. The Aziza Tribunal charged, convicted, and sentenced Anyanwu,
 Mbah, Ajibade, Obi, and Ransome-Kuti for treason, conspiracy, concealment of trea-
 son, and other alleged "anti-regime" activities. Ransome-Kuti was sentenced to life
 imprisonment, whih Abacha reduced to 15 years in October (see Section i.e.).
 addion to arrests related to the alleged coup plot, the Government routinely
 arrested and detained without charge leading human rights and prodemocracy ac-
 tivists. In January security agents arrested and detained for 10 days Ransome-Kuti
 and Femi Falana. Falana is chairman of the National Association of Democratic
 Lawyers. On January 17, the Government arrested Sylvester Odion-Akhaine, sec-
 retary general of the CD, and Shehu Sani, CD's Northern Nigeria organizer. It de-
 tained both without charge and repeatedly ignored court orders to produce and jus-
 tify their continued detention. On April 20, security agents in Abuja arrested and
 detained without charge Dr. Ore Falomo, the personal physician of chief Moshood
 K.O. Abiola. Falomo was detained in Kaduna prison until his release on April 23.
 No official reason was given for his arrest and detention.
 In May and June, the Government expanded its crackdown, arresting scores of
 prodemocracy activists in a series of preemptive strikes prior to the second anniver-
 sary of the annulled 1993 presidential election. In mid-May security agents arrested
 Olawale Oshun, acting general secretary of the National Democratic Coalition
 (NADECO), Josephine Okei, NADECO assistant secretary, and Femi Falana after
 NADECO announced plans to convene a commemorative convention in Lagos in
 early June. On June 1, government security forces arrested and detained Ransome-
 Kuti, Kwara state NADECO chairman Wole Oke, former Social Democratic Party
 presidential aspirant and NADECO activist Olu Falae, and former Kwara state gov-
 ernor and NADECO national publicity director Cornelius Adebayo. In addition,
 Ondo state security forces arrested and detained the octogenarian NADECO leader
 Chief Michael Adekunle Ajasin, and 39 members of his Yoruba political and cultural
 association known as Afenifere and charged them with holding an unauthorized po-
 litical meeting at Ajasin's house. On June 7, the Government arrested, interrogated,
 and released Olisa Agbakoba, president of the Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO)
 and two CLO employees, Steve Aluko and Tunde Akannu. Agbakoba was rearrested
 on June 9 and detained for 2 weeks. No official reasons were given for their arrests
 and detention.
 On July 3, security agents arrested Gani Fawehinmi, National Conscience Party
 (NCP) president, and detained him without charge for 2 weeks. Although no official
 reason was given for Fawehinmi's arrest, it followed his July 2 press conference dur-
 ing which he had boldly criticized the Abacha regime and denounced the Govern-
 ment's provisional lifting of the ban on political activity (see Section 2.b.). Also in
 July, the Government arrested Chima Ubani, the secretary general of the Demo-
 cratic Alternative (DA), Osagie Obayuwana, the Deputy National President of CD,
 and CLO executive director Abdul Oroh. No official reasons were given for their ar-
 rests and the Government ignored a Lagos federal high court order to produce and
 justify Oroh's detention. In late July, federal Ministry of Justice attorneys told the
 Lagos federal high court that Abayomi and Ubani were being held under provisions
 of the State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree of 1984. In September police
 again arrested Gani Fawehinmi along with five fellow NCP activists as Fawehinmi
 was about to address a party rally in Lagos. All six were arraigned and released
 on their personal rcognizance 3 days after their arrest. Misdemeanor charges
 against Fawehinmi included unlawful assembly and conduct liable to breach the
 public peace. Trial on the misdemeanors was set for January 1996.
 Throughout the year, government forces harassed and detained members of
 MOSOP, including Ken Saro-Wiwa's brother and sister-in-law Owns and Kiana
 Wiwa. Saro-Wiwa, Ledum Mitee, Barionem Kiobel, and 11 others also remained in
 detention in Port Harcourt's Bori Military Camp, with limited access to their law-
 yers, families or doctors until the end o the  roceedings. A court convicted Saro-
 Wiwa and eight others, who received sentences of death by hanging. The other five
 defendants were released. The "Ogoni Nine" were executed November 10 (see Sec-
 tion l.a.). In August the Rivers state internal security task force arrested four
 MOSOP activists including Lekue Lah-Loolo, Baton Mitee, Professor Meshack
 Karanwi, and a cameraman who filmed several videos subsequently incorporated
 into British television documentaries critical of the Government and multinational
 oil companies. Following the Ogoni executions, several clergymen and others were
 arrested and detained briefly to preclude any organized mourning or possible dem-
 onstrations.
 
 
 201
 Several leading labor and prodemocracy activists, who were arrested in 1993, re-
 mained in detention at year's end, including- M.K.O. Abiola; Fred Eno, personal aide
 to Abiola; Olu Akerele, Cororate Affairs Manager of the Abiola-owned Concord
 PressFrank Kokori, Genera Secretaiy of the National Union of Petroleum, Energy,
 and Gas Workers (NUPENG); Wariebi Kojo Agamene, President of NUPENG;
 Addo first president of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association
 (PENGASSAN); and P. Aidelomon, a PENGASSAN branch chairman.
 The above cases were not isolated. The Government routinely detained human
 rights monitors, journalists, and political opponents throughout the year for making
 or publishing critical statements. Government security forces frequently harassed,
 arrested, and detained journalists for a variety of reasons, including the alleged
 spreading of false information and stories that exposed the actions of government
 officials (see Section 2.a.).
 Most often the authorities did not charge detainees with a crime, held them for
 only brief periods, and questioned them about their activities and statements. Nig
 ria's total prison population is estimated at 65,000. A precise figure for the number
 of persons detained without charge is unavailable. However, CLO estimates that
 50,000 prisoners, nearly 77 percent of the total prison population, are still awaiting
 trial.
 There are no reliable estimates of the number of political detainees. At year's end,
 annulled 1993 presidential election victor M.K.O. Abiola remained detained in pris-
 on, despite a November 1994 ruling by the Kaduna Federal High Court of Appeals
 granting him bail on the condition that he "not disturb the peace." In December
 1994 the same court overruled its earlier decision, and Abiola's attorneys appealed
 to the Supreme Court. In May eight Supreme Court justices, including Chief Justice
 Mohammed Bello, withdrew from hearing the case because of a libel suit they had
 pending against Abiola's Concord Press, effectively suspending hearings of Abiola's
 appeal until new justices are named to the court. Abiola's trial on treason charges
 remained suspended indefinitely on orders from the regime. Other long-term olti-
 cal detainees, such as Olatunji Abayomi, Frank Kokori, and Abdul Oroh, continued
 to be held without trial.
 There were no known instances of forced exile as a means of political control, al-
 though several NADECO members, including former Third Republic Senator Bola
 Tinabu, retired Air Commodore Dan Suleiman, and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka
 were in self-imposed exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-To suppress opposition to its rule, the regime first
 bypassed the regular courts in favor of "tribunals" and then declared itself above
 the law by prohibiting court review of any government action. Sentences are gen-
 erally severe. The Government's reliance on tribunals, which operate outside the
 constitutional court system, seriously undermines the judiciary's independence and
 often results in legal proceedings that deny defendants due process.
 The regular court system is composed of both federal and state trial courts, state
 appeals courts, the federal Court of Appeal, and the federal Supreme Court. Under
 the 1979 constitution, courts of the first instance include magistrate or district
 courts, customary or area courts, Shari'a (Islamic) Courts, and for some specified
 cases, the state high courts. The nature of the case usually determines which court
 has jurisdiction. In principle, customary and Shari'a courts have jurisdiction only if
 both plaintiff and defendant agree to accept it. In practice, fear of legal costs, delay,
 and distance to alternative courts encourage many litigants to choose these courts.
 Decree One of 1984, the basic Constitution (modification and suspension) decree,
 the first decree promulgated by the military officers who overthrew the civilian re-
 gime of President Shehu Usman Aniyu Shagari in 1983, left the institutional frame-
 work of the judiciaiy relatively intact. However, it established a parallel system of
 military tribunals with sole jurisdiction over certain offenses, such as coup plotting,
 corruption, armed robbery, and illegal sale of petroleum. A 1991 decree amended
 Decree One by providing that only sitting or retired civilian judges may preside over
 tribunals hearing nonmilitary cases.
 The PRC retained the tribunal framewoik. In most cases before the tribunals, the
 accused have the right to legal counsel, bail, and appeal, although some tribunals
 substitute a presumption of guilt for the presumption of innocence, and conviction
 rates in the tribunals reportedly exceed conviction rates in the regular courts. In
 practice tribunal proceedings often deny defendants due process.
 For example, in late 1994 the Government set up the Ogeni Civil Disturbances
 Special Tribunal o ttry Ken Saro-iwa and others for their alleged roles in the
 killings of four prominent Ogoni politicians in May 1994 (see Sections 1.d. and 5).
 On February 6, Saro-Wiwa and four others pleaded not guilty to charges that they
 procured and counseled others to murder the politicians. _On arch 28, the tribunal
 charged 10 additional suspects and merged the cases with the ongoing case against
 
 
 202
 Saro-Wiwa. In June the 18-member defense team led by Gani Fawehinmi withdrew
 in protest after the Government refused to comply with a tribunal order to produce
 a videotape recorded May 22 1994 at Port Harcourt's Government House in which
 State Administrator Lt. Colonel Dauda Komo proclaimed that Saro-Wiwa was
 "guilty of murder.'
 In July Saro-Wiwa's tribunal-appointed legal aid counsel attorney resigned from
 the case, saying that his client refused to cooperate. In August the tribunal's chair-
 man, Justice Ibrahim Auta, advised Saro-Wiwa and the others to cooperate with
 their newly appointed lawyers and suggested that failure to do so was not in their
 "best interest because it would not stop tribunal proceedings. On October 31, the
 tribunal announced guilty verdicts and death sentences for Saro-Wiwa and eight
 other Ogoni activists. The PRC "confirmed" this decision November 8 and executed
 all nine November 10 (see Section l.a.).
 On June 5, the Government convened a secret special military tribunal, chaired
 by Brigadier General Patrick Aziza, and charged 16 soldiers including 4 colonels
 (Lawan Gwadabe, RS. Bello-Fadile, R.A. Emokpae, 0. Oloruntoba), 7 Lt. Colonels
 (SE. Oyewole, K. Happy Bulus, MA. Igwe, R.D. Obiki, V.0. Bamgbose, OE. Nyong
 C.P. Izuorgu), 3 Captains (M.A. Ibrahim, A.A. Ogunsuyi U.S.A. Suleiman), Second
 Lieutenant RichardEmonvhe, Staff Sergeant Patrick Usikpeko, and 7 civilians (Ret.
 Lt. Colonel MA. Ajayi, Ret. Major Akinloye Akinyemi, Felix Ndmaigida, Peter
 Ijala, Julius Badejo, Matthew Popoola, Sanusi Mato) with treason, concealment of
 treason, and conspiracy. The Government claims the defendants were tried in ac-
 cordance with military law and had appointed military lawyers. There were credible
 reports that most military lawyers refused to represent the alleged coup plotters be-
 cause they saw it as a "losing proposition." On June 30, the Lagos federal high
 court dismissed Akinloye Akinyemi's suit challenging the constitutionality of the tri-
 bunal. Judge Vincent Eigbedion termed Akinyemi's lawsuit "foolhardy and incom-
 prehensible" and based the court's decision on the "ouster" clauses contained in the
 1990 Special Military Tribunal Act which prevent the judiciary from interfering
 with tribunal matters. The tribunal charged, convicted, and sentenced prominent
 human rights activists, journalists, and others, including relatives of the coup sus-
 pects, for their alleged "antiregime" activities throughout July and August.
 In October the Government announced that the PRC and Abacha had approved
 final sentences for those convicted of participation in the coup plot. However,
 Abacha reduced the original sentences passed by the tribunal due to the inter-
 national campaign for clemency for the coup plotters. The death sentences of
 Akinyeml, Gwadabe, Oloruntoba and Bello-Fadile were commuted to life imprison-
 ment. The death sentences for conviction of conspiracy to commit treason of
 Yar'adua, Bulus, Oyewole, Emokpae, Igwe, Lt. Col. Ajayi, and four others were com-
 muted to 25 years. The life sentences for convictions of concealment of Obaangjo,
 Ibrahim, Usikepo, Mato, Ndmaigida, Badejo, Popoola, Obiki and eight others were
 reduced to 15 years. Long-term political detainee George Mbah was convicted along
 with the coup plotters. Mbah's conviction was reduced Trom life imprisonment to 15
 years. Prison terms for a variety of other offenses were similarly reduced. Military
 personnel who had been discharged but not tried were to be released and discharged
 irm service.
 The Government's frequent refusal to respect court rulings also undercuts the
 independence and integrity of the judiciary. In April and May, government security
 agents at Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) twice ignored court or-
 ders termitting Gani Fawehinmi to travel abroad (see Section 2.d.). On April 10, se-
 curity agents told Fawehinmi that they had been instructed to ignore an April 6
 Lagos federal high court order and to prevent Fawehinmi from boarding a British
 Airways flight to London. Fawehinmi alleged that the head of state personally or-
 dered that he not be allowed to travel abroad for urgently needed medical treatment
 because he was seen as a threat to the Government. In August the Government ig-
 nored Lagos federal high court orders to produce and justify the continued detention
 of CLO executive director, Abdul Oroh, and CD Chairman Beko Ransome-Kuti. The
 state security service initially ignored court orders to produce and justify the deten-
 tion of Olatunji Abayomi and Chima Ubani, then declared that it held them under
 Decree Two provisions.
 Seriously damaging the shred of credibility the judiciary retained, the regime in
 August 1994 declared itself above the law. Decree 12 of 1994 states that "no act of
 the federal military government may be questioned henceforth in a court of law,"
 and "divests all courts of jurisdiction in all matters concerning the authority of the
 federal Government."
 Criminal justice procedures call for trial within 3 months of arraignment for most
 categories of crimes. Inefficient administrative procedures, petty extortion, bureau-
 cratic inertia, poor communication between police and prison officials, and inad-
 
 
 203
 equate transportation continue to result in considerable delays, often stretching to
 several years in bringing suspects to trial.
 Trials in the regular court system are public and generally respect constitu-
 tionally protected individual rights, including a presumption of innocence, the right
 to be present, to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to be represented by
 legal counsel.
 There are no legal provisions barring women or other groups from testifying in
 civil court or for giving their testimony less weight. The testimony of women is,
 however, accorded less weight in Shari a courts. There is a widespread perception
 that judges are easily bribed, or "settled," and that the litigants cannot rely on the
 courts to render impartial judgment.
 The number of political prisoners (as distinct from political detainees) held by the
 Government was also unknown.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Provi-
 sions of the 1979 and 1989 constitutions provide for the rights to privacy in the
 home, in correspondence, and in oral electronic communications. However, the mili-
 tary government regularly interfered in the lives of its citizens, and if the authori-
 ties desired to use a warrant in a particular search case, they often secured it from
 a military tribunal rather than a regular court. Human rights and prodemocracy
 leaders, including Gani Fawehinmi, Glory Kilanko, and Oisa Agbakoba, reported
 that security agents regularly followed them and cut off or monitored their organiza-
 tions' telephones. Crdible sources reportan increase in harassment and intimida-
 tion by plie an   mitary units in Ogonland following the execution of Ken Saro-
 Wiwa and the eight other Ogoni activists. Abuses perpetrated in Ogoniland included
 random search oT houses and cars without warrants or probable cause and preven-
 tion of any public display of mourning for the Ogoni Nine.
 A 1995 money laundering decree allows the National Drug Law Enforcement
 Agency to monitor telephone communications, access computer systems, and obtain
 bank and financial records of individual and corporate customers.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Abacha regime often publicly declared its
 support for these freedoms, but it nevertheless sought to confine public political dia-
 logue to the constitutional conference. The regime also increased its systematic in-
 timidation of the press through legal and extralegal means throughout the year.
 Constitutional provisions providing for freedom of speech and the press are not en-
 forceable because of continued suspension of constitutional rights.
 There is a large and vibrant press, which is frequently critical of the Government.
 Nonetheless, the Government directly owns or controls many newspapers and has
 shut down several others. The Government granted broadcasting rghlts to private
 radio stations for the first time in 1994.
 The Government used a variety of methods to repress its many critics. In January
 and February it extended its August 1994 decrees proscribing for 6 months three
 newspaper publishing houses: the Concord Group; the Punch Group; and the Guard-
 ian Group. These new decrees granted the Abacha regime and its agents legal im-
 munity from challenges to actions it took to implement the decrees, even when the
 action predated the decree. In July it rescinded the Guardian proscription order re-
 portedly after that publishing group's owner and former Interior Minister, Alex
 Ibr, personally apologized or having offended the Head of State. In October
 Abacha announced the removal of the earlier bans on Punch and the National Con-
 cord, expressing the "hope that these media houses will now operate responsibly
 within the law and in the national interest."
 Throughout the year, government security agents frequently harassed, arrested,
 and detained journalists. In January security agents arrested Sani Abdullahi and
 Yusuf Dingyadi, Hausa Service reporters for the Voice of America (VOA) and British
 Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) respectively, and detained them without charge.
 The Government accused the pair of spreading false information, inciting religious
 hatred, and broadcasting inaccurate reports about religious clashes in Sokoto (see
 Section 5). In March security agents arrested Bayo Onanuga, editor-in-chief of The
 News, Tempo, and P.M. News, after The News reported on meningitis and cholera
 epidemics in Enugu, badan, and Kaduna, three of four proposed host cities for the
 1995 Junior Soccer World Cup. In May the Government arrested and detained an
 A.M. News reporter after he published a story alleging that the chief of general
 staff, General Oladipo Diya, had been a victim of advance fee fraud, commonly
 known as "419." In July security operatives arrested Babafemi Ojudu, A.M. News
 Editor, and Olusesan Ekinsola, the general manager of Ray Power 100.5, the only
 private radio station in Nigeria. Although no official reasons were given for their
 arrests, it was widely believed to be in response to a broadcast that soldiers had
 
 
 204
 laid siege to an Ikeja police station. In August Enugu state police arrested and de-
 tained Louis Onyia, correspondent for The-Week magazine, who refused to disclose
 his source of information regarding an article that the state police commissioner had
 consulted "oracles" to assist police investigations.
 Government repression of journalists continued through the summer with the Au-
 gust 7 arrest of Fred Ohwahwa, Third Eye on Sunday editor, and the August 31
 arrest of Osa Director, Tell Magazine's Kano bureau chief. No official reasons were
 given for their arrest and detention. In September security agents arrested the man-
 M   g director of Sub-Saharan Press Limited ( ublishers of The Week magazine),
 uh0 Mamah, and The Week editor Godwin Abroko. No reasons were given for
 their arrest; however it was most likely in response to the magazine's September
 11 feature entitled "Abacha's Illness: Top Aides Struggle to Take Over."
 The Government increased harassment of the independent press in December. In-
 formation Minister Walter Ofonagoro led a high profile campaign warning journal-
 ists not to publish articles against the interests of the Government. Security agents
 increased their overall efforts to intimidate, harass, and arrest prodemocracy jour-
 nalists.
 On December 16, the headquarters of The Guardian was set on fire. Press ac-
 counts said that the fire "was set by men reportedly dressed in military uniform."
 On December 17, the Government detained staff of Tell Magazine, then seized that
 publication's entire print run, which featured a headline article, "Abiola Freedom."
 n December 23, the State Security Service (SSS) confiscated approximately 32,000
 copies of the January 1 edition of Tell Magazine at the Academy Printing Press in
 Ilupeju and ransacked Tell offices in Ikeja. Several hours later, the SSS arrested
 Nosa Igiebr, editor-in-chief of Tell. On December 31, arsonists set fire to the offices
 of the Independent Communcations Network Limited, publishers of The News and
 Tempo. There were credible reports that the fire was set by the SSS.
 The Government also denied entry to and deported foreign journalists, including
 two South Africa-based journalists, Henrick Thomsen and 7Ric Miller, of a leading
 Danish daly newspaper. In May it seized thousands of copies of the May 22 inter-
 national edition of Newsweek magazine which contained an article critical of the
 Head of State.
 The military government used a number of other means to intimidate the press.
 These included a decree banning government offices from advertising in nongovern-
 ment media, periodic directives to government offices forbidding the purchase of cer-
 tain publications, personal attacks in government-controlled media against journal-
 ists and others who challenged government policies, and threats of harassment of
 potential advertisers and investors in antigovernment publications. In August the
 regime dismissed both Tunji Oseni, chief executive of the government-controlled
 Daily Times newspaper, and its board of directors. It appointed a sole administrator,
 Innocent Oparadike, in their place.
 Television, both Nigerian and foreign, is widely available. Access is limited more
 by substandard cable installation, electrical power surges and outages, and technical
 broadcasting difficulties than by government intervention.
 Academic freedom is generally respected, although the head of Ahmadu Bello Uni-
 versity's Political Science Department claimed that faculty cannot in fact conduct re-
 search. There were credible reports that the Government secretly tape recorded con-
 versations among faculty at the University of Ibadan and the University of Lagos.
 Security agents subsequently confronted faculty members with the recordings and
 interrogated them concerning their alleged political activities. Some student groups
 believe university authorities follow government directives to suspend or expel activ-
 ist students.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The two constitutions provide
 citizens with the right to assemble freely and associate with other persons in politi-
 cal parties, trade unions, or other special interest associations. However, the Gov-
 ernment proscribed all political activity 1 day after coming into power in 1993. In
 Augst 1994, General Abacha announced that "individuals or groups may hence-
 forth canvass poitical ideas, but they cannot form political parties for now." On
 March 3, Thadan police stopped a rally marking the end of Ramadan at Oke Ado
 market after an announement that prominent Thadan politician Lamidi Adedibu
 was scheduled to speak. In May the Edo and Oyo state military administrators is-
 sued orders indefinitely banning all political and tribal meetings. In June the Gov-
 ernment arrested 39 supporters of Afenifere, and charged them with holding an un-
 authorized political meeting (see Section 1.d.).
 On June 27, Abacha announced a partial lifting of the month-old ban on political
 activity. Enthusiasm over the lifting of the ban was muted, however, by Abacha's
 announcement that no political activities would be allowed until the moribund Na-
 tional Electoral Commission (NEC) was reconstituted. The only immediate effect of
 
 
 205
 Abacha's announcement was that political and cultural associations, such as
 Afenifere, NADECO, and Gani Fawehinni's NCP, theoretically could establish
 themselves as political parties. Only 1 week after Abacha s announcement,
 Fawehinmi was arrested for holding an illegal olitical rally in Lagos.
 Permits are not normally required for public meetings indoors, and permit re-
 quirements for outdoor public functions are often ignored by both Government and
 those assembling. However, the Abacha government retained the authority of De-
 cree Five of the Babangida government, which had banned gatherings whose politi-
 cal, ethnic or religious content it believed might lead to unrest.
 Althougih Abacha announced the lifting of restrictions on political activities in his
 October I Independence Day address, he issued no enabling decree. The Lagos po-
 lice chief refused to grant the NADECO a permit for a mid-December rally, disburs-
 ing the 10,000 people in attendance with clubs and tear gas. Police also aborted a
 mid-December rally in Abeokuta in support of the release of Abiola, Ransome-Kiti,
 and Obasanjo. CD Acting Chair Frederick Fasehun and others arrested at the still-
 born rally have been charged with sedition, disturbance of the peace, and unlawful
 assembly. On December 27, the Government issued a directive that all universities
 be closed, reportedly to prevent the use of students for illegal rallies by
 prodemocracy groups. At year's end, the Government continued to repress the politi-
 cal activities of opposition groups.
 Open-air religious services away from places of worship remain prohibited in most
 states due to religious tensions in various parts of the country.
 Religious, professional, and other organizations need not register with the Govern-
 ment and are generally permitted freely to associate with other national and foreign
 bodies. The PRC retained its ban on several political organizations which it con-
 tended were founded primarily along ethnic, tribal, religious, or other parochial
 lines for the purpose of sponsoring various political candidates.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government generally respects freedom of belief
 practice, and religious education which had been provided for by the suspended
 1979 and 1989 constitutions. Decree One (suspending most of the 1979 constitution)
 and the stillborn 1989 constitution also prohibited federal and state governments
 from adopting a state religion, and the PRC reaffrmed the secular nature of the
 state in its instructions to the constitutional conference. The Government instituted
 a ban in 1987 (which is still in effect) on religious organizations on campuses of pri-
 mary schools, although individual students retain the right to practice their religion
 in recognized places of worship.
 Distrbution of religious publications is generally unrestricted. There is a lightly
 enforced ban on pubished religious advertisements, and reigious programming on
 television and radio remains closely controlled by the Government. Both Christian
 and Muslim organizations allege that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Immi-
 gration Department continue to restrict the entry into the country of certain reli-
 gious practitioners, particularly persons suspetedofproselizing. While it has not
 outlawed the practice, the Government discourages proselytizing in the belief that
 it stirs up religious tensions, particularly in the predominantly Islamic north.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The two constitutions entitle citizens to move freely throughout the
 country and reside where they wish. However, increasing violent crime in many
 parts of the country prompted police to set up roadblocks and checkpoints, where
 officials commonly engaged in extortion, violence, and excessive use of force.
 Those constitutions also prohbited expulsion or the denial of exit or entry to any
 citizen. In practice, however, women must often obtain permission from a male fam-
 ily member before being granted a passport, and the Government, like its prede-
 cessors, occasionally prevented travel for political reasons.
 For example, in August the Government prevented Gani Fawehinmi from exiting
 Port Harcourt Airport and "deported" him back to Lagos. Government security
 agents told Fawehinmi that they had "orders from above" that he not be allowed
 to enter Port Harcourt; not to talk to anyone or address any gathering; and that
 he be returned to Lagos "immediately." In April and May, government security
 agents at MMIA twice prevented Fawehinmi from boarding an international flight.
 Fawehinmi subsequently managed to travel abroad, but government security agents
 immediately seized his passport upon his return to Lagos.
 Throughout the year the Government routinely seized the passports of its critics.
 On June 7, government security agents at MMIA seized the passport and plane tick-
 et of Abiola s attorney, Godwin Aayi, prior to his planned departure to attend an
 international Bar Association conference. On June 30, the Government confiscated
 the passport of prominent feminist, Glory Kilanko, who, 1 week before, criticized the
 Government's human rights record at a British Commonwealth NGO forum in Wel-
 lington, New Zealand. In August the Government seized the passports of Nigerian
 
 
 206
 Bar Association President Priscilla Kuye, Women in Nigeria representative Nyoko
 Toyo, Citizen magazine editor Bilikisu Yusufu, and Mere Mandara and prevented
 them from traveling to the Fourth United Nations Conference on Women in Beijing.
 In March government security agents seized former head of state Olusegun
 Obasanjo's passport after he returned from the United Nations World Summit on
 Social Development.
 Journalists reported harassment at the nation's airports by security officials
 throughout the year, including having to fill out a special exit and entry form detail-
 ing their movements abroad, reasons for making their trip, and friends and associ-
 ates overseas. Security officials harassed or temporarily confiscated the passports of
 journalists who refused to complete the form. There were credible reports that the
 Government had assigned military security personnel to MMIA to screen departing
 passengers to apprehend prodemocracy supporters. Government security agents
 were instructed to question extensively citizens who had been issued United States
 visas. If the agents were not satisfied with the responses, they had orders to seize
 passports and turn the suspects over to military intelligence and state security serv-
 ice personnel for additional questioning.
 Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge and asylum for political refu-
 gees from other countries. The Government cooperates with the Lagos office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in dealing with an estimated 4,300
 Liberian, 1,400 Chadian, 580 Cameroonian, 140 Ghanaian, and an undetermined
 number of Togolese, Somalian, Sudanese, and Ethiopian refugees. There were no re-
 ports that refugees were expelled from Nigeria in 1995.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens could not exercise this right in 1995 and there was little indication that
 General Abacha's military regime was willing to permit them to do so on any basis
 other than a process tightly controlled by the regime. Throughout the year, the re-
 gime committed numerous, repeated, and egregious human rights abuses in its ef-
 ort to prevent citizens from opposing it by peaceful political means.
 After coming to power, the rvisional Ruling Council headed by General Abacha
 promised a return to civilian, democratic rule but did not provide a timetable. The
 regime instead convened a constitutional conference which prepared a draft con-
 stitution, but did not set a definitive date for the termination of military rule. In
 his October 1 Independence Day address, Abacha announced a transition timetable
 leading to inauguration of a civilian president on October 1, 1998. The process was
 to begin with the adoption of a new constitution, lifting of all restrictions on political
 activities, establishment of an electoral commission, creation of committees on tran-
 sition implementation, national reconciliation, and federal character, and appoint-
 ment of a panel on creation of new state and local governments, all within the final
 3 months of 1995. The transition program further provides for a series of local, state
 and federal elections over a perio dof 3 years. It does not provide for any meaningful
 civilian participation, other than in elections, and Abacha has not indicated any in-
 tention to relinquish control during the transition process.
 So far, Abacha has made no meaningful progress in the 3-year transition pro-
 gran. The new constitution proposed by the National Constitutional Conference in
 June was never adopted. Only in early December did Abacha take the first step
 when he approved the composition of three of the transition committees. On Decem-
 ber 22, Abacha announced the establishment of the last three committees. However,
 Abacha never issued enabling decrees for any of the new bodies, without which they
 are powerless. By year's end, no positive action in the direction of civilian rule had
 emerged from any of the bodies.
 Nigerian politics remains dominated by men. However, there are no legal impedi-
 ments to political participation or voting by women or members of any other minor-
 ity group. There are three women in the PRC's Federal Executive Council.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permitted local human rights groups to operate but often inter-
 fered with their activities, detaining their members and preventing them from criti-
 cizing the Government's human rights record (see Sections 1.d. and 2.a). High-level
 government officials regularly denounced the activities of Nigeria's human rights
 community, often accusing its members and the independent press of participating
 in foreign-inspired plots to destabilize the country.
 Notwithstanding the Government's hostile attitude, national and international
 human rights groups engaged in a vocal and public campaign for the promotion of
 human rights. Among the most active organizations are: the CLO; the Committee
 
 
 207
 for the Defense of Human Rights (CDHR); the CD; the Constitutional Rights Project
 (CRP); the National Association of Democratic Lawyers; Human Rights Africa
 (HRA); the HRM; the NCP; the Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law-
 the Legal Research and Resource Development Center; the National Association of
 University Women; the International Federation of Women Lawyers; Women in Ni-
 geria; andthe Human Rights Committee of the Nigeian Bar Association. A number
 of prominent authors, including Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, artists, educators,
 and jurists, in addition to professional and labor organizations, spoke out frequently
 on human rights issues as well. Amnesty International is active in Nigeria, and the
 International Committee of the Red Cross has a regional office based in Lagos.
 The Government smetimes prevented foreign human rights monitoring groups
 and individuals from visiting Nigeria In Augst government security agents de-
 tained and deported two South African-based journalsts for a Danish newspaper
 (see Section 2.a.). The pair had planned to meet with leading human rights and
 prodemocracy activists, as well as MOSOP representatives, during their 2-week
 visit. In Jul the Government refused the United Nations Human Rights Commis-
 sion's  M    C) Working Group on Arbitrary Detention permission to visit, citing
 the UNHRC's failure to respond to a joint CLO, CRP, MOSOP, CD, CDHR, and
 HRA request on July 24 to send a country mission to assess the human rights situa-
 tion. The Government admitted British Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative
 delegation representatives to the country in July but denied them access to detain-
 ees.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, Social Status, or
 Disability
 Both the 1979 and 1989 constitutions provide citizens with the right to freedom
 from discrimination based on "community, place of origin, ethnic group, sex, reli-
 gion, or political opinion." However, customary and religious discrimination against
 women persists, while tension between the Government and disaffected minority
 ethnic groups is on the rise.
 Women.-Reports of spousal abuse are common, especially wife-beating in polygy-
 nous families. Police do not normally intervene in domestic disputes, which are sel-
 dom discussed publicly. In more traditional areas, it is questionable whether the
 courts and police actively intervene to protect women who formally accuse their hus-
 bands if the level of alleged abuse does not exceed customary norms in the area.
 Purdah, the Islamic practice of keeping girls and women in seclusion from men out-
 side the family, is prevalent in parts of Nigeria's far north. Women also bear the
 brunt of attacks for social and religious reasons, particularly for "immodest" or "in-
 appropriate" behavior.
 Women experience considerable discrimination as well as physical abuse. There
 are no laws barring women from particular fields of employment, but women often
 experience discrimination because the Government tolerates customary and reli-
 gious practices which adversely affect them. While the number of women in the for-
 mal sector increases every year, women do not receive equal pay for equal work and
 often find it extremely difficult to acquire commercial credit or obtain tax deductions
 or rebates as the heads of households.
 While some women have made considerable individual progress, both in the aca-
 demic and business world, most are underprivileged. Though women are not legally
 barred from owning land, under some customary land tenure systems only men can
 own land, and women gain access to land through marriage or family. In addition,
 many customary practices do not recognize a woman's right to inherit her husband's
 property, and many widows are rendered destitute when their in-laws take virtually
 all of the deceased husband's property. In other areas, a widow herself is considered
 part of the property, and she too may be "inherited" by the husband's eldest male
 relative. Polygyny is widely practiced among all ethnic groups in both Christian and
 Islamic communities. Women often must provide permission from a male family
 member to obtain a passport (see Section 2.d.).
 Children.-The Government only occasionally condemns child abuse and neglect
 and makes little effort to stop customary practices, such as the sale of children into
 marriage. It remains only sporadically committed to children's welfare. Public
 schools continue to deteriorate, and limited facilities precluded access to education
 for some children. While the Government increased spending on children's health
 in recent years, it seldom enforced even the inadequate laws designed to protect the
 rights of children. Although the law stipulates that "no child shall be ordered to be
 imprisoned," juvenile offenders are routinely denied bail and incarcerated along
 with hardened criminals.
 There are credible reports that poor families often sell their daughters into mar-
 riage as a means of supplementing their incomes. There are also reports that many
 
 
 young girls are forced into marriage as soon as they reach puberty, regardless of
 age to revent "indecency" associated with premarital sex.
 The government publicly oppses female genital mutilation (FGM), which is wide-
 lycondemned by internationaihealth experts as damaging to both hysical and psy-
 chological health. Nigeria cosponsored a resolution at the Fourth World Health As-
 sembly calling for the elimination of harmful health practices, including FGM. How-
 ever, the Government has taken no action to abolish the procedure, and nearly all
 ethnic groups subject young females to it. Nigerian experts estimate that as many
 as 50 percent of Nigerian women, primarily in the Christian south but less in the
 Muslim north, may have undergone FGM, which varies from simple removal of the
 clitoral hood or labia minora to excision of the clitoris and the most dangerous form,
 infibulation.
 The age at which females are subjected to FGM varies from the first week of life
 to after a woman delivers her first child. The Ministry of Health and NGO's sponsor
 public awareness and education projects to inform communities of the health haz-
 ards of FGM. The press openly condeemned the practice on a number of occasions.
 People With Disabilities.-While the Government called for private businesses to
 institute policies ensuring fair treatment of the 2 percent of the work force that it
 claims is disabled, it has not enacted any laws fostering greater accessibility to
 buildings and public transportation, nor has it formulated any policy which specifi-
 cally ensures the right of the disabled to work.
 National/Racial fEthnic Minorities.-The Government has promulgated no official
 policy concerning discrimination against any of Nigeria's 250 ethnic groups, and
 laws do not favor one group over another. However, Nigeria has a long history of
 tension among its diverse ethnic groups. Clashes continued between rival ethnic
 groups in Delta, Rivers, Benue, Cross River, Plateau, and Taraba states, often re-
 sulting in casualties. Tradition continues to impose considerable pressure on indi-
 viduaagovernment officials to favor their own ethnic group, and ethnic favoritism
 ersists. The Ogoni, an ethnic group indigenous to Rivers state in eastern Nigeria
 (igeria's oil producing region), maintain that the Government continues to engage
 in a systematic campaign to deprive them of their land and its wealth.
 Members of the Ogoni group claim that the Government seizes Ogoni property
 without fair compensation, ignores the environmental impact of oil production on
 Ogoni land, and fails to provide adequate public services, such as water and elec-
 tricity. MOSOP, which campaigns for greater Ogoni autonomy, often describes gov-
 ernment policy towards the Ogoni as genocide. The confrontation between the Gov-
 ernment and the Ogoni has increasingly turned violent, and Ogoni concerns about
 environmental degradation and the quality of social services in the oil producing re-
 gion have merit. Despite this, accusations that the Government is engaged in a gen-
 ocidal campaign against the Ogoni are unfounded. Other ethnic minorities, particu-
 larly in Delta, Rivers, and Akwa Ihom states, have echoed Ogoni claims of environ-
 mental degradation and government indifference to their development. Groups such
 as the Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Urhobo have grown increasingly vocal in expressing their
 unhappiness, while the prevalence of ethnic conflict and confrontation with govern-
 ment forces increased in these areas.
 Religious Minorities.-The law prohibits religious discrimination. Nonetheless, it
 is commonly reported that government officials often discriminate against persons
 practicing a religion different from their own. Religious tensions often lead to vio-
 lence, as in January, May, and June when clashes between Muslims and Christians
 in the northern cities of Kano and Sokoto resulted in scores of deaths and the par-
 tial destruction of each city's central market. In response, the Christian Association
 of Nigeria condemned the killings,  alleged officl indifference to the incidents.
 To date the Government has not prosecuted anyone for the killings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associetion.-Although basic labor legislation dating to 1974 re-
 mains in place, decrees enacted in 1994 that dissolved eleted national executive
 councils of the Nigeria Labor Coness (NLC) and two key oil sector unions and
 placed them under the authority of government-appointed sole administrators have
 effectively emasculated the labor movement. Nigeria has signed and ratified the
 International Labor Organization's (ILO) Convention on Freedom of Association, but
 there are no safeguards preventing the Government from interfering in the adminis-
 tration of labor unions. The Government's exercise of absolute power over the affairs
 of the NLC, NUPENG, and (PENGASSAN) fly in the face of international obliga-
 tions and demands by numerous international bodies. Although the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the World Confederation of Labor and
 the Organization of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU) filed a complaint with the
 1L committee on freedom of association following the 1994 dismissal of the three
 
 
 209
 
 National Executive Councils the Government had not responded positively by year's
 end. Instead, it kept NUPENG General Secretary Frank Kokori and President
 Waribi Agamene and two officials of PENGASSAN in custody without charge since
 August 1994, and used threats and investigations to intimidate union officials and
 undermine union members' resolve to resist government domination.
 The Government's promiss to allow elections of new executive councils in ad-
 vance of the June ILO conference were never fulfilled, nor was the labor movement
 allowed to choose its own representatives to the ILO. Instead, the Government at-
 tempted unsuccessfully to seat workers' delegates of its choosing. In the ensuing de-
 bate on Nigeria in the ILO's committee on the application of conventions and rec-
 ommendations, dlegates adopted a "special paragraph" that took the Government
 to tak for denying trade unions the right to elect their leaders freely. The 1995 ac-
 tion supplementedthe 1994 finding of the ILO committee on freedom of association
 that the Government's interference in the administration of labor unions and its re-
 striction of workers rights is in direct contravention of ratified conventions. The
 committee then recommended that the Government remove appointed administra-
 tors from labor bodies, restore suspended union executives and allow them access
 to the premises of union headquarters, and restore dues checkoff. By year's end,
 none of these demands had been met.
 The Government proceeded with plans to impose its own restructuring plan on
 the 41 unions of the NLC and was considering a draft constitution for the labor
 central. Elections of union executives at local and branch levels were occurring, but
 the Government continued to balk at holding elections for national executives, ap-
 parently fearing that the election would put in office trade unionists who would
 challenge government involvement in union affairs.
 At the end of the year, the Government had failed to respond to a request by the
 ILO to send a delegation to Nigeria aimed at securing the release of trade unionists
 and was again cited in a December 1 resolution of the ICFTU executive board that
 appealed to all affiliates and international trade secretariats to support measures
 to seek the release of the jailed trade unionists and the elimination of government
 interference in trade union affairs.
 Workers, except members of the armed forces and employees designated essential
 by the Government, may join trade unions. Essential employees include firefighters,
 police, employees of the central bank, the security printers (printers of currency,
 passprts, and government forms), and customs and excise staff. In May 1993, the
 Government promulgated the Teaching Essential Services Decree, declaring edu-
 cation an essential service. The decree did not, however, prscribe education sector
 unions.
 Approximately 70 percent of the work force is employed in agriculture. Agricul-
 tural workers, except for small numbers in the food processing sector, are not union-
 ized. Most of the informal sector and practically all small industries and businesses
 remain nonunionized. Approximately 11.5 percent of the total work force belong to
 unions.
 In contravention of the ILO Convention on Freedom of Association, the Govern-
 ment has decreed that the NLC is the single central labor body. Although state ex-
 ecutive councils of the NLC continue to function, government interference makes it
 difficult for the NLC to represent workers effectively. The NLC has claimed to rep-
 resent 3 million workers of a total work force of 30 million. This figure is difficult
 to verify and may have dropped in light of a depressed manufacturing sector and
 significant public sector reductions in force. The Government continued to resist at-
 tempts by higher graded workers and middle management to form and register an
 independent labor central. However, the Senior Staff Consultative Association of Ni-
 geria continues to serve as an unregistered central for the senior staff associations.
 ecause it is unrecognized by the Government, its leaders have also been more out-
 spoken on political issues than the NLC.
 The right to strike is recognized by law except for those performing essential serv-
 ices. However, workers are recquired to give 21 days' notice prior to commencing a
 strike. There are no laws prohi iting retribution against strikers and strike leaders,
 but strikers who feel they are facing unfair retribution may submit their cases to
 the industrial arbitration panel whose decisions are binding on all parties.
 In April the Government fired 3,000 striking Kwara state civil servants who were
 demanding promised government relief packages, including 100 percent increases in
 transportation and housing allowances. The Government subsequently reinstated
 the workers, except for union officials, and dissolved the union. On May 18 after
 negotiations broke down, security agents and riot police, backed by an armored per-
 sonnel carrier, broke up a demonstration and arrested scores of striking Nigerian
 Security Minting and Printing Company workers who were protesting poor working
 conditions and the Government's failure to implement promised relief packages.

 They had gathered in front of the Lagos Mint to press their demands. Citing the
 Essential Services Decree, the Government dismissed 2,500 workers. Many of these
 workers were subsequently rehired as new employees, thereby forfeiting seniority
 rights and benefits.
 In September teachers struck for 2 weeks over demands that included payment
 of allowances and salary arrears that had previously been agreed to in negotiations.
 They returned to work when the Government paid half of the arrears, gave a date
 certain for payment of the remainder, and agreed to continue work on stalled con-
 sideration of a new teachers' salary schedule and a teachers' registration procedure.
 Strikes in the public sector occurred in many of the 30 states, typically when under-
 funded state and local governments failed to fulfill previously negotiated contract
 prvisions relating to salaries and allowances. The National Association of Resident
 Dotors struck for a week in November on wage-related issues, returning to work
 when Government conceded two demands ant promised to study two others. At
 Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH) in Zaria, the strike by doc-
 tors coincided with the gruesome murder of the medical director of the hospital by
 service workers who mobbed his office to protest failure of the hospital to pay allow-
 ances. The doctors at ABUTH, in addition to wage demands, pressed the authorities
 to find and arrest suspects and to improve hospital security.
 Nonagricultural enterprises which employ more than 50 employees are obliged by
 law to recognize trade unions and to pay or deduct a dues checkoff for employees
 who are members. The NLC has complained that some employers deliberately orga-
 nize their industries into multiple units employing less than 50 workers to avoid
 unionization. The Government threatened to wthdraw the dues checkoff provision
 and make the payment of union dues completely voluntary if unions pursue strikes.
 This was the case in August 1993 when the NLC called a general strike, and in
 September 1994 at the conclusion of the petroleum strike.
 In August 1991, the Government revoked a policy in effect since 1975 that per-
 mitted international labor affiliation only with theOATUU and affiliated Pan-Afri-
 can labor federations. Under Decree 32, affiliation with non-African international
 labor organizations was allowed. Negotiations commenced with the ICFTU seeking
 formal affiliation, but the removal of the NLC executive and the protracted political
 confrontation have precluded further progress on these applications. In December
 the ICFTU adopted a resolution critical of the Government s labor policies and ac-
 tions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The labor laws provide for
 both the right to organize and the right to bargain collectively between management
 and trade unions. Collective bargaining is, in fact, common in many sectors of the
 economy. Laws further protect workers against retaliation by employers for labor ac-
 tivity through an independent arm of the judiciary, the Nigerian Industrial Court
 (C), which handles complaints of antiunion discrimination. Before cases can be
 brought to the NIC, parties are required to seek mediation and conciliation through
 the Ministry of Labor. Unresolved disputes can subsequently be taken to the Indus-
 trial Arbitration Panel and the NIC. Union officials have, however, questioned the
 independence of the NIC in light of its refusal to resolve various disputes stremming
 from Government's failure to fulfill contract provisions for public employees.
 There have been no significant reforms in labor practice since January 1991,
 when the Government abolished the uniform wage structure for all government en-
 tities. This allowed each tier of government-federal, state, local, and parastatals-
 freedom to negotiate its own level of wages, benefits, and conditions of employment.
 As a result, negotiations previously conducted on a nationwide basis under the di-
 rect supervision of the Labor Ministry are now conducted on a local, often plant-
 wide, basis with less government involvement.
 One export processing zone is in development in Calabar, Cross River state.
 Workers in such zones are subject to same national labor laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1974 Labor Decree and the
 1989 constitution prohibit forced or compulsory labor. However, the ILO noted that
 with no constitution in force, the Government may be unable to enforce the ILO con-
 vention against forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children.-The 1974 Labor Decree prohibits
 employment of children under 18 years of age in commerce and industry and re-
 stricts other child labor to home-based agricultural or domestic work. The law fur-
 ther stipulates that children may not be employed in agricultural or domestic work
 for more than 8 hours per day. The Decree allows the apprenticeship of youths aged
 13 under specific conditions.
 Primary education is compulsory, although this is rarely enforced, and recent
 studies show declining enrollment due mainly to the continuing deterioration of
 public schools. This lack of sufficient primary school infrastructure has ended some
 
 
 211
 families' access to education, forcing them to place their children in the labor mar-
 ket. The ILO and the United Nations Children's Fund, in consultation with the
 NLC, have concluded that child labor, while not yet endemic, is increasing and could
 become a serious problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-The 1974 Labor Decree sets a minimum wage,
 which is reviewed on an ad hoc basis. The last review in 1991 was undertaken by
 a tripartite group consisting of representatives of the NLC, the Nigeria Employers'
 Consultative Association, and the Ministry of Labor. With the considerable decline
 in the naira, the Group raised the minimum wage from $2.90 (250 naira) to $5.00
 (450 naira) per month, a level which does not provide a decent living for a worker
 and family.
 The Labor Decree also established a 40-hour workweek, prescribes 2 to 4 weeks
 of annual leave, and stipulated that workers must be paid extra for hours worked
 over the legal limit. The decree also stated that workers who work on Sundays and
 statutory public holidays must be paid a full day's pay in addition to their normal
 wages. There is no law prohibiting excessive compulsory overtime.
 The decree contains general health and safety provisions, some aimed specifically
 at young or female workers. While it requires that the Factory Inspectorate of the
 Ministry of Labor and Employment inspect factories for their compliance with
 health and safety standards, this agency neglects safety oversight of construction
 sites and other nonfactory work. The decree also requires employers to compensate
 injured workers and dependent survivors of those killed in industrial accidents. The
 Labor Decree does not provide workers the right to excuse themselves from dan-
 gerous work situations without loss of employment. The Labor Ministry, which is
 charged with enforcement of these laws, has experienced large staff turnover and
 has been largely ineffective in identifying violations. The Government has failed to
 act on various ILO recommendations since 1991 to update its moribund Inspection
 and Accident Reporting Program.
