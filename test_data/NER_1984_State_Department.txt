 NIGER
 Niger is governed by an authoritarian military regime with
 power concentrated in the hands of its President, General
 Seyni Kountche, who heads the nation's highest body, the
 Supreme Military Council. He took power in a military coup in
 1974, toppling a civilian government which had lost popular
 support because of corruption and inefficiency. At the time
 of the coup the Constitution was suspended, and Kountche has
 since ruled by decree. The freedoms of assembly, expression,
 political activity, and movement within the country are
 restricted. The state's security apparatus is small but
 effective when coupled with the firm administration exercised
 by the provincial governors, all but one of whom are senior
 military officers. Public dissent in Niger is nonexistent,
 and private dissent is guarded for fear of retribution.
 People may, however, pursue their economic interests, and hold
 private property. Government administration, including the
 legal system, is considered generally fair and moderately
 efficient. Significant violations of the integrity of the
 individual occur but are not widespread.
 Landlocked Niger occupies a large area in the arid Sahel
 region of West Africa. The economy is based primarily on
 subsistence farming, livestock, and a few cash crops. In
 addition, there is a mining sector dominated by uranium, of
 which Niger is one of the world's major producers. Poor
 worldwide prices and demand for uranium in recent years have
 had a serious negative effect on the Nigerien economy.
 Overall, the state of human rights in Niger changed only
 slightly in 1984. In April, on the tenth anniversary of the
 coup which brought Kountche to power, the Government released
 about 20 political prisoners, including ex-President Diori.
 These political prisoners, connected with the 1974 coup or two
 subsequent coup attempts, had all been detained without
 trial. After these releases, the Government acknowledged that
 36 political prisoners are still being held, most of them
 associated with an October 1983 coup attempt. The Government
 has indicated that those people implicated in the October 1983
 coup attempt will be tried by a special military tribunal, but
 such a trial., if held, is expected to be in camera. An
 increasing preoccupation with internal security has led the
 Government to tighten internal restrictions on travel and
 population movements during 1984.
 The state of human rights in Niger hinges to a great extent on
 how the Kountche Government deals with the internal and
 external threats it perceives. Internally, the economic
 decline was made much worse by a severe drought in 1984,
 probably the worst in this century. Externally, the main
 threat is Colonel Qadhafi, the Libyan leader, who has stated
 that Niger will be his next target after Chad. Nonetheless,
 despite these threats, the Kountche Government is proceeding
 with its policy of expanding the role of civilians in
 government and of instituting some modest political reforms to
 increase popular participation in government, at least in the
 economic sphere.

 NIGER
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports in 1984 of political killings by either
 the Government or terrorist groups.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported in Niger during 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is not
 believed to be practiced or condoned, but one student arrested
 during a student strike in 1983 died in detention shortly
 after his arrest. A labor official who was arrested following
 a dispute with the former head of the security services also
 died in 1983 while in detention. This individual was known to
 have been in poor health before his arrest and the exact cause
 of his death is not known. It is also not known whether the
 Nigerien Government investigated this case.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were two confirmed arrests of people for the expression
 of views critical of or different from the Government in
 1984. In August, Customs Director Diallo Amadou Hassane and
 Presidential Inspector Ibrahim Samba Diallo were imprisoned
 for their alleged involvement in the marriage-by-proxy
 ceremony of a local woman with Bonkano Oummarou, the architect
 of the October 1983 coup against President Kountche. Both
 remain in detention, probably at the prison at Quallam, north
 of Niamey. Several other persons are believed to have been
 arrested in connection with the same incident. A senior
 military officer who reportedly criticized the Government was
 arrested early in 1983 and remains in detention. It is not
 known whether he has been formally accused or brought to
 trial. With the Constitution suspended, there are no specific
 statutory protections against arbitrary arrest or imprisonment,
 nor does habeas corpus exist. Warrants for arrest are not
 required. The law provides for a suspect to be charged within
 48 hours, but delays, sometimes lasting months, occur as the
 result of a lack of trained, efficient legal officials.
 Apparently those arrested in connection with the attempted
 coup in 1983 have not been formally charged. The Government
 does not exile dissidents, but some dissidents have fled the
 country. There is no case of incommunicado detention. As a
 drought relief measure, the Government is insisting in some
 cases that indigents work in development projects.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are public trials for civil and criminal cases not
 involving political acts. Legal counsel is provided for
 indigent defendants accused of felonies or other major
 offenses if they are under 18 years of age, handicapped, or
 faced with the possibility of a sentence of more than
 10 years. There is some evidence that courts are subject to
 political influence or pressure in ordinary civil or criminal
 
 
 238
 NIGER
 cases. Defendants may appeal verdicts first to an appellate
 court and, if desired, to the nation's highest tribunal, the
 state court, composed of civilian magistrates, which serves in
 the capacity of a supreme court as a final court of appeals.
 The President has the right of pardon in penal cases. Islamic
 justice is often used on a local basis throughout the country
 for petty crimes.
 There is also provision for a state security court to operate
 outside the legal framework and try political cases. Such a
 court will reportedly try those accused of complicity in the
 1983 coup attempt, but it is expected that such a trial will
 be held in camera. It is assumed that a security court can
 review sentences of a person already in detention, but
 information is not available about rules, or procedures, or if
 defendants are entitled to counsel. There are believed to be
 several more political prisoners in Niger than the 36
 acknowledged by the Government. Most are accused of
 complicity in the 1983 coup attempt or are leftover detainees
 from earlier coup attempts. There are no current published
 estimates by private organizations on the number of political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The police have the right to enter homes between 5 a.m. and 9
 p.m. but will enter at other times if they believe they have
 sufficient cause. A court warrant is not required. There
 have been no reports of forced entry, but other violations of
 privacy such as monitoring correspondence and the operation of
 an informer system occur on a selective basis. A few cases of
 forced population resettlement are occurring as a government
 response to the drought.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are restricted. Institutions which might voice
 dissent, such as an independent press or a freely elected
 legislature, do not exist. The government-controlled media
 allow only occasional minor or veiled criticism of government
 policies or operations. Full academic freedom does not
 exist. The primary function of the media is to disseminate
 government policies and viewpoints and to engender popular
 support for them, as well as for such leading government
 figures and entities as the President and the military.
 Nigerien journalists are aware of their status as government
 employees and of the guidelines within which they are expected
 and required to operate. There have been no reported
 deviations from these requirements. There have been no
 reports of censored or banned magazines, or other
 publications, but the Government is under no constraints
 should it discover material that it deems offensive. Foreign
 films are subject to censorship on the grounds of public
 morality and political content.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except for political parties, most forms of voluntary
 association, such as trade unions, churches, and other
 religious groups, function with the understanding they operate
 consistent with government policy. They have no legal
 
 
 239
 NIGER
 protection. Public meetings of such organizations are
 allowed, but the Government is under no restriction should
 it wish to limit such activity. The trade union movement
 exists apart from the Government and is organized in a
 confederation of 23 unions representing about 30 percent of
 the estimated 60,000 salaried workers in Niger. Although
 weak, poorly-financed, and subject to government influence,
 the trade union movement is considered fairly democratic.
 Meetings are frequent, and the unions have the right to
 organize, negotiate, and strike even though strikes are rare.
 The confederation maintains relations with recognized
 international bodies and sends representatives to international
 meetings. It alto is a member of the Accra-based Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Niger is overwhelmingly Muslim, but Christian Churches operate
 freely. Conversion from one religion to another is permitted
 but occurs rarely. Foreign missionaries are permitted to
 enter and reside in the country. There have been no reports
 of religious discrimination, but adherence to Islam tends to
 give one an advantage in all sectors of life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Niger is closely monitored, although no special
 travel documents are necessary for internal travel. Police
 checks, often accompanied by searches, take place on the
 outskirts of all cities and towns, but in 1984 these controls
 have been enforced more severely. In addition to a
 longstanding concern over smuggling, those measures stem from
 concerns over the movement of potential dissidents or criminal
 elements. In addition, the Government seeks to prevent
 migration to cities and towns from the countryside in order to
 reduce urban unemployment and associated social problems.
 Nigeriens wishing to travel abroad or emigrate must apply for
 exit visas which are usually granted routinely. The
 repatriation of Nigerien nationals is unrestricted. In early
 1983, the Government willingly and efficiently repatriated
 approximately 55,000 Nigeriens who had been expelled from
 Nigeria. A small number of refugees from other countries have
 been accepted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 Niger is ruled by an authoritarian military regime.
 Virtually all political power is concentrated in the hands of
 the President, General Seyni Kountche. He rules in the name
 of the Supreme Military Council, a small group of military
 officers most of whom participated in the 1974 coup which
 brought Kountche to power. Kountche rules by decree, makes
 all government appointments, and decides the pace of all
 political change. The military remains the source of
 Kountche's power, but the number of military officers in high
 positions has declined substantially in recent years, except
 in the case of Niger's seven departments, all but one of which
 have military governors. Government operations are conducted
 largely by civilian technocrats.
 The capacity of the people to influence the Government is
 improving but is still very limited. There are no political
 
 
 240
 NIGER
 parties. As an alternative to a party-based democracy, the
 Government began in 1979 to create a structure it calls the
 Development Society, a hierarchical network of councils at the
 village, subregional, regional, and national levels. The
 councils, all of which were in place by late 1983, contain at
 each level a mixture of elected and appointed members, but
 only at the village level are some of the members elected
 directly by the people. At the higher levels, members are
 elected by the members at the next lower level. The precise
 role of the Development Society councils has yet to be defined-
 in practice. Theoretically, their role is to involve the
 people in economic and social development activities. But
 even then their role is strictly advisory, and the councils
 have no financial support from the Government. The national
 council has the additional task of writing a national charter
 which is expected to pave the way for the writing of a
 constitution. The charter, and eventually the Constitution,
 are expected to address the subject of the future role of the
 military and find a formula for more popular participation in
 government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Niger is not an active participant in regional and
 international human rights organizations. Niger hasnot been
 the subject of resolutions, investigations, or other actions
 by human rights organizations. However, Amnesty International
 has expressed its concerns to the Government, and in its 1984
 report, about long-term detentions without trial, ill-treatment
 of prisoners, and prison conditions. An International Red
 Cross official visited Niger in 1984, primarily to establish
 contact with government officials. Freedom House rates Niger
 .not free.'
 SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Niger is one of the world's poorest countries. Most of the
 current population of 6,284,000 lives at no more than a
 subsistence level. Fully 35 percent (1975 estimate) of the
 population lives below an absolute poverty level. Gross
 national product per capita was S306 in 1982. Other social
 indicators are also low. The adult literacy rate was
 10 percent in 1980 (male 14 percent, female 6 percent). In
 1978, the primary school enrollment ratio was 21 percent, with
 a large bias in favor of males (27 percent) compared to
 females (16 percent). Infant mortality is 137 deaths for
 1,000 live births. Life expectancy is 46 years. On the
 average, Nigeriens receive 91 percent of daily nutritional
 requirements (1977 estimate). A 1975 estimate shows only
 27 percent of the population has access to safe water (38
 percent urban, 26 percent rural), but this figure is believed
 to have improved in recent years, thanks to a large-scale
 government well-drilling program.
 Given these conditions, the Government has made economic
 development its top priority. The bulk of the funds derived
 from the uranium boom of the late 1970's have been channeled
 into projects in health, agriculture, and rural development.
 Foreign assistance has also largely gone to these sectors.
 Substantial progress had resulted from these efforts.
 
 
 241
 NIGER
 However, the current and future economic prospects for Niger
 are bleak. Uranium prices are not expected to recover, and
 Niger has no other easily exploitable source of wealth. A
 large foreign debt, contracted in the early eighties in a
 mistaken anticipation of continued high uranium prices, has
 proved difficult to repay, forcing Niger to reschedule its
 debt and adopt an IMF-supervised austerity program. To make
 matters worse, a devastating drought in 1984 has left
 thousands of Nigeriens with no private means of support.
 Niger's social and cultural characteristics have mixed effects
 on human rights. The bulk of the population lives much as it
 has for centuries. The essentially traditional nature of
 society helps ensure that family and ethnic group ties remain
 strong and supportive, but traditional practices and attitudes
 on ethnicity, women, and education have some negative
 effects. Males have considerable advantages in terms of
 education, employment, and property rights. In case of
 divorce, custody of all children under eight years of age is
 given to the husband. Conscious of this situation, the
 Government has made progress in improving the status of women
 by launching work on a new family code, by making better
 employment opportunities available to women, by giving them a
 significant role in the Development Society, and by supporting
 the National Women's Association.
 Pour major ethnic groups, each with its own language, make up
 the bulk of the population. The two nomadic groups, Tuaregs
 and Peuls, have somewhat less access to government services,
 primarily because their nomadic life makes it difficult for
 the Government to supply them with social services such as
 education and health. In addition, some Tuaregs and Peuls
 remain unconvinced of the value of any formal education and
 keep their children from attending schools. The drought-prone
 Nigerien climate has a particularly harsh effect on nomads.
 In bad years, such as 1984, it can heighten traditional
 animosities between the nomads and the Government. Signs have
 appeared this year that such animosity has contributed to a
 slowness on the part of the Government to provide a fair share
 of relief assistance to the nomads.
