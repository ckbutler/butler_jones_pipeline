 FIJI
 Fiji, which became independent in 1970, has a multiparty
 parliamentary system inherited from the British colonial period.
 Its Constitution protects traditional communal social systems,
 including landholding rights of the indigenous Fijians. The
 672,000 citizens include indigenous Melanesians/Polynesians (43..4
 percent), immigrant Indians (51 percent), and some Europeans.
 Chinese, and other Pacific Islanders (5.6 percent). Although
 there are unresolved racial tensions between indigenous Fijians
 and Indo-Fijians, Fiji's political and social leaders have
 succeeded in mitigating those tensions and preventing disorder.
 The human rights of Fiji's citizens are protected by law, an
 efficient court system, a free press, free democratic elections,
 and a government which supports cultural diversity. The
 integrity of the person is respected both in law and in practice.
 Fiji's fourth national elections since independence were held in
 July 1982, and the ruling party was returned with a reduced
 majority. Charges by both of Fiji's major parties of electoral
 fraud and foreign influence on the electoral process became the
 subject of a special investigation by an independent commission
 of inquiry appointed by the Governor General. The hearings
 lasted from December 1982 through August 1983, and in its final
 report the Commission found no evidence to support any of the
 charges.
 As in previous years, there were no significant human rights
 violations reported in Fiji in 1983.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Murders by the Government or opposition political organizations
 are unknown in Fiji.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances in 1983 nor evidence of people being
 abducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely detained.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture, which is prohibited under the Constitution, is not
 practiced in Fiji. Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is illegal and is neither condoned nor practiced.
 There are no summary executions in Fiji. Treatment of prisoners
 is impartial and humane. In addition to constitutional
 prohibitions, the prisons ordinance contains specific regulations
 on treatment, food, visiting rights, clothing etc., which are
 respected in practice. Prisons are overcrowded, but prisoners
 can serve their time and live outside the prison environment for
 the last 12 months of sentence and for any sentence of 12 months
 or less. They also are allowed to seek gainful employment
 besides performing public work while serving extramural
 sentences. Public defenders are available, and the Fiji Red
 Cross has access to persons who are arrested.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no political prisoners in Fiji, writs of habeas corpus
 are available, and there is no preventive detention. In addition
 to constitutional safeguards, the law establishes detailed rules
 to be followed by the police during arrests. A suspect can be
 held no more than 24 hours without charge following arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair, public trial is guaranteed by law and is
 honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel, and
 counselors have free access to defendants. Consultations between
 counselors and defendants may be held in private. Defendants are
 made fully aware of the charges brought against them, and they
 and their lawyers have access to the evidence on which charges
 are based. Fiji's courts are independent of executive or
 military control. There are no special courts to deal with
 security or political offenses, and civilians are not tried by
 military courts. An ombudsman's office actively investigates
 complaints against the Government while protecting the identity
 of the complainant.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is respected. Warrants issued by a
 magistrate are required for officials to enter a private
 residence. There is no arbitrary intrusion by the state or
 political organizations into the private life of the individual.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and press are guaranteed in the Fiji
 Constitution and observed in practice. The only radio station is
 under the administration of an independent Broadcasting
 Commission and provides balanced coverage of the news in three
 languages. The press is free and private and is not censored or
 controlled by the Government. However, Fiji inherited an
 ordinance from the Colonial Administration which allows the
 Government to order a correction in the press if the Government
 believes its position has been misrepresented. This ordinance,
 though very seldom used, is resented by the press since it
 requires giving equal space and equal placement to the
 Government's statement. There is no interference with academic
 inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Citizens are free to join associations or to assemble, although
 an ordinance requires that they obtain a permit one week in
 advance of any picketing or public demonstration. Fiji has an
 active trade union movement, which has the right to organize,
 strike, bargain collectively, and lobby. Fiji's 50 trade unions
 have about 45,000 members. Unions must give a 28-day notice of
 intent before going out on strike in the public sector. Fiji's
 largest trade confederation is associated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

 c. Freedom ot Religion
 All religions are tolerated and allowed to freely practice their
 rites. There is no dominant religion in Fiji, nor is any singled
 out for discrimination. Evangelical religions are free to seek
 converts actively.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Fiji citizens, men and women, are free to travel anywhere
 within the country and abroad. There are no restrictions on
 repatriation. There are no displaced persons in Fiji.
 Section 3   Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Fiji's democratic political structure is designed to take account
 of the special interests of the ethnic Fijians and of the
 immigrant Indian community. Under the Constitution, the House of
 Representatives has 12 Fijians, 12 Indians, and three general
 members elected on communal rolls; and 10 Fijians, 10 Indians,
 and five general members elected on national rolls. The general
 communal role consists of electors--mainly Europeans and
 Chinese--who are not eligible on the Fijian or Indian rolls. On
 the national roll, members of all ethnic groups vote together.
 House elections are free and democratic, and a multitude of
 parties contest the seats. In Fiji's most recent national
 elections, 84.4 percent of the population of voting age
 participated. Members of the Senate are appointed by the Fiji
 Council of Chiefs, the Prime Minister, and the leader of the
 Opposition.
 Charges of misconduct by both of the major parties contesting the
 1982 election were the subject of an independent one-man
 commission of inquiry composed of a retired New Zealand Supreme
 Court judge who was appointed by the Governor General. The
 hearings, which lasted 76 days, were covered extensively by the
 press. The Commissioner found no evidence to support any of the
 charges.
 Fiji's court system has tried, and in some cases convicted,
 individuals charged with voting fraud, including a member of the
 governing party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights
 violations by the Fiji Government nor any known requests for
 investigations. Fiji recently served on the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission. Fiji's ombudsman investigates complaints
 against the Government while maintaining the confidentiality of
 the complainant. The Government does not interfere with his
 actions. Amnesty International did not report on Fiji in 1983;
 Freedom House rated Fiji "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In 1983 Fiji's population grew at the rate of 2.1. percent and
 reached 672,000. Life expectancy at birth was estimated at 71.7
 years in 1980; the infant mortality rate, at 27.8 per 1,000 live
 births in 1983; and caloric supply as a percent of requirements,
 at 99.1 percent in 1977.

 Fiji's economy is divided between a subsistence agricultural and
 a cash-based economy, the former characteristic of the outlying
 islands and the latter typical of the group's two main islands,
 Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Although the $1,884.30 per capita
 gross national product (GNP) of Fiji is relatively high for a
 developing nation, the country's wealth is not evenly distributed
 between the urban and rural sectors, a situation Fiji's most
 recent development plan attempts to remedy. Fiji seeks to
 increase economic opportunities through regional planning and
 economic incentives, not by penalizing private industry. Private
 enterprise is encouraged, as is foreign investment, and the
 Economic Development Board assists private, domestic, and foreign
 investors to develop their projects.
 About 85 percent of the land in Fiji is owned communally by the
 indigenous Fijian people. Approximately six percent is
 government land, leaving less than 10 percent as freehold land.
 Communal and government lands can be leased but not sold, while
 freehold land can be sold outright. The arrangement regarding
 communal land ownership was instituted to protect the interests
 of indigenous Fijians from the more economically competitive
 Indo-Fijians, but some of the latter consider it discriminatory
 and an interference with their own freedom to develop. Some
 members of the Indian community also complain that it is
 difficult for them to obtain government-backed financing for
 investment projects.
 Indo-Fijians have generally been more successful in getting an
 education and accumulating wealth through investment in private
 enterprise. Most businesses in Fiji are owned and operated by
 Indo-Fijians and they are more heavily represented in the civil
 service. Some indigenous Fijians view the concentration of
 Indo-Fijians, in business and government as discriminatory to
 their own racial group.
 The Government neither condones nor encourages sexual, racial, or
 religious discrimination. The Constitution states that "every
 person in Fiji is entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms
 of the individual, that is to say, the right whatever his race,
 place of origin, political opinions, color, creed or sex..." Few
 women, however, hold high-level economic or political positions,
 although one is the deputy leader of the opposition. There is a
 growing awareness among women of both the Fijian and Indian
 communities of their rights to participate more actively in
 social and political endeavors outside their homes.
 Women in the rural areas continue to fill the traditional roles
 of village life. Tribal inheritance is usually based on a
 patriarchal system. Women can and do, however, inherit status as
 chiefs; Fiji's third highest ranking chief is a woman.
 Health care has been expanded with an emphasis on preventive
 medicine. In the last decade, the percentage of the total
 population with access to safe water rose to 69 percent.
 Three-quarters of the population can read and write, and almost
 every Fijian citizen is to some degree bilingual in English and
 either Fijian or Hindustani. Virtually all children in the
 primary age group are enrolled in school, as are 90 percent of
 secondary school-aged children. There is no discrimination
 between sexes with regard to education.
