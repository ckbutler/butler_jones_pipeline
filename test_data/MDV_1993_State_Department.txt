 MALDIWES
 The Republic of Maldives comprises 1,190 islands in 26 natural atolls scattered
 across an area 500 miles long by 75 miles wide in the Indian ocean with a po u-
 lation of some 225,000 persons. It has a parliamentary form of government with a
 strong executive. In practice, government authority in this small,homogeneous soci-
 ety rests largely in the hands of the President and a number of powerful Cabinet
 ministers. Political parties are officially discouraged. Candidates for the unicameral
 legislature, the Citizens' Majlis, run as individuals. The Majlis selects a single nomi-
 nee for president who is subsequently approved or rejected by the voters.
 In 1993 the MaJlis nominated President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom for a fourth 5-
 year term. His principal rival for the nomination, Ilyas Ibrahim, was subsequently
 tried in absentia for violation of the Constitution, found guilty of treason, and sen-
 tenced to more than 15 years' banishment in what was widely seen as a politically
 motivated legal proceeding. A number of Ibrahim's supporters were arbitrarily de-
 tained, and some were later tried and convicted for political offenses.
 The National Security Service (NSS), which includes the army and police, is re-
 onsible for maintaining internal law and order as well as defending the country.
 otal NSS membership is estimated at between 1,200 and 2,000. NSS members gen-
 erally serve in both police and military functions over their careers. The police divi-
 sion investigates crimes, does security intelligence work, makes arrests, and en-
 forces house arrest.
 Nearly half the work force engages in traditional activities such as fishing and
 small-scale arculture. Manufacturing and tourism employ an additional 25 percent
 of the work force, with tourism accounting for 40 percent of foreign exchange re-
 ceipts.
 Te Government continues to restrict human rights closely in several areas, in-
 cluding the right of citizens to change their government, freedom of speech and of
 
 
 1355
 the press, freedom of religion, and women's and workers' rights. There are some po-
 litical prisoners. Other problems include arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention
 and lack of an independent judiciary. Some of these restrictions-on religion and
 women's rights, for example-are linked with the country's observance of the Shari'a
 (Islamic law) and other Islamic principles and customs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 killings in 1993.
 b. Disappearance.-Them were no reports of disappearances in 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no credible reports in 1993 that persons were beaten while in police cus-
 tody. Supporters of Ilyas Ibrahim were alleged to have been abused while in cus-
 tody, but these allegations were not substantiated. Convicted criminals may be
 flogged under judicial supervision when this punishment is prescribed by the
 Shari's. Usually, however, punishment is confined to fines, compensatory payment
 house arrest, imprisonment, or banishment to a remote and sparsely populated
 atoll. Banishment is considered a particularly severe punishment because the ban-
 ished person is not allowed visits by family members.
 Prison conditions are reported to be adequate. Food and accomodation provided,
 especially for political prisoners, is reportedly quite good by Maldivian standards.
 Prisoners are allowed to work while in prison. Spouses are now allowed complete
 privacy during visits with incarcerated partners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution states that "no person
 shall be apprehended, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or (civil) law.' Police
 undertake investigations either on suspicion of criminal activity or in response to
 a formal written complaint alleging commission of a crime. The complaint can be
 written by anyone, including a citizen, police officer, or government official. No war-
 rants are required for arrests, but arrests are made only after clearance from a su-
 perior officer, such as the officer-in-charge, is received. Depending on the results of
 the police investigation, the Attorney General may refer the case to the appropriate
 court.
 Complainants may also directly petition a court for its intervention. It is cus-
 tomary not to disclose to the public the details of the charges against a person until
 it has been established that the charges are likely to be upheld.
 Persons under investigation generally are free pending trial, provided they do not
 leave a specified atoll. Depending on the charges, however, a suspect may be impris-
 oned or placed under house arrest without trial for 15 days while the case is being
 investigated. In most cases, if not brought to trial within 15 days, the subject is
 freed. After the first 15 days, detention or house arrest may be extended for 30 days
 by authority of the President. There is no limit on the detention of persons sus-
  ected of such crimes as illegal drug use, terrorism, or attempted overthrow of the
 vernment. As a result, such detainees may be held without trial indefinitely.
 There is no provision under Maldivian law for bail. Neither is there a requirement
 in law that persons be formally charged before being detained on suspicion, so some
 suspects, especially for political offenses, have been imprisoned or held under house
 arrest for weeks or months without charge. There is also no right to legal counsel
 during police interrogation or the making of a confession. One detainee, charged
 with withholding information about terrorist activities, was arrested in February
 1991 and held under house arrest for 2 years before his trial (at which he was ac-
 quitted in March 1993) began. Some detainees reportedly have been held without
 access to lawyers, friends, or family. Persons held under house arrest may be pro-
 hibited visits by nonfamily members and access to a telephone. At times prisoners
 have been held incommunicado as a way to extract confessions.
 Most, if not all, of the more than 50 persons arrested in November 1990 on what
 appear to have been exaggerated charges, including terrorism and political subver-
 sion, have either been released or tried, convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment
 or banishment to outer atolls.
 In 1993 at least 20 supporters of Ilyas Ibrahim-the President's brother-in-law
 and chief rival for the presidential nomination-were detained. Three were charged
 with assisting Ibrahim in his campaign to win the presidency-an offense under the
 Maldives' Constitution (see Section 2.e. and Section 3). They were convicted and
 sentenced to 10 years' banishment. A fourth was sentenced to 7 years' banishment
 for withholding information about the above-mentioned crime. Other detainees were
 released after questioning, but approximately eight are believed to still be in police
 custody awaiting the filing of charges.
 
 
 1356
 There were no cases-of foreign exile in 1993. The practice of banishment to remote
 atolls is a form of internal exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The President exercises considerable influence
 over the judiciary as demonstrated by his power to appoint and dismiss judges. All
 judges serve at his pleasure; they are not subject to confirmation by the citizens'
 ej'is. The High Court falls under the authority of the Office of the President.
 Under the law, the President has the power to grant pardon and amnesty to offend-
 ers but, according to Maldivian officials, does not determine sentences. Some observ-
 ers also believe that the President personally reviews some court decisions and may
 use his influence to affect the outcome of decisions.
 There are eight lesser courts and a High Court in the capital island, Male. The
 High Court handles a wide range of cases, including politically sensitive ones, and
 acts as a court of appeal. Each of the lesser courts deals with specialized cases, such
 as debt, theft, or property claims. On other islands, there are all-purpose courts.
 There are no jury trials. Most trials are open to the public and are conducted by
 judges trained in Islamic and civil law. Public and press attendance at trials of per-
 sons charged with political crimes has, on occasion, been restricted, but the maior
 political cases in 1993-that of Ilyas Ibrahim and his supporters-were open to the
 public and heavily attended.
 Ibrahim was charged with having illegally attempted to become president of the
 Maldives. Under the Constitution, nomination of the presidential candidate is the
 responsibility of Parliament and it is a constitutional offense for an individual to
 actively seek the office. Ibrahim was also charged with having violated his oath as
 minister. Ibrahim, who was out of the country, declined to appear before the court
 as ordered. He was ultimately tried in absentia. Although he was represented by
 counsel during the proceedings, Ibrahim claims that his attorney was prevented
 from traveling abroad to meet with him and that telephone and fax communications
 between him and his attorney were monitored by the Government. Ibrahim was con-
 victed on both charges and sentenced to 15 years' banishment on the first count and
 to 6 months' additional banishment on the second. He still faces two additional
 charges involving conflict of interest between his ministerial duties and private posi-
 tions that he held concurrently.
 Most Maldivians believe that the charges against Ibrahim were motivated pri-
 marily by political considerations and that the results of the trial were a foregone
 conclusion (see Section 3). However, most also believed that there was some sub-
 stance to the charges by government officials that Ibrahim attempted to bribe par-
 liamentarians to vote for him.
 Cases on outer islands are usually adjudicated by traditional legal practitioners,
 but more complex legal questions are referred to the appropriate specialized court
 in Male'. The Male' court may in turn refer the issue to four judges attached to the
 Justice Ministry.
 During trial the accused may defend himself and call witnesses. He also may be
 assistedby a lawyer, but most defendants do not use them because there are few
 professionally trained lawyers in Maldives. Courts do not provide lawyers to defend-
 ants who cannot obtain legal counsel on their own. Traditional Islamic judges qu es-
 tion the concerned parties and attempt to establish the facts of a case as well as
 reach a legal judgment. Generally, the length and type of sentence are established
 by law an dcustom.
 Shari'a and civil law operate simultaneously in the Maldivian legal system, but
 civil law is subordinate to Shari'a. Shari'a is applied in situations not covered by
 civil law as well as in dealing with certain specific acts and offenses, such as divorce
 and adultery. The courts that deal with matrimonial and criminal cases do not, as
 a general rule, allow legal counsel to be present because the interpretation of
 Shari'a used in Maldives argues that answers and submissions should come directly
 from the parties involved. The High Court of Maldives, however, does allow legal
 counsel in all types of cases, including those in which the right to counsel was de-
 nied by the lower court.
 There are political prisoners, but there are no reliable estimates of the number.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits opening, or reading letters, telephone conversations, tele-
 grams, and wireless messages exchanged between persons "except in accordance
 with the specific provisions of the law. The NSS sometimes opens the mail of pri-
 vate citizens and notifies them that it has done so. It is also widely believed that
 the Government taps telephones. The Constitution requires that private premises
 and dwellings be respected, but there is no legal requirement for search or arrest
 warrants, and police officials sometimes search private residences without prior
 warning.
 
 
 1357
 Section 2. Re'spect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and expression so long as the specific prvisions of Shari'a and the law are not con-
 travened." In practice, however, freedom of speech, press, and broadcast are sharply
 restricted. Under Maldivian law and custom, a citizen may criticize or complain to
 the Government without fear if he does so through recognized channels, Thes in-
 clude letters or oral complaints to the President, a Majlis member, a civil servant,
 or other person in authority.
 Individuals who use other channels to express dissent, however, do so at their
 peril. The Penal Code includes a prvision that makes it illegal to arouse the people
 against the Government. A November 1990 amendment to the Penal Code decrimi-
 nalized "any true account of any act of commission or omission past or present by
 the Government in a lawfully registered newspaper or magazine, so as to reveal dis-
 satisfaction or to effect its reform." This amendment so far has had no appreciable
 effect in easing journalists' concerns about publishing material that might be
 deemed to contravene the broad Penal Code provision. Law no. 4 of 1968 also pro-
 hibits public statements-either orally or in writing-that express anti-Islamic sen-
 timent or that might threaten national peace and stability or that might be libellous
 to anyone.
 The harassment, arrest, and conviction of a number of journalists following a
 short period of unprecedented press freedom in early 1990 eliminated the dissident
 press and created a persisting atmosphere in which newspapers are afraid to pub-
 lish articles critical of the Government. The Government also holds printers respon-
 sible for the material they print, resulting in the printers' refusal to accept anything
 even slightly controversial.
 Seventy-six newspapers and periodicals are registered, of which 13 are published
 by the Government. The only two dailies are owned by government ministers. Two
 politically outspoken newspapers, Sangu and Hukuru, whose official registrations
 were revoked in mid-1990, remain closed. Of the 2 journalists affiliated with Sangu
 who were among 50 persons detained in 1990, one, editor Mohammed Shafeeq who
 was originally sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment, was released from house arrest
 in May. The second a journalist remains under house arrest serving a 3-year sen-
 tence. Other journaists detained in 1990, including several from Hukuru, have re-
 portedi either completed their sentences or been granted amnesty. There were no
 orced closures of newspapers or magazines in 1993. In the one defamation case
 brought against a journalist by a private party in 1993, the journalist was found
 innocent.
 There is no prior censorship of newspapers, but officials in the Department of In-
 formation and Broadcasting sometimes call publishers to point out that certain arti-
 cles are unacceptable for political or other reasons. Publications may be banned for
 containing criticisms of the Government "based on falsehood and unfounded specula-
 tion." The Government also reserves the right to take action against journalists who
 "bring discredit and dishonor to individuals or groups through the malicious use of
 mass media and create social unrest among the general public." Because these regu-
 lations are often broadly construed, self-censorship is well ingrained among writers
 and editors.
 The Government owns and operates the only television and radio stations. Foreign
 broadcasts are not jammed. There is no prohibition on satellite receivers anywhere
 in the country.
 There are no legal prohibitions on the import of foreign publications, except those
 containing pornography or material otherwise deemed objectionable in terms of Is-
 lamic values. No seizures of foreign publications were reported in 1993. There are
 no reported restrictions on academic freedom nor any governmental censorship or
 control over classroom materials. Some teachers are reportedly quite vocal in their
 criticism of government policies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Article 15 of the Constitution
 guarantees Maldivians the right to assemble as long as they do not violate the law
 or the Islamic code of behavior. Public political meetings are permitted during elec-
 toral campaigns, with Home Ministry permission, but so far political meetings have
 been limited to small gatherings on pnvate premises. Clubs and other private asso-
 ciations are permitted if they do not contravene Shari'a and civil law. They must
 be registered with the Government. While not expressly forbidden by law, political
 parties are not permitted in practice. President Gayoom has publicly discouraged
 their formation, deciarir.g political parties inappropriate to the homogeneous
 Maldivian society, at least or the present.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is significantly restricted. The Con-
 stitution designates Islam as the official religion and requires all citizens to be Mus-
 lims.
 
 
 1358
 
 There are no places of worship for adherents of any other religion, and the impor-
 tation of figures for worship is prohibited. Clergy and missionaries of non-Muslim
 faiths may enter Maldives tut are forbidden to proselytize or hold public worship
 services. Conversion of a Muslim to another faith is a violation of Shari'a law and
 could result in a loss of citizenship for the Maldivian convert, although law enforce-
 ment authorities say this provision of the law has never been applied. The practice
 of any religion other than Islam is prohibited by law. Citizens of other nations resi-
 dent in Maldives are, however, allowed to practice their religion if they do so pri-
 vately.
 d. Fre.dom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -There are no formal restrictions on freedom of movement within the
 aldives. Although no law explicitly prohibits migration to the capital island of
 Male' or its surrounding atoll, these areas have become so overcrowded that the
 Government discourages migration there except for short periods of work, education,
 or medical treatment.
 There are no arbitrary restrictions on foreign travel or emigration. A Maldivian
 who has acquired another nationality must maintain Maldivian nationality concur-
 rently and must enter and leave Maldives on a Maldivian passport. The Govern-
 ment is not known to have revoked the citizenship of any Maldivian.
 There are no refugees or displaced persons.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Maldives traditionally has been governed by a limited circle of persons, and
 Maldivians have only limited and indirect influence on the selection and organiza-
 tion of their government. A single nominee for president, who constitutionally must
 be male and a Sunni Muslim, is chosen by secret ballot in the Majlis from as many
 candidates as are proposed by members. Direct personal campaigning for the nomi-
 nation by a candidate is not permitted. The nominated candidate is confirmed or
 rejected in a nationwide referendum, also by secret ballot. In 1993 the Majlis nomi-
 nated President Gayoom to a fourth 5-year term in office.
 Members of the citizens' Majlis, a unicameral legislature, are chosen for 5-year
 terms by secret ballot. All Maldivians over 21 years of age may vote. Of the body's
 48 members, 40 are elected-2 from each of the 19 inhabited atolls and 2 from
 Male'-and the President appoints 8. Individuals or groups are free to approach
 members of the Majlis with grievances or opinions on proposed legislation.
 The most recent Majlis election was held in November 1989. Under the Constitu-
 tion, Islamic law rather than the Majlis has legal preeminence. In practice, the
 President, who in addition to being the head of government and state is also respon-
 sible for the protection of Islam, and key members of his Cabinet wield tremendous
 power over the Majlis.
 It is widely believed that through a combination of inducement and intimidation
 the President and key members of his Cabinet have been able to control the out-
 come of the presidential election process. In the 1993 campaign President Gayoom
 was challenged by his brother-in-law and Cabinet Minister Dyas Ibrahim, who had
 also been nominated. In the nominating vote, Gayoom won 28 votes to Ilyas' 19.
 Ilyas, who charged that he had been forced to leave the country by the President,
 and who faced criminal charges should he return, alleged that the President improp-
 erly pressured Majlis members and denied him his right to contest fairly for the
 dency. Government officials allege, however, that Ilyas improperly used funds
 from his ministerial portfolio to induce parliamentarians to vote in his avor.
 In place of political parties, factions in the Ma'lis tend to form around individuals
 or points of view. Any member may int ducelegislation. If seconded, it must be
 considered by the entire legislative body. Although the Majlis previously could not
 interpellate ministers, in 1993 President Gayoom instructed the Majlis to introduce
 a question time during which Members of Parliament will question ministers di-
 rectly about government policy and administration. The Government has said that
 members of the Majlis are protected by law for statements made during Majlis de-
 bates; however, since the arrest and banishment of a member of the Majlis in 1990
 on charges that were not made public and the harassment of several others for out-
 spokenness in 1990 and 1991, the atmosphere in the Mailis reportedly has become
 more subdued than it was in early 1990. The Majlis still, however, proposes new
 legislation and debates some draft bills vigorously.
 Women are not eligible to become president but may hold all other government
 posts. For reasons of tradition and culture, however, few women seek or are selected
 or public office. In 1993 2 women served in the 48-member Majlis. There were no
 female members of the Cabinet.
 
 
 1359
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no active local human rights groups, and government restrictions on
 freedom of speech and press inhibit any organization from investigating and publicly
 criticizing the Government's human rights  licies.
 In general, the Government does not welcme international human rights organi-
 zations or the human rights inguiries of foreign governments, considering them an
 intrusion into Maldives'domestic affairs. However, there have been instances in re-
 cent years in which the Government has engaged international human rights orga-
 nizations in discussion.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women traditionally have played a subordinate role in Maldivian soci-
 etyt although they nowpaicipate in public life in growing numbers and gradually
 at higher levels. Well-educated Maldivian women report that although the upward
 professional mobility of women is not limited by statute, the education, career
 choices and achievement of women is circumscribed by cultural norms and expecta-
 tions. Aecause Islamic practice is the basis for Maldivian civil law, it is easier for
 husbands to divorce wives than vice versa. Islamic law also governs inheritance ac-
 cording to men twice the share of women. Women who work for wages-for the 6ov-
 ernment, in business, or in garment factories-generally receive pay equal to that
 of men in the same positions. Approximately 10 percent of uniformed N   personnel
 are now female.
 The Government has shown interest in promoting the welfare of women in both
 the public and private sectors. A Department of Women's Affairs and a National
 Women's Council have been created to protect women in traditional roles and, to
 a degree, to expand opportunities for them in nontraditional occupations. These ef-
 forts must contend, however, with conservative sentiment among small businessmen
 and residents of the outer islands, due largely to orthodox Islamic training which
 opposes women being active outside the home.
 There are no firm data on the extent of violence against women. Violence against
 women is probably underreported to authorities because of the value attached to pri-
 vacy within the family in this conservative society. Police officials report that they
 receive only three or four complaints of assaults against women each year, and
 Maldivian women's rights advocates agree that wife beating and other forms of vio-
 lence are not widespread. Rape and other violent crimes against women are rare.
 Children.-There are no reported patterns of abuse against children in Maldives.
 A Bill of Children's Rights is incorporated into Maldivian law which specifically pro-
 tects children from both physical and psychological abuse-including at the hands
 of teachers or parents. The Ministry of Home Affairs has direct authority for
 overseeing enforcement of this law and reportedly takes the responsibility seriously.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no legislation in Maldives that specifically ad-
 dresses the rights of the physically or mentally disabled. The Government has, how-
 ever, played an active role in the protection and rehabilitation of the disabled. There
 is a government institution for treatment of the mentally handicapped. The Ministry
 of Health and Welfare arranges for treatment abroad for physically disabled persons
 who need specialist care and for visits to Maldives by specialists to treat both the
 mentally and physically disabled. The Government also provides a monthly allow-
 ance for the blind and makes items such as wheelchairs, crutches, and eyeglasses
 available to those who cannot afford them. The Government has not legislated or
 otherwise mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-While unions are not expressly prohibited, the Gov-
 ernment recognizes neither the right to form them nor the right to strike. There
 were no reports of efforts to either form unions or to strike in 1993.
 Maldives has a work force of approximately 57,000 persons, about 20 percent of
 whom are employed in traditionalfishing. Approximately 17,000 foreigners work in
 Maldives. Many are brou ht in from Sri Lanka and India to work in resort hotels
 so that Maldivian nationals will be only minimally involved in the serving of liquor,
 A large number of factory workers are also foreign laborers, and many are engaged
 in road work and construction projects. The great majority of economically active
 Maldivians work outside the wage sector. Detailed employment statistics do not
 exist, but it is estimated that the manufacturing sector employs about 15 percent
 of the labor force and the tourism industry another 10 percent. Tourism, however,
 accounts for about 20 percent of the gross domestic product and 40 percent of for-
 eign exchange receipts.
 
 
 1360
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers' rights to organize
 and bargain collectively are neither recognized nor protected by law. Wages in the
 private sector are set by contract between employers and employees and are usually
 based on the rates for similar work in the public sector. In 1993 the Government
 asked a foreign union organizer to leave the country due to his efforts to persuade
 Maldivian seamen to join the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) for
 the purpose of obtaining wage and other benefits not provided to them in their em-
 ployment contracts approved by the Ministry of Transport and Shipping. Maldivian
 officials also reportedly warnedseamen against becoming involved with foreign sea-
 men's unions arguing that shipping company recruiters would stop coming to
 Maldives to offer jobs if they did so.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no legal code regulating
 the conditions of labor. Forced or compulsory labor is not prohibited, but there are
 no reports that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no compulsory education
 law. However, in 1990 some 77 percent of those 5 to 19 years of age were enrolled
 in government or private schools. A law passed in 1992 bars children under 14 years
 of age from "places of waged work" and from work that is "not suitable for that
 child's age, health, or physical ability" or that "might obstruct the education or ad-
 versely affect the mentality or behavior of the child." An earlier law prohibits gov-
 ernment employment of children under the age of 16. There are no reports of chil-
 dren being employed in the small industrial sector, although children do work in
 family fishing, agricultural, and commercial activities. Hours of young workers are
 not specifically limited by statute.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage for the
 private sector, although the Government has established wage floors for certain
 inds of work. There are no statutory provisions for hours of work and length of
 annual leave. Given the severe shortage of labor, however, employers must offer
 competitive pay and working conditions to attract skilled workers. In the public sec-
 tor, a 6-hour day and a 6-day workweek have been established through administra-
 tive circulars from the President's office. Overtime pay for those who work more
 than a 6-hour day was instituted in the public sector in 1990. Government workers
 receive 3 weeks' leave per year. There are no laws governing health and safety con-
 ditions.
