 MACEDONIA*
 Macedonia is the only former Yugoslav republic to have gained independence
 peacefully and without bloodshed. It is a parliamentary democracy. The Parliament
 was elected in free and fair elections in November 1990 and elected Kiro Gligorov
 as President in January 1991. It declared Macedonia's independence from Yugo-
 slavia after a public referendum on the issue and adopted a new Constitution in
 November 1991. The nonparty "government of experts," which took office in March
 1991, lost a vote of no confidence in July 1992. A broad-based coalition of former
 Communists, Socialists, liberals, ethnic Albanians, and others then formed a new
 Government in September.
 The Ministry of the Interior oversees the security apparatus, including uniformed
 police, border police, and the domestic and foreign intelligence services. Branch of-
 ices in 13 Ministry precincts are in charge of security at the local level. Statutorily,
 the Interior Ministry is under the control of a civilian Minister and civilian Govern-
 ment, and its operations are overseen by a standing parliamentary commission.
 Throughout 1992 the Ministry was widely accused by various sources of human
 rights violations, including excessive use of force. In December the Alliance of Re-
 formed Forces-Liberal Party, a member of the governing coalition, publicly called for
 a major restructuring of the Ministry.
 Historically, Macedonia was the poorest of the former Yugoslav republics. Its
 economy, based on agriculture, mining, and light industry, was closely tied to those
 of the other republics, especially Serbia. The conflict in the region, bringing with
 it the imposition of international sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro and a
 rising tide of refugees, severely disrupted the economy and caused increasing unem-
 ployment and inflation and the breakdown of trade. The Government is publicly
 committed to a market economy; it has adopted an anti-inflation program, issued
 a transitional currency, and established an independent central bank.
 Fundamental human rights are provided for in the Constitution and are generally
 respected. Minorities, including_ Albanians and Serbs, have raised various credible
 allegations of human rights infringements and discrimination at the hands of the
 majority Macedonian population. The Albanians have noted economic discrimination
 and incommensurate political rights, particularly inadequate representation in local
 government, and demanded better access to minority-language schooling and public
 sector jobs. They have also complained of insufficient media access. The Albanian
 community also objected strongly to the Macedonian law on citizenship which states
 that a person must reside in Macedonia for 15 years to be eligible for naturalized
 citizenship. On November 6, a riot in Skopje, the capital, erupted between Alba-
 nians and Macedonian police, resulting in four civilian deaths (see Section L.a.).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.---On November 6 thousands of Alba-
 nians demonstrated in an Albanian neighborhood of Skopje alter the Macedonian
 police allegedly beat a teenaged Albanian cigarette vendor. The Ministry of Internal
 Affairs refused offers by leaders of various Albanian political parties to try to calm
 the crowds on the grounds of security considerations. When noting broke out, both
 sides used firearms, and three Albanians and one Macedonian bystander were
 killed. Over 20 people were injured, including 10 police officers. In the face of Alba-
 nian accusations of excessive and unjustifiable use of force, the Government de-
 fended the police's actions and launched an inquiry. On November 9, after hinting
 ,Macedonia has proclaimed independent statehood but has not been formally recognized by
 the United States as a state. There has been a dispute regarding the name under which it
 should be recognized. We use "'Macedonia" in this report informally for convenience; its use is
 not intended to have international or diplomatic significance. Because there is no Unites States
 Embassy in Macedonia, this report draws to a large extent on unofficial sources.

 that outside forces may have orchestrated the incident, the police apprehended 27
 foreigners (16 from Kosovo and 11 from Albania), but no charges were filed and
 they were eventually released. Macedonian nationalists blamed Albanian black
 maiketeers and criticized the Government for not quelling the rioting sooner. The
 Ministry said Albanian black marketeers, smugglers, and drug dealers used the
 beating incident as a pretext to riot, partly in reaction to the police's recent crack-
 down against their illegal activities. Conference on Security and Cooperation in Eu-
 rope (CSCE) monitors in Skopje at the time concluded that the police had used ex-
 cessive force in attempting to arrest the teenager.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such treatment and punishment. Albanians, however, re-
 ported numerous instances of brutality by Macedonian police officers, mostly in pro-
 vincial villages near Struga, Skopje, and Gostivar, but most of these claims were
 unsubstantiated. On April 15 in Debar, the wounding of an Albanian by an Macedo-
 nian policeman resulted in a major demonstration by Albanians and the subsequent
 suspension of the two Macedonian police officers involved.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no confirmed reports of arbi-
 trary arrest in 1992. Some ethnic Albanians reported instances of unprovoked police
 harassment, but these claims were not confirmed.
 The Constitution states that a person must be arraigned in court within 24 hours
 of arrest and sets the maximum duration of detention pending trial at 90 days. The
 accused must be informed of their legal rights and the reasons for their arrest and
 detention. The accused is entitled to contact a lawyer at the time of arrest and to
 have a lawyer present during police and court proceedings. The Constitution also
 provides that a person illegally detained has the right to compensation. Judges issue
 warrants at the request of prosecutors. Exile, internal or external, is not used as
 a form of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Macedonia's courts are "autonomous and inde-
 pendent" under the Constitution. The current court system is three-tiered: munici-
 pal district, and the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Court deals exclusively
 with matters of constitutional interpretation. On December 16, Parliament passed
 several key pieces of judicial reform legislation, including laws on the public pros-
 ecutor's office and on private lawyers. The Albanian parties unsuccessfully lobbied
 for the establishment of a public prosecutor's office in the predominantly Albanian
 city of Gostivar. Presently, the mandates of virtually all of Macedonia's judges, who
 were appointed prior to independence, have expired. An implementing law for the
 seven-member Judicial Council, the constitutionally established judicial organ
 charged with nominating judges at all levels, was passed in late 1992. Two of the
 Council members are nominated by the President, two by the Constitutional Court
 and three by Parliament, and all must be confirmed by Parliament. Procedurally al
 judges will be selected by the republic Judicial Council and confirmed by Par-
 liament, but the law on courts, which would provide for the selection of all of Mac-
 edonia's 400 judges, is still pending. The Justice Minister promised that the election
 of the new judges would be accomplished by April 1, 1993. They will have mandates
 of varying terms.
 The Constitution calls for public court trials and sentencing, except as specified
 by law. Defendants have the right to be present, to confront witnesses, to present
 evidence, to have counsel, and to appeal. Prosecutors and defense attorneys have the
 same rights, including the right of appeal. The operation of the judicial system ap-
 pears to be consistent with the constitutional guarantees.
 There were no known trials on purely political charges in 1992. A local human
 rights group alleged that there were as many as 10 Albanian "political prisoners"
 being held in Macedonia's Idrizova Prison.
 The Constitutional Court has a mandate to protect the human rights of citizens,
 but it has not yet taken any action in this area. The Assembly is to elect a people's
 ombudsman to defend citizens' constitutional and legal rights, but it has not yet
 passed an implementing law.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is provided in the Constitution.
 A though searches without court order are prohibited, the Albanian community al-
 leged that the police sometimes engage in illegal searches of Albanian homes. Dif-
 ferent political groups alleged that government bodies engaged in wiretapping, but
 no instance is known to have been substantiated. Only courts may grant permission
 to install wiretaps. On July 6, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-
 Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNU) charged that the
 Interior Ministry had wiretapped its office telephones. On December 22, a par-
 liamentary commission charged with reviewing the allegation did not explicitly con-
 
 
 841
 firm that the wiretapping took place but judged that such an infringement of a po-
 litical party's right to privacy would be unconstitutional.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution forbids censorship and guaran-
 tees freedom of speech, public access, public information, and freedom to establish
 institutions for public information. These freedoms are generally respected.
 There are four daily newspapers in Skopje and numerous weekly political and
 other publications. There is also an Albanian newspaper and a Turkish one, both
 of which are published three times weekly and are widely circulated. Other cities
 publish their own dalies or have them published in Skopje. Printing presses are
 centralized and state-owned, however limiting competition.
 Macedonian Radio-Television (MRT) in Skop*e, which is state owned, transmits
 programs in the Macedonian, Rom, Turkish,          an    Viach languages. There
 are currently three television and four 24-hour radio stations under MRT's control.
 In addition, there are several small private radio and television broadcasters
 throughout the country.
 The Albanian minority complained that insufficient access to television limited Al-
 banian-language rogramming to only 3 to 4 hours per week. They also charged that
 the dependence of the main Albanian-lanuage newspaper Flame of Brotherhood on
 state-owned printing facilities deprived it of some measure of independence. The
 Serbian minority made similar allegations. The VMRO-DPMNU, the only significant
 parliamentary opposition faction, alleged that the state-owned printing house and
 radio and television outlets denied it fair access to their facilities.
 There are no legal barriers to setting up independent media outlets, although air-
 wave licensing requirements are not yet firmly established. The media were not in-
 cluded in the Government's privatization program; parliamentary leaders promised
 this would be changed.
 Foreign books and publications are freely available, principally in the larger cities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights. Groups and political parties may not advocate the forcible overthrow
 of the constitutional order, encourage the commission of military aggression, or pro-
 mote national, racial, or religious hatred or intolerance. Advance notification for an
 assembly is required to ensure adequate security. Numerous public rallies were held
 in 1992, including a large assembly in July and several political rallies in the prov-
 inces before by-elections in October.
 Political parties and nongovernmental organizations are required to register with
 the Interior Ministry in compliance with a comprehensive political party registration
 law. More than 40 political parties and associations have registered since 1990, in-
 cluding a political party of Serbs and a pro-Bulgarian party.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is guaranteed, and there is no gov-
 ernmental interference with the practice of religion. The dominant faiths are Ortho-
 dox and Muslim. Although the Macedonian Orthodox Church is specifically named
 in the Constitution, it does not enjoy any special legal status. That church and all
 other religious communities and groups are separate from the State and equal
 under the law. They are free to establish religious schools and social and philan-
 thropic organizations. There are active Roman Catholic and Methodist dioceses.
 Hare Krishnas, Mormons, and other proselytical groups are also active. The Govern-
 ment has returned property confiscated by the Yugoslav government to the churches
 and religious communities.
 The Serbian community has requested that the Macedonian Orthodox Church
 allow Serbian clerics to administer a church and a monastery in northern Macedo-
 nia. The Muslim religious community recently complained to the Government about
 the Macedonian Orthodox Church erecting crosses on bell and clock towers in sev-
 eral towns. Although government authorities ruled that the emplacement of the
 crosses was illegal, local authorities have apparently not yet complied with the Gov-
 ernment's decision.
 There are no restrictions on foreign missionaries, and they are free to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are permitted free movement within the country as well as the
 right to leave and return. These rights may be restricted for security, public health,
 and safety reasons.
 Over 30,000 registered refugees from the crisis in Bosnia have been resettled in
 Macedonia. The Government estimates that an equal number of unregistered refu-
 gees have entered the country. Eighty-eight percent of the refugees are housed in
 private homes, with the rest in refugee camps. Since late summer, the Government
 has restricted the entry of refugees, and the current government position is that no
 more refugees will be admitted.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights. The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The citizens of Macedonia chose their government in 1990 by secret ballot in free
 and fair, multiparty, multicandidate elections. The parliamentary term is 4 years.
 The Constitution allows citizens who are at least 18 years of age to vote. There are
 no restrictions on the participation of women in political activities, and two women
 serve as ministers in the coalition Government.
 The country is governed by a unicameral parliament of 120 members called the
 Assembly. The Prime Minister, who is the Head of Government, is the candidate
 of the party or parties that are in the majority in the assembly. The Prime Minister
 is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Assembly. The Prime Minister
 and the other ministers do not have to be members of the Assembly. The Constitu-
 tion also provides for legislation by initiative and referendum. The President, elect-
 ed to a 5-year term by secret ballot in a general election, is Head of State, chairman
 of the Security Council and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
 The nonparty "government of experts" fell after a vote of no confidence in July.
 The President ave VMRO-DPMNU, the largest party in the Assembly, the oppor-
 tunity to form the next government, but it was unable to do so. In September a coa-
 lition of the Social Democratic Alliance (former Communists), the Alliance of Reform
 Forces (liberal), the Party for Democratic Prosperity (Albanian), and other smaller
 parties formed a Government headed by a member of the Social Democratic Alli-
 ance, Branko Crvenkovski.
 The Government participated in several rounds of talks with representatives of
 the Albanian community under the auspices of the Peace Conference on the former
 Yugoslavia. In accordance with the Constitution, the Assembly on October 26 nomi-
 nated a 13-member Council on Interethnic Relations, comprised of the President of
 the Assembly and two representatives each from six national and ethnic groups
 (Serbs, Macedonians Romas, Vlachs, Turks, and Albanians).
 Over the strong objections and boycott of the Albanian political parties, the As-
 sembly adopted a law on citizenship on October 27 which requires 15 years' resi-
 dency as a precondition to acquire Macedonian citizenship. The Albanian commu-
 nity, which had sought a maximum 5-year residency requirement, charged that the
 law was inherently discriminatory and disenfranchised a large segment of the Alba-
 nian population.
 A special European Community (EC) arbitration commission, the Badinter Com-
 mission, considered Macedonia's request for recognition on the basis of the following
 criteria, among others: acceptance of the U.N. Charter and CSCE agreements and
 provision of guarantees of the rights of ethnic minorities. The Badinter Commis-
 sion's January 14, 1992, report stated that Macedonia fulfilled all EC conditions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups, such as the Democratic Forum for Human Rights in Mac-
 edonia, and ethnic minority groups meet frequently with foreign representatives
 with no government interference. The Government did not oppose visits or inves-
 tigations by international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Macedonia has a variety of national and ethnic groups: Macedonians, Albanians,
 Turks, Romas (Gypsies), Serbs, Greeks, and Vlachs (Romanians). All citizens are
 equal under the law. The Constitution guarantees the protection of the ethnic, cul-
 tural, linguistic, and religious identity of ethnic groups.
 In spite of these guarantees, Albanians allege that they are being discriminated
 against. They expressed concern about undercounting an so refused to participate
 in the 1991 census. (According to the 1981 census, Macedonians comprised 67 per-
 cent of the population, Albanians 20 percent, Turks 5 percent, and Serbs 2 percent.
 Some observers estimate that Albanians now account for some 25 to 30 percent of
 the population, while the Albanians themselves claim up to 40 percent.) Albanians
 also boycotted the vote in the 1991 independence referendum because of objections
 to several provisions in the proposed constitution; however, they participated in the
 1992 elections.
 Albanians pressed their claims of discrimination in January at the Yugoslav
 Peace Conference and from June onward in talks with the Government under the
 auspices of the Peace Conference. They also pressed their claims within Parliament,
 where they hold about 20 percent of the seats, and within the Cabinet, where they
 hold five ministerial portfolios. They claimed there were limited oportunities for Al-
 banian-language broadcasts on radio and television, inadequate schooling in the Al-
 banian language, and patterns of employment discrimination. Albanian advocacy
 
 
 groups and political parties charged that Albanians were also underrepresented in
 both the milita  and police forces. The Government acknowledged this, and both
 the Ministries of Defense and Interior instituted moderate measures to ameliorate
 the imbalance including special competitions for mid-level positions open only to
 members of ethnic minorities and quotas for the induction of ethnic minorities into
 the military college and police academy.
 The Serbian minority made similar claims about limited opportunities and
 underrepresentation.
 President Gligorov has been a vocal advocate of interethnic cooperation and has
 played an influential behind-the-scenes role in promoting such cooperation. He has
 stated he is in favor of strict measures against discrimination and also favors en-
 hanced linguistic and cultural autonomy. The Government considers the participa-
 tion of Albanian parties and ministers in the coalition Government as an indication
 of I.ogress.
 women possess the same legal rights as men. Little is known of the extent to
 which violence against women, including domestic violence, occurs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution guarantees citizens the right
 to form trade unions. There are restrictions on that right for military personnel, po-
 lice, and government workers. However, the Government has not yet enacted new
 laws on trade unions that would implement the constitutional guarantees. Reliable
 statistics on the unionized proportion of the labor force are not available. Much of
 Macedonia's total work force is rural and not unionized.
 The Council of Trade Unions of Macedonia (SSSM) is the labor confederation
 which is the successor organization to the old Communist labor confederation. It
 continues to maintain the assets of the Communist group and remains the Govern-
 ment's main negotiating partner on social issues. The Union of Independent and Au-
 tonomous Trade Unions (UNNIA) is a totally new confederation formed in 1992 with
 six member unions. A new independent journalists' association has not joined UNIA
 because it sees itself primarily as a professional organization to deal with free press
 issues.
 The Constitution guarantees the right to strike. Difficult economic conditions,
 brought on by the co lapse of markets, fuel shortfalls, and currency shortages, re-
 suited in high unemployment thrnughout 1992, and strikes were more or less a
 daily occurrence. Several strikes early in the year resulted in confrontations with
 security forces, and, in some cases, in injuries. Teachers and railroad mechanical
 workers went on strike, demanding higher wages. In October thousands of construc-
 tion workers staged a peaceful strike in downtown Skopje. In November farmers
 partially blacked roads in southern Macedonia in protest over the low purchase
 price of agricultural products. In most cases, the employers or Government offered
 compromise packages, such as wage increases or purchase price increases, which
 satisfied the strikers' main demands.
 Trade unions are free to join international trade union organizations. American
 Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations representatives met
 with the new independent trade unions in Macedonia and supplied several of them
 with information about international labor organizations, but to date no trade union
 has affiliated with an international organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution implicitly
 recognizes employees right to bargain collectively. Collective bargaining, however,
 is still in its formative stages. Formerly, public employee official unions, which en-
 compassed the majority of unionized workers, estab ished so-called collective agree-
 ments with the Government, which set minimum wages and various other stand-
 ards. Collective agreements are still commonly used to govern employer-employee
 relations and have the status of virtual law. Parliament has not yet approved legis-
 lation defining collective bargaining rights or prohibiting antiunion discrinmination.
 There are no export proces.ing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited and is
 not known to be practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The constitutional minimum age
 for employment of children is 15.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Yugoslavia had extensive laws concerning ac-
 ceptable conditions of work, including an official 42-hour workweek with generous
 vacation time and sick leave benefits. Macedonia adopted many of these provisions.
 The Constitution guarantees safe working conditions, temporary disability com-
 pensation, and leave benefits.
 As part of a government stabilization package, the formerly Communist-domi-
 nated labor federation (SSSM) in September negotiated with the Government and
 
 
 semiofficial business associations a monthly net minimum wage to be effective
 through 1992. That wage will be indexed only if monthly inflation exceeds 30 per-
 cent. Although the minimum wage agreement represented a substantial increase
 over previous average wages, numerous studies suggest that the current cost of liv-
 ing still far exceeds the minimum wage.
 Although Macedonia has laws and regulations on worker safety remaining from
 Yugoslav legislation, credible reports indicate they are not strictly enfored. The
 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is responsible for enforcing regulations per-
 taining to working conditions.
