 President Soeharto and the military wield predominant
 political power; opposition groups exist but in fact have no
 real chance to obtain power. Since the mid-1960's, after an
 abortive coup backed by the Communist Party, retired and
 active-duty military officers and civilian technocrats have
 exercised centralized executive authority under President
 Soeharto's leadership. The partly elected, partly appointed
 Parliament (DPR) considers but does not initiate legislation.
 The People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)--consisting of 500
 appointed members and the 500 DPR members--meets every 5 years
 to approve guidelines for government policy and to elect the
 President and Vice President.
 Indonesia is the fifth most populous country in the world and
 the largest in Southeast Asia. Since independence, Indonesian
 leaders have sought to create a national identity and to
 accommodate ethnic, religious, linguistic, and geographical
 diversities, while fostering cohesion, internal security, and
 development. The Soeharto Government actively promotes
 allegiance to "Pancasila," five broad, guiding principles of
 national life: belief in one supreme god, a just and
 civilized humanity, Indonesian national unity, democracy, and
 social justice.
 The armed forces (ABRI)--which include the military services
 and the police--number about 416,000. The Army constitutes
 about half of the armed forces and focuses mainly on internal
 security. Under a "dual function" concept, many military
 officers serve in the civilian bureaucracy at all levels and
 in Parliament. Frequent military operations against dwindling
 insurgency movements in the provinces of East Timor and Irian
 Jaya took place. In East Timor, at least 15 civilians were
 killed by the military in 1990, a figure reduced from previous
 years. For 2 months, beginning in October, there was a
 temporary increase in reports of security force beatings of
 detainees there. An upsurge in Aceh (Northwest Sumatra) of
 separatist violence and alleged violent crime, linked to
 economic and cultural grievances, provoked a significant
 increase in military presence and operations there. There
 were numerous unconfirmed reports of military abuses against
 alleged criminals and suspected separatists--including
 arbitrary arrest, mistreatment of detainees, and extrajudicial
 killings--raising the possibility of a government campaign of
 violent intimidation directed at these rebels and their
 sympathizers.
 Although Indonesia's mixed economy involves the State in
 nearly all sectors, government policies are expanding the role
 and freedom of the private sector. Deregulation aimed
 primarily at stimulating growth in nonoil sectors has been a
 major government objective since the collapse of oil prices in
 the early 1980's. Real gross domestic product growth in 1989
 was 7.4 percent and was estimated to be of a similar order of
 magnitude in 1990. Despite substantial increases in real
 incomes and in the standard of living of most Indonesians in
 the past 20 years, the country is poor, there is significant
 unemployment, and wide disparities in wealth exist.
 Corruption and influence peddling are endemic and restrict
 growth and economic opportunity.
 Human rights remained circumscribed in 1990. Areas of abuse
 included the killing and physical mistreatment, sometimes
 torture, of civilians by military and the police; the often
 
 
 'INDONESIA
 unfair administration of justice, especially in cases under
 the broad antisubversion-law; significant restrictions of
 freedoms of speech, press, and assembly; authoritarian
 political controls; and persistent discrimination against
 ethnic Chinese. Military abuses in East Timor continued but
 apparently at a reduced rate overall, while military
 operations against separatists.in Aceh produced reports of
 new, serious abuses there. On the other hand, there was some
 fitful easing of press censorship and aimodest relaxation of
 restrictions on political discussion. Other favorable
 developments included unprecedented acquittals in two
 subversion trials; the early release-from prison of a leading
 dissident; an enhanced role for Parliament; formation of a ï¿½
 second labor union; and beginning steps toward enforcing
 minimumnwage requirements, including conviction of some
 offending employers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity- of the Person. Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Military forces in East Timor, according to credible reports,
 killed at least 15-civilians, a decrease from 1989. Official
 sources-confirmed the deaths of five civilians in a military
 operation in Aceh. There have also been reports of execution-
 style killings there. Eight bodies--some mutilated--were
 reportedly found in areas of insurgent activity during
 September and October. Those discoveries, as well as reports
 of bodies found in north Jakarta in January, revived
 speculation about "mysterious, killings," i.e., vigilante
 killings by security forces, which had abated in recent
 years. Insurgents and alleged criminals in Aceh killed an
 undetermined number of military and police officials, and
 reportedly killed several informants as well- Local military
 authoritiev claimed to have taken disciplinary action against
 some subordinates responsible for human rights abuses but did
 not specify what action was taken.
 b. Disappearance
 Security forces periodically took persons for interrogation,
 usually without notification to- families, resulting in at
 least their temporary disappearance. This occurred
 particularly in East Timor and Aceh, but also in Irian Jaya
 and elsewhere- Most reports are unspecific and difficult to
 confirm. No cases of suspected permanent disappearance were
 resolved-
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Credible reports of torture and mistreatment, including rape,'
 of criminal suspects, detainees, and prisoners were frequent.
 Police in Jakarta, for instance, on several reported-
 occasions, beat individuals taken temporarily into custody;
 youths detained in East Timor in connection with civil unrest
 were beaten, sometimes severely--and in some cases were
 subjected to more serious physical mistreatment. Police often
 resort to physical abuse, even in minor incidents. Officials
 have publicly acknowledged and condemned police brutality and
 unacceptable prison conditions and occasionally instigated
 disciplinary action, including transfer, dismissal, trial, and
 
 
 894
 INDONESIA
 sentencing to prison terms. However, in 1990 there were no
 known instances of officials being punished for mistreatment
 of political prisoners or detainees. Pretrial mistreatment of
 detainees to obtain confessions is reportedly common.
 The practice in Medan of "shooting to wound" criminal suspects
 allegedly attempting to escape capture continued, and efforts
 by police in Jakarta to cope with increased crime rates raised
 concerns about excessive use of force against suspects in
 several cases. Peaceful though at times unruly demonstrators
 in East Timor were on several occasions beaten and wounded by
 security personnel. Three participants required
 hospitalization after riot police forcibly dispersed a
 demonstration in East Timor during the January visit of the
 U.S. Ambassador. Police reportedly tortured at least one of
 five students arrested after a September 4 proindependence
 rally in East Timor. Reports of torture and mistreatment of
 political detainees have been persistent, although fewer in
 1990 than in recent years. In Aceh there were also reports
 that police and soldiers had beaten and terrorized suspected
 rebel sympathizers. Rebels in East Timor, Irian Jaya, and
 Aceh periodically harassed and terrorized civilians.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Criminal Procedures Code (KUHAP) contains protections
 against arbitrary arrest and detention and specifies the right
 of prisoners to legal counsel and notification of family.
 These safeguards are often disregarded in practice. Detainees
 in cases of alleged subversion may be held up to a year
 without charges. Security agencies detain and arrest persons,
 including students and intellectuals, to intimidate them and
 inhibit activities judged undesirable. Legal mechanisms for
 redress of such actions are inadequate. The approximate
 number of persons detained without trial is unknown, although
 past estimates were up to 500. Application of a 1987
 presidential decree on remission of prison terms leaves
 uncertain the status of some prisoners, including several
 reportedly still in jail despite apparent expiration of their
 sentences.
 The Agency for Coordination of Assistance for the
 Consolidation of National Security (BAKORSTANAS) operates
 outside KUHAP procedures and has wide discretion to detain and
 interrogate persons thought to threaten national security.
 Indonesian law does not provide for the right to judicial
 review of such actions or for the right to protection or legal
 aid for the detainees. Their cases are rarely if ever
 publicized.
 Security forces periodically detained persons on suspicion of
 subversive activity or knowledge thereof for days or weeks in
 East Timor, Irian Jaya, and Aceh, subsequently releasing most
 without charges. The youths temporarily detained for
 demonstrating during the Pope's October 1989 visit to East
 Timor were freed by January. Six went on trial, with two
 sentenced to short prison terms served retroactively.
 Following a proindependence demonstration in September in East
 Timor, some participants were reportedly detained temporarily
 and a few were arrested. As many as 40 youths were detained
 temporarily for questioning following October disturbances at
 two schools. In one incident, police were called in when a
 'subversive text" (a proindependence sign) was found. These
 incidents reflected a cycle of increased civil unrest,
 including violent attacks by some youths on soldiers and
 
 
 895
 INDONESIA
 policemen and subsequent overreaction by security forces.
 Nevertheless,.early releases have reduced to 10 the number of
 East Timorese serving sentences in Dili and Jakarta for
 involvement with the Fretilin rebels.
 Elsewhere in the country, following a vigorous public outcry,
 Justice Ministry officials reversed the transfer by local
 authorities of eight young political prisoners to a prison
 normally used for hardened criminals. In September'one of the
 country's leading dissidents, retired Lt. Gen. H.R. Dharsono,
 was released for good behavior after serving 5 years and 8
 months of a 7-year subversion sentence. As noted in our 1985
 report, Dharsono's lawyers claimed at the time of his trial ï¿½
 that he was not permitted to meet with legal counsel for most
 of the 7-month pretrial period, was denied bail contrary to
 common legal practice, and was not permitted to offer
 testimony from 6 of 12 witnesses he sought. Dharsono's
 original 10-year sentence was reduced in 1986.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A quadripartite judiciary of general, religious, military, and
 administrative courts exists below the Supreme Court. The
 right of appeal from District Court to High Court to Supreme
 Court exists. The Supreme Court, with a current backlog of
 some 17,000 cases, does not consider material aspects of a
 case, only the lower courts' application of law. Initial
 judgments ar& rarely reversed in the appeals process, although
 sentences are sometimes increased or reduced. A three-judge
 panel conducts most trials, poses questions, hears evidence,
 decides guilt or innocence, and assesses punishment. The
 judiciary is not independent; judges are civil servants
 employed by the executive branch. The Supreme Court cannot
 annul laws passed by Parliament.
 Most court sessions are open to the public, and most
 defendants have access to counsel although such access is
 sometimes significantly delayed. Destitute defendants can
 obtain private legal help, such as that provided by the Legal
 Aid Institute (LBHY. Courts also'can provide a limited amount
 of aid for those unable to afford legal assistance. The State
 must ensure legal assistance in capital cases-.
 Corruption permeates the Indonesian legal system. In civil
 and criminal cases, payment of bribes can influence decisions,
 prosecution, conviction, and sentencing. Use in trials of
 forced confessions and limitations on the presentation of
 defense evidence are reportedly common. The Government has
 occasionally taken action- against flagrant offenders, but by
 and- large these abuses continue unchecked. The Government
 supports programs to improve legal awareness, training, and
 research.
 Conviction is virtually automatic in cases involving
 Indonesia's broad 1963 antisubversion law, although, in an
 unprecedented move, courts in 1990 acquitted two persons
 charged with-subversion on grounds of mistaken identity and
 insufficient evidence respectively. Advocacy or actions in
 support of secession or creation of an Islamic state,
 criticism of Pancasila, and smuggling are classified
 subversive offenses subject to a maximum penalty of death.
 Although the Government does not provide data on the number of
 persons serving subversion sentences, careful estimates based
 on the incomplete information available suggest a total of
 approximately 400. This estimate includes persons sentenced
 
 
 896
 INDONESIA
 for involvement in the 1965 Communist coup attempt and alleged
 Muslim extremists, many of whom, according to credible
 reports, were unfairly convicted for peaceful protest
 activity. Although the exact numbers are undetermined, some
 persons are serving sentences or are under detention for
 peaceful political activities in East Timor and elsewhere.
 Dozens of subversion trials took place in 1990, most related
 to prior incidents in Lampung, Jakarta, and Sumbawa involving
 alleged Muslim extremists charged with seeking to establish an
 Islamic state. Some of these defendants committed acts of
 violence; however, charges of committing dr plotting to commit
 violence against other defendants appeared fabricated.
 Sentences ranged from 6 to 17 years. Nearly 50 cases of
 alleged Muslim extremists were believed to be pending as of
 September. In Irian Jaya, three persons who unsuccessfully
 sought asylum at the Papua New Guinea Consulate were later
 tried and sentenced for 1989 secessionist activities, despite
 reported assurances that the Government would not prosecute
 them. The 7- and 8-year subversion sentences from 1989 of a
 student and an employee at Yogyakarta's Gajah Mada University
 were upheld. In connection with this case, a court in October
 convicted another student for possessing banned books
 allegedly espousing Marxist ideology and sentenced him to 8
 years and 6 months' imprisonment.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Judicial warrants for searches are required except for cases
 involving suspected subversion, economic crimes, and
 corruption. However, forced or surreptitious entry by
 security agencies reportedly occurs regularly. Security
 agencies intimidate by conducting surveillance of persons and
 residences, and they are believed to monitor selectively local
 and international telephone calls without legal restraint.
 Correspondence generally is not monitored. Government
 security officials try to monitor the movements and activities
 of up to 2.5 million former members of the Indonesian
 Communist Party (PKI) and the approximately 20 million members
 of its front groups. These persons and sometimes their
 relatives are subject to surveillance, required check-ins, and
 arbitrary actions by officials, including removal from
 government employment. While new regulations based on an
 April decree were promulgated to make less arbitrary the
 ideological screening of persons in government and other jobs
 considered sensitive, the potential for official
 discrimination remains.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Significant restrictions on freedom of speech and press
 exist. Government agencies exercise broad discretionary
 authority in applying laws concerning the rights of persons,
 and effective judicial review is lacking. Public statements
 or publications which criticize the Government or could be
 perceived as critical of it or of Pancasila, top leaders,
 their families, or particular religious and ethnic groups are
 often harshly punished.
 For example, six students were sentenced to prison terms
 averaging 3 years on criminal charges of insulting the
 Government during the Home Affairs Minister's August 1989
 
 
 897
 INDONESIA
 visit to the Bandung Institute of Technology. A Jakarta court
 sentenced Bambang Beathor Suryadi to 4 years and 5 months for
 spreading false rumors that insulted national leaders and for
 encouraging the publib to act against the Government.
 Subversion and criminal sentences periodically demonstrate
 limitations on freedom of speech. In October a court
 convicted a student at Yogyakarta's Gajah Mada University of
 subversion and sentenced him to 8 years and 6 months for
 possessing banned books allegedly espousing Marxist ideology.
 This was the third conviction in this case, stemming from
 arrests made in 1988. Authorities'banned two popular
 theatrical productions, one almost through its run and the
 other having played without interference in the past, for
 contents deemed harmful to public order. A poet instructed
 not to read two of his works canceled a planned performance.
 In December Parliament held a hearing with representatives of
 the artistic community critical of these bannings, which drew
 spirited and negative public reactions. The Government
 subsequently revoked the bannings. Public and media airing of
 issues regarded as sensitive to the Government--including
 complaints against officials, the President's tenure in
 office, the business activities of the President's family, and
 calls for change in the political system--increased in 1990.
 President Soeharto sanctioned the expression of different
 points of view in an address to Parliament on August 16, and
 various government critics attempted to test the limits of
 government tolerance during the year.
 The risk of official sanctions and informal government
 instructions generally influence the media to avoid or
 exercise great caution in disseminating views of government
 critics. -However, coverage of opposition views conveyed to
 the Parliament in August and of Lt. Gen. Dharsono's September
 release from prison was extensive. Lack of clear guidelines
 on what is permissible has generated a significant degree of
 self-censorship both in public speaking and in the press.
 However, the limits of government tolerance were regularly
 tested in 1990-usually by indirection--in published
 editorials, opinion pieces, cartoons, and public statements
 that sometimes tweaked the Government, sometimes more
 seriously questioned it.
 While academic freedom is provided, for in law, constraints
 exist on the activities of scholars. They sometimes refrain
 from producing materials which they believe might provoke
 government displeasure. Publishers are unwilling to accept
 manuscripts dealing with controversial issues. Although
 considerable public discussion of East Timor took place,
 authorities canceled a seminar scheduled to present the
 findings of a study of its economy.
 The Government operates the national television network. A
 private company offers television service to viewers in
 Jakarta. A private commercial station began operating in
 Surabaya and another was approved for Yogyakarta. More than
 400 private radio stations operate in Indonesia in addition to
 the national radio network. Private television and radio
 stations, which have considerable programming latitude, are
 subject to careful official scrutiny and are required to use
 government-provided news programs. Private radio stations
 frequently supplement such news programs with their own
 reports. Foreign television and radio broadcasts are
 accessible to those who can afford the technology.
 
 
 898
 INDONESIA
 The press is largely privately owned. Officials state that
 the press is "free" but also "responsible." It is expected to
 support national development and stability, be educational,
 and uphold professional standards. The Government exercises
 strong control over the press through its control of
 publishing permits. One periodical lost its permit after
 there were negative reactions to polling results it released
 which were judged insulting to the prophet Mohammed. The
 Government often advises editors and reporters about news
 which cannot be reported, and it closely monitors media
 outlets. Oral or written warnings are issued for published
 material found unacceptable. For example, in March the
 Minister of Information issued a warning to a newspaper for a
 column comparing President Soeharto to a pharaoh. The
 newspaper apologized and fired the writer. If ignored,
 warnings can result in a ban on circulation or revocation of
 the license to publish. The Government limits the number of
 newspaper licenses, the amount of advertising, and the number
 of pages.
 In 1990 the press received warnings for a variety of reports
 found objectionable by the Government. Numerous reports on
 issues considered sensitive by the Government, particularly in
 the English-language domestic press, nonetheless went
 unchallenged. The Coordinating Minister for Security and
 Political Affairs announced in August an end to the government
 practices of telephoning editors to suppress stories and
 censoring foreign periodicals, but some newspapers continued
 thereafter to receive such telephone directives. The Attorney
 General banned in August four books, one by a U.S. author
 charging President Soeharto with masterminding the abortive
 1965 coup. The other books concerned the violent February
 1989 clash between members of an Islamic sect and the
 military, the controversy surrounding "The Satanic Verses,"
 and former President Soekarno's role in the 1965 coup. In
 December the Attorney General banned another four books,
 giving as grounds that one disparaged Islam; another
 (containing rebuttals of the indictments against the Bandung
 university students) contained inaccuracies and discredited
 the Government; and two more had unacceptable sexual content.
 The Justice Minister temporarily suspended one newspaper's
 access to his Ministry. In November the Government banned a
 foreign journalist from returning to Indonesia for "defaming"
 President Soeharto in a newspaper article. The article
 described the Soeharto family's business activities and
 speculated about the impact they may have on Soeharto's
 decision whether to seek reelection. The Government also
 announced that it would investigate the Indonesian distributor
 of the two international newspapers that carried the article
 for failing to "exercise self-censorship."
 Chinese-language publications, with the exception of one
 officially sanctioned daily newspaper, can neither be imported
 nor produced domestically. Private instruction of Chinese is
 discouraged but takes place to a limited extent. No laws
 prohibit speaking Chinese, but the Government lays heavy
 stress on the learning and use of the national language,
 Bahasa Indonesia.
 The Government closely regulates visiting and resident foreign
 correspondents and occasionally xeminds the latter of its
 prerogative to deny requests for visa extensions.
 The importation of foreign publications and video tapes, which
 must be reviewed by government censors, requires a permit.
 
 
 899
 INDONESIA
 Importers usually avoid foreign materials critical of the
 Government or dealing with topics considered sensitive, such
 as human rights. Foreign periodicals and newspapers, readily
 available in Indonesia, are subject to censorship prior to
 distribution. A marked number of articles inked or cut out
 preceded the August announcement of an end to the practice
 which at year's end continued sporadically and unpredictably.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All organizations must have government permission to hold
 regional and national meetings. Local jurisdictions often
 require prior approval for smaller gatherings as well. While
 obtaining such approvals is fairly automatic, authorities
 occasionally withhold permission. Meetings of nongovernmental
 organizations that do occur are sometimes subject to
 substantial official efforts to produce specific outcomes. A
 long-postponed meeting of the Indonesian Lawyers Association
 ended in disarray over such efforts. Student gatherings have
 often been the target of disapprovals, and ostensible
 political activity at universities remains forbidden under the
 "Campus Life Normalization" (NKK) law of 1978. The Minister
 of Education and Culture issued revisions in June to allow.
 student senates at universities, although the bodies'
 prescribed composition and autonomy fall short of many
 students' demands.
 Student activism continued in 1990, though not at the same
 pitch as in 1989. Delegations raised land reform issues at
 Parliament, expressed foreign policy concerns at embassies,
 addressed human rights questions to the visiting chairman of
 Indonesia's international donor group, welcomed Lt. Gen.
 Dharsono on. his return to freedom, and protested the arbitrary
 handling of student prison inmates to Parliament and the
 Ministry of Justice. Peaceful demonstrators in East Timor
 were forcibly dispersed in January, and several persons were
 detained temporarily and beaten by security personnel
 following a demonstration there in September. Security forces
 intervened in two schools in East Timor in October after
 expression of proindependence views by some students. An
 official who reportedly provoked the student outburst at one
 school was fired.
 The 1985 "Social Organizations" (ORMAS) law requires all
 organizations, including recognized religions and
 associations, to adhere to Pancasila. This provision, which
 limits political activity, is widely understood as prohibiting
 groups which seek to make Indonesia an Islamic state. The law
 empowers the Government to disband any organization it
 believes to be acting against Pancasila and requires prior
 government approval for any organization's acceptance of funds
 from foreign donors.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution recognizes and provides for religious freedom
 for Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism, and permits
 practice of the mystical, animistic beliefs of "Aliran
 Kepercayaan." Although the population is overwhelmingly
 Muslim, the practice and teachings of the other recognized
 faiths are respected. The Catholic Church operates widely in
 East Timor. Various restrictions on religious activity
 nonetheless exist. According to official statistics, nearly
 400 "misleading religious cults" are banned, including some
 Islamic groups considered heretical. Existing bans affect
 
 
 900
 INDONESIA
 many thousands of adherents, and new bannings by national or
 local authorities occur periodically.
 Although banned, several thousand Jehovah's Witnesses are
 believed to practice in Jakarta alone. Adherents are
 periodically detained and their religious materials
 confiscated. A spokesman for the Ministry of Religious
 Affairs urged security authorities to crack down on
 practitioners for seeking converts and inciting unrest. A
 1963 ban on the Baha'i faith continues in force, and some
 observers expressed concern about stricter implementation.
 The private practice of banned religions is often tolerated,
 although authorities periodically harass adherents or pressure
 them to convert to the recognized faiths. Because the first
 tenet of Pancasila is belief in a supreme being, atheism is
 forbidden. The legal requirement to adhere to Pancasila
 extends to all religious and secular organizations.
 The Government strongly opposes Muslim groups which advocate
 establishing an Islamic state or acknowledging only Islamic
 law, both of which are outlawed. Over 100 and possibly many
 more alleged Muslim extremists are estimated to be serving
 prison terms on subversion charges. The Minister of Religious
 Affairs affirmed the Government's continuing determination to
 take stern measures against foreign religious teachers found
 proselytizing while on tourist passes. Visiting Muslim
 fundamentalist teachers have been particularly susceptible to
 deportation.
 There is no legal bar to conversion between faiths, and
 conversions occur. However, proselytizing between the
 recognized religions or in areas heavily dominated by one
 recognized religion or another is considered potentially
 disruptive and is discouraged. Foreign missionary activities
 are relatively unimpeded. In recent years, however, some
 foreign missionaries have had difficulty renewing visas or
 residence permits--a few on unspecified "security grounds."
 Laws and decrees from the 1970's do not allow foreign
 missionaries to spend more than 10 years in Indonesia, with
 extensions to 15 in exceptional circumstances only. With rare
 exceptions, enforcement of this policy does not discriminate
 by sect or nationality. Exceptions to the 10-year rule have
 been granted to foreign religious workers since late 1987 in
 the remote areas of Irian Jaya and Kalimantan and, more
 recently, in other parts of the country. The Government says
 it intends over time to reduce the number of foreign
 missionaries in order to encourage employment of Indonesians.
 Foreign missionary work is subject to the funding stipulations
 of the "ORMAS" law discussed above.
 Indonesians practicing the recognized religions maintain
 active links with coreligionists imside and outside Indonesia
 and travel abroad for religious gatherings. The Government
 permits a set number of pilgrims to make the hajj annually.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Restrictions on freedom of movement exist. Permits to seek
 work in a new location are required in certain areas,
 primarily to control further population movement to crowded
 cities. Previously some ethnic Chinese encountered legal and
 bureaucratic obstacles to obtaining citizenship, although the
 Government's stated policy was to encourage them to apply. In
 connection with the August renewal of diplomatic ties between
 
 
 INDONESIA
 Indonesia and China, officials announced that stateless
 Chinese-currently estimated to number 300,000--must adopt the
 citizenship of one country or the other and that Indonesia's
 procedures would be simplified and shortened. Travel to China
 remains restricted; and the State Secretary expressed
 opposition to the rumored plans of many ethnic Chinese to
 attend the Asian Games in Beijing. The Director General of
 Immigration announced the exemption of additional categories
 of citizens from the exit-visa requirement.
 The Government acknowledges maintaining a "blacklist" that
 includes domestic critics and others in disfavor whose foreign
 travel is periodically prohibited. Although reliable figures
 are not available, an estimated 5,000 Indonesians-including
 prominent past civilian and military officials--currently may
 not leave the country. Some critics, however, are free to
 travel abroad, and a person prohibited at one time may be
 permitted to travel subsequently. Students wishing and able
 to do so can generally go abroad for study.
 Restrictions exist on movement by Indonesian and foreign
 citizens to and within parts of Irian Jaya. Security checks
 affecting transportation and travel in East Timor outside Dili
 (the provincial capital) occurred sporadically, and permission
 is required to visit certain districts considered sensitive
 for security reasons. Some journalists visiting East Timor
 were restricted from traveling everywhere they wanted, while
 some others visiting as tourists traveled extensively.
 Curfews were often in force in connection with military
 operations in parts of East Timor and Aceh. Family visits
 back to East Timor by East Timorese now living in Australia
 continued.
 Former political detainees, including those associated with
 the abortive 1965 coup, must notify authorities of their
 movements and may not change their place of residence without
 official permission. A spokesman for BAKORSTANAS reasserted
 the Government's case-by-case approach to members or alleged
 supporters of the banned PKI outside Indonesia, saying that
 those living in Eastern Europe can return but must undergo
 intensive investigation before resuming a normal life.
 President Soeharto said ex-PKI members can return to Indonesia
 provided they submit to the legal, process, as did their
 colleagues who never left.
 Indonesia has given first asylum to over 125,000 Indochinese
 asylum seekers since 1975, and the population of its Galang
 Island facility was over 20,000 at year's end. Vietnamese
 arrivals increased dramatically in 1990; over 7,000 had been
 redirected from nearby Malaysia. Galang's Cambodian
 population was about 1,800. Indonesia considers the
 Cambodians illegal entrants rather than asylum seekers.
 Nevertheless, Cambodians have been allowed to remain in
 Indonesia, pending an international, decision on how to resolve
 their situation. Three boatloads of Cambodians were refitted,
 reprovisioned, and assisted to sail to Australia.
 In June and July 1990, some asylum seekers reported
 experiencing abuse while transiting to Galang. Military
 personnel--some of whom were subsequently transferred--raped,
 beat, and robbed asylum seekers who landed at Kuku Island. At
 least one victim died. The U. N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) immediately investigated-and notified
 relevant authorities; subsequently, reports of such incidents
 ended.
 
 
 INDONESIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Parliament, political organizations, and the general public
 have limited ability to influence government decisions but can
 not change the system or its leadership. President Soeharto
 and a small group of active-duty and retired military officers
 and civilian technocrats exercise governmental authority. The
 military has responsibility under a "dual function" doctrine
 for national defense and security plus sociopolitical
 affairs. The military is predominant in the political and
 security fields. The Constitution provides Parliament a
 mechanism to call the President to account in extraordinary
 circumstances. Government leaders seek out and receive public
 opinion informally. Reflecting a strong cultural preference,
 Indonesian leaders emphasize the importance of decisionmaking
 and resolving disputes through "consultation leading to
 consensus."
 In 1990 public discussion among elites focused continued
 attention on the paternalistic political system, laws
 regulating political activity, and the challenge of managing
 political change to keep pace with and support economic
 progress. Some top officials indicated increased tolerance
 for pluralistic political activity and expression, while also
 responding with varying effectiveness to public concerns about
 the gap between rich and poor, domination of the economy by
 conglomerates, land use disputes, and fuel prices.
 The Parliament--whose members are screened by the Government
 before election or appointment--considers bills presented to
 it by government departments and agencies but does not draft
 laws on its own, although it has the constitutional right to
 do so. The Government seeks to resolve potential
 parliamentary concerns before bills are officially presented.
 Parliament makes technical and occasionally substantive
 alterations to bills it reviews. Through consultations and
 hearings with ministers and other executive branch officials,
 press statements, and field trips, Parliament is more actively
 contributing to the content and execution of government policy
 than previously, but it remains clearly subordinate to the
 executive branch.
 Only three political organizations are allowed by law.
 -GOLKAR, a government-sponsored organization of diverse
 functional groups, dominates. Two small political
 parties--the United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian
 Democratic Party (PDI)--also operate. By law they embrace
 Pancasila. They are not considered opposition parties and
 seldom espouse policies much different from the Government's.
 The leaders of all these organizations are approved, if not
 chosen, by the Government, and their -activities are closely
 scrutinized and often guided by government authorities.
 GOLKAR maintains close institutional links with the Armed
 Forces and KORPRI, the nonunion association to which all civil
 servants automatically belong. Civil servants may join either
 of the political parties with official permission, but most
 are members of GOLKAR. Former members of the PKI and some
 other banned parties may not run for office or be active
 politically.
 General elections for Parliament'and for provincial and
 district assemblies are held every 5 years. The Home Affairs
 Minister put into debate the role of the provincial assemblies
 by suggesting their abolition. GOLKAR won 73 percent of the
 
 
 903
 INDONESIA
 natidnal-vote in the 1987 elections. All adult citizens are
 eligible to vote, except active-duty members of the Aimed
 Forces, convicted criminals serving prison sentences, and some
 former PKI members.' The Governffient decided in February to
 screen some 40,600 of the latter for eligibility to
 participate in the 1992 elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 While the Government considers outside investigations of
 alleged human rights violati6ns to be interference in its
 internal affairs, it facilitated access in 1990 by Asia Watch
 representatives preparing a report critical of prison
 conditions, and the Foreign Minister met Asia Watch's
 executive director in New York in September. Amnesty
 International has been refused access to Indonesia. Informal
 Asia Watch visits, in addition'to the prison study, have
 occurred during the past several years. Access to East Timor
 by such organizations- which the Government considers
 biased-has traditionally been restricted though it has not
 been tested since the formal normalization of the province's
 status in 1989. Diplomats and some journalists are encouraged
 to visit the province.
 President Soeharto and the General Secretary of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) met
 in March and discussed worker rights issues. The Government
 generally ignores calls by domestic human rights groups and
 activists for investigations of alleged human rights
 incidents. While various domestic organizations and persons
 interested in human rights operate energetically, the
 Government discourages public human rights activities. Some
 human rights activists have complained of government
 harassment.
 Under'a 1985'agreement, the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) is authorized by the Government to visit persons
 held for security reasons in East Timor. The conditions of
 such access improved somewhat in 1990. In Irian Jaya the ICRC
 facilitated the return of some border crossers from Papua New
 Guinea and visited persons jailed in connection with
 separatist activities. The ICRC annually visits and
 interviews the prisoners convicted of participation in the
 abortive, Communist-backed coup in 1965. The Government has
 not to date allowed access by the ICRC-or any other
 international humanitarian group--to imprisoned Muslim
 activists.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Indonesians exhibit considerable tolerance for ethnic, racial,
 and major religious differences, with the major exception of
 official and informal discrimination against ethnic Chinese.
 Since 1959, noncitizen ethnic Chinese have been denied the
 right to run businesses in rural Indonesia. Regulations
 prohibit the operation of all-Chinese schools for ethnic
 Chinese citizens, formation of exclusively Chinese cultural
 groups or trade associations, and public display of Chinese
 characters. Many people of Chinese ancestry have nonetheless
 been successful in business and the professions, and the
 enforcement of restrictions is often haphazard. Some ethnic
 Chinese have enjoyed particular government favor. Social and
 
 
 904
 
 INDONESIA
 religious groups exist which are, in effect, all-Chinese and
 are not proscribed. In 1990 Jakarta authorities ended the
 practice of marking local identification cards to indicate
 Chinese ethnicity, and in Bandung a controversial decree to
 remove Chinese characters from tombstones and places of
 worship was rescinded. However, publicized statistics from
 the Attorney General's Office on persons accused of economic
 corruption categorized them as ethnic Chinese or indigenous
 Indonesian, and various materials for commercial sale bearing
 Chinese characters were seized.
 Under the law, and as President Soeharto and other officials
 periodically affirm, women are equal to and have the same
 rights, obligations, and opportunities as men. Some
 Indonesian women enjoy a high degree of economic and social
 freedom and occupy important mid-level positions in the civil
 service, educational institutions, labor organizations, the
 military, the professions, and private business. Although
 women constitute one quarter of the civil service, they occupy
 only a small fraction of the service's top posts. Women make
 up about 40 percent of the overall work force, with the
 majority in the rural sector. Despite legal guarantees of
 equal treatment, women seldom receive equal pay for equal work
 and disproportionately experience illiteracy and poor health
 and nutrition. Traditional attitudes which limit women's
 aspirations, activities, and status undercut state policy in
 some areas. Several voluntary, private groups work actively
 to advance women's legal, economic, social, and political
 rights and acknowledge some success in gaining official
 cognizance of their concerns.
 Violence against women is an acknowledged though inadequately
 documented problem. In response to a call for a new law to
 protect women, including application of the death penalty in
 rape cases, the Justice Minister argued instead that better
 enforcement of existing laws and regulations is necessary.
 The media frequently--and sometimes luridly--report instances
 of rape and other abuse against women and subsequent legal
 proceedings against the perpetrators. The Government has
 recognized domestic violence as a problem in Indonesian
 society and provides some counseling, as do several private
 organizations. However, cultural, social, psychological, and
 other factors .inhibit reporting of such abuse and recourse by
 victims to counseling and legal protection.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Private sector workers, including those in export-processing
 zones, are free to form or join unions without previous
 authorization, but in order to bargain on behalf of employees
 a union must meet the requirements for legal recognition and
 register with the Department of Manpower. The requirements
 for legal recognition are representation in at least 20 of the
 27 provinces, branch offices in at least 100 districts, and
 1,000 local units at plant level. The unions draw up their
 own constitutions and rules and elect their representatives
 while under close government scrutiny and subject to
 government approval prior to registration.
 About 6 percent of the 76-millionLmember work force is
 organized. The All Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI), which
 groups together private sector workers, is the only recognized
 intersectoral trade union body. The SPSI's predecessor
 
 
 905
 INDONESIA
 organization, FBSI, was set up in 1973 through a
 government-sponsored merger of various non-Communist unions
 and adopted its present name and structure, also with heavy
 government involvement, in 1985. The SPSI, recently
 reorganized into 13 autonomous divisions covering broad
 industrial sectors and specialized institutes, has about
 10,000 local units at the plant level and claims over 3
 million members, although only about 900,000 actually pay dues.
 In November a number of human rights campaigners announced the
 creation of the Setia Kawan (Solidarity) free trade union,
 alleging that the SPSI had failed to defend worker interests
 adequately. However, the Coordinating Minister for Political
 and Security Affairs initially stated that the Government
 would not approve the new trade union when it seeks to
 register because to do so would violate the Government's
 single-trade union policy. He later stated that the
 Government would tolerate the new organization if it did not
 do anything illegal. A number of groups and professional
 organizations, e.g., the Journalist Association and the Joint
 Secretariat of Industrial Unions, are permitted to carry out
 certain limited trade union functions and operate openly, but
 they-may not engage in collective bargaining. The nonunion
 teachers' association (PGRI) in April was allowed to register
 as a trade union with exclusive, jurisdiction for this sector.
 The PGRI, which consists of 1.3 million teachers, including
 teachers in religious, private, and public schools, has
 representation in all 27 provinces.
 State enterprise employees and civil servants must belong to
 KORPRI, a nonunion association whose central development
 council is chaired by the Minister of Home Affairs. During
 August, for the first time, a KORPRI subunit successfully
 negotiated four collective bargaining agreements with the
 state-owned coal company.
 The Government and employers have considerable influence over
 union affairs. A retired military lieutenant colonel and
 GOLKAR district chairman with some prior union experience was
 recently elected chairman of the largest provincial branch of
 the SPSI, partly due to government backing. SPSI officials
 are pressured to join GOLKAR, and GOLKAR members dominate the
 SPSI leadership.
 Under the ORMAS law (see Section 2..b.), government approval is
 needed for meetings outside union headquarters. Permission is
 routinely given. A union may be dissolved if the Government
 believes it is acting against Pancasila. There are no laws or
 regulations laying out the procedures for the dissolution of a
 union, and there have been no cases of union dissolution.
 The SPSI maintains international contacts, but it is not
 affiliated with any trade union organization, except the
 Associatibn of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Trade Union
 Council. The SPSI's government-endorsed application for
 membership in the ICFTU is still pending. Some elements of
 the SPSI, such as the Port and Maritime Workers,-maintain
 links with international trade union secretariats. The Joint
 Secretariat, grouping elements of the SPSI and unions not
 legally recogniied by the Government, has links with the World
 Confederation of Labor.
 While Pancasila principles call for labor-management
 differences to be settled by consensus, all organized workers,
 with the exception of civil servants, have a legal right to
 
 
 906
 INDONESIA
 strike. In June President Soeharto revoked a 1963
 presidential decree which prohibited strikes and lockouts in
 vital industries, services, and enterprises. This
 prohibition, although reportedly never implemented, was
 theoretically applicable to about 170,000 workers. Before a
 strike can occur in the private sector, the law requires
 intensive-mediation by the Department of Manpower and prior
 notice regarding the intent to strike, but no approval is
 required. Most disputes, however, are settled through
 negotiation and consensus. There were 45 strikes reported in
 1990, compared to 19 strikes for all of 1989, many of which
 were not legal. Many strikes are not reported.
 Strike outcomes varied. In one highly publicized strike at a
 textile factory, more than 21 workers, including some union
 officials, who protested the dismissal of 7 women workers and
 low wages, were dismissed. The minimum wage was increased,
 and the seven women rehired, but the strikers were not.
 In practice there are no clear established procedures
 regarding the settlement of disputes. The various laws,
 interpretative rules, instructions, and practices indicate
 that the parties should try to settle the dispute themselves.
 If they cannot settle the matter then they should submit the
 case to the Department of Manpower's Mediation and
 Conciliation Service. If the parties do not accept the
 mediator's decision, then the mediator or either party may
 submit the matter to tripartite (government, employers,
 employees) administrative tribunals or to arbitration. These
 tribunals hear arguments and issue decisions enforceable
 through the courts. The Minister of Manpower can nullify the
 decisions of administrative tribunals on legal or national
 interest grounds. Although technically the Minister's
 decisions may be appealed to the courts, in practice it is
 rarely done. Under the law, the parties can elect binding
 arbitration in lieu of the tripartite mechanism. However,
 this provision is seldom used; most cases are handled by the
 Department of Manpower's Mediation and Conciliation Service.
 The Central Board of KORPRI and its secretariats at the
 provincial level have employee relations bureaus, which are
 responsible for settling employee disputes. Some government
 departments have specific agreements with the Department of
 Manpower, which call for the convening of a labor committee to
 resolve disputes.
 Indonesia has for many years been the subject of complaints in
 the International Labor Organization (ILO). The American
 Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations,
 a longstanding critic, has brought worker rights complaints
 against Indonesia in U.S. trade proceedings. In May 1989, the
 ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA) reached final
 conclusions concerning the uncompleted aspects of a 1987
 complaint by the ICFTU pertaining to the ban on organizing
 public sector unions, insufficient protection against
 antiunion discrimination, and restrictions on collective
 bargaining and the exercise of the right to strike.
 Concluding that a large section of the work force does not
 have freedom to form or join a workers' organization of its
 own choosing, the CFA requested the Government to allow public
 employees to establish unions outside KORPRI and to remove
 other restrictions. In April and May 1990, the Government
 informed the CFA that the 1963 presidential decree would be
 repealed and that the PGRI had registered as a union. It also
 argued that there was no need for public servants to have
 
 
 907
 INDONESIA
 collective bargaining as the legislation adequately covers
 conditions of employment. In June the CFA pointed out that
 the limited nature of the "associations" public servants can
 form was tantamount to a restriction on unionization, even
 though there was no explicit legislative ban. In November the
 CFA took note of the repeal of the 1963 presidential decree
 and of the Government's report that collective labor
 agreements had been concluded by one KORPRI subunit.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is provided for by law, but only
 registered trade unions can do it. The Department of Manpower
 vigorously promotes collective bargaining as an instrument of
 industrial relations in accordance with Pancasila. The
 overwhelming majority of the SPSI's collective bargaining
 agreements are negotiated and concluded bilaterally with
 employers. Once notified that 25 employees have joined a
 registered union, the employer is under an obligation to
 bargain. As a transitional stage to encourage collective
 bargaining, regulations require that every company which has
 25 or more employees must issue company regulations defining
 the terms and conditions of employment. Before a company can
 register or renew its company regulations it must demonstrate
 that it has consulted with a committee consisting of employer
 and employee representatives, in the absence of a union. Of
 the approximately 10,000 SPSI units, only about half have
 collective bargaining agreements. The degree to which these
 agreements are freely negotiated between unions and management
 without government interference varies. By regulation,
 negotiations are to be concluded within 30 days. If not, the
 matter is submitted to the Department of Manpower for
 mediation and conciliation/arbitration. In practice, most
 negotiations are concluded within the 30-day period.
 Agreements are for 2 years and can be extended for I more.
 Labor law applies equally in export-processing zones. While
 some companies in these zones have SPSI units, none have
 negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Regulations
 expressly forbid employers prejudging or harassing employees
 because of union membership, and employees are urged to report
 harassment to the Government. The SPSI claims that some
 employers discriminate against its members and those wishing
 to form SPSI units.
 Many strikes and protests take place in support of fired union
 officials. Charges of antiunion discrimination are handled by
 the administrative tribunals. Many union members believe that
 the tribunals generally side with the employer. Two members
 of the-Jakarta City Council's Social Welfare Commission stated
 publicly that the tribunals are inclined to favor employers
 when settling labor disputes. Because of this partiality,
 many worers reject or avoid the process and present their
 disputes before the Parliament and other agencies.
 Workers can organize without restriction in a private
 enterprise even if it is designated vital by the Government.
 If the State has a partial interest, the enterprise is
 considered to be in the public service domain, but this does
 not legally limit organizing. There are a significant number
 of government/private joint enterprises which have labor
 unions and which bargain collectively.
 
 
 908
 INDONESIA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is strictly prohibited. Indonesia has ratified
 ILO Convention 29 concerning forced labor. The International
 Human Rights Law Group, a U.S.-based nongovernmental
 organization, asserts that military and civilian officials in
 Irian Jaya cooperate with Jakarta-based timber companies to
 compel Asmat tribespeople to cut down trees and transport them
 downstream to waiting ships, and that the-government
 resettlement program raises serious questions of informed
 consent. It also alleges that there are documented reports of
 labor contractors in Jakarta selling girls as domestic
 servants or to brothels near plantations, and that men are
 sold as agricultural workers. The Government has responded
 that it is investigating the allegations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor continues to be a major problem. The Department
 of Manpower acknowledges that there is a class of children
 under age 14 who, for socioeconomic reasons, must work and
 notes that the child labor laws have not been fully enforced.
 These laws provide detailed safeguards, including requirements
 for parental consent, prohibition of dangerous work and night
 work, and a limit of the workday to 4 hours. Employers must
 cooperate with public authorities to ensure that children
 under 14 comply with the 1989 national education law, which
 requires that children complete 9 years of schooling beginning
 at age 7.
 Employers are required to report in detail on every child
 employed, and the Department of Manpower carries out periodic
 inspections. Employers not complying with the law and
 regulations are subject to fines of $65 and/or up to 3 months
 in jail for each infraction, but the Government still relies
 on persuasion and teaching employers rather-than penalizing
 them. The Department of Manpower continues to admit that
 employer compliance with the regulations is inadequate (less
 than 50 percent of companies employing children have
 registered), and that it still lacks enough qualified
 inspectors to carry out inspections. Observers claim that as
 many as 2 million children under the age of 14 are working
 half to full time, mostly in family-run businesses in the
 informal sector and at agricultural sites, where enforcement
 is difficult. Efforts to control child labor focus primarily
 on instituting educational programs for working children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The law establishes 7-hour workdays and 40-hour workweeks,
 with one-half hour of rest for each 4 hours of work. The
 daily overtime rate is one and one-half times the normal
 hourly rate for the first hour, and twice the hourly rate for
 additional overtime. Regulations allow employers to deviate
 from the normal work hours upon request to the Minister of
 Manpower with the agreement of the employees.
 In the absence of a national minimum wage, minimum wages are
 established by regional wage councils working under the
 supervision of the National Wage Council. This is a
 quadripartite body consisting of representatives from labor,
 management, government, and universities. It also establishes
 a basic-needs figure for each province--a monetary amount
 considered sufficient to enable A single worker or family to
 meet the basic needs of nutrition, clothing, and shelter. The
 
 
 909
 INDONESIA
 minimum wage rates constantly lag far behind the basic-needs
 figures and fall short of providing a decent standard of
 living. The minimum wage in the capital city of Jakarta is
 $1.13 per day. Labor law and ministerial regulations provide
 workers with a variety of other benefits such as social
 security, and workers in more modern facilities often receive
 health benefits and free meals.
 Observance of minimum wage and other laws regulating benefits
 and labor standards varies from sector to sector and from
 region.to region. Employer violations of these guarantees are
 considered to be fairly common and often the subject of
 strikes and employee protests. Government supervision and
 enforgement have been weak or nonexistent. In May 1989, the
 Manpower Minister issued regulations giving Department.
 officials a legal basis to carry out periodic inspections and
 providing for fines or imprisonment for employers who do not
 comply. In March 199a, spurred on by an Asian-American Free
 Labor Institute/SPSI minimum wage compliance project, which
 showed that 50 to 70percent of employers in three targeted
 areas in Jakarta were paying less than the minimum wages, the
 Manpower Minister-began to prosecute employers for violating
 minimum wage regulations. The President of the Social
 Insurance Program (ASTEK) followed suit and began prosecuting
 employers who had not enrolled their employees in ASTEK as
 required by law. The actual number prosecuted for minimum
 wage violations was about 30.
 Bothlaw and regulations provide for minimum standards of
 industrial health and safety. In the more profitable and
 largely Western-operated oil sector, safety and health -
 programs function reasonably well. However, safety and health
 programs in the country's over 100,000 larger, registered
 companies in the nonoil sector are still hampered by the
 limited number of qualified inspectors from the Department of
 Manpower--less than 1,300; the slowness with which the firms
 establish the Zequired plant-safety committees; the need for
 more and better training of government inspectors and
 plant-safety personnel; .and the lack of employee appreciation
 for sound health and safety practices. A National Health and
 Safety Council, an advisory body established under the
 Department of Manpower, was created to oversee the enforcement
 efforts of over 6,000 company safety committees.
 Workers are obligated to report hazardous working conditions,
 and employers are prevented by law from retaliating against
 those who do. An ILO-sponsored program to enhance the
 technical capabilities of government inspectors and plant
 personnel in the area of chemical and major hazards control
 was signed in 1988, and the Government has sought additional
 technical assistance from other countries to increase
 inspection capabilities.
