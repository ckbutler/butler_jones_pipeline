 AUSTRALIA
 Australia and the United States share a similar outlook
 on human rights. Australian society adheres firmly
 to its democratic traditions. Common law and the
 Australian Constitution guarantee all basic rights
 to the citizenry.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is neither condoned nor practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The law prohibits such punishment and is respected in
 practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The law prohibits such action and is respected in
 practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The law guarantees the right to a fair hearing and a
 fair public trial and is respected in practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Effective legal safeguards prevent arbitrary invasion
 of the home.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Australia's pioneering social welfare system provides
 for basic food, shelter, health care and social
 security for the entire population. Social security

 and welfare accounts for the largest single part of
 the Australian Government's budget expenditures,
 27.8 percent. Public education is universal and
 free.
 Aboriginal rights and development are of constant
 and active concern in Australia. Because of cultural
 differences between the aboriginal and European
 populations, there have been difficulties in inte-
 grating the former into the mainstream of Australian
 society. The Government acknowledges that the abori-
 ginal population is generally disadvantaged in such
 fields as employment, housing and health. Through
 the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and other agencies
 on the federal and state levels, efforts have been
 made to rectify the situation by programs of assistance
 in areas such as housing, the purchase of land, the
 promotion of small business and specialized training.
 An elected National Aboriginal Consultative Committee
 involves aborigines in policy-making. The Government
 is helping the aborigines to become economically self-
 sufficient while preserving their distinctive culture.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The law guarantees all of the basic freedoms, which
 are respected in practice. Public demonstrations
 are fully acceptable forms of political activity.
 The trade union movement has no restraints placed upon
 it. The Royal Commission on Human Relationships reported
 in mid-1978 on the issue of discrimination against
 women, migrants and other groups, and the Government
 is currently studying appropriate measures for imple-
 mentation of the Commission's recommendations. With
 respect to the status of women, particularly within
 government, a Women's Unit exists on the federal level
 aimed at combatting discrimination against women.
 Similar efforts are being made by state governments.
 
 
 In instances of discrimination against persons of
 aboriginal descent, the Government of Australia acts
 quickly and effectively to assure that they receive
 the full and equal protection of the law. The Racial
 Discrimination Act of 1975 made discrimination on the
 basis of race unlawful. In recent years, discrimina-
 tory provisions contained in federal and state
 legislation have accordingly been removed.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within or out-
 side the country including emigration. Race is
 barred as a criterion for approval or rejection of
 an application to immigrate to Australia. On a per
 capita basis, Australia's acceptance of Indochinese
 refugees is the highest of any country in the world.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Australian law guarantees this freedom, which is
 respected in practice.
 4. Government Attitude. and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Department of State knows of no requests to make
 such investigations.
