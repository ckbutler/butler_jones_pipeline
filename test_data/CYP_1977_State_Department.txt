 CYPRUS
 Perhaps more so than elsewhere, human rights questions
 in Cyprus cannot be treated in isolation from political
 considerations. As a consequence of past intercommunal-
 troubles and the events of 1974, they constitute an
 integral element of the Cyprus problem and will no
 doubt figure largely in any settlement ultimately
 reached between the two Cypriot communities.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no indications that torture is currently per-
 mitted or practiced by the Government of Cyprus, the
 Turkish-Cypriot administration, or Turkish forces in
 northern Cyprus.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been no recent instances of large-scale or
 politically-inspired cruel or inhuman treatment of persons
 on Cyprus. It is generally accepted, however, that vio-
 lations of human rights in the form of cruel and inhuman
 treatment of civilians and prisoners were committed in
 the course of the Greek-led coup against President Makarios
 in July 1974 and during the subsequent Turkish military
 intervention. These were less a reflection of deliberate
 governmental policy than a consequence of the scale and
 intensity of the fighting and of the longstanding antago-
 nisms within and between the two communities on the island.
 Turkish-Cypriot enclaves not occupied by Turkish troops
 were reportedly attacked by Greek-Cypriot forces; sub-
 sequently mass graves of executed Turkish-Cypriot
 villagers were discovered.
 For their part the Greek-Cypriots have charged that the
 Turkish troops who intervened in 1974 engaged in massive
 and systematic murder, rape, and inhuman treatment of
 prisoners. As a consequence of the world-wide attention
 that these charges attracted, and in response to a Greek-
 Cypriot petition, the Council of Europe instructed its
 Commission on Human Rights to undertake an investigation
 of Turkish actions in 1974. The Commission's report,
 completed early in 1977, found Turkey responsible for
 six violations of the European Convention on Human Rights.'

 The Turks subsequently submitted a lengthy rebuttal that
 claimed that Greek-Cypriots violated Turkish-Cypriot rights
 on a massive scale during the 1963-64 period. The Council
 of Europe has declined to endorse the Commission's findings
 against Turkey, simply noting in a recent statement that
 violations of human rights did occur in Cyprus in 1974.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest or detention is not currently being prac-
 ticed in Cyprus. Charges that these practices occurred
 were frequently leveled by both Greek and Turkish-Cypriots
 during the 1974 crisis and its immediate aftermath.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The authorities in Cyprus respect the right to a fair
 public trial.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Many thousands of Cypriots--both Greek and Turkish--were
 displaced from their homes during the 1974 fighting.
 Over the next two years practically all Turkish-Cypriots
 remaining in the south moved, whether v6luntarily or in-
 voluntarily, to the north. Similarly, in the course of
 1975 and 1976 all but a few thousand of the Greek-Cypriots
 remaining in Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus moved to
 the Greek-administered south. According to the Greek-
 Cypriots, many of these persons were evicted from their
 homes as a deliberate act of policy; according to the
 Turkish-Cypriots, they moved southward voluntarily and
 subsequently claimed they were forced out in order to
 qualify for refugee benefits. The report of the Euro-
 pean Commission on Human Rights supports the former view.
 If there was in fact a deliberate eviction policy, it
 appears now to have been dropped. U.N. representatives
 have verified that those Greek-Cypriots who moved from
 the north to the Greek-controlled sector in the course
 of 1977 clearly did so of their own accord.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Government of Cyprus has responded promptly and effec-
 tively to the plight of the many thousands displaced as
 
 
 287
 a consequence of the 1974 crisis. Housing, employment,
 education and health programs have been designed and
 implemented--funded in large part by outside (principally
 U.S.) sources. The Turkish-Cypriots were confronted with
 substantially less pressing refugee problems after 1974,
 but they have likewise been attentive to resettlement
 needs (benefiting also from U.S. assistance).
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, SpeechPress, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of the press and of assembly exists in both
 sectors of Cyprus. Minority groups, e.g.-Greek-Cypriots
 in the north and Maronites in the south, practice their
 religions without hindrance.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Turkish. and Greek-Cypriots enjoy normal freedom of move-
 ment within their respective sectors. The Turkish-
 Cypriot authorities continue to impose certain restric-
 tions on the movement of Greek-Cypriots residing in the
 north. Movement between the two sectors is permitted
 only under exceptional circumstances.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Government of Cyprus is organized under the 1960 con-
 stitution in accordance with Western representative
 models. Suffrage is universal. Labor unions are free
 of governmental control. The Turkish-Cypriot regime in
 the north is democratically elected and controlled.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Turkish-Cypriot administration has consistently re-
 fused to permit international bodies--including the ICRC
 and the European Commission on Human Rights-to conduct
 on-the-spot investigations into cases of persons reported
 missing and unaccounted for since the events of 1974.
 Other investigatory bodies, however, have been allowed
 to work in northern Cyprus without hindrance, and U.N.
 officials are at present free to pursue humanitarian
 activities there on behalf of the remaining Greek-Cypriot
 residents.
