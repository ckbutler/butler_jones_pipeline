 BELIZE
 Belize is a parliamentary democracy with a constitution enacted in 1981 upon
 independence from the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister, a cabinet of ministers,
 and a legislative assembly govern the country. The Governor General represents
 Queen Elizabeth II in the largely ceremonial role of head of state. Both local and
 national elections are scheduled on a constitutionally prescribed basis. The Con-
 stitution provides for an independent judiciary.
 The Police Department has primary responsibility for law enforcement and main-
 tenance of order. The Belize Defense Force (BDF) is responsible for external secu-
 rity, but when deemed ap.ropriate by civilian authorities may be tasked to assist
 the police department. Both the police and the BDF report to the Minister of Na-

 tional Security and are responsible to and controlled by civilian authorities. There
 were occasional reports of abuse by the police.
 The economy is primarily agricultural, although tourism has become the principal
 source of foreign exchange earnings. The agricultural sector is heavily dependent on
 preferential access to export markets for sugar and for bananas. The Government
 favors free enterprise and generally encourages investment, although domestic in-
 vestors are given preferential treatment over foreign investors in a number of key
 economic sectors. Preliminary estimates put 1996 gross domestic product growth at
 4.5 percent in real terms. Annual per capita income was about $2,359.
 The Constitution provides for, and citizens enjoy in practice, a wide range of fun-
 damental rights and freedoms. Principal human rights abuses include occasional use
 of excessive force by the police when making arrests, lengthy pretrial detention, po-
 litical influence on the judiciary, discrimination and domestic violence against
 women, and employer mistreatment of immigrant workers in the banana industry.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Idling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids torture or other inhuman punishment. There were several
 credible reports of mistreatment and abuse by the police. In at least two cases, po-
 lice authorities took internal disciplinary measures against officers accused of abuse,
 although the authorities did not lodge criminal charges. The Police Department, the
 Police Complaints Board, and on occasion special independent commissions ap-
 pointed by the Prime Minister investigate allegations of official abuse.
 The Hattieville prison opened in 1993 and replaced the notoriously decrepit Belize
 City prison. Although designed to house 500 inmates, it actually held 960, or about
 5 prisoners per 10-by-12-foot cell. There are rare reports of human rights abuses at
 the prison, in the form of physical brutality by prison wardens. The press also car-
 ried credible reports that prisoners were used as a labor force to build homes for
 family members of the minister with oversight responsibility for the prison.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest or detention, and the Government generally observes these prohibitions. The
 law requires the police to inform a detainee of the cause of detention within 48
 hours of arrest and to bring the person before a court within 72 hours. In practice,
 the authorities normally inform detainees immediately of the charges against them.
 Bail is granted in all but the most serious cases. In cases involving narcotics, the
 police cannot grant bail, but a Magistrate's court may do so after a full hearing.
 Many detainees cannot afford bail, however, and backlogs in the judicial system
 often cause considerable delays and postponements of hearings, resulting in an over-
 crowded prison and prolonged incarceration before trial.
 The Constitution forbids exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. The judici-
 ary consists of the magistrate's courts, the Supreme Court, and the Court of Appeal.
 Notwithstanding constitutional provisions, the fact that prominent government
 leaders continue to practice law while in office brought the judiciary's independence
 into question. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court publicly stated that judges
 should not interpret laws in such a way as to frustrate the intention of the legisla-
 ture, saying that this practice is an abuse of the power of the courts. The appear-
 ance of judicial independence from the executive branch is also compromised be-
 cause judges and the director of public prosecutions must negotiate renewal of their
 employment contracts with the Government and thus may be vulnerable to political
 interference.
 An inordinate number of significant narcotics-related cases are taking years to re-
 solve. In these cases, defendants are released on minimal bail payments, and the
 defense lawyers and their fi-ms are closely connected to sitting ministers of govern-
 ment, including the Attorney General.
 Persons accused of civil or criminal offenses have constitutional rights to pre-
 sumption of innocence, protection against self-incrimination, defense by counsel, a
 public trial, and appeal. Trial by jury is mandatory in capital cases. The Supreme
 Court and magistrate courts suffer backlogs aggravated by the inability to maintain
 a full complement of judges.
 
 
 354
 Those convicted by either a magistrate's court or the Supreme Court may appeal
 to the Court of Appeal. In some cases, including those resulting in a capital sen-
 tence, the convicted party may make a final appeal to the Privy Council in the Unit-
 ed Kingdom. The Privy Council has agreed to hear several such appeals in 1996;
 this delayed carrying out the capital sentences.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to legal sanctions. However, there were
 several cases in which the Government has expropriated private land. The law re-
 quires that the Government assess and pay compensation in these instances, but
 these cases take many years to settle.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, but also permits the authorities to make "reasonable provisions"
 in the interests of defense, public safety, public order, public morality, or public
 health. These provisions include forbidding any citizen to question the validity of
 the financial disclosure statements submitted by public officials. Anyone who ques-
 tions these statements orally or in writing outside of a rigidly prescribed procedure
 is subject to a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to 3 years, or both.
 A wide range of viewpoints is publicly presented without government interference
 in six privately owned weekly newspapers (there is no daily press), half of which
 are directly subsidized by major political parties. All newspapers are subject to the
 constraints of libel laws.
 Since the first privately owned commercial radio station began broadcasting in
 1990, other stations have been established, broadening the audience's choices. Popu-
 lar radio call-in programs are lively and feature open criticism of and comments on
 government and political matters. Through financial subsidies, the Government con-
 tinues to exert substantial editorial influence over the nominally autonomous Broad-
 casting Corporation of Belize (BCB) and its two radio stations; BCB once held a mo-
 nopoly on radio in the country. The Government utilizes BCB studios and facilities
 to produce partisan advertisements and party propaganda.
 There are eight privately owned television broadcasting stations, including several
 cable networks in Belize City and the major towns. The Government's Belize Infor-
 mation Service and two independent television stations produce local news and fea-
 ture programs. The Belize Broadcasting Authority (BBA) regulates broadcasting and
 asserts its right to preview certain broadcasts, such as those with political content,
 and to delete any defamatory or personally libelous material from political broad-
 casts. As far as is known, the BBA did not exercise this authority during 1996 al-
 though there appeared to be ample opportunity to do so during the aggressive and
 negative media campaigns each party waged during local elections held earlier in
 the year.
 The Belize Press Association, formed in 1995 to seek common ground among the
 disparate members of the press, continued this effort in the face of strong internal
 partisan debate. One of the association's main goals is to obtain increased access
 to government information, utilizing the countifs Freedom of Information Act. In
 September the Prime Minister challenged the media to exercise this right, noting
 that only one case had been filed in the 3 years since the law had been passed.
 Frustrating the media's attempts to use the Freedom of Information Act are state-
 ments by the Supreme Court warning journalists that questioning the integrity of
 the court or its members could result in criminal contempt of court charges.
 The law provides for academic freedom, and the Government respects it in prac-
 tice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and the authorities honor it in practice. Political parties and
 other groups with political objectives freely hold rallies and mass meetings. The or-
 ganizers of public meetings must obtain a permit 36 hours in advance of the meet-
 ings; such permits are not denied for political reasons and are routinely granted in
 practice.
 The Constitution permits citizens to form and join associations of their choice,
 both political and nonpolitical.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 
 
 The Government generally Cooperates with the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. The UNHCR provides the majority of funding for refugee programs in the
 country, including the salaries of most of the employees in the Government's De-
 partment of Refugees. A government committee to review applications for ayslum
 meets weekly and includes a UNHCR representative as a m  ber. The Government
 turned down approximately 500 requests for asylum in 1996. The Government hon-
 ors the principle of first asylum, and most recently provided it to four persons in
 1995.
 In the wake of the civil conflicts in Central America during the 1980's, over
 40,000 mostly Hispanic immigrants came to Belize, many of them entering illegally
 and living in the country without documentation. The Government has granted asy-
 lum and allowed local resettlement of about 8,000 refugees. Despite the signing of
 the Peace Treaty ending Guatemala's civil war, the Government does not plan to
 send Guatemalan refugees back until it deems the situation in that country to be
 conducive to such return.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights:- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Belize is a democracy governed by a Legislative Assembly, with executive direc-
 tion from a cabinet of ministers headed by Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel. The
 law requires national elections at least every 5 years.
 All elections are by secret ballot, and suffrage is universal for citizens 18 years
 and older. National political parties include the People's United Party (PUP), the
 United Democratic Party (UDP), the National Alliance for Belizean Rights (NABR)
 and the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The nation's ethnic diversity is reflected
 in each party's membership. The Government changed hands (for the third time
 since independence in 1981) in 1993 when a coalition of the UDP and the NABR
 won 16 of 29 seats in the House of Representatives.
 No laws impede participation of women in politics; their scarcity in electoral poli-
 tics can be attributed to tradition and socioeconomic factors. Women hold a number
 of appointive offices, including three of nine Senate seats. One member of the 29-
 seat House of Representatives is a woman, but women in elective office are the ex-
 ception. None hold senior positions higher than membership on the executive com-
 mittees of the political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their activities. The Human Rights Com-
 mission of Belize (HOEB), a nongovernmental organization (NGO) affiliated with re-
 gional human rights organizations and partly funded by the UNHCR, operates free
 of government restriction on a wide range of issues, including refugee and agricul-
 tural workers' rights, cases of alleged police abuse, and cases of alleged illegal de
 prtations of Central American nationals. The HCRB publicizes, and urges po ie
 and other government bodies to act upon complaints it receives. However, the HCRB
 appears to have been largely inactive in 1996, reportedly due to financial difficul-
 ties.
 Local and international human rights groups operate freely, and the Government
 cooperates with independent investigations of human rights conditions. However,
 when native Belizean Maya organizations voiced concern over what they considered
 an environmentally questionable and socially disruptive highway improvement
 project in the Toledo district, the Government dismissed their arguments and re-
 portedly accused the leaders of bing foreign immigrants.
 Section 5. Discriminatin oBased upon Race, Sex Religion, Disability, Language, or
 Social Status
 Belize is a multiracial, multiethnic country, and the Government actively pro-
 motes tolerance and cross-cultural understanding. Discrimination on ethnic or reli-
 gious grounds is illegal and not common, although ethnic tension, particularly re-
 sentment of recently arrived Central American and Asian immigrants, continued to
 be a problem. The Government continues to reserve certain professions for Belizean
 nationals, granting permits and licenses to non-Belizeans only in specific cases.
 These occupations include fishing, souvenir manufacturing, sightseeing tours, ac-
 counting, insurance, real estate, and legal services.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women is a chronic problem. Women Against
 Violence, an NGO with branches throughout the country, runs a shelter for battered
 women and a hot line for rape victims.
 
 
 356
 Despite constitutional provisions for equality, women face social and economic
 e          For example, women find it more difficult than men to obtain business
 and agricultural financin aand other resources. Most employed women are con-
 centrated in female-dominated occupations with traditionally low status and wages.
 A women's bureau in the Ministry of Labor and Social Services is charged with de-
 velopig programs to improve the status of women. A number of officially registered
 women a groups work closely with various government ministries in promoting so-
 cial awareness progsins    omen have access to education and are active in all
 spheres of national life, but relatively few are found in top managerial psitions.
 While the law mandates that women receive equal pay for equal work, female wage
 earners often earn less than men in similar jo1s. There are no legal impediments
 to women owning or managing land or other r  property.
 Chi/dren.-Education is compulsory for children ages 5 to 14. There is a family
 services division in the Ministry of Human Resources devoted primarily to childrena
 issues. The division coordinates programs for children who are victims of domestic
 violence, advocates remedies in specific cases before the family court, conducts pub-
 lic education campaigns, and works with NGO's and the United Nations Children's
 Fund to promote children's welfare. There is also a national committee for families
 and children, chaired by the Minister of Human Resources. There is no societal pat-
 tern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate specifically the prvision of
 accessibility for disabled persons nor prhibit job discrimination against them. The
 Government's Disability Services Unit, as well as a number of NwO's such as the
 Belize Association of and for Persons with Disabilities and the Belize Center for the
 Visually Impaired provide assistance to physically disabled persons. Disabled chil-
 dren have access to government special education facilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association-By statute and in practice, workers are free to estab-
 lish and join trade unions. Eleven independent unions, with apprximately 11 per-
 cent of the labor force, represent a cross-section of white-collar, blue-collar, and pro-
 fessional workers, including most civil service employees. Several of these unions,
 however, were inactive. The Ministry of Labor recognizes unions after they file with
 the office of registry. The law empowers members to draft the by-laws and constitu-
 tions of their unions, and they are free to elect officers from among the membership
 at large. Unions that choose not to hold elections may act as representatives for
 their membership, but the national Trade Union Congress permits only unions that
 hold free and annual elections of officers to join its ranks. Both law and precedent
 effectively protect unions against dissolution or suspension by administrative au-
 thority
 The law permits unions to strike, but unions representing essential services may
 strike only after giving 21 days' notice to the ministry concerned.
 Although no unions are officially affiliated with political parties, several are sym-
 pathetic to one or the other of the two main parties (the UDP and the PUP). Unions
 freely exercise the right to form federations and confederations and affiliate with
 inter   onationl organizations.
 b. The Right to Organe and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining and unions freely practice it throughout the country. Employers and
 unions set wages in free negotiations, or, more commonly, employers simply estab-
 ish them. The Labor Commissioner acts as a conciliator in deadlocked collective
 bargaining negotiations between labor and management, offering nonbinding coun-
 sel to both sides. Historically, the Commissioner's guidance has been voluntarily ac-
 cepted. However, should either union or management choose not to accept the Com-
 missioner's decision, bth are entitled to a legal hearing of the case, provided that
 it is linked to some prvision of civil or criminal law.
 The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimination both before and after a union
 is registered. Unions may freely organize, but the law does not require employers
 to recognize a union as a bargaining agent. Some employers have been known to
 block union organization by terminating the employment of key union sympathizers,
 usually on goundso purportedly unrelated to union activities. Effective redress is ex-
 tremely difficult in such situations. Technically, a worker may fe a complaint with
 the Lar Department, but in practice it was virtually impossible to prove that a
 termination was due to union activity. The United Banners Banana Workers Union
 is seeking to organize the mainly foreign laborers in the banana industry and in
 the process is testing the Government's commitment to a number of these legal pro-
 visions. The Government has refused to recognize the union until the union submits
 its membership list for inspection. The uleon's members have expressed concern
 over possible government reprisals.
 
 
 357
 The Labor Code applies in the country's two export processing zones (EPZ's).
 There are no unions in the EPZ's, however, reflecting the general weakness of orga-
 nized labor in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids forced
 labor, and it is not generally known to occur. However, prisoners were reportedly
 used to build homes for relatives of senior officials (see Section 1.c.).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 14 years, or 17 years for employment near hazardous machinery. Inspectors from
 the Ministries of Labor and Education enforce this regulation, although in recent
 years school truancy officers, who have historically borne the brunt of the enforce-
 ment burden, have been less active. The law requires children between the ages of
 5 and 14 to attend school, but there are many truants and dropouts.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is $1.12 (BZ$2.25), except
 in export industries where it is $1.00 (BZ$2.00) per hour. For domestic workers and
 shop assistants in stores where liquor is not consumed, the rate is $0.87 (BZ$1.75)
 The minimum wage law   ono cover workers paid on a piecework basis.
 Ministry of Labor is carged with enforcing the legal minimum wage, which
 is *enerally respected in practice. The minimum wage as a sole source of income
 is inadequate to provide a deent standard of iving for a worker and family. Most
 salaried workers receive more than the minimum wage.
 The law sets the normal workweek at no more than 6 days or 45 hours. It re-
 quires payment for overtime work and an annual paid vacation of 2 weeks. A patch-
 work of health and safety regulations covers numerous industries, and the Min-
 istries of Labor and Public Health enforce these regulations to varying degrees. En-
 forcement is not universal, and the ministries commit their limited inspection and
 investigative resources principally to urban and more accessible rural areas where
 labor, health, and safety complaints have been registered. Workers have the legal
 right to remove themselves from a dangerous workplace situation without jeopardy
 to continued employment.
 The exploitation of undocumented Hispanic workers, particularly young service
 workers and workers in the banana industry, continues to be a major issue for the
 Government, the HCRB, and other concerned citizens. Undocumented immigrants
 working in the Stann Creek area banana industry have cited for years poor working
 and living conditions and routine nonpayment of wages. However, little progress has
 been made in resolving or preventing these systemic problems.
