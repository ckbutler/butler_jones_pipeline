 UAN*
 The Islamic Republic of Iran was established in 1979 after a populist revolution
 toppled the Pahlavi monarchy. The Government is dominated by Shi'a Muslim cler-
 gy. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution and
 functions as the Chief of State and the Commander in Chief of the armed forces.
 Seyed Mohammad Khatami was elected to a 4-year term as President in a popular
 vote in February 1997. A popularly-elected 270-seat unicameral Islamic Consult-
 ative Assembly, or Majles, develops and passes legislation. All legislation passed by
 the Majles is reviewed for adherence to Islamic and constitutional principles by a
 Council of Guardians, which consists of six clerical members, who are appointed by
 the Supreme Leader, and six lay jurists, who are appointed by the head of the judi-
 ciary and approved by the Majiles. Candidates for most elective offices are screened
 carefully for their ideological beliefs by the regime. The Government seeks to con-
 form public policy to its political and socio-religious values, in particular the tenets
 of Shi'a Islam, but there are serious factional differences within the leadership. The
 judiciary is subject to government and religious influence.
 Several agencies share responsibility for internal security, including the Ministry
 of Intelligence and Security, the Ministry'of Interior, and the Revolutionary Guards,
 a military force established after the revolution. Paramilitary volunteer forces
 known as Basijis, and gangs of street thugs, known as the Ansar-e Hezbollah (Help-
 ers of the Party of God), who often are often aligned with specific members of the
 clergy, act as vigilantes. -Both regular and paramilitary security forces committed
 numerous, serious human rights abuses.
 Iran has a mixed economy. The Government owns the petroleum, banking, insur-
 ance, power, and most large-scale manufacturing industries, and controls access to
 foreign exchange. Large charitable foundations called bonyads, most with strong
 connections to the Government, control properties and businesses that were expro-
 priated from the former Shah and figures associated with his regime. The bonyads
 exercise considerable influence in the economy, but do not account publicly for reve-
 nue and-pay no taxes. Basic foodstuffs and energy costs are subsidized heavily by
 the Government. Oil exports account for nearly 80 percent of foreign exchange earn-
 ings. Economic performance is affected adversely by government mismanagement
 and corruption, and was made worse during the year by the low price of oil. Unem-
 ployment in 1998 was estimated to be at least 25 percent, and inflation was an esti-
 mated 25 percent.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor; despite some improve-
 ments in a few areas, serious problems remain. The Government restricts citizens'
 right to change their government. Systematic abuses included extrajudicial killings
 and summary executions; disappearances; widespread use of torture and other de-
 grading treatment; harsh prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of
 due process; unfair trials; infringement on citizens' privacy; and restrictions on free-
 dom of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement. The Govern-
 ment manipulates the electoral system and represses political dissidents. Increased
 debate in the country over President Khatami's expression of interest in promoting
 greater attention to the rule of law and the development of civil society led to fac-
 tional struggle and occasionally to violent tactics by hard-line elements opposed to
 change. A trend toward greater freedom of expression and thought was reversed late
 in the year through arbitrary arrests, the closure of reform-oriented publications,
 and the murders of several dissident writers. Religious minorities, in particular Ba-
 ha'is, came under increasing repression by conservative elements of the judiciary
 and security establishment. The Government restricts the work of human rights
 groups. Women face legal and social discrimination, and violence against women oc-
 curs. The Government discriminates against religious and ethnic minorities and re-
 stricts important workers' rights. Vigilante groups enforce their interpretation of ap-
 propriate social behavior through intimidation and violence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-U.N. representatives, including the
 U.N. Special Representative on Human Rights in Iran, Maurice Copithorne, and
 independent human rights organizations continue to note the absence of procedural
 safeguards in criminal trials. Inhuman punishments are used in some cases, includ-
 *The United States does not have an embassy in Iran. This report draws heavily on non-U.S.
 Government sources.

 ing stoning (see Section 1.c.). In 1992 the domestic press stopped reporting most
 executions; however, executions appear to continue in substantial numbers. The
 U.N. Special Representative reported an estimated 199 executions in 1997, many of
 those attributable to drug convictions. Human Rights Watch reported "hundreds" of
 executions during the year after trials that failed to comply with minimum inter-
 national standards.
 Ruhollah Rouhani, a Baha'i, was executed in July after having served 9 months
 in solitary confinement on a charge of apostasy stemming from allegedly having con-
 verted a Muslim woman to the Baha'i faith. The woman maintained that her mother
 was a Baha'i and that she herself had been raised a Bahai. Rouhani was not ac-
 corded a public trial or sentencing for his alleged crime, and no sentence was an-
 nounced prior to his execution. Two other Baha'is, Sirus Zabihi-Moghaddam and
 Hadayat Kashefi-Najafabadi, were tried alongside Rouhani and later sentenced to
 death by a revolutionary court in Mashad for practicing their Baha'i faith. Their
 sentences were under appeal before the Supreme Court of Iran at year's end. Six
 Baha'is are on death row. Baha'is face severe repression, and are particularly vul-
 nerable during times of social and political unrest (see Section 2.c.).
 Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported the death in May of Ruhollah Kakhodah-
 Zadeh, a businessman and an active member of Tehran's small Jewish community.
 Kakhodah-Zadeh was hanged in prison without benefit of public charge or legal pro-
 ceeding, although there were reports that he was ordered executed for helping Jews
 leave Iran. HRW also reported the killing of Sunni prayer leader Molavi Imam
 Bakhsh Narouie in the province of Sistan and Baluchistan in southeast Iran, which
 led to protests from members of the local Sunni community who believed that gov-
 ernment authorities were involved in the murder (see Section 2.c.).
 Prominent opposition figure Dariush Foruhar and his wife were stabbed to death
 at their residence in November in a manner that led many human rights observers
 to believe that the couple was murdered for their political beliefs. The Forouhars
 were under continual monitoring by state security officials. Dariush Forouhar had
 been active in Iran's prerevolutionary National Front Movement, and had served as
 labor minister in an early postrevolution government. However, since that time he
 had spoken out frequently against the abuse of power of the revolutionary govern-
 ment, in particular with respect to human rights abuses. Supreme Leader
 Khamanei, President Khatami, and other senior officials condemned the murders.
 Several other prominent and active political dissidents also were killed late in the
 year. In November the body of writer and translator Majid Sharif, whose published
 political views included advocacy for the separation of state and religion, was discov-
 ered in a Tehran morgue several days after his mysterious disappearance. In De-
 cember the body of Mohammad Mokhtari, a prominent poet and literary critic, also
 was discovered at a Tehran morgue after he disappeared 6 days earlier. Parviz
 Davani, a publisher and dissident critic of the Government, disappeared in August.
 Amnesty International (AI) received unconfirmed reports that Davani's mother was
 contacted by unnamed persons who told her that her son was killed. Mohammad
 Jafar Pouyandeh, a dissident writer and advocate against censorship, also dis-
 appeared in December and later was found dead. Sharif, Mokhtari, and Pouyandeh
 were among 134 signatories of the 1994 Declaration of Iranian Writers; several sig-
 natories have been targets of regime harassment and violence since the release of
 the Declaration (see Section 2.a.). The Government investigation of these murders
 continued at year's end.
 Exiles and human rights monitors allege that many of those executed for criminal
 offenses, primarily narcotics charges, are actually political dissidents. A November
 1995 law criminalized dissent and applied the death penalty to offenses such as "at-
 tempts against the security of the State, outrage against high-ranking Iranian offi-
 cials, and insults against the memory of Imam Khomeini and against the Leader
 of the Islamic Republic." President Khatami advocated allowing criticism of the Gov-
 ernment on several occasions throughout the year, but offered no official protection
 to critics. In June the daily newspaper Hamshahri reported the public hanging of
 four men in Ahvaz, in southern Iran, for "insulting" Supreme Leader Khamenei, and
 "armed robbery."
 -Investigations of the killing of political dissidents abroad continued during the
 year. The Istanbul Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of an Iranian national for
 complicity in the 1996 murder of Zahra Rajabi and Ali Moradi, who were both asso-
 ciated with the National Council of Resistance (NCR), an exile group that has
 claimed responsibility for several terrorist attacks within Iran. The U.N. Special
 Representative reported that Italian security authorities continued their investiga-
 tion into the 1993 killing in Rome of Mohammad Hossein Naghdi, the NCR's rep-
 resentative in Italy.
 
 
 1662
 The Government announced in September that it would take no action to threaten
 the life of British author Salman Rushdie, or anyone associated with his work, 'The
 Satanic Verses." The announcement came during discussions with the United King-
 dom regarding the restoration of full diplomatic relations. Several revolutionary
 foundations and a number of Majles deputies within Iran repudiated the Govern-
 ment's pledge and emphasized the "irrevocability" of the fatwa, or religious ruling,
 calling For Rushdie's murder by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989. The 15 Khordad Foun-
 dation raised the bounty it earlier had established for the murder of Rushdie.
 b. Disappearance.-No reliable information is available on the number of dis-
 appearances. In the period immediately following arrest, many detainees are held
 incommunicado and denied access to lawyers and family members.
 A Christian group reported that between 15 and 22 Iranian Christians dis-
 appeared during 1997 and the first half of 1998. Those who disappeared reportedly
 were Muslim converts whose baptisms had been discovered by the authorities.
 There was an increase in the disappearances of prominent writers and dissident
 figures during the latter part of the year, many of whom were found dead (see Sec-
 tion l.a.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There are numerous, credible reports that security forces continue to torture detain-
 ees and prisoners. Cormon methods include suspension for long periods in con-
 torted positions, burning with cigarettes, and, most frequently, severe and repeated
 beatings with cables or other instruments on the back and on the soles of the feet.
 -Prisoners also have reported beatings about the ears, inducing partial or complete
 deafness.
 Stoning and flogging are expressly prescribed by the Islamic Penal Code as appro-
 priate punishment for adultery. Article 102 of the Code states, "the stoning of an
 adulterer or adulteress shall be carried out while each is placed in a hole and cov-
 ered with soil, he up to his waist and she up to a line above her breasts." Zoleykhah
 Kadkhoda, who had been arrested on charges of adultery and stoned to near death
 in August 1997, reportedly was released in November 1997 after widespread inter-
 national criticism of the punishment.
 Faraj Sarkuhi, a magazine editor critical of the government who disalipeared in
 1996, later reappeared and was convicted in 1997 of "spreading antigovernment
 propaganda" and sentenced to a year in jail. He was released in January. In April
 Sarkuhi was allowed to visit his family in Germany. Sarkuhi used this opportunity
 to describe the torture he had suffered while in detention, including repeated beat-
 ings about the head and to the feet with a wire cable. Sarkuhi spent more than 9
 months in solitary confinement and was forced to admit to false charges that he was
 a spy of Germany and France. On one occasion, Sarkubi reported, his torturers tied
 a rope around his neck to feign impending execution.
 In the course of a wide-ranging Tehran municipality corruption case, which con-
 cluded in the indictment and trial of former Tehran Mayor Hossein Gholam
 Kharbaschi (see Section i.e.), several defendants accused police and prison officials
 of using torture to coerce admissions of guilt and statements implicating the Mayor.
 These confessions allegedly were coerced at so-called "special detention centers" af-
 filiated with, but outside the official prison system. Several of those-tortured report-
 edly brought cases against the police for improper interrogation methods, and the
 U.N Special Representative reported that 152 Majles deputies sent a letter to Su-
 preme Leader Khamanei requesting a high-level inquiry into the charges, although
 no subsequent action apparently was taken in response. The secretary general of the
 Islamic Human Rights Commssion, a government-affiliated body, cited the special
 detention centers in remarks critical of police tactics in the municipality case.
 Prison conditions are harsh. Some prisoners are held in solitary confinement or
 denied adequate food or medical care in order to force confessions. Female prisoners
 reportedly have been raped or otherwise tortured while in detention. In the past,
 prison guards have intimidated the family members of detainees and tortured de-
 tainees in the presence of family members.
 The Government does not permit visits to imprisoned dissidents by human rights
 monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention; however, these practices remain common. There is reportedly no
 legal time limit on incommunicado detention, nor any judicial means to determine
 the legality of detention. Suspects may be held for questioning in jails or in local
 Revolutionary Guard offices. Although reliable statistics are not available, inter-
 national observers believe that between scores and hundreds of citizens are impris-
 oned for their political beliefs.
 The security forces often do not inform family membersof a prisoner's welfare and
 location. Even if these circumstances are known, the prisoner still may be denied
 
 
 1663
 visits by family and legal counsel. In addition, families of executed prisoners do not
 always receive notification of the prisoner's death. Those who do receive such infor-
 mation may be forced to pay the Government to retrieve the body of their relative.
 At least 26 editors and writers either were detained, jailed, fined, or prohibited
 from publishing their writings during the year (see Section 2.a.).
 Adherents of the Baha'i faith continue to face arbitrary arrest and detention. The
 Government appears to adhere to a practice of keeping a small number of Baha'is
 in detention at any given time. According to the U.N. Special Representative and
 Baha'i groups, at least 14 Baha'is are in prisons, including 6 men, convicted of ei-
 ther apostasy or "actions against God" and sentenced to death. Thirty-six Baha'is
 associated with the Baha'i Institute of Higher Learning were detained arbitrarily
 in a September government raid on offices and residences associated with the Insti-
 tute (see Section 2,c.). Four of those arrested remained in custody at year's end.
 The Government enforced house arrest and other measures to restrict the move-
 ments and ability to communicate of several senior religious leaders whose views
 on political and governance issues are at variance with the ruling orthodoxy. The
 clerics include Ayatollah Hassan Tabataei-Qomi, under house arrest for more than
 13 years; Ayatollah Mohammad Sadeq Rowhani, under house arrest for more than
 12 years; and Ayatolah Yasub al-Din Rastgari, under house arrest since late 1996.
 Ayatollah Hossein Au Montazeri, the former designated successor of Iran's late Spir-
 itual Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, and an outspoken critic of Iran's current leader,
 remains under house arrest and heightened police surveillance (see Section 2.a.).
 Dissident clerics' foliowers reportedly have been detained and tortured by govern-
 ment authorities.
 Human Rights Watch reported that in April, about 40 bazaar shopkeepers and
 teachers were detained for leading protests against the restricti   on Ayatollah
 Montazeri in his home town of Najafabad. Montazeri's son-in-law, Hadi Hashemi,
 was detained in May and held incommunicado. Mohammad Movahedi Savoji, the
 son of a Member of Parliament, also was arrested in May and sentenced to 20
 months' imprisonment in September for speaking out against the harsh treatment
 of Ayatoliah Montazeri.
 In September 1994, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) issued
 a report on "unresolved humanitarian issues" from the Iran-Iraq war. The ICRC
 noted that the Iranian Government failed to identify combatants killed in action and
 failed to exchange information on those killed or missing. The report criticized the
 Government for obstructing ICRC efforts to register and repatriate prisoners of war
 (POW's).
 Iran agreed to the release of 5,584 Iraqi POW's in April, and news organizations
 reported intermittent meetings throughout the remainder of the year between Ira-
 nian and Iraqi government officials toward reaching a final agreement on the re-
 maining POW's held by each side. An Iranian government official was quoted in the
 press as pledging to settle the remaining POW issues with Iraq by March 1999. A
 June press report also described joint Iran-Iraq search operations to identify re-
 mains of those missing in action.
 The Government does not use forced exile, but many dissidents leave the country
 because they feel threatened.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system is not independent and is sub-
 ject to government and religious influence.
 There are two primary court systems: Traditional courts, which adjudicate civil
 and criminal offenses; and Islamic Revolutionary Courts, which were established in
 1979 to try offenses including those against internal or external security, narcotics
 crimes, and official corruption. A special clerical court also exists to examine alleged
 transgressions within the clerical establishment. The Supreme Court has limited
 authority to review cases.
 Many aspects of the prerevolutionary judicial system survive in the civil and
 criminal courts. For example, defendants have the right to a public trial, may choose
 their own lawyer, and have the right of appeal. Trials are adjudicated by panels of
 judges. There is no jury system. If a situation is not addressed by statutes enacted
 after the 1979 revolution, the Government advises judges to give precedence to their
 own knowledge and interpretation of Islamic law rather than rely on statutes en-
 acted during the Shah's regime.
 Trials in the Revolutionary Courts are -notorious for their disregard of inter-
 national standards of fairness. A law authorizes Revolutionary Court judges to act
 as prosecutor and judge in the same case, and judges are appointed for their ideo-
 logical beliefs. Often, pretrial detention is prolonged and defendants lack access to
 attorneys. Indictments are often for undefined ofeases such as "antirevolutionary
 behavior," "moral corruption," and "siding with global arrogance." Defendants do not
 have the right to confront their accusers. Secret or summary trials of 5 minutes are
 
 
 1664
 not unknown. Others are show trials intended to highlight a coerced public confes-
 sion. In 1992 the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights concluded that "the chronic
 abuses associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Courts are so numerous and so
 entrenched as to be beyond reform." The, Government has undertaken no major re-
 form of the Revolutionary Court system since that report.
 Much attention was focused on the fairness of the court system during the high
 profile trial in June of-the former Mayor of Tehran, Gholam Hossein Kharbaschi,
 on corruption charges. Kharbaschi criticized the proceedings as unfair, in particular
 the conflict of interest on the part of the judge, who also served as prosecutor. Testi-
 mony offered in support of the charges against Kharbaschi reportedly was coerced
 from detained municipality officials under harsh treatment (see Section 1.c.).
 It is difficult for many women, particularly those residing outside large cities, to
 obtain any legal redress. A woman's testimony is worth only half that of a man's,
 making it difficult for a woman to prove a case against a male defendant. In addi-
 tion, the families of female victims of violent crime reportedly must pay the assail-
 ant's court costs.
 The Government frequently charges members of religious minorities with crimes
 such as "confronting the regime" and apostasy, and conducts trials in these cases
 in the same manner as is reserved for threats to national security. Ayatollah Mo-
 hammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary, stated'in 1996 that Baha'ism was an espi-
 onage organization. In October a Revolutionary Court in Mashad sentenced to death
 Sirus Zabihi-Moghaddam and Hedayat Kashefi-Nejafabadi, two Baha'is arrested in
 October 1997, in a secret trial on a finding of "waging war against God." A third
 defendant in the same trial, Ataollah Hamid-Sasirizadeh, was given a 10-year sen-
 tence. Among the charges against the defendants Were "activism in the administra-
 tion of the Baha'i faith; misleading Muslims; and espionage on behalf of foreign
 powers." The defendants were denied the right to choose their own counsel, or to
 consult family or coreligionists during their extended pretrial detention period.
 Independent legal scholar and member of the Islamic clergy Hojatoleslam Sayyid
 Mohsen Saidzadeh was detained in June for his outspoken criticism of the treat-
 ment of women under the law (see Section 5). While detained prior to his appear-
 ance before the special clerical court convened to hear his case, Saeidzadeh was de-
 nied access to his lawyer, and was prevented from receiving visits from his wife and
 other family members. Saeidzadeh reportedly was found guilty of the charges
 against him, freed from detention, and barred from clerical activities for 5 years.
 Human Rights groups-outside Iran noted reports that Saeidzadeh's sentence also in-
 cluded a prohibition on publishing. He had ceased authoring a monthly column on
 legal issues since the time of his detention.
 In September authorities rearrested former deputy prime minister and longtime
 political dissident Abbas Amir-Entezam for comments he made questioning the le-
 gitimacy of the extended power invested in the office of Iran's Supreme Leader, and
 for criticizing the torture of prisoners (see Section 2.a.).
 No estimates are available on the number of political prisoners. However, the
 Government often arrests persons on questionable criminal charges, usually drug
 trafficking or espionage, when their actual "offenses" are political.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution states that "reputation, life, property, (and) dwelling(s)" are protected
 from trespass except as "provided by law;" however, the Government infringes on
 these rights. Security forces enter homes and offices, monitor telephone conversa-
 tions, and open mail without court authorization.
 The Basijis, other security forces, and the Ansar-e Hezbollah monitor the social
 activities of citizens. Such organizations harass, beat, or arrest women whose cloth-
 ing does not cover the hair and all of the body except the hands and face, or those
 who wear makeup. Vigilante violence may include attacking young persons believed
 to be too foreign in their dress or activities, invading private homes, and abusing
 unmarried couples. Authorities occasionally enter homes to remove television sat-
 ellite dishes, or to disrupt private gatherings where unmarried men and women so-
 cialize, or where alcohol, music, or other forbidden activities are offered or take
 place. Enforcement appears to be very arbitrary, varying widely with the political
 climate and the individuals involved. There are penalties for those who do not follow
 the Islamic dress code at work (see Sections 5 and 6.a.).
 A well-coordinated and nationwide government raid of more than 500 homes and
 offices owned or occupied by Baha'is suspected to have connections to the Baha'i In-
 stitute of Higher Learning took place in September, during which instructional ma-
 terials, office equipment, and other items of personal property were confiscated (see
 Section 2.c.). The effort apparently was designed to disrupt the operation of the In-
 stitute, which serves as the only alternative source of higher education for most Ba-
 ha'is, who are- denied entry to the state-controlled university system.
 
 
 1665
 In the past, prison guards have intimidated family members of detainees (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). Iranian opposition figures living abroad have reported harassment of their
 relatives in Iran.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press, except when published ideas are "contrary to Islamic principles, or are det-
 rimental to public rights;" however, in practice the Government restricts freedom of
 speech and of the press. The Government exerts strong control over most media,
 particularly publications, by, among other methods, controlling access to newsprint
 and to foreign exchange to purchase newsprint. The Government directly controls
 television and radio broadcasting networks.
 Newspapers represent a wide variety of political and social perspectives, some al-
 lied with particular figures within the Government. Many subjects of discussion are
 tolerated, including criticism of certain government policies. However, generally pro-
 hibited materials include faultfinding comment on the personality and achievements
 of the late leader of the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini; direct criticism of the Su-
 preme Leader;, assailing the principle of velayat-e faqih, or rule by a supreme reli-
 gious leader;, and promotion of the rights or autonomy of ethnic minorities.
 Complaints against journalists, editors, and publishers frequently are levied by
 public officials and even rival publications. The practice of complaining against the
 writings of journalists crosses ideological lines. Offending writers are subject to
 trial, with fines, suspension from journalistic actiyities, lashings, and imprisonment
 all common punishments on findings of guilt for offenses ranging from "fabrication7
 to "propaganda against the State" to "insulting the leadership of the Islamic Repub-
 lic.?
 Police frequently raid newspaper offices, and Ansar-e Hezbollah mobs continue to
 attack the offices of liberal publications and bookstores without interference from
 the police or prosecution by the courts.
 The record on freedom of expression was mixed during the year. The Government
 took steps to encourage an environment of greater tolerance in the early part of the
 year. This included easing issuance of licenses for new publications, a policy that
 sparked a large increase in reported circulation of print media. President Khatami
 and others in the Government made statements indicating that criticism and debate
 were healthy for society, which encouraged publishers and journalists to test the
 bounds of expression. The ensuing public debate on a wide variety of topics quickly
 raised the level of concern among antireform elements, which saw the increased
 openness as an invitation for "disunity" and chaos in the society. Supreme Com-
 mander of the Revolutionary Guards Rahim Safavi, a vehement critic of the new
 openness, told a gathering of the Guards' officers in April that "we have to cut the
 throats of some and cut out the tongues of others," in referring to "liberals" in the
 society. Safavi's remarks formed part of a backlash against the limited reform meas-
 ures undertaken by the Government. The judiciary took the lead in this effort, clos-
 ing several publications and jailing writers and editors for overstepping the bounds
 of allowable expression, including Jameah, the newspaper that had printed Safavi's
 leaked remarks. In November judiciary head Mohammad Yazdi said that freedom
 of the press "should not undermine Islamic fundamentals," and that whoever criti-
 cizes the civil and criminal laws "oversteps the limits of liberty, since this legislation
 is inspired by Islamic sacred law."
 At least 12 publications were banned or suspended during the year. In addition,
 at least 26 editors and writers either were detained, jailed, fined, or prohibited from
 publishing because of what they wrote. Following the closing of Jameah, its writers
 and editors began work on another reform-oriented publication, Tous, which also
 came under the attack of anti-reform elements. Tous was closed in September, and
 its editor and publisher were jailed for about a month. Authorities revoked the li-
 cense of the weekly magazine Khaneh after it reportedly printed a letter from a
 reader harshly critical of the policies of former Supreme Leader Khomeini. During
 the trial of the mayor of Tehran, the offices of the publications Hamshahri, Iran,
 and the Iran Daily News were raided by police. Each of those publications had been
 supportive of the mayor in his trial on corruption charges.
 The Government monitors carefully the statements and views of Iran's senior reli-
 gious leaders to prevent disruptive dissent within the clerical ranks. In November
 1997, Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, a cleric formerly designated as the successor
 to Iran's late Spiritual Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, called into question the author-
 ity of the current Supreme Leader, Ali Khamanei, criticizing his increasing inter-
 vention in government policy. The comments sparked attacks by Ansar-e Hezbollah
 mobs on Montazeri's residence and a Koranic school in Qom run by Montazeri.
 These events prompted Ebrahim Yazdi, the leader of the Iran Freedom Movement,
 
 
 1666
 and 54 others, to issue an open letter calling on the Government to respect
 Montazeri's rights. Yazdi reportedly was detained later for 11 days for his role in
 this protest.
 Independent legal scholar and Islamic cleric Hojatoleslam Sayyid Mohsen
 Saidzadeh was detained in June because of his criticism of the treatment of women
 under the law (see Sections I.e. and 5).
 In September authorities rearrested former deputy prime minister and long-time
 political dissident Abbas Amir-Entezam for comments he made questioning the le-
 gitimacy of the extended political power invested in the office of the Supreme Reli-
 gious Leader, and for criticizing torture and mistreatment of prisoners. Amir-
 Entezam's comments came in the wake of the killing of the former head of Iran's
 prison authority, Assadullah Lajeverdi. He had been criticized by Lajeverdi family
 members and officials associated with the Bureau of Prisons. Amir-Entezam's attor-
 ney said that he had been charged with "making false accusations" and "insult."
 Anir-Entezam has spent 17 years in jail under the Islamic Republic for alleged espi-
 onage. Human Rights groups have protested the fact that he was never given a
 proper trial.
 Further violence and harassment was directed against signatories of the 1994
 Declaration of Iranian Writers, which declared a collective intent to work for the
 removal of barriers to freedom of thought and expression. The association of inter-
 national writers, PEN, reported in October the questioning by a Revolutionary
 Court of signatories Mohammad- Pouyandeh, Mohammad Mokhtari, Houshang
 Golshiri, Kazem Kardevani, and Mansour Koushan in connection with their at-
 tempts to convene a meeting of the Iran Writer's Association. Mokhtari and
 Pouyandeh later disappeared under suspicious circumstances, and both were found
 dead. Signatory Mansour Koushan reportedly fled to Norway during the year, while
 another signatory, Faraj Sarkuhi, was allowed to leave for Germany, where he pro-
 vided reports of the mistreatment he had received while in jails in 1997 and 1998
 (see Section 1.c.).
 The Government owns all television and radio broadcasting facilities; program-
 ming reflects the Government's political and socio-religious ideology.
 The Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance is charged with screening books
 prior to publication to ensure that they do not contain offensive material. However,
 some books and pamphlets critical of the Government are published without re-
 prisal. The Ministry inspects foreign printed materials prior to their release on the
 market.
 The Government effectively censors Iranian-made films, since it is the main
 source of funding for Iranian film producers, who must submit scripts and film pro-
 posals to government officials in advance of funding approval.
 President Khatami announced in September that the Government would take no
 action to threaten the life of British author Salman Rushdie, or anyone associated
 with his work, "The Satanic Verses" (see Section l.a.). However, his remarks were
 repudiated by other parties, including the 15 Khordad Foundation, which claims to
 have financed a bounty for the murder of Rushdie.
 Academic censorship persists., In his 1996 interim report, the U.N. Special Rep-
 resentative noted the existence of a campaign to bring about the "Islamization of
 the universities," which seemed to be a movement to purge persons "who fight
 against the sanctities of the Islamic system." Government informers who monitor
 classroom material are said to be common on university campuses. Admission to
 universities is politicized; all applicants must pass "character tests" in which offi-
 cials screen out applicants critical of the Government's ideology. To achieve tenure,
 professors must cooperate with government authorities over a period of years.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution permits as-
 semblies and marches "provided they do not violate the principles of Islam;" how-
 ever, in practice the Government restricts freedom of assembly and closely monitors
 gatherings to ensure that they do not constitute uncontrolled anti-government pro-
 test. This includes funeral processions and Friday prayer gatherings. Many in-
 stances were reported during the year of Ansar-e Hezbollah disruptions of gather-
 ings of university students and other groups. Police and military forces often do not
 intervene in these cases. In one such incident in September, Ansar-e Hezbollah
 thugs attacked Vice President Abdollah Nuri and Culture Minister Attaollah
 Mohajerani, who are both closely associated with President Khatami's reform pro-
 gram, during a Friday prayer gathering in Tehran. Authorities sought to break up
 spontaneous celebrations that followed Iran's qualification for the World Cup soccer
 finals because the celebrations featured male-female commingling and flaunting of
 the Islamic dress code by women.
 The Government limits the freedom of association. The Constitution provides for
 the establishment of political parties, professional associations, and religious groups
 
 
 1667
 provided that they do not violate the principles of "freedom, sovereignty, and na-
 tional unity," or question Islam or the Islamic Republic. Several new political par-
 ties were established and registered with the Government during the year. How-
 ever, several other applications were rejected.
 The U.N. Special Representative noted in his October report that elections for the
 leadership of the Iran Bar Association took place in December 1997, with candidates
 required by the government to meet certain qualifications. The Bar Association was
 reported in August to have sent a letter to the Minister of Justice detailing its rec-
 ommendations for improvement of the court system.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government restricts freedom of religion. The 1979
 revolution resulted in the creation of an Islamic Republic, the central feature- of
 which is rule by a "religious jurisconsult." Its senior leadership, including the Spir-
 itual Leader of the Revolution, the President, the head of the judiciary, and the
 Speaker of the Majles, is composed principally of Shi'a clergymen. The Constitution
 declares that the "official religion of Iran is Islam and the sect followed is Ja'fari
 Shi'ism." It also states that "other Islamic denominations shall enjoy complete re-
 spect," and recognizes Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians as "protected religious mi-
 norities." Religions not specifically protected under the Constitution do not enjoy
 freedom of activity. This most directly affects the nearly 350,000 followers of the
 Baha'i faith, who effectively enjoy no legal rights in the society. In addition, the
 Government is hi liy suspicious of the proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims
 and may be harsh in meting out its response, in particular against Baha'is and
 evangelical Christians.
 Approximately 90 percent of the population are Shi'a Muslims. Aside from slightly
 over 1 percent who are not Muslims, the rest of the population are Sunni Muslims,
 drawn largely from Kurdish, Arab, Turkoman, Baluchi, and other ethnic minorities.
 Human Rights Watch reported the killing of Sunni prayer leader Molavi Imam
 Bakhsh Narouie in the province of Sistan and Baluchistan in southeast Iran, lead-
 ing to protests by members of the local community who believed that authorities
 were involved in the murder.
 Majdhub Alishahi, an adherent of the Sufi tradition, reportedly was executed on
 charges of adultery and homosexuality after a coerced confession in 1996. Sufi orga-
 nizations outside Iran reported an increasing level of repression by the authorities
 of Sufi religious practices.
 Religious activity is closely monitored by the Ministry of Islamic Culture and
 Guidance; non-Muslim religious activities often require the approval of or licensing
 by the Ministry. Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians legally are permitted to practice
 their religion and instruct their children, but may not proselytize Muslims. The
 Government interferes with the administration of their schools, and harassment by
 government officials is common (see Section 5).
 Oppression of evangelical Christians continued during the year. Christian groups
 reported instances of government harassment of churchgoers in Tehran, in particu-
 lar against worshipers at the Assembly of God congregation in Tehran. Instances
 of harassment cited included conspicuous monitoring by authorities outside Chris-
 tian premises to discourage Muslims or converts from entering, and entry to the
 church premises by armed Revolutionary Guards who subsequently demanded iden-
 tity papers of worshipers inside. Christian church leaders are also subject to pres-
 sure from government authorities to sign pledges that they would not evangelize
 Muslims or allow Muslims to attend church services. Iranian Christians Inter-
 national (ICI) detailed the cases of Alireza and Mahboobeh Mahmoudian, converts
 to Christianity and lay leaders of the Saint Simon the Zealot Osgofi Church in
 Shiraz, who were forced to leave Iran permanently in June after continued harass-
 ment by government authorities. The ICI reported that Alireza Mahmouian had
 lost his job because of his conversion and had been repeatedly beaten by Basiji and
 Ansar-e Hizbollah thugs on orders from Ministry of Islamic Guidance officials. His
 wife, Mahboobeh, also had been the subject of intimidation, principally through fre-
 quent and aggressive interrogation by government officials.
 Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported the death in May of Jewish businessman
 Ruhollah Kakhodah-Zadeh, who was hanged in prison without a public charge or
 legal proceeding (see Section l.a.). While Jews are a recognized religious minority
 in Iran, allegations of official discrimination are frequent. Jewish leaders in Iran re-
 portedly are reluctant to draw attention to official mistreatment of their community
 due to fear of government reprisal.
 The year was particularly difficult year the Baha'i community. The Government
 regards the Baha'i community of 300,000 to 350,000 members, whose faith origi-
 nally derives from a strand of Islam, as a "misguided" or "wayward" sect. The Spe-
 cial Representative noted in his September report that pressures on Baha'is from
 the judiciary apparently increased during the year. The execution of Ruhollah
 
 
 1668
 Rouhani and the death sentences confirmed against two other Bahai's in Mashad
 (see Section L.a.), along with the arbitrary roundup of students and faculty associ-
 ated with the Baha'i Institute of Higher Learning, marked a renewed level of perse-
 cution and state-directed intimidation of a community that is always at risk, but
 particularly so during times of political ferment.
 Baha'is may not teach or practice their faith or maintain links with coreligionists
 abroad. The fact that the Baha'i world headquarters (established by the founder of
 the Baha'i faith in the 19th century in what was then Ottoman-controlled Palestine)
 is situated in what is now the state of Israel exposes Iranian Baha'is to government
 charges of "espionage on behalf of Zionism," in particular when caught communicat-
 ing with or addressing contributions to Baha'i administrative headquarters.
 Broad restrictions on Baha'is appear to be geared to destroyingtem as a commu-
 nity (see Section 5). Baha'i marriages are not recognized by the Government, leaving
 Baha'i women open to charges of prostitution. Children of Baha'i marriages are not
 recognized as legitimate and, therefore, are denied inheritance rights. Sacred and
 historical Baha'i properties have been confiscated systematically. Baha'is are not al-
 lowed to bury and honor their dead in keeping with their religious tradition, while
 historic Baha'i gravesites have been confiscated, and in many cases desecrated or
 destroyed. In October three Bahai's were arrested in Damavand, a city north of
 Tehran, on the grounds that they had buried their dead without government author-
 ization.
 Group meetings and religious education, which often take place in private homes
 and offices, are curtailed severely. Public and private universities continue to deny
 admittance to Baha'i students, a particularly demoralizing blow to a community
 that traditionally has placed a high value on education. Denial of access to higher
 education appears aimed at the eventual impoverishment of the Baha'i community.
 In September authorities launched a nationwide operation to disrupt the activities
 of the Baha'i Institute of Higher Learning, also known as the "Open University,"
 established by the Baha'i community shortly after the revolution to offer higher edu-
 cational opportunities to Baha'i students who had been denied access to high schools
 and- universities. The Institute employed Baha'i faculty and professors, many of
 whom had been dismissed from teaching positions by the Government as a result
 of their Baha'i faith, and conducted classes in homes or offices owned or rented by
 Baha'is. In the assault, which took place in at least 14 different cities, 36 faculty
 members were arrested, and a variety of personal property, including books, papers,
 and furniture, were either destroyed or confiscated. Government interrogators
 sought to force the detained faculty members to sign statements acknowledging that
 the Open University was now defunct and pledgin not to collaborate with it in the
 future. Baha'is outside Iran report that none of the 36 would sign the document.
 Four of those arrested in September remained in custody at year's end.
 The Government appears to adhere to a practice of keeping a small number of
 Baha'is in arbitrary detention, some at risk of execution, at any given time (see also
 Section 1.d.). There were 14 Baha'is reported to be under arrest for practice of their
 faith at year's end, 6 under sentence of death (see Section l.a.). Baha'is regularly
 are denied compensation- for injury or criminal victimization. Government authori-
 ties claim that only Muslim plaintiffs are eligible for compensation in these cir-
 cumstances. Baha'is are prohibited from government employment. A 1993 law pro-
 hibits government workers from membership in groups that deny the "divine reli-
 gions," terminology the Government uses to label members of the Baha'i faith. The
 law also stipulates penalties for government workers who do not observe "Islamic
 principles and rules.'
 The Government restricts the movement of several senior religious leaders, some
 of whom have been under house arrest for years (see Sections 1.d. and 2.d.), and
 often charges members of religious minorities with crimes such as drug offenses,
 "confronting the regime," and apostasy (see Section I.e.).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government places some restrictions on these rights. Citizens may
 travel to any part of the country, although there have been restrictions on travel
 to Kurdish areas during times of occasional heavy fighting. Citizens may change
 their place of residence without obtaining official permission. The Government re-
 quires exit permits (a validation stamp placed in the traveler's passport) for draft-
 age males and citizens who are politically suspect. Some citizens, particularly those
 whose skills are in short supply and who were educated at government expense,
 must post bonds to obtain exit permits. The Government restricts the movement of
 several religious leaders (see Sections 1.d. and 2.c.).
 Citizens returning from abroad are sometimes subject to search and extensive
 questioning by government authorities for evidence of antiregime activities abroad.
 Cassette tapes, printed material, and personal correspondence and photographs are
 
 
 1669
 subject to confiscation. Such actions reportedly increased late in the year as authori-
 ties noted the increased activity of dissident groups outside the country.
 The Government permits Jews to travel abroad, but often denies them the mul-
 tiple-exit permits normally issued to other citizens. The Government normally does
 not permit all members of a Jewish family to travel abroad at the same time. Ba-
 ha'is often experience difficulty getting passports. Iranian women must obtain the
 permission of their husband, father, or other living male relative in order to obtain
 a passport for travel abroad.
 The law contains provisions for granting refugee status in accordance with the
 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and-its 1967 Protocol- The
 Government generally cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Although the
 Government generally provides first asylum, pressure was applied on some refugees
 to force them to return to their home countries.
 The country hosts a very large refugee population. The Government and the
 UNHCR estimate that there are approximately 1.4 million Afghan refugees in the
 country. Of this total, about 21,200 are accommodated in refugee camps adminis-
 tered by the Government. The rest subsist on itinerant labor, often moving from
 place to place within the country. As of September, the UNHCR estimated that
 1,525 Afghans refugees were repatriated to Afghanistan during the year, continuing
 the low trend of recent years. There were reports in December that the Government
 forcibly repatriated Afghan refugees, although the lack of a UNHCR presence in Af-
 ghanistan due to continued instability in that country made these reports difficult
 to verify.
 The UNHCR estimates that there are about 580,000 Iraqi Kurdish and Arab refu-
 gees in Iran, and reported 9,232 returnees to Iraq during the year, through Septem-
 ber.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change their government is severely compromised. The Su-
 preme Leader, the recognized Head of State, is selected for a life term by the popu-
 larly-elected Assembly of Experts. The Assembly itself is restricted to clerics. The
 Government effectively manipulates the electoral system to its advantage. There is
 no separation of state and religion, and clerics dominate the Government. The Gov-
 ernment represses any movement seeking to separate state and religion, or to alter
 the State's existing theocratic foundation. The selection of candidates for elections
 is effectively controlled by the ruling clerics.
 The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed of six Islamic cler-
 gymen and six lay members who review all laws for consistency with Islamic law
 and the Constitution. The Council also screens political candidates for ideological,
 political, and religious suitability. It accepts only candidates who support a theo-
 cratic state; clerics who disagree with government policies also have been disquali-
 fied.
 Regularly scheduled elections are held for the President, members of the Majles,
 and members of the Assembly of Experts, a body responsible for selecting the suc-
 cessor to the Supreme Leader.
 Seyed Mohammad Khatami was elected President in May 1997. The Interior Min-
 istry estimated that over 90 percent of the eligible population voted in the presi-
 dential election. During the campaign, there was considerable government interven-
 tion and censorship. The Council of Guardians reviewed 238 candidates, including
 a woman, but only allowed 4 individuals to run. Three were clerics; all were men.
 Khatami garnered nearly 70 percent of the vote, his greatest support coming from
 the middle class, youth, minorities, and women.
 The election results were particularly notable because Khatami was not the re-
 gime's preferred candidate. In a break with precedent, Supreme Leader Khamenei
 let it be known that he preferred Majles Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri. Prayer
 leaders also supported Nateq-Nuri in their sermons. The regime attempted to censor
 ublic debate by restricting the campaign coverage of some technocratic and modern
 eft publications, particularly the pro-Khatami daily, Salam. As the election neared,
 Khatami was evicted from his campaign headquarters. Despite the regime's clear
 preference for Nateq-Nuri, the election results were not disputed, and the regime
 does not appear to have engaged in election fraud-possibly due to Khatami's early
 and overwhelming lead. The results appear to indicate that citizens demanded
 change within the limits allowed by government control of the electoral process.
 The Government in 1997 nullified election results from the spring 1996 Majles
 elections in several districts, including Malayer, Astara, and Esfahan.
 
 
 1670
 
 Elections were held in the fall for the 86-member Assembly of Experts. The Coun-
 cil of Guardians disqualified numerous candidates, leading to criticism from many
 observers that the Government improperly pre-determined the election results.
 Preparations were begun late in the year for the election of local councils through-
 out the country, the first such elections since the 1979 revolution. Vigorous par-
 liamentary debates take place' on various issues. Most deputies are associated with
 powerful political and religious officials, but often vote independently and shift from
 one faction to another.
 Women are underrepresented in government. They hold only 13 of 270 Majles
 seats, and there are no female cabinet members. In 1997 President Khatami ap-
 pointed the first female vice president (for environmental protection) since the 1979
 Islamic Revolution, Masoumeh Ebtekar, following his in inauguration. Minister of
 Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani appointed a second woman to
 a senior post, Azam Nouri, when he chose her in 1997 as his deputy. A woman was
 also appointed as a district mayor of Tehran. President Khatami also appointed a
 woman to serve as Presidential Adviser for Women's Affairs. A small number of
 women serve in the judiciary as advisers but not fully enabled judges; their author-
 ity is limited principally to family law cases.
 Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians elect deputies to specially reserved Majles
 seats. However, the U.N. Special Representative noted in his September report fre-
 quent assertions that religious minorities are, by law and practice, barred from
 being elected to a representative body (except to the seats in the Majles reserved
 for minorities), and from holding senior government or military positions. Religious
 minorities are allowed to vote, but they may not run for president.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government continued to restrict the work of local human rights grouns. The
 Government denies the universality of human rights and has stated tat uman
 rights issues should be viewed in the context of a country's "culture and beliefs."
 International human rights NGO's, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
 International, are not allowed to establish offices or conduct regular investigative
 visits to Iran.
 The ICRC and the UNHCR both operate in the country. However, the Govern-
 ment did not allow U.N. Special Representative for Human Rights in Iran, Maurice
 Copithorne, to visit the country during the year,-and complained that his annual
 report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission was biased and reflected "an absence
 of accurate understanding of Islamic norms." Copithorne-was last allowed entry to
 Iran to gather information for his yearly report in 1996. In his September report,
 he noted his concern about the infrequency of even written communication from the
 Government in response to his inquiries regarding specific cases. U.N. High Com-
 missioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson visited Iran in February to inaugurate
 a conference on Asian human rights issues. She reportedly had received assurances
 from the Government that Special Representative Copithorne would be allowed to
 visit later in the year; but this never occurred.
 The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) was established in 1995 under
 the authority of the Head of the Judiciary, who sits on its Board as an observer.
 In 1996 the Government established a human rights committee in the Majles. Most
 observers believe these bodies lack independence. The U.N. Special Representative
 cited press reports that the IHRC fielded 2,450 complaints from March 1997
 through March 1998, half from women and 50 percent against the police. The Sec-
 retary General of the IHRC, Mohammad Ziaei-Far, reportedly complained about the
 use by police of "special detention centers" to conduct coercive interrogations of de-
 tainees (see Section 1.c.) and acknowledged widespread human rights violations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 In general the Government does not discriminate on the basis of race, disability,
 language, or social status. The Government does discriminate on the basis of reli-
 gion and sex.
 Women.-Although domestic violence is known to occur, little is known about its
 extent. Abuse in the family is considered a private matter and is seldom discussed
 publicly. There are no official statistics on the subject.
 Women have access to primary and advanced education, but social and legal con-
 straints tend to inhibit their professional opportunities. The state enforces gender
 segregation in most public spaces. While the enforcement of conservative Islamic
 dress codes has varied with the political climate since the death of Ayatollah Kho-
 meini in 1989, the fact remains that what women wear in public is not entirely a
 
 
 1671
 matter of personal choice. Women are subject to harassment by the authorities if
 their dress or behavior is considered inappropiate, and may be sentenced to flog-
 ging or imprisonment for such violations. In April a girl detained by authorities on
 suspicion of having an inappropriate relationship with a man reportedly committed
 suicide in detention. The Majles passed a law in April restricting the publication
 of pictures of women in the Iranian print media, including pictures of foreign
 women, unless fully covered as prescribed by the Islamic dress code. There are pen-
 alties for failure to observe Islamic dress codes at work (see Section 6.a.).
 Discrimination against women is reinforced by law through provisions of the Is-
 lamic Civil and Penal Codes, in particular those sections dealing with family and
 property law. The Majies ap proved a bill in April mandating segregation of the
 sexes in the provision of medical care. The bill provided for women to be treated
 only by female physicians and men by male physicians and raised questions about
 the quality of care that women could receive under such a regime, considering the
 current imbalance between the number of trained and licensed male and female
 physicians and specialists. Upon first review, the Council of Guardians rejected the
 w pending an amendment to assure funding, but approved it in a subsequent re-
 view in November.
 The minimum legal age of marriage for women is 9, although marriage at that
 age is rare. All women, no matter the age, must have the permission of the father
 or a living male relative in order to get married. The law allows for the practice
 of Siqeh, or temporary marriage, a Shi'a custom in which a woman or a girl can
 become the wife of a married or single Muslim male after a simple and brief reli-
 gio s ceremony. The Siqeh maage can last for a night or as little as 30 minutes.
 on is not record  on identfcation documents, and according to Islamic law,
 men may have as many Siqeh wives as they wish, although these wives are not
 granted rights associated with traditional marriage.
 The Penal Code inciudes provisions that mandate the stoning of women and men
 convicted of adultery (see Section l.c.). Under legislation passed in 1983, women
 have the right to divorce, and regulations promulgated in 1984 substantially broad-
 ened the grounds on which a woman may seek a divorce. However, a husband is
 not required to cite a reason for divorcing his wife. In 1986 the Government issued
 a 12-point "contract" to serve as a model for marriage and divorce that limits the
 privileges accorded to men by custom and traditional interpretations of Islamic law.
 The model contract also recognized a divorced woman's right to a share in the prop-
 erty that couples acquire during their marriage, and to increased alimony rights. in
 November the Majles passed a law granting custody of minor children to the mother
 in certain divorce cases when the father was proven unfit to care for the child.
 Women who remarry are forced to give up to their father custody of children from
 earlier marriages. Muslim women may not marry non-Muslim men. The testimony
 of a woman is worth only half that of a man's in court (see Section i.e.).
 Children.-Most children have access to education through the 12th grade, and
 to some form of health care. There is no known pattern of child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no available information regarding whether
 the Government has legislated or otherwise mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 However, the Cable News Network (CNN) reported in 1996 on the harsh conditions
 in an institution for retarded children who had been abandoned by their parents.
 Film clips showed children tied or chained to their beds, in filthy conditions, and
 without appropriate care. It is not known to what extent this represents the typical
 treatment of the disabled in Iran.
 Religious Minorities.-The Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Baha'i minorities
 suffer varying degrees of officially sanctioned discrimination, particularly in the
 areas of employment, education, and public accommodations (see Section 2.d.). For
 example, members of religions minorities are barred from becoming school prin-
 cipals. Muslims who convert to Christianity also suffer discrimination. Apostasy, or
 conversion from Islam to another religion, may be punishable by death.
 University applicants are required to pass an         in Islamic theology. Al-
 though public-school students receive instruction in Islam, this requirement limits
 the access of most religious minorities to higher education. Applicants for public-sec-
 tor employment are screened in similar fashion for their adherence to Islam.
 Religious minorities suffer discrimination in the legal system, receiving lower
 awards in injury and death lawsuits, and incurring heavier punishments than Mus-
 lims. Sunni Muslims encounter religious discrimination at the local level, and re-
 ports of discrination against practitioners of the Sufi tradition surfaced during
 year. Muslim men are free to marry non-Muslim women, but marriages between
 Muslim women and non-Muslim men are not recognized.
 In 1993 the U.N. Special Representative reported the existence of a government
 policy directive on the Baha'is. According to the directive, the Supreme Revolution-
 
 
 1672
 
 ary Council instructed government agencies to block the progress and development
 of the Baha'i community, expel Baha'i students from universities, cut the Baha'is'
 links with groups outside Iran, restrict the employment of Baha'is, and deny Baha'is
 "positions of influence," including those in education. The Government claims that
 the directive is a forgery. However, it appears to be an accurate reflection of current
 government practice.
 Property belonging to the Baha'i community as a whole, such as places of worship,
 remains confiscated. Baha'i graveyards have been confiscated and defiled. Other
 government restrictions have been eased; Baha'is currently may obtain food ration
 booklets and send their children to public schools. However, the prohibition against
 the admission of Baha'is to-universities remains. Thousands of Baha'is who were
 dismissed from government jobs in the early 1980's receive no unemployment bene-
 fits and have been required to repay the Government for salaries or pensions re-
 ceived from the first day of employment. Those unable to do so face prison sentences
 (see Sections 1.d. and 2.c.).
 National/RacialIEthnic Minorities.-The Kurds seek greater autonomy from the
 central Government and continue to suffer from government discrimination. The
 Kurds' status as Sunni Muslims serves as an aggravating factor in their relations
 with the Shi'a-dominated government. Kurds often are suspected of harboring sepa-
 ratist or foreign sympathies by government authorities. Human Rights Watch re-
 ported in September 1997 that in the wake of the Gulf War and the creation of an
 autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Iraq, Iranian authorities increased their mili-
 tary presence in Kurdish areas of Iran, which often led to human rights abuses
 against Kurds. Abuses included destruction of villages, forced migrations, and wide-
 spread mining of Kurdish property.
 Azeris are well integrated into the Government and society, but complain of eth-
 nic and linguistic discrimination. The Government traditionally has viewed Azeri
 nationalism as threatening.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Labor Code grants workers the right
 to establish unions, there are no independent unions. A national organization known
 as the Worker's House, founded in 1982, is the sole authorized national labor orga-
 nization. It serves primarily as a conduit for the Government to exert control over
 workers. The leadership of the Worker's House coordinates activities with Islamic
 labor councils, which are organized in many enterprises. These councils also func-
 tion as instruments of government control, although they frequently have been able
 to block layoffs and dismissals. Moreover, a network of government-backed guilds
 issues vocational licenses, funds financial cooperatives, and helps workers find jobs.
 -. The Government does not tolerate any strike deemed to be at odds with its eco-
 nomic and labor policies. In 1993 the Parliament passed a law that prohibits strikes
 by government workers. It also prohibits government workers from having contacts
 with foreigners and stipulates penalties for failure to observe Islamic dress codes
 and principles at work.
 There are no known affiliations with international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers do not have the
 right to organize independently and negotiate collective bargaining agreements. No
 informationis available on mechanisms used to set wages.
 It is not known whether labor legislation and practice in the export processing
 zones differ from the law and practice in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Penal Code provides that the
 Government may require any person who does not have work to take suitable em-
 ployment. This provision has been criticized frequently by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) as contravening ILO Convention 29 on forced labor. There is no
 information available on the Government's policy on forced and bonded labor by
 children.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Law prohibits employment of minors under 15 years of age and places special
 restrictions on the employment of minors under age 18. Education is compulsory
 until age 11. The law permits children to work in agriculture, domestic service, and
 some small businesses. By law women and minors may not be employed in hard
 labor or, in general, in night work. Information on the extent to which these regula-
 tions are enforced is not available. There is no information available on the Govern-
 ment's policy on forced and bonded labor by children (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code empowers the Supreme Labor
 Council to establish annual minimum wage levels for each industrial sector and re-
 gion. It is not known if the minimum wages are adjusted annually or enforced. The
 Labor Code stipulates that the minimum wage should be sufficient to meet the liv-
 
 
 1673
 ing expenses of a family and should take inflation into account. Under current poor
 economic conditions, many middle-class citizens must work two or even three jobs
 to support their families. The daily minimum wage was raised in March 1997 to
 $2.80 (8,500 rials). This wage apparently is not sufficient to provide a decent stand-
 ard of living for a worker and family. Information on the share of the working popu-
 lation covered by minimum wage legislation is not available.
 The Labof Code establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum, with 1
 weekly rest day, normally Fridays, and at least 12 days of paid annual leave and
 several p aid public holidays.
 According to the Labor Code, a Supreme Safety Council, chaired by the Labor
 Minister or his representative, is responsible for promoting workplace safety and
 health. The Council reportedly has issued 28 safety directives, and oversees the ac-
 tivities of 3,000 safety committees established in enterprises employing more than
 10 persons. It is not known how well the Ministrys inspectors enforce regulations.
 It is not known whether workers can remove themselves from hazardous situations
 without risking the loss of employment.
