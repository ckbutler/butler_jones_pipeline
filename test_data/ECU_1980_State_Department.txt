 ECUADOR
 Since August 10, 1979, Ecuador has had a democratic,
 constitutional government composed of an executive branch
 headed by a president, Jaime Roldos, a unicameral legisla-
 tive of sixty-nine representatives elected for a five-
 year term and a judiciary appointed by the legislature.
 Local government is composed of elected provincial and
 municipal councils. The government is committed to the
 defense of human rights, both internally and internationally.
 Habeas corpus and trade union rights were restored after
 Roldos' inauguration.
 Ecuador has an estimated per capita annual income of
 $1,000, but income is unevenly distributed; an estimated
 60 percent of the population have a per capita income
 of $300 or less a year. Large sectors of the population,
 particularly in rural areas, are not fully integrated
 into the economic and political life of the country.
 The present government was elected on a platform of socio-
 economic reform which created high expectations among
 the poor. Difficulties in adjustment to democratic prac-
 tices after nine years of military rule has delayed the
 implementation of the reform program.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The constitution which entered into effect on August 10,
 1979 prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treat-
 ment (Part I, Title II, Section I, Article 19).
 Beatings sometimes occur at lower police levels but bru-
 tality is not officially sanctioned. During the past
 year, there have been four reliable reports of police
 brutality, all but one linked to efforts to obtain confes-
 sions.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The death penalty is prohibited by the constitution,
 and there haie been no summary executions in Ecuador.
 Corporal punishment is not permitted by law.
 Conditions vary from prison to prison. Facilities are
 generally poor due to limited economic resources. Through
 bribes, it is frequently possible to obtain relatively
 comfortable cells. A number of privileges such as day
 passes, establishing a'business within the prison, and
 conjugal visits are available. Prison authorities do
 have the authority to mete out punishments for internal
 disciplinary reasons; the most frequently reported punish-
 ment is separate confinement in a damp, poorly ventilated,
 underground cell with inadequate sanitary facilities.

 Rehabilitation is the stated objective of the Ecuadorean
 penal system, but there are few rehabilitation programs.
 The women's prisons in Quito and Cuenca have been turned
 over to the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. Under the
 direction of these nuns, guards are kept to a minimum,
 prisoners are allowed to keep infants until they reach
 two years of age, and the prisoners are given temporary
 passes in order to attend retreats and to participate
 in activities organized by the nuns.
 Classification of prisoners by type of conviction, by
 social class, by race, sex or religion does not in prin-
 ciple affect treatment in prison.
 c.   Disappearances
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested or held in
 clandestine detention by official security forces or
 by elements whose activites are condoned by the government.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 None of the human rights organizations in Ecuador have
 claimed that there are any political prisoners in the
 country. However, the 1980 Amnesty International Report
 claims that not all political prisoners have been released
 in spite of a general amnesty by the Roldos administration.
 The constitution provides for habeas corpus. Preventive
 detention does not exist. A criminal suspect can be
 held without charge for a maximum period of no more than
 seventy-two hours.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trial procedures can be lengthy; prisoners are sometimes
 confined two years or more between arrest and sentencing.
 Time spent in prison while awaiting sentencing counts
 toward completion of the final sentence. The defendant
 has a right to counsel. Both social workers and legal
 aides are assigned to prisons. If a defendant is unable
 to pay legal costs, the legal aide will evaluate his
 financial circumstances and request that the court appoint
 an attorney. Frequently the attorneys appointed are
 advanced law school students or recent law graduates.
 The judiciary is independent and appointed by the legis-
 lature. Political and security courts do not exist.
 Civilians are not tried by the military.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The Ecuadorean government respects the sanctity of the
 home both in theory and in practice. Warrants are required
 for an official to enter a private residence except in
 cases of hot pursuit. Warrants can be issued by judges
 ranging from the city level to the supreme court. Bugging
 of telephones is permitted.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 At the end of 1979, the gross domestic Product in current
 prices was $9,172 million, the equivalent of an estimated
 $1,000 per capita. Yet the figures are deceptive, since
 Ecuador's distribution of income is highly skewed.
 
 
 422
 Ninety-seven percent of the population reside in two
 of Ecuador's three geographic zones, the sierra and the
 tropical coast, three percent live in the tropical oriente
 and the Galapagos. Although 79 percent of the population
 is estimated to be literate, adult illiteracy is four
 times higher in rural areas (34 percent) than urban areas
 (eight percent). Of every 1,000 students who enter first
 grade in rural public schools, only 272 complete the
 sixth, compared with 611 in urban areas. In the rural
 areas there are only three physicians per 10,000 persons
 compared with nine per 10,000 nationwide. Whereas 72.8
 percent of urban dwellings have a toilet and an additional
 11.2 percent have a latrine, 86.6 percent of rural dwel-
 lings have neither.
 Life expectancy is 62 years. The infant mortality rate
 dropped dramatically over the past decade, but in 1979
 it was still as high as 66 per 1,000. The nutritional
 intake of the population is low, with average deficits
 of 43 percent in protein and 14 percent in calories based
 on standards established by the World Health Organization.
 About 40 percent of pre-school age children are malnourished.
 The 1974 housing census showed that 33 percent of the
 occupied housing units did not meet minimum shelter stand-
 ards.
 Poverty is persistent and widespread in Ecuador. Two
 percent of the property owners control 48 percent of
 the land. Underemployment is pervasive with an estimated
 40 to 60 percent of the labor force not earning enough
 income to meet basic needs. Urban industrial workers
 are covered by higher minimum wage, $160.00 plus fringe
 benefits of approximately $70.00 per month. Income in
 agricultural areas is about two-thirds lower. The high
 population growth rate of over three percent serious-
 ly impedes socio-economic progress.
 Since most of the government's efforts during its first
 seventeen months in office have been devoted to solving
 disagreements between the executive and legislative branches,
 there has been a delay in implementing new development
 initiatives. A National Development Council (CONADE),
 headed by the vice-president, has been established to
 plan and coordinate development activities. Its 1980-
 84 development plan provides a clear and realistic indica-
 tion of the government's commitment to the poor and their
 basic needs. Within the past year the minimum wage has
 been doubled, with a resultant strong inflationary impact,
 and the work week for industrial laborers cut to forty
 hours. A new low cost housing program aimed at aiding
 the urban poor of Quito and Guayaquil has been planned
 and financing arranged through international lending
 agencies. New projects have also been initiated for
 small industry development, rural electrification, second-
 ary cities, rural roads, health care and adult literary.
 The government's ambitious development plan has allocated
 20 percent of its central government budget to providing
 for basic economic needs. Significant budget deficits,
 stagnating agricultural production, rising inflationary
 pressure (estimated to be b~tween 18 and 20 percent in
 1980) and increasing rural to urban migration will provide
 significant challenges to the government's ability to
 carry out its development programs.
 
 
 423
 Over 60 percent of the rural population in the sierra
 are Indians in various degrees of integration with the
 Spanish-speaking society. In addition there are an esti-
 mated 300,000 blacks in the coastal province of Esmeraldas
 and in one small pocket in the northern sierra. Both
 groups are the object of serious racial and social pre-
 judices.
 Women face barriers to socio-economic mobility, as separate
 male and female roles are well defined in Ecuadorean
 society. This problem is particularly acute for the
 large number of female heads of household in urban slums
 and squatter settlements who are seeking productive employ-
 ment.
 The government has made little effort to deal with the
 discrimination barrier which makes socio-economic mobility
 especially difficult for blacks and Indians, but it has
 taken some steps to deal with the problems facing women.
 In May 1980, the government inaugurated its Bureau of
 Women's Affairs to deal with the problems of rural, poor
 and single women. Its initial focus was in areas of
 legislation, female unemployment and information gathering
 with other countries.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Preedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of speech and freedom
 of expression. However, the penal code provides for
 the arrest, fining and imprisonment of anyone who cri-
 ticizes the president or government officials. This
 section of the penal code was invoked several times during
 the past year, and those accused served three to four
 days in jail.
 The major Ecuadorean newspapers are privately owned and
 free of government influence. There is no media censorship
 nor is there censorship of domestic or foreign books
 and artistic works. Opposition viewpoints and criticism
 of the government are tolerated. One exception was in
 August of 1980 when the editor of the magazine Caskabel
 was arrested on charges of slander. Press reports alleged
 that the arrest actually was made because the magazine
 published an interview severely critical of government
 policy.
 There has been no government interference with academic
 inquiry in the natural or social sciences.
 There are no limits on public meetings, and groups are
 not denied or restricted in their right to free assembly.
 Street rallies require prior government consent, which
 normally is granted.
 Trade union organization is relatively widespread. Unions
 are organized in five major confederations of contrasting
 ideological pursuasions. Trade unions have and exercise
 the legal right to organize, strike, bargain collectively
 and lobby, although these rights are not always respected.
 The law calls for considerable government involvement
 in resolution of labor disputes. The present government
 
 
 424
 has been generally sympathetic to trade union organization
 and activity. However, during a strike of transport
 workers in July, the most serious strike of the year,
 the government~rade  .union headquarters, temporarily
 arrested union leaders with9ut charge and militarized
 the transport system until a~s~ttlement was reached.
 The Coordinator General of the Mnf{sty, of Government
 headed a group of demonstrators that sacked the headquar-
 ters of the Guayas province drivers union. Several union
 leaders were arrested without charges and when the strike
 ended, released.
 The government does not impose leaders of its choice
 on the trade unions, and governmental favoritism does
 not appear to exist. The constitution provides for the
 formal participation of unions in policy making by assuring
 that at least one labor representative sits on the National
 Development Board, the Social Security Board, the Tribunal
 of Constitutional Guarantees and the Board of the Labor
 Training Institute.
 There is no state or otherwise favored religion, and
 Ecuadoreans are free to practice the religion of their
 choice. Foreign missionaries operate freely in Ecuador,
 and adherence to a particular faith does not appear to
 confer either advantage or disadvantage in civil, economic,
 political, military or other secular status.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 No refugee groups have been resettled or granted safehaven
 in Ecuador during the past year.
 There are no internal or external travel restrictions.
 Ecuadoreans may emigrate freely, and there are no restric-
 tions on repatriation.
 Women or other groups are not subjected to different
 rules in matters of internal or foreign travel, emigra-
 tion or repatriation.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Ecuadoreans eighteen years of age and over have the right
 to vote by secret ballot, to elect and be elected, to
 present projects to the legislature, to be consulted
 as provided by the constitution and to question the actions
 of the public sector. Voting is mandatory for literates
 and voluntary for illiterates. All citizens have the
 right to organize political parties and to participate
 in political activities. The twelve legal political
 parties function free of restrictions, but a party may
 be deprived of its legal status if it fails in two conse-
 cutive elections to receive a minimum percentage of the
 votes or does not present candidates in a stipulated
 number of provinces.
 Women enjoy the same constitutional rights and privileges
 as men in all aspects of public and private life. Although
 tradition and custom are important factors in limiting
 women's participation in the political process, women
 have made some gains during President Roldos' administra-
 tion. The aforementioned Women's Bureau was established
 and two women were appointed to cabinet positions, though
 they did not serve at the same time.
 
 
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No international or non-governmental organizations have
 requested permission to carry out investigations in Ecua-
 dor. President Roldos clearly delineated his human rights
 policy in the Riobamba Declaration which was proposed
 to and was approved by the Andean Pact countries with
 the exception of Bolivia. The essence of the declaration
 is that condemnation of human rights violations does
 not constitute intervention in the internal.affairs of
 another country.
 Numerous human rights organizations exist in Ecuador,
 The government along with the Latin American Institute
 of Social Investigations has sponsored two human rights
 conferences in Quito which led to the formation of the
 Latin American Association for Human Rights, whose first
 two seminars were devoted to criticizing human rights
 violations in rightist, authoritarian governments. Al-
 legations of human rights violations are most likely
 to be found in the editorial section of newspapers.
 The present government is an active defender of human
 rights in international organizations. Ecuador has acceded
 to the American Convention on Human Rights. It is also
 a member of the American States' Juridical-Political
 Committee.
 Non-gover'nmental groups have made no requests to visit
 Ecuador.
