 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constituti6nal
 monarch. Its Council of Ministers (Cabinet) in practice is
 responsible for governmental decisions. The Council, led by the
 Prime Minister, holds office as long as it retains the
 confidence of the Parliament. Direct popular elections for
 parliamentary seats (excluding 76 of the 182 Senate seats
 apportioned by other means) are held at least every four years
 under a system of universal suffrage, obligatory voting, and
 proportional representation.
 Belgium is a party to the 1950 European Convention on the
 Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Respect
 for human rights in Belgium is guaranteed in the Constitution
 and laws and is observed in practice.
 The Belgian economy is only now beginning a slow recovery from
 the severe recession which followed the second oil price shock.
 High wages and costs had made Belgian industry uncompetitive,
 which contributed to steeply rising unemployment and large
 current-account and budget deficits. A special economic
 recovery program, which began in early 1982 with an 8.5 percent
 devaluation and a plan to lower real wages, has restored the
 competitive position of Belgian industry and made significant
 progress toward-current account equilibrium. However, because
 growth has not returned to the economy, the budget deficit
 remains at about 13 percent of the gross national product (GNP),
 and unemployment, now at least 15 percent, is continuing to
 rise, though at a reduced rate. About one percent real growth
 is expected in 1984 with inflation projected at 6.5 percent.
 The division of Belgium between Dutch- and French-speaking
 regions poses significant problems for the Belgian state.
 Belgium has four linguistic entities: The Dutch speakers of
 Flanders (57 percent of the population), the Francophones in
 Wallonia (33 percent), the legally bilingual residents of the
 Brussels area (just under 10 percent), and the German speakers
 along the southeast border area (0.7 percent). All major
 institutions, including political parties, are divided into
 Dutch- and French-speaking sections. Regional and linguistic
 needs are taken into account in national decisions. Linguistic
 disputes are a perennial problem which can immobilize the
 political process and from time to time cause minor, temporary
 civil disorder. A committee was established by Prime Minister
 Martens in 1983 to study all outstanding linguistic issues, and
 the committee will issue its report in 1985. This has frozen
 public and parliamentary debate for the present and defused much
 of the tension over the problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Neither the Belgian authorities nor officially sanctioned groups
 engage in killings for political motives. Terrorism in Belgium
 -has remained a low-level, externally motivated activity, with
 
 (928)
 
 
 929
 Armenian groups claiming responsibility for three out of six
 apparent terrorist acts in 1983. The only clearly
 terrorist-related death this year was the July assassination of
 Dirsan Aksoy, a Turkish cultural attache, in Brussels.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, or clandestine detentions by
 official or quasi-official security forces, or by other
 officially condoned elements, contravene Belgian law and are
 unknown in practice.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 The Belgian Constitution provides that *no person may be
 prosecuted except in cases laid down by the law and in the form
 it prescribes' and "no penalty may be decreed nor applied save
 in accordance with the law.* The Belgian Penal Code prohibits
 the deliberate mistreatment or injury of another, and is
 applicable to the actions of officials, as well as those of
 private individuals. There are no differences in the conditions
 of confinement based on race, sex, religion, or social class.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice. Arrested persons must be brought
 before a judge within 24 hours or released. Belgian law
 provides for pretrial confinement only under special
 circumstances: when a person is apprehended in the commission
 of a criminal act; when there is a risk that the suspect will
 prove a danger to the community; when there is a risk that he
 will flee the jurisdiction; and when the case involves one of a
 number of serious offenses specified by law. The justification
 for such confinement is subject to periodic review by a panel of
 judges. Exile of Belgian citizens is not permitted by law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair, public trial, including the right to counsel, is
 guaranteed by law and honored in practice. A suspect is
 charged, if the evidence so warrants, when the preliminary
 judicial investigatory phase is completed. Charges are clearly
 and formally stated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy by the state is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Participation in
 the political process and enjoyment of civil and personal
 liberties in Belgium are not inhibited to any perceptible degree
 by law or by actions of security forces. The inviolability of
 the home is specifically guaranteed by the Belgian Constitution,
 except in cases laid down and regulated by law. The law forbids
 
 
 930
 searches of private homes at night, except in special
 circumstances; warrants issued by a judge are required unless
 the inhabitants of the domicile agree to the search. The penal
 code provides penalties for all violations of the home by
 officials, as well as by private persons. Monitoring of
 telephones and interference with mail are also strictly
 prohibited.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Varying political, religious, philosophical, and artistic views
 are permitted free public expression, and there is no political
 censorship of the media. There are, however, prohibitions on
 publications and productions held to undermine "public order"
 (e.g., extreme pornography and incitement of violence). There
 are laws against libel, provisions for a citizen's right of
 reply to media criticism, and restrictions on criticism of
 government policies by civil servants. Belgium has a
 4tate-owned radi6 and television network, but there is no direct
 government control of program content. "Free" (not state-owned)
 radio stations operate openly, although their legal status is
 ambiguous. Most urban homes also have access to foreign
 television from neighboring countries via cable. Belgian
 state-owned radio and television programs are supervised by
 boards of directors which represent the main currents of
 opinion. The Government has a representative on the boards, but
 no veto power.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Subject to regulations of public order, political, civic,
 religious, artistic, social, and special interest groups are
 permitted free public assembly. Labor unions and groups
 protesting government policies or actions are totally free from
 harassment and persecution.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religions are accorded a
 "recognized" status in law, which entails a government subsidy.
 Minority, 'non-recognized" religions enjoy full freedom to
 practice and are not subject to harassment or persecution.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Belgian citizens enjoy freedom of travel within the country and
 internationally, including the right of voluntary repatriation.
 Within a system of immigration and labor regulations, Belgium
 previously admitted a large number of foreign immigrants. The
 granting of resident status to non-European Community nationals
 has become more restrictive since December 1980. Belgium grants
 the right of political asylum to those foreign nationals
 applying in Belgium who are recommended by the local office of
 the U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) as eligible for
 asylum.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Belgium is governed by Parliament under a constitutional monarch
 with direct popular elections for most parliamentary seats held
 at least every four years. Participation in the political
 system is open to all citizens. Suffrage is universal for all
 adults (18 and over), secret, and compulsory. Unweighted voting
 (one person/one vote) has been in effect since 1919, and women's
 suffrage since 1948. There are 13 parties currently represented
 in the Belgian Parliament. Opposition parties are free, under
 law and in practice, to operate without constraints or
 repression.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Belgian Government has been active in promoting independent
 investigation of alleged human rights violations, such as
 sponsoring resolutions in the UNHRC on Iranian treatment of
 Bahais. yo requests have been made for outside investigation of
 the human rights situation in Belgium. Freedom House rates
 Belgium 'free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Belgium's per capita GNP for 1983 is projected to be about
 $8,800. The Government seeks to insure that these benefits are
 distributed equitably throughout the economy, with social
 programs to insure adequate living standards to all the
 population. Excellent medical care is available at reasonable
 cost. Belgium's population enjoys a life expectancy at birth of
 72.9 years. The infant mortality rate is 11.6 per 1,000 live
 births (1983).
 The adverse effects of a general downturn in the world economy,
 combined with structural problems in the national economy, have
 led to a high unemployment rate. This is being confronted by
 remedial governmental policies and by an extensive system of
 unemployment compensation and other social benefits. In most
 cases, these have prevented serious individual hardship.
 A common educational system serves all economic levels. School
 attendance is mandatory until age 18 for both sexes, and the
 population is almost .totally literate. To confront the
 longstanding ethnic rivalries inherent in the linguistic
 division between the Dutch-speaking north and the
 French-speaking south, detailed provisions have been made in law
 and government structure to assure equitable participation in
 the national life for both major linguistic groups. In 1983,
 the Prime Minister formed a committee to study linguistic issues
 for two years, which has subdued public and parliamentary debate
 on these issues. A long-term solution to the linguistic
 community problems remains a priority goal of the Government.
