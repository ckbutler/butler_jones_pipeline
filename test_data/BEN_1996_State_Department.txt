 BENIN
 The Republic of Benin is a constitutional democracy headed by President Mathieu
 Kerekou, who was inaugurated on April 4 after elections generally viewed as free
 and fair. President Kerekou, who ruled Benin as a Socialist military dictator from
 1972-1989, succeeded his democratically elected predecessor, and continued the ci-
 vilian, democratic rule begun in the 1990-1991 constitutional process that ended his
 previous reign. There are 18 political parties represented in the unicameral, 83-
 member National Assembly; no party or political grouping commands a majority of
 seats. The Government respects the constitutional provision for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the judiciary is inefficient and susceptible to corruption.
 
 
 The civilian-controlled security forces consist of the armed forces, headed by a
 Minister Delegate for Defense Matters in the office of the President and the police
 force under the Interior Minister. The two Ministers also share authority over the
 gendarmerie, which exercises police functions in rural areas. The armed forces con-
 tinued to play an apolitical role in government affairs despite concerns about morale
 within its ranks and its ethnic imbalance.
 An extremely poor country with average yearly per capita income below $450, the
 economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, regional
 trade (including transshipment of goods to neighboring countries), and small-scale
 offshore oil production. The port of Cotonou serves as a major conduit for goods en-
 tering neighoring Nigeria legally and illegally. The new Administration continued,
 and in some cases stepped up, the austerity program begun by its predecessor,
 privatized state-owned enterprises; reduced fiscal expenditures; and deregulated
 trade. In spite of its bloated and inefficient bureaucracy, high debt servicing costs,
 and widespread unemployment, Benin's economic recovery continues under liberal
 economic policies instituted since the return to democracy. Inflation in 1996 was less
 than 3 percent with real growth estimated at between 5 and 6 percent.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. The major
 human rights problems continued to be the failure by police forces to curtail acts
 of vigilantism and mob justice; serious administrative delays in processing ordinary
 criminal cases with attendant denial of timely, fair trials; judicial corruption; harsh
 and unhealthy prison conditions; societal discrimination and violence against women
 and the abuse of children. The practice of female genital mutilation (FGM), is also
 a problem. The Constitutional Court demonstrated independence in a high profile
 challenge to the presidential elections and the prosecution of an army officer ac-
 cused of threatening state security.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Illing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government officials. However, a rising crime rate and
 a lack of police responsiveness led to more reports of mob justice. Vigilantism re-
 portedly resulted in several cases of suspected criminals being killed or severely in-
 jured, particularly thieves caught in the act. Although a number of these incidents
 took place in urban areas and were publicized in the press, the Government appar-
 ently made no concerted attempt to investigate or prosecute anyone involved. Some
 press accounts suggested that the police deliberately igored vigilante attacks.
 b. Disappearane.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruet, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices and there were no reports that officials
 employed them. The Government continued to make payments to victims of torture
 under the military regime which ruled from 1972 to 1989.
 Prison conditions continue to be extremely harsh. Extensive overcrowding and
 lack of proper sanitation and medical facilities pose a risk to prisoners' health. The
 prison diet is seriously inadequate with malnutrition and disease common. Prisoners
 are allowed to meet with visitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention or exile, however, at times the authorities arbitrarily arrested and
 detained persons. The Constitution prohibits detention for more than 48 hours with-
 out a hearing by a magistrate whose order is required for continued detention. How-
 ever, there were credible reports that authorities exceeded this 48-hour limit in
 many cases, sometimes by as long as a week, using the accepted practice of holding
 a person without specified time limit "at the disposition of" the public prosecutor's
 office before presenting the case to a magistrate. Approximately 75 percent of pris-
 oners are pretrial detainees. Arbitrary arrest is not routine but does occur occasion-
 ally. In a highly publicized case, Colonel Maurice Kouandete was arrested for politi-
 cal reasons prior to the presidential election, allegedly forplotting against the secu-
 rity of the State. The Constitutional Court ruled that his detention was unconstitu-
 tional. He was not released, however, until President Kerekou took office on April
 4.
 On July 31, in his first address to the nation since taking office, President
 Kerekou announced that he would pardon certain categories of prisoners convicted
 between August 1, 1995, and June 15, 1996. All such prisoners were released by
 year's end.
 The Constitution prohibits forced exile of citizens. Many citizens who went into
 exile prior to the establishment of democratic rule have returned.
 
 
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. However,
 the executive has important powers in regard to the judiciary.
 The President appoints career magistrates as judges in civil courts, and the Con-
 stitution gives the Ministry of Justice administrative authority over judges, includ-
 ing the power to transfer them. Inadequate facilities, poorly-trained staff, and over-
 crowded dockets result in slow admimstration of justice. The low salaries of mag-
 istrates and clerks have a demoralizing effect on their commitment to efficient and
 timely justice and makes them susceptible to corruption.
 The legal system is based on French civil law and local customary law. The Con-
 stitution provides for the right to a fair public trial. A defendant enjoys the pre-
 sumption of innocence and has the right to be present at trial and to representation
 by an attorney, at public expense if necessary. In practice, the court provides indi-
 gent defendants with court-appointed counsel upon request. A defendant also has
 the right to confront witnesses and to have access to government-held evidence.
 Trials are open to the public, hut in exceptional circumstances the President of the
 court may decide to restrict access to preserve public order or to protect the parties.
 A civilian court system operates on the national and provincial levels. Military
 disciplinary councils deal with minor offense by military members, but have no ju-
 risdiction over civilians. There is only one court of appeals. The Supreme Court is
 the court of last resort in all administrative and judicial matters. The Constitutional
 Court is charged with passing on the constitutionality of laws and disputes between
 the President and the National Assembly and with resolving disputes regarding
 presidential and National Assembly elections. Its rulings against both the executive
 and legislative branches indicated its independence from both these branches of
 Government. The Constitution also provides for a High Court of Justice to convene
 in the event of crimes committed by the President or government ministers against
 the State. Implementing legislation to create the High Court of Justice was passed
 in June. Although the legislation was passed, the Constitutional Court later found
 some of its provisions tobe unconstitutional. As of year's end, the legislature had
 not passed revisions to bring the law into compliance with the Constitutional Court
 ruling.
 At year's end there were no reports of political prisoners. During the year, one
 individual arrested in connection with a rocket attack on the site where the Decem-
 ber 1995 international conference for the heads of French-speaking nations was held
 in special prison quarters, charged with "threatening national security," but tried
 under the Criminal Code. The individual was convicted and sentenced to 1 year in
 prison, but released on December 1 after paying a fine of $2,000 (1 million cfa).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices and government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions in practice. Police are required to obtain a judicial warrant before
 entering a private home, and usually observed this requirement in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. The Govern-
 ment entity with oversight responsibility for media operations is the High Authority
 for Audio-visual Media and Communications (HAAC), which requires broadcasters
 to submit weekly lists of planned programs and requires publishers to deposit copies
 of all publications with it. The requirement, however, is not observed by the media
 in practice.
 There is a large and active privately owned press consisting of about a dozen
 newspapers. These publications criticize the Government freely and often, but their
 effect on public opinion is limited because of their urban concentration. The majority
 of Beninese are illiterate.
 The Government continued to own and operate the media most influential in
 reaching the public. The only radio stations that transmit locally are Government
 owned: the Benin Office of Radio and Television (ORTB) transmits in FM, AM and
 short wave, in French and local languages. Radio France International (RFI) also
 transmits over a local FM band under an agreement with the Government. Five
 rural radio stations governed by local committees broadcast several hours a day ex-
 clusively in local languages. These stations receive support from ORTB. Radio is
 probably the most important information medium.
 A similar arrangement is in place for television transmissions: ORTB broadcasts
 5 hours per day on a signal that is easily received in urban areas. Approximately
 80 percent of ORTB's television programming is in French. TV5, a commercial ven-
 ture with investments by television broadcasting organizations in France, Canada,
 Belgium and Switzerland, broadcasts locally 24 hours a day entirely in French
 
 
 under an agreement with the Government. Although neither television station
 broadcasts partisan programs in support of or unduly critical of the Government,
 the vast majority of news programming centers on government officials' activities.
 By year's end, the Nationa Assembly still had not approved guidelines for broad-
 casting, effectively blocking the demonopolization of electronic media.
 The Government does not censor works by foreign journalists, authors, or artists.
 A special RFI correspondent covering the Presidential election was threatened with
 expulsion by the previous government because he transmitted reports of unofficial
 early election results that showed the government was losing. However, no action
 was taken against him.
 HAAC regulations govern satellite reception equipment and movie and video
 clubs. There is little enforcement of these regulations.
 In general, academic freedom is respected. University professors are permitted to
 lecture freely, conduct research, and publish their work.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assciation.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice. The Govern-
 ment requires permits for use of public places for demonstrations and requires asso-
 ciations to register. It routinely grants both such permits and registrations. The
 Government did not take any actions against nonregistered organizations for failure
 or refusal to register. Security forces protected former President Soglo at a rally or-
 ganized by the opposition coalition, following his return from a protracted stay
 abroad after the election. Sglo was allowed to use government-owned facilities for
 his homecoming speech and the rally was given prominent coverage on the govern-
 ment-owned radio and television stations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Countr, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patrietion.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the governent gen-
 erally respects them in practice. However, the presence of police, gendarmes, and
 illegal roadblocks impedes domestic movement. Although ostensibly meant to en-
 force automotive safety and customs regulations, many of these checkpoints serve
 as a means for officials to exact bribes from travelers. The Kerekou Government in-
 stituted measures to combat such petty corruption at roadblocks.
 The Government's policy toward transhumance allows migratory Fulani herdsmen
 from other countries to enter freely; it does not enforce designated entry points. In
 recent years, friction between native farmers and itinerant foreign herders has
 sometimes led to violence.
 The Government does not restrict international travel for political reasons, and
 those who travel abroad may return without hindrance.
 Historically, the Government has cooperated closely with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in as-
 sisting refugees, including those in need of first asylum. The Government provided
 first asylum to up to 200,000 Togolese in the recent past. While most have returned
 to Togo, some 5,000 to 8,000 continue to receive first asylum. Several hundred
 Oganis from Nigcria were also provided first asylum in 1996. Thee rele no reports
 o forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution. There were
 no reports of forced expulsion of persons having a valid claim to refugee status.
 As a result of political turmoil in neighboring Togo beginning in 1992, some
 200,000 Togolese refugees were protected and assisted by the UNHCR. Since 1993
 thousands of refugees have returned to Togo on their own. At the benning of 1996,
 approximately 20,000 Togolese refugees remained in Benin. In mid-1996 UNHCR
 implemented its plan for organized voluntary repatriation of the Togolese. By year's
 end, all but about 5,000 to 8,000 had returned to Togo. Despite severe economic
 pressures limiting its ability to provide education for its own children, the Govern-
 ment allowed the Togolese to enroll their children in local schools and to participate
 in some economic activities. The country also' hosts several hundred Nigerian refu-
 gees, primarily from the Ogoni ethnic group. Ogoni requests for asylum increased
 significantly when Ogoni leader Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed. Liberian, Rwandan,
 Burundian and Chadian refugees are among those also   resented in smaler num-
 bers.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment. Citizens exercised this right in legislative elections in 1991 and 1995, and
 in presidential elections in 1991 and March, all considered free and fair. The Con-
 stitution provides for a 5-year term of office for the President (who is limited to two
 terms) and 4-year terms for National Assembly members (who may serve an uaim-
 
 
 ited number of terms). Seven candidates competed openly and vigorously during the
 March 3 presidential elections, with the two leaders contesting the runoff two weeks
 later. Although the losing incumbent challenged the final results, claiming fraudu-
 lent voting and other irregularities, those claims were rejected after consideration
 by the Constitutional Court.
 Women participate actively in the political parties but are underrepresented in
 Government positions. There is now 1 woman in the 19-member Cabinet. The pre-
 vious Government had four female cabinet members. There are 6 female deputies
 in the 83-member unicameral National Assembly. The President of the Constitu-
 tional Court is a woman; the HAAC and the Economic and Social Council have fe-
 male members.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups-both domestic and international--operate
 without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on
 human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive
 to their views. Hundreds of electoral observers representing scores of international
 human rights groups traveled to Benin for the presidentia[ elections. Nearly all of
 them reported that the Government had cooperated with them.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, and religion, but so-
 cietal discrimination against women continues.
 Women.-While no statistics are available, violence against women, including wife
 beating, occurs. The press sometimes reports incidents of abuse of women but judges
 and police are reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes, considering such disputes
 a family matter.
 Although the Constitution provides for equality for women in the political, eco-
 nomic, and social spheres, women experience extensive societal discrimination, espe-
 cially in rural areas, where they occupy a subordinate role and are responsible for
 much of the hard labor on subsistence farms. In urban areas, women dominate the
 trading sector in the open-air markets. By law, women have equal inheritance and
 property rights, but local custom in some areas prevents them from inheriting real
 property. Women do not enjoy the same educational opportunities as men, and fe-
 male literacy is about 16 percent (compared with 32 percent for males).
 There are active women's rights groups that have been effective in drafting a fam-
 ily code that would improve the status of women under the law.
 Children.-The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is responsible for the protec-
 tion of children's rights, primarily in the areas of education and health. In particu-
 lar, the Government is trying to boost primary school enrollment, which is only
 about 66 percent. In some parts of the country, girls receive no formal education.
 Some traditional practices inflict hardship and violence on children, including
 most prominently the custom of "vidomegon," whereby poor, often rural, families
 place a child, primarily girls, in the home of more wealthy families. In July a crimi-
 na court convicted and sent to prison the wife of a former Minister for beating to
 death a child in her employ under the vidomegon system. Other traditional practices
 include the killing of deformed babies, breach babies, and one of two newborn twins
 (all of whom are thought to be sorcerers in some rural areas). There is also a tradi-
 tion in which a groom abducts and rapes his prospective child (under 14 years of
 age) bride. Criminal courts mete out stiff sentences to criminals convicted of crimes
 against children, but many such crimes never reach the courts.
 The Government has been less successful in combating female genital mutilation
 (FGM), which is not illegal. FGM is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. FGM, or excision, is
 practiced on females ranging from infancy through 30 years of age. Studies vary
 widely and suggest that as few as 5 percent or as many as 50 percent of women
 are affected by this practice, mostly in the northern provinces. The actual incidence
 probably falls somewhere between these estimates. A prominent nongovernmental
 organization has made progress in raising awareness of the dangers of the practice;
 the Government has cooperated with its efforts. According to recent research, there
 is a strong profit motive in the continued practice of FGM by those who perform
 the operation, usually older women.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the Constitution provides that the State look
 after the handicapped, the Government does not mandate accessibility for disabled
 persons. It operated a number of social centers for disabled persons to assist their
 
 
 social integration. Nonetheless, many are unable to find employment and must re-
 sort to begging to support themselves.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There is a long history of regional rivalries.
 Although Southerners dominate the Government's senior ranks, Northerners domi-
 nate the military. The South has enjoyed more advanced economic development, a
 larger population, and has traditionally held favored status. In the 1996 elections,
 a Northerner was elected President.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides workers with the freedom
 to organize, join unions, meet, and strike, and the Government usually respects
 these rights in practice. The labor force of about2 million is primarily engaged in
 subsistence agriculture and other primary sector activities, with less than 2 percent
 of the population engaged in the modern (wage) sector. Approximately 75 percent
 of the wage earners belong to labor unions. There are four union confederations, and
 unions are generally independent of Government' and political parties. The Eco-
 nomic and Social Council, a constitutionally mandated body established in 1994, in-
 cludes four union representatives. In August the Union of Workers of the Agency
 for Aviation Navigation (ASECNA) closed the country's only international airport for
 several days to protest government plans (initiated under the previous administra-
 tion) to privatize airport operations. The strike was settled peacefully. In December
 ASECNA also struck in coordination with ASECNA workers in 14 other African
 countries. In February workers at the state-owned petroleum company, SONACOP,
 conducted a 72-hour strike to protest the company's privatization as proposed by the
 World Bank. The President agreed to renegotiate the terms of the privatization and
 the strike was settled peacefully.
 There were no known instances of efforts by the Government to retaliate against
 union activity. Laws prohibit employer retaliation against strikers, and the Govern-
 ment enforces them effectively.
 Unions may freely form or join federations or confederations and affiliate with
 international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining, and workers freely exercised these rights. Wages in the pri-
 vate sector are set in negotiations between unions and employers. A tripartite
 group, composed of unions, employers, and the Government, discussed and agreed
 to revisions in the Labor Code in 1995, but the new code had not been enacted into
 law by year's end The Government sets wages in the public sector by law and regu-
 lation.
 The Labor Code prohibits employers from taking union membership or activity
 into account regarding hiring, work distribution, professional or vocational training,
 or dismissal. The Government levies substantial penalties against employers who
 refuse to rehire workers dismissed for lawful union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and such labor is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code prohibits the em-
 ployment or apprenticeship of children under 14 years of age in any enterprise.
 However, the Ministry of Labor enforces the code in only a limited manner (and
 then only in the modern sector), due to the lack of inspectors. Children continue to
 work on rural family farms, on construction sites in urban areas, and as domestic
 servants. Children also commonly work as street vendors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively sets mini-
 mum wage scales for a number of occupations. The minimum wage is approximately
 $40 (cfa francs 20,300) per month, which is insufficient to cover the costs for food
 and housing of even a single worker living in an urban area. Many workers must
 supplement their wages by subsistence farming or informal sector trade. Most work-
 ers in the wage sector, however, earn more than the minimum wage.
 The Labor Code establishes a workweek of from 40 to 46 hours, depending on the
 tpe of work, and provides for at least one 24-hour rest period per week. The au-
 Torities generally enforce legal limits on workweeks. The Labor Code establishes
 health and safety standards, but the Ministry of Labor does not enforce them effec-
 tively. The Labor Code does not provide workers with the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
 The Ministry of Labor has the authority to require employers to remedy dangerous
 work conditions but does not do so effectively.
