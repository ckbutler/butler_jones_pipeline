 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a longstanding parliamentary democracy under a
 constitutidnal monarch. The constitutional role of King
 Baudouin I is largely ceremonial. The Council of Ministers
 (the Cabinet),led by the Prime Minister, is responsible for
 government decisions. The Cabinet holds office as long as it
 retains.the confidence-of the democratically elected bicameral
 Parliament.
 National,. municipal, and judicial police forces bear the
 primary responsibility for domestic security in Belgium. The
 armed forces play no role in domestic law enforcement.
 Belgium is a highly industrialized state with a mixed,
 free-market economy. A vigorous private sector, government
 participation in certain industries, and an extensive social
 welfare system combine to support a relatively high standard
 of living for most Belgians.
 Respect for human rights is provided for in the Constitution
 and laws and observed in practice. The Government is
 sensitive to allegations -of human rights violations and in
 1989 took steps to adjust national policies criticized by the
 European Court of Human-Rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the-Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and-Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance *      "
 Abductions; secret arrests ;and clandestine detentions did not
 occur.  4   "" .
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or-Punishment "-   -
 The Government does-not practice or condone torture or inhuman
 treatment.            .
 d. Arbitrary Arrest; Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is provided for
 by law. Arrested persons must be brought before a judge
 within 24 hours. Thereafter, pretrial confinement is allowed
 only under certain legally specified circumstances. The
 premise for.such confinement is subject to monthly review by a
 panel-of judges.
 Bail exists-in principle under Belgian-law but is rarely
 granted' in practicb7. There is'nb limit on the length of time
 an accused may be held prior to coming to trial. In 1988' the
 European Court of Human Rights criticized Belgium for placing
 juveniles in prisons until accommodations could be found in
 special juvenile correction institutions. Since that time,
 several legislative amendments have been proposed in the
 Parliament to put an end to this practice. Exile of Belgian
 citizens is not permitted by law.
 With regard to forced or combtlgory labor, see Section 6.c.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial, including the right to counsel, is
 assured by.law and honored in practice. A suspect is charged,
 if the evidence so warrants, once a preliminary judicial
 investigatory phase is completed. Charges are clearly and
 formally stated, and defendants enjoy the right of appeal.
 Imprisonment for political beliefs is prohibited.
 In March the European Court of Human Rights citicized Belgium
 for withholding evidence from defense attorneys for as long as
 1 month after detainees had been arrested. In response, the
 Ministry of Justice has proposed legislation which would bring
 Belgian law in this area into compliance with the European
 Convention on Human Rights.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy by the State
 is guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Search
 warrants issued by a judge are required unless the residents
 of a domicile agree to a search. Monitoring of telephones and
 interference with mail are strictly prohibited.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are assured by law and respected in practice.
 varying political, religious, philosophical, and artistic
 views are permitted free public expression, subject only to
 slander and libel laws. There is no political censorship of
 the media. Statutes protect citizens' rights to reply to
 media criticism. Publications and productions held to
 undermine "public order" (e.g., explicit pornography and
 incitement to violence) are prohibited, however, and civil
 servants are restricted from criticizing government policy.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 The Government operates several radio and television networks
 but does not control program content. Programs are supervised
 by boards of directors which represent the main political,
 linguistic, and opinion groups. A government representative
 sits on each board but has no veto power. Private radio and
 television stations operate with government licenses. Most
 urban homes have access by cable to television from other
 European countries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public assembly is subject to regulations concerning public
 order, but is otherwise unrestricted. Groups protesting
 government policies or actions are free from harassment and
 persecution. Permits are required for open-air assemblies,
 but are granted routinely. Belgians are free to form
 organizations and to establish ties to international bodies.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Belgium has a long tradition of religious tolerance. The
 Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religions are accorded a
 
 
 1041
 BELGIUM
 "recognized" status in law, and granted a government subsidy.
 Minority "nonrecognized" religions enjoy full freedom to
 practice and are not subject to harassment or persecution.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 - Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Belgians are completely free to travel both within Belgium and
 internationally, and may return to Belgium at any time.
 Citizens are free to choose their places of work and
 residence. The Government does not force refugees to return
 to countries where they face persecution.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Participation in the political system is open to all adult
 citizens. Direct popular elections for'parliamentary seats*
 (excluding 76 of the 182 Senate seats apportioned by other
 means) are held at least every 4 years under a system of
 universal, secret, and compulsory suffrage for all adults (age
 18 and over). Unweighted voting (one person/one vote) has
 been in effect since 1919 for men, and since 1949 for women.
 Under law and practice, opposition parties are free to operate
 without constraints or repression. Seventeen political
 parties,'representing the full range of the political
 spectrum, competed in the last general elections in December
 1987;
 The existence of Dutch- and French-speaking regions poses
 significant problems for the State. All major institutions,
 including political parties, are divided along linguistic
 lines. There are special provisions for Dutch-, French-, and
 German-speaking councils at the regional level. Regional and
 linguistic needs are taken into account in national political
 afideconomic decisions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requbsts'hake:been made for outside investigation of the
 human rights situatibn'in Belgium. Several active independent
 human righth"gr6ups exist. All consider the Government open
 to discdssion'of any hufban rights question. The Ministry of
 J~btice and~other goirnmental'agencies aie sensitive to-
 allegations of human rights abuses and-take steps to correct
 perceived shortcomings in national legislation. The
 Goverfimeft-is-  party to various. intknationbl human rights
 treaties'Snd ha& been active in the United Nations and other
 inteknational forums in promoting human rights. It has also
 pr6moted'independent investigation of alleged human rights
 violhtions.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Religion, Sex,
 Language, er Social Status
 Belgifht.is a dulturally vibrant, pluralistic society in-which
 indiirid'al aifferences in general are respected, and
 linguiitic rights in particular'are protected. Some 57
 percent of Belgians are native Dutch speakers living primarily
 in the northern proyinces that constitute Flanders. The 42
 percent of th population who are French speakers live mostly'
 in the capital', 9tussels, and the southern provinces called
 Wallonia. A small minority of German speakers lives along the
 
 
 1042
 eastern border. Language differences have been the subject of
 hundreds of laws over the last century, leading to a fairly
 rigid structure designed to protect each language group from
 cultural, economic, or political dominance by the others.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 residents regardless of race, sex, religion, language, social
 status, or ethnic background. Some 27 percent of the
 residents of Brussels, the nation's largest city, are
 foreigners. Many of these are north African and Turkish
 immigrants. Encouraging the further assimilation of the
 immigrant population--generally poorer, less skilled, and less
 educated than average--is increasingly the focus of public
 debate.
 Belgium is a leading advocate of women's rights both within
 the country and in international meetings on the subject. A
 number of commissions have been established to ensure that
 women's rights are protected and to oversee women's education
 and working conditions. To show the importance attached by
 the Government to promoting women's rights internationally, a
 Consultative Commission for the Condition of Women was
 established within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 Physical abuse of women is punishable by law both in theory
 and in practice. Until recently, however, little factual
 evidence was available concerning the extent of abuse.
 According to a 1988 government study, 25 percent of Belgian
 women had encountered some form of physical abuse, while 13
 percent had suffered "moderately serious" physical abuse, and
 3 percent "very serious" abuse. In reaction to the study, the
 Government improved coordination among the various
 institutions involved in combating the abuse of women,
 provided better training to police on domestic and sexual
 violence, and organized an extensive publicity campaign
 designed to raise national awareness about the abuse of women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike.
 With 75 percent of its labor force organized, Belgium is one
 of-the most unionized countries in the world and has a long
 tradition of democratic trade union elections. Labor unions
 striking or protesting government policies or actions are free
 from harassment and persecution.
 Labor unions are strong and independent of the Government but
 have important informal links with and influence on many of
 the major political parties. Unions in Belgium are affiliated
 with the major international bodies representing labor, such
 as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
 the World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is recognized
 and exercised freely. The right to due process and judicial
 review are guaranteed for all protected activity. In the
 first instance, the Labor Court reviews matters relating to
 collective bargaining. Parties then have the right of
 judicial review by the regular courts. Effective mechanisms
 exist for adjudicating disputes between labor and management.

 B fELGIUMh
 There.are no export processing zones, and labor legislation
 and practice are uniform throughout Belgium.
 c'. Prohibition of Forced'or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or c6mpulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not
 occur in Belgium.
 d. Minimum age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 16, and it is
 observed in pracLice.
 .e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Belgian working hours, mandated by law and through collective
 bargaining agreements, are among the shortest in Europe,
 averaging about 38-hours a week. There are provisions for a
 minimum wage, currently $880 per month for full-time workers
 over age 21. This provides an adequate minimum standard of
 living. Workers typically receive at least 4 weeks of
 vacation and a bonus equal to 1 month's wages each year.
 Unemployment benefits are also guaranteed. Government
 policies to promote employment and an extensive system of
 unemployment compensation and other social benefits have
 served to minimize serious individualifinancial hardship.
 Health and safety legislation exists, supplemented by
 collective bargaining agreements. Health and safety
 committees are mandated by law in"companies with more than 50
 employees. The Labor Court monitors compliance with national
 'laws and standards.
