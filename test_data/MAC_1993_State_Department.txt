 MACAU
 Macau, a tiny enclave comprised of a peninsula and two islands on the south
 China coast andencompassing only 6 square miles is recognized by both China and
 Portugal as Chinese territory under Portuguese administration. The "Organic Stat-
 ute" of 1976, which serves as Macau's Constitution, grants it considerable adminis-
 trative, financial, and legislative autonomy. Legislative power is shared by the Por-
 tuguese Government and the territory's Iegislative Assembly. Macau's Governor,
 appointed by the Portuguese President, holds expansive powers under the statute.
 Portuguese metropolitan law serves as the basis for the legal system, which features
 an independent judiciary and jury trials. The police force is firmly under the control
 of the civilian authorities. Macau's economy is fueled by legalized gambling, which
 has produced a thriving tourist industry, and by the export of textiles and other
 light industrial products. With a population of less than half a million people,
 Macau has a per capita gross domestic product of over $13,500.
 Under the 1987 Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, Macau will become a Special
 Administrative Region (SAR) of China on December 20, 1999, and operate under a
 principle of "one country, two systems," to remain unchanged for 50 years. The
 Macau SAR's future Constitution, called the "Basic Law, was promulgated on
 March 31, 1993.
 Citizens of Macau enjoy a wide range of rights and freedoms. The human rights
 provisions of the Portuguese Constitution apply in Macau, while Article 40 of the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has been incorporated into the
 Basic Law. The principal human rights problem in Macau involves the inability of
 citizens to change their government or determine their political future: the Governor
 is appointed by the Portuguese President, only a third of legislators are directly
 elected, and the territory's future path has been set largely by Lisbon and Beijing.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Government authorities do not prac-
 tice these abuses.
 b. Disappearance.-The authorities do not practice or condone secret arrests or
 clandestine confinements.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such abuses are prohibited by law and were not known to occur in 1993.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal prohibitions against arbitrary ar-
 rest exist and are honored. The examining judge, who conducts a pretrial inquiry
 in criminal cases, has a wide range of powers to collect evidence, order or dismiss
 indictments, validate and maintain the detention of suspects, and determine wheth-
 er to release accused persons. Persons remanded in custody must be presented to
 an examining judge within 48 hours of being detained. The accused's counsel may
 examine the evidence. If the judge is not convinced that the evidence is adequate,
 he may dismiss the accused. Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Fair trial is guaranteed and practiced. The courts
 are independent of the executive, and juries determine questions of fact in criminal
 cases. At present, Macau's courts are integrated into the Portuguese judicial system,
 and decisions are appealable to the superior Portuguese courts. Macau's Supreme
 Court established in April, Oives Macau nearly complete judicial autonomy, al-
 though in cases involving "basic rights of the citizen" defendants may appeal to Por-
 tugars Constitutional Court, which may overturn all lower court rulings.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Laws
 provide for the inviolability of the home and of communication, the right of owner-
 ship of private property and of enterprises, and the freedom to marry and raise a
 family. There is no indication of any abuses of these rights by the Government.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press. -Independent or critical opinions receive consist-
 ent airing on radio and television and in public forums. The Government owns a
 majority share of the radio and television service and ensures that all candidates
 receive equal time during election campaigns. However, freedom of the press is more
 restricted. Most of Macau's newspapers are _pro-China publications that do not give
 equal coverage to liberal and prodemocracy forces. Self-censorship is growing among
 newspaper reporters, some of whom express fears that they will lose their jobs if
 they criticize China or government policy. The academic community is free to ex-
 press its views, though some academics report that they avoid research on topics
 that entail criticism of China.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Legal guarantees of these free-
 doms are largely observed. However, the Government restricts demonstrations to a
 limited number of "approved locations" with sufficient space to accommodate the
 crowds and continues to ban any protests within 50 meters of government buildings.
 This ban effectively excludes demonstrations from the city center and relegates
 them to the outlying islands.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Macau is a predominantly Buddhist society. Members of
 other religions exist and practice their religion freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement within the enclave; emigration
 and foreign travel are unlimited. The Government reports that about 105,000 of
 Macau's 400,000 inhabitants have the right of abode in Portugal.
 The Government's official policy since 1982 has been to refuse asylum to all Viet-
 namese boat people arriving in Macau waters and redirect them to nearby Hong
 Kong territorial waters. There were no arrivals of boat people in Macau in 1993.
 While awaiting third-country resettlement, the 10 remaining boat people in Macau
 live in public housing and work in the local economy.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have only a limited ability to change their government. In a by-election
 in the summer of 1992, 6 members were added to the legislative assembly (2 ap-
 pointed, 2 elected, 2 indirectly elected through functional constituencies). The 23-
 member Legislative Assemly is composed of 8 members elected in universal, direct
 elections; 8 indirectly electedby local community interests; and 7 appointed by the
 Governor. The Consultative Council, an advisory group to the Governor composed
 of elected and appointed members, also provides some measure of popular represen-
 tation. The Government, by tradition, also consults informally on a regular basis
 with local business and cultural leaders.
 Although women traditionally have played a minor role in local political life, they
 increasingly are being found in senior positions throughout the administration. A
 woman is the President of the Legislative Assembly, the second most senior position
 in Macau after the Governor, and the Under Secretary for Health and Social Affairs
 is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International Nongovernmental Inves-
 tigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Lcal human rights organizations operate freely in Macau. The Government re-
 ceived an Amnesty International delegation sent to study a final draft of the Basic
 Law.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women are becoming more active and visible in business and govern-
 ment, and some enjoy considerable influence and responsibility in these areas. Anec-
 dotal information indicates women do not receive equal pay for equal work, but firm
 statistical evidence on this issue is not available.
 Cases of violence against women are not common. For cases that are reported,
 Macau's criminal statutes prohibiting domestic violence are enforced and violators
 prosecuted. Police and doctors report abuses to the Social Welfare Department,
 which investigates them. If hospital treatment is required, a medical social worker
 counsels the victim and informs her about social welfare services. Until their com-
 plaints are resolved, battered women may be placed in public housing, but no facili-
 ties are reserved especially for them.
 Children.-Child abuse and exploitation are not widespread problems in Macau.
 While some funds for children's welfare and protection services are provided by the
 Government, most such services are provided by nongovernmental entities such as
 churches and community organizations. Moreover, the Government has not promul-
 gated any statutes specifically to protect the rights of children, relying on the gen-
 eral framework of civil and political rights legislation to protect all citizens.
 National/RacialEthnic Minorities.-Freedom from discrimination is gtaranteed
 by law. However, in practice Macau's governmental and legal systems place a pre-
 mium on knowledge of the Portuguese angage, which is spoken by less than 4 per-
 cent of the population. Thus, about 60 percent of the approximately 130 senior gay-
 ernment officials come from aortual. Most of the other middle and upper ranking
 civil servants are Macanese-Eurasmans of Chinese and Portuguese descent. There is
 significant public pressure for the Government to speed up the process of making
 the civil service mrec representative of the population. In January the Government
 gave the Chinese language official status andthe same legal force as Portuguese.
 
 
 1012
 People with Disabilities.-The extent to which physically disabled persons are dis-
 criminated against in employment, education, and the provision of state services is
 not known. There does not appear to be much governmental concern about the sub-
 ject, and there is little funding for special programs aimed at helping the physically
 and mentally disabled gain better access to employment, education, and public fa-
 cilities. Accessibility for the disabled has not been mandated legislatively or other-
 wise.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Macau labor law recognizes the right and freedom
 of all workers to form and join trade unions and of private sector unions to strike.
 The Government neither impedes the formation of trade unions nor discriminates
 against union members. A garbage strike was the only major strike in 1993. The
 police are legally prohibited from striking but occasionally engage in massive "job
 actions" which are strikes in all but name.
 Local trade union activities, including the selection of union leadership, are heav-
 ily influenced by mainland Chinese interests, which stress the importance of stabil-
 ity and minimum disruption of the work force. Nearly all of Macau's 7,000 private
 sector union members belong to a pro-China labor confederation. Many local observ-
 ers claim that this organization is more interested in furthering the Chinese politi-
 cal agenda in Macau than in addressing classic trade union issues. A few private
 sector unions and two of the four public sector unions are outside of Chinese control.
 Macau unions may freely form federations and affiliate with international bodies.
 Three civil service unions are affiliated with the major non-Communist Portuguese
 Union Confederation, which itself has international labor ties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions tend to resemble local
 traditional neighborhood associations, promoting social and cultural activities rather
 than issues relating to the workplace. Local customs, moreover, normall*y favor em-
 ployment without the benefit of written labor contracts-except in the case of impor-
 tation of labor from China. Reflecting influence by China, unions traditionally have
 not attempted to engage in collective bargaining. While Portuguese laws protecting
 collective bargaining apply to Macau, the Government does not impede or discour-
 age it.
 There are no government mechanisms to promote voluntary negotiations.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination, and there were no complaints about
 it in 1993.
 There are no export processing zones in Macau.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is illegal and
 does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Minors under the age of 15 are
 forbidden to work except in businesses operated by their families. The law is en-
 forced by the Macau Labor Department, which refers offending employers to the ju-
 dicial authorities for prosecution. The Labor Department claims that the incidence
 of child labor has declined radically since effective enforcement began in 1985. There
 were two prosecutions for child labor violations in 1992.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In the absence of any statutory minimum wage
 or publicly administered social security program, some large companies have pro-
 vided private welfare and security packages. Calls for labor reform, medical insur-
 ance, a social security system, and increases in employee compensation figure regu-
 larly in political campaign platforms. To offset a current labor shortage, the Govern-
 ment allows the importation of labor from China under contract, while at the same
 time imposing heavy fines on employers harboring illegal immigrants. Roughly
 12,000 imported Chinese laborers are now in Macau, most of them working on con-
 struction of the new airport. The number of imported workers in other jobs totals
 between 2,000 and 3,000 out of an estimated work force of 195,000.
 Labor legislation provides for a 48-hour workweek, an 8-hour workday, overtime,
 annual leave, medical and maternity care, and employee compensation insurance.
 The Department of Labor provides assistance and legal advice to workers on request
 but government enforcement of labor laws is lax because of limited resources.
 Laws on occupational safety and health are enforced by the Department of Labor,
 which reported 1,171 infractions of occupational safety and health laws through
 mid-November, mostly in the construction sector. Failure to correct infractions leads
 to government prosecution.
