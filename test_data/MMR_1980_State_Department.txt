 BURMA
 The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma is the largest
 country in mainland Southeast Asia. It is governed under a
 constitution promulgated in 1974 which established a one-
 party parliamentary system with parallel government and
 party structures and a state-run economy.
 The dominant political figure in Burma is President U Ne
 Win, who has controlled the government since 1962, when
 he overthrew then Prime Minister U Nu in a military coup.
 Following the 1962 coup, opponents of the revolutionary
 government and regional separatists were jailed, generally
 without trial. Other political opponents of the revo-
 lutionary government went into exile abroad. Most of the
 jailed persons were released in the late 1960's and early
 1970's.
 A process of gradual relaxation of government restrictions
 and reduction in reported abuses of human rights began about
 1978 and has continued through 1980. This process accompanied
 the improvements in relations with neighboring and regional
 countries, confinement of the troubling insurgencies to the
 border areas, and improved economic performance. Criticism
 of government policy, however, is still limited to that
 voiced within the party/government structure. Criticism of
 the government outside of this structure is not tolerated.
 Although Burma is a poor nation in terms of per capita
 income, it is self-sufficient in food and petroleum.
 The government's comnitment to development has assured
 access to basic requirements for most of the population,
 and economic reforms of the past seven years have produced
 noticeable progress in rice production and overall gross
 domestic product growth.
 In May 1980, President U Ne Win offered a pardon to exiles
 and insurgents who returned to Burma or surrendered within
 90 days. Almost 2,200 accepted this offer. He also
 announced an amnesty for political prisoners and convicted
 criminals, under which more that 15,000 were released from
 jail. Awards and pensions were provided to many, including
 political dissidents who had contributed to the Burmese
 independence movement and post-independence development.
 President U Ne Win also invited former Prime Minister U Nu,
 who had been living in India,-to return to live in Burma.
 U Nu accepted, and arrived in Rangoon July 29. There is no
 evidence yet that the amnesty and associated actions signal
 any fundamental change in the government's displeasure with
 public dissent.
 1.  Respect for the ntegrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Persistent but unconfirmed reports suggest that the security
 arms of the government have used and continue to use physical
 and psychological coercion, including torture, during
 investigation of cases involving national security, major
 organized crime (including narcotics trafficking), and
 political opposition. Amnesty International in its 1980
 report states it received reports of imprisonment and
 torture of "actual and alleged members of the opposition".

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Apart from the use of torture in interrogations and pre-
 ferential treatment accorded political prisoners, there
 is no confirmation of any intentional pattern of cruel,
 degrading or discriminatory treatment or punishment.
 In part because of the general low standard of living,
 conditions in Burmese prisons are poor. Prisons are
 overcrowded. Diet and medical attention- are limited.
 In addition to standard prisons, the government has
 established a system of work camps to which convicts are
 assigned for manual labor, including road-building and
 quarry work. A system of temporary paroles permits convicts
 with good records to make short visits home from these
 camps. Summary executions and corporal punishment are not
 mandated under the Burmese judicial system. No death
 sentences are known to have been carried out during the
 past year, although capital punishment is permitted under
 Burmese law.
 c. Disappearances
 Although the government exercises broad powers of detention
 no recent cases are known of persons being held secretly or
 having "disappeared" for protracted periods or of attempts
 to hide arrests from family members or friends.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 A 1975 anti-subversion law permits indefinite detention.
 The Burmese government neither acknowledges holding
 political prisoners nor feels compelled to justify detention
 or imprisonment of any individual or class of individuals.
 The exact number of political prisoners held at any given
 time is uncertain; some persons whose activities may have
 been considered political have also been charged with
 criminal offenses or with inciting violence; others have
 been released without trial.
 The amnesty announced in May 1980 apparently resulted in
 the release of some persons who had been imprisoned on
 criminal charges but whose offenses appeared to have some
 political basis. At present, the number of political
 prisoners in Burma is unknown, but since the amnesty,
 which was to free all political prisoners then being held,
 it is believed to be very low.'
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Article 101(F) of the 1974 constitution provides for
 public trials. A limited number of cases involving intelli-
 gence or politically sensitive crimes are tried in camera
 and are closed to the public. The burden of proof is on
 the prosecution and the accused has the right to an attorney.
 Justice is administered by a system of people's courts with
 the right to appeal to higher levels (up to the National
 Council of People's Justices). Most judges are lay persons
 untrained in the law who are selected by the party.
 Courts are advised by professional legal officers, some
 of who are former judges.
 Court decisions are not determined solely by the codified
 law but are also affected by Burmese concepts of community
 harmony, and fair play, as well as by Burmese socialist
 concepts.

 In normal practice, defendants can consult freely and
 privately with their lawyers, and defendants and defense
 lawyers are aware of the charges and evidence against them
 and are permitted to submit their own evidence. There have
 been some allegations that this is not always the case.
 In some political cases judgments and sentences apparently
 have been influenced by the government. Civilians, even
 when charged with security offenses, are tried by the
 people's courts rather than by courts martial.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Article 160 of the 1974 constitution guarantees the
 privacy and security of the home. This right, however, is
 frequently abridged in practice. Local authorities
 regularly search and inspect homes for unauthorized
 residents.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Burma has a per capita income of approximately $150 per
 year. Burma is, however, self-sufficient in both food
 production and energy and exported both rice and a minor
 amount of petroleum during the past year.
 Throughout the 1960's and early 1970's, the government,
 pursuing the "Burmese Road to Socialism", achieved a
 substantial redistribution of wealth and the accompanying
 expansion of government services inhibited the formation
 of capital necessary for rapid economic growth.
 n recent years, however, stringent economic reforms (such
 as placing state corporations on a commercial footing) and
 inputs of multilateral and bilateral assistance have
 resulted in an average 6 percent yearly real growth rate.
 Production increases have occurred in almost all sectors
 of the economy since 1976. In particular, rice production
 (Burma's economic mainstay) has increased 20 percent in the
 last four years.
 The Burmese government's egalitarian approach to develop-
 ment has assured access to basic requirements for most of
 the population. Government economic policies through the
 1960's and 1970's have largely eliminated extreme income
 differentials, both between city and countryside and among
 city and rural families, although average incomes are still
 quite low. The consumer price index is expected to show a
 6.6 percent increase from 1979 to 1980, after declining 6.1
 percent from 1978 to 1979. Per capita income is expected
 to increase 8.1 percent, from $148 to $160 (in current
 dollars).
 As of 1974, 67 percent of the Burmese population was able to
 read and write. Education is free through university level.
 Access to higher education (beyond secondary schools) is
 controlled by a system of examinations.
 Adequate shelter is a problem only in the larger urban
 areas, where construction of new housing has not kept
 pace with population growth, and in very remote and econo-
 mically depressed hill areas.
 A basic level of health care is available throughout
 the country, through a system of hospitals and clinics.
 Graduates from the Institutes of Medicine enter the
 
 
 569
 government's health service and are available for assignment
 in rural or urban areas, depending upon the needs of the
 area. Lack of resources, however, limits the effectiveness
 of health care in both rural and urban areas. The Burmese
 government has recently begun a program to facilitate the
 expansion of rural health care services.
 Several government development projects, some of which
 are receiving bilateral and multilateral foreign assistance,
 have been undertaken to provide water for both personal use
 and irrigation during the dry season.
 The right to own property is established by law, although
 under the constitution (and in accordance with traditional
 custom) the state retatns residual rights to the disposition
 of land. In practice, these residual rights have not affected
 the right of rural Burmese to work their own land.
 Women in Burma are permitted to and do own property, attend
 higher education, enter professions, and engage in business
 on almost the same basis as men. Women are under-represented
 in politics'and senior levels of government, reflecting in
 part the military origin of most Burmese leaders.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 All mass media, including the recently inaugurated tele-
 vision broadcasting system, are government-owned and
 controlled. Journalists are subject to strict guidelines
 as to what can be broadcast or published, especially
 regarding political matters. All forms of communications -
 imported and domestic books and periodicals, stage plays,
 motion pictures, musical recordings -- are subjec" to
 censorship. Public criticism of the government'c Leadership
 is not tolerated. Government control over literature
 published in Burma was strengthened during 1980 with the
 founding of a nationwide literary workers' organization,
 intended to include all writers who seek publication.
 Political assembly and organizing are permitted only
 within the framework of the ruling Burma Socialist Programme
 Party (BSPP) and the associated mass organizations.
 These party-sponsored workers', peasants' and youth
 organizations provide some opportunity for ordinary
 citizens to express themselves politically but serve
 primarily as vehicles for communicating national policies
 and implementing government programs. Secular organizations
 not approved by the government are banned.
 Freedom of religion, guaranteed in the 1974 constitution,
 is widely observed in Burma, a largely Buddhist country with
 sizeable Christian, Muslim and animist minorities.
 The government strengthened its links with and control
 over Buddhist monks by forming a national Buddhist clergy,
 instituting regulations requiring certification of monks
 by religious superiors and the government, and the issuance
 of identification and residence cards by the government --
 a system that imposes residence and movement controls on
 monks similar to those imposed on the rest of the population.
 
 
 570
 
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The 1974 constitution guarantees the right of Burmese
 citizens to live anywhere within Burma. Exceptions apply
 to areas of insurgent or military activity. Both citizens
 and non-citizen residents of Burma are subject to travel
 restrictions and controls and must obtain permission to
 travel and to stay outside of the township of their
 residence.
 Foreign travel is difficult, except for official purposes.
 Emigration is permitted; the formidable bureaucratic and
 legal requirements for permission to travel abroad have been
 slightly streamlined during the past year. Prospective
 emigrants must reimburse the government for their university
 and professional education.
 The amnesty announced in May 1980 permitted Burmese exiles
 living abroad to return to Burma. Many prominent former
 politicians and insurgents took advantage of this offer.
 In a related offer, Burmese President U Ne Win invited
 former Prime Minister U Nu to return to live in Burma, an
 offer which U Nu accepted. These steps continue the process
 of relaxing past policies which at one time virtually
 prohibited the return of Burmese-born emigres.
 Burma has not permitted the resettlement or the granting
 of safe haven within Burma to foreign refugees. There
 appears to be no significant outflow of refugees from Burma,
 except when groups of insurgents temporarily cross to Thai-
 land to avoid Burmese military operations.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The government of Burma is an authoritarian one-party
 system with the leadership drawn largely from the military
 officer corps. The single party is known as the Burma
 Socialist Programme Party (BSPP). No other political groups
 are permitted. Political opposition is not tolerated.
 Although Burma has universal suffrage, the BSPP chooses the
 only slate of candidates.
 Occasionally the BSPP nominates non-party candidates.
 Participation in the BSPP is open to all adult citizens
 who meet candidacy requirements. Less than five percent
 of the adult population are full party members. Party
 membership is virtually a prerequisite for many government
 jobs. The party mechanism provides for modest political
 participation by an individual and allows limited self-
 criticism of bureaucratic failures.
 There are hundreds of thousands of non-citizen residents
 of Burma, primarily of Chinese or Indian origin. Those
 holding foreign citizenship and proper documentation are
 eligible for registration as legal alien residents of Burma.
 Those lacking documentation are subject to deportation.
 Resident aliens are not eligible to attend graduate and
 professional schools, to join consumer's cooperatives,
 or to take certain categories of employment. Internal
 travel of aliens is restricted. A new citizenship law which
 may affect the status of resident aliens is under consider-
 ation.
 
 
 571
 An unknown but considerable number of residents of Burma
 neither have Burmese citizenship nor can obtain official
 documentation from another country. They are usually not
 able to emigrate, as Burma does not normally recognize
 stateless documentation for exit purposes.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In the past, the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma
 has not responded directly to the rare foreign comment on
 alleged human rights violations in Burma. There were no
 inquiries or requests to visit Burma by non-governmental
 human rights organizations during 1980.
