 ESTONIA
 Regaining its independence in 1991 after more than 50 years of Soviet occupation,
 Estonia moved in 1992 to reestablish itself as a sovereign, independent, an demo-
 cratic state.
 Estonia is a parliamentary democracy. For the first half of 1992, the highest legis-
 lative authority was the Supreme Council, the Chairman of whose Presidium served
 as Head of State. A Prim Minister was elected by the Supreme Council to serve
 as the chief executive official. Day-to-day government operations were the respon-
 sibility of the Council of Ministers, elected by the Supreme Council and directed by
 the Prime Minister.
 The new Constitution, adoted by referendum on June 28, established a 101-mem-
 ber unicameral legislature ( tate Assembly), a Prime Minister as head of govern-
 ment, employment and thea      t      and fair elections were held on Septem-
 
 
 763
 ber 20 for the State Assembly and the President. Because none of the four can-
 didates for President received a majority, the State Assembly, as prescribed by the
 Constitutional Enabling Act, elected Lennart Meri as President on October 5.
 Estonia insists that all Russian and Commonwealth of Independent States' mill-
 tary forces should leave the country by the summer of 1993. Estonia and the Rus-
 sian Federation have not yet reached agreement on a timetable for the withdrawal
 of these troops. All borders came entirely under Estonian control.
 Estonia is gradually transforming the centrally planned economy it inherited into
 a market-oriented system. The most difficult problems resulted from the collapse of
 the trading network that existed in the Soviet Union, which has meant that Estonia
 has had to identify new sources of fuel and new markets. Estonia has been surpris-
 ingly successful, however, in finding Western markets, to which approximately two-
 thirds of its exports are now directed. There has also been rising unemployment,
 although the level remained manageable. Estonia introduced its own internationally
 convertible currency in June-the first attempt by a former Soviet republic to break
 out of the ruble zone. The currency has been remarkably stable. Parliament adopted
 large-scale privatization legislation in August.
 The treatment of members of minorities, particularly ethnic Russians, attracted
 the greatest human rights attention, with the major focus on the question of citizen-
 ship. On February 28, the then Parliament brought the 1938 citizenship law into
 effect, which meant that only those qualifying under its provisions were considered
 citizens, i.e., those who were citizens bfore June 16, 1940, and their direct descend-
 ants. This law also provides for naturalization of aliens upon application after com-
 pleting a 2-year residency requirement, followed by a 1-year waiting period, and
 demonstrating a knowledge of the Estonian language. Consequently, most nonethnic
 Estonian residents, approximately 38 percent of the total population, could not qual-
 ify for citizenship at the time of the constitutional referendum and the nationwide
 parliamentary erections. This exclusion from the national elections caused the Rus-
 sian Federation and members of the Russian-speaking community to criticize Esto-
 nia for what they perceived as an attempt to limit the influence of the large Slavic
 minority through restrictive citizenship laws. In the wake of this and other criti-
 cism, Estonia on September 28 invited the Conference on Security and Cooperation
 in Europe's (CSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to send
 a fact-finding mission to assess Estonia's compliance with human rights standards.
 This mission began its survey in early December and the final report, which will
 be distributed to all CSCE member states, is expected to be issued in mid-January
 1993.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known instances of
 such killing in 1992.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known instances of abductions or disappear-
 ances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such practices are prohibited by law. The harsh treatment of prisoners during both
 interrogation and confinement, physical and psychological abuse, overcrowding, and
 detention under extremely unhealthful conditions that were the rule during the So-
 viet period were alleviated to some extent. The Government continues to address
 the question of how prisoners are housed and treated and, in response to a highly
 critical report by an international human rights group, destroyed the small cells
 previously used for solitary confinement of prisoners in detention in the Tallinn
 prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and laws forbid arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile. There were no known instances of Estonian authori-
 ties' engaging in such activities. Under the new Constitution, warrants issued by
 a court are required to make an arrest (previously warrants could be issued by
 prosecutors). Detainees must be promptly informed of the grounds for the arrest and
 given immediate access to legal counsel. If a person cannot afford counsel, the State
 will provide one. A person may be held for 48 hours without formally being charged;
 further detention requires a court order. A person may be held in pretrial detention
 for 2 months; this may be extended up to a total of 9 months by a court order. Occa-
 sional violations of these norms are the result of a poorly trained police force which
 is being rebuilt and reorganized in the post-Soviet context. Criminal procedure and
 the rights of defendants are part of the curriculum at the Estonian Public Safety
 Academy that trains supervisory police officers. A revised Code of Criminal Proce-
 
 
 764
 dure, adopted by Parliament in May, went into effect on July 1. It clarifies criminal
 law procedure and provides explicit protections for suspects in criminal cases.
 In April an international human ifhts group criticized the condition of prison fa-
 cilities. While acknowledKing that prions are ovecrowded, undermaintained, and in
 a general state of disrepair, the Government said it lacked the resources to upgrade
 and expand prison facilities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The Constitution establishes a three-tiered court
 system for Estonia's independent judiciary rural and city courts, district courts, and
 the national court. The district and national courts are also courts for -constitu-
 tional supervision." At the rural-city level, court decisions are based on majority
 rule, with ajudge and two lay judges sitting injudgment.
 The Constitution provides that court hearings shall be public but may be closed
 by the court for specific reasons, such as protection of state or business secrets or
 the interests of juveniles. It further provides that defendants may present witnesses
 and evidence as well as confront and cross-examine government witnesses. Defend-
 ants have access to government evidence and enjoy a presum on of innocence. The
 judicial reform law is to go into effect on January 1, 1993, but it is possible that
 fmal implementation could be delayed by about 6 months because of the difficulty
 in filling all vacant judgeships in time.
 Estonia has started to overhaul its criminal and civil procedural codes. As a first
 step, on June 1 a new but interim criminal code went into effect that basically r!-
 vised the Soviet Criminal Code, for example, eliminating political and economic
 crimes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Hor. or Correspondence.-Esto-
 nian law requires a search warrant for search and seizure of property. During the
 investigative stage, warrants are issued by the procurator upon a showing of prob-
 able cause. Once a case has gone to court, warrants are issued by the court. The
 Constitution guarantees secrecy of the mail, telegrams, telephones, and other means
 of communication. Police must obtain a court order to intercept a person's commu-
 nications, and illegally obtained evidence is not admissible in court
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Estonians legally enjoy wide and constitu-
 tionally guarantee freedom of speech, although the media are relatively restrained
 in practice. The press and broadcast media criticize the Government, although indi-
 viduals are rarely singled out because of harsh libel laws that put the burden of
 proof on the media. There is no evidence of punishment or threat of punishment for
 expressing antigovernment sentiment. Due mainly to journalists' opposition, the
 Government has not yet passed a media law.
 Although the application of the libel laws remains unclear, in one precedent-set-
 ting case a politican sued the newspaper Eesti Express for referring to the politi-
 cian's alleged past with the Committee for State Security (KGB). The court decided
 in favor of the politician because the newspaper was unable to provide supporting
 documentation.
 With a long tradition of newspaper reading, many Estenians follow three or four
 different Estonian dailies. The most widely read papera a!e Rahva Haal Postimees,
 and Molodyozh Estonii. Foreign newspapers and magines are readily available
 but are very expensive for most Estonians.
 Newsprint, printing facilities, and distribution are still usually provided by the
 State. There is no indication hat the State has used this control to influence the
 print media, although there may be an inherent risk of a chillin effect.
 State broadcast media continue to get large subsidies, but there are now several
 independent radio stations and newspapers throughout the country. The state tele-
 vision company continues to fund the retransmission of three Russian-language
 channels from Russia.
 b. Freedom of Peacefl Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble freely. Permits for all pubic gatherings mst be obtained 3
 weeks prior to the date of the public gathering. The authorities have wide discretion
 to prohibit such gatherings on public safety grounds but seldom exercise it. Numer-
 ous mass gatherings and political rallies took place peacefully in 1992 without gov-
 ernment interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedm of conscience and freedm of religious pros-
 elytism are guaranteed by law and honored in practice. Ter were no known   -
 stances of discrimination based on religious belief. There is no state church
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Countr, Foreign Travel, Emigra tion, and Re-
 patriation.-The law permits free movement within the country, and wits honored
 i practice. Estonan law guarantees the right of foreign travel, emigratiounand pr-
 natriation for Estonian citizens. Estoha beuan  i sui g l asspors to is citizens in

 July. The Government decided to continue to honor the red Soviet external pass-
 ports of all residents in the country until September 1, 1993. While the Estonian
 Government did not pass laws defining the status of resident aliens nor issue its
 noncitizens Estonian travel documents during 1992, no restrictions were placed on
 their right to foreign travel, emigration, or repatriation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Estonian citizens approved the new Constitution and the concomitant Enabling
 Act in a referendum on June 28. This Constitution, drafted by a constitutional as-
 sembly composed of members of the Supreme Council and the Congress of Estonia
 (representing the citizens of the pre-1940 Estonian Republic and their descendants),
 established a parliamentary form of government with a 101-member legislature
 (State Assembly), a Prime Minister elected by the Parliament as head of govern-
 ment, and a President as head of state. While the Constitution provided for the
 State Assembly to elect the President, the Enabling Act provided that the first
 President should be elected by popular vote. If no presidential candidate received
 an absolute majority in the popular vote, then the State Assembly would choose be.
 tween the top two contenders. Estonia's voters went to the polls on September 20
 to elect the first post-Soviet State Assembly from over 600 candidates representing
 various political parties or no party. Four candidates ran for the Presidency, but
 none received the required absolute majority. The new State Assembly met for the
 first time on October 5 and elected Lennart Meri as President.
 The issue of citizenship remained at the center of political debate in 1992. Persons
 who took up residence in Estonia after the Soviet occupation in 1940 and their de-
 scendants were not permitted to participate in the constitutional referendum or the
 elections. They also, under the law, do not have the right to an Estonian passport
 because they are not citizens. They enjoy internationally recognized rights, such as
 civil liberties and the right to own property (except land), and, in accordance with
 the Constitution, may participate in local elections if they are permanent residents.
 However, permanent residency is not defined in Estonian law.
 In February the Supreme Council (the then legislature) adopted a law to imple-
 ment the 1938 citizenship law that had been reactivated in November 1991. This
 citizenship law also covered naturalization requirements, including, inter alia, a 2-
 year residency requirement to be followed by a 1-year waiting period as well as
 knowledge of the Estonian language. The implementation law provided that the 2-
 year residency requirement for naturalization could be met by residency starting on
 March 30, 1990 Thus, any noncitizen who had resided in Estonia since that date
 was eligible to apply for Estonian citizenship as of March 30 1992. The 1-year wait-
 ing period would make them eligible for naturalization on March 30, 1993. By the
 end of the year, a little over 5,000 people had been naturalized, with about another
 1 000 having completed applications and awaiting processing. The law allows the
 dovernment to waive requirements for applicants who are ethnic Estonians or who
 have performed valuable service to Estonia.
 Article 16 of the Citizenship Law Implementation Act provides that applications
 for naturalization shall not be accepted from "(1) foreign military personnel on ac-
 tive service; (2) persons who have been in the employment of the security and intel-
 ligence organizations of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; (3) persons who
 have been convicted of serious criminal offenses against persons or who have a
 criminal record of repeated convictions for felonies; and (4) persons lacking a legal
 steady income.
 In May the City Council of Narva, a town with only a 4-peicent Estonianpopu-
 lation, began a camp sign to collect signatures for a referendum on the city's future
 status without spec   g the nature of the question to be put before the local voters.
 In September the City Council; unable to agree on the text, established a task force
 to work out the proposed language. In addition, a group of noncitizen leaders pro-
 posed the election of an assembly in early 1993 to represent the interests of
 noncitizens at the national lerel.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on the formation or functioning of human rights organi-
 zations in Estonia. In response to criticism about the treatment of ethnic minorities
 in Estonia, President Meri established a Human Rights Institute that convened for
 the first time on December 10. The purpose of the Institute is to follow the situation
 with respect to individual and collective human rights in Estonia and to provide in-
 formation to the international community. A number of international bodies and or-
 ganizations sent observers to Estonia during the 1992 elections. In addition, there
 
 
 766
 were visits by human rights organizations, and Estonia received a delegation from
 the Council of Europe.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sm Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is prohibited by the
 Constitution.
 Relationships between Estonians and the large ethnic Russian population in Esto-
 nia, however, remain tense. During the years of forcible incorporation into the So-
 viet Union, large numbers of non-Estnians, predominantly Russians, emigrated to
 Estonia both on a permanent and temporary basis to work as laborers and adminis-
 trators. These people and their descendants now make up approximately one-third
 of the total population. (About 8 percent of the population of the pre-1940 republic
 consisted of Russians.)
 Non-Esto*nian, especially Russians, continued to allege job, salary, and housing
 discriminaton based on Estoman-lang"ge requirements for certain jobs. They are
 fearful that laws may be adopted that discriminate against noncitizens during this
 period when they have no representation in the legislature. (See Section 3 for dis-
 cussion of citizenship and naturalization laws.) Estonian law makes no distinction
 on citizenship or other such grounds as to who may enter into business or own prop-
 erty (other than land). All residents of Estonia may participate equally in the pri-
 vatization of state-owned housing.
 Estonian language training is readily accessible. It is not clear, however, how the
 Estonian-lan$uage requirement will be implemented for those applicants seeking
 Estonian citizenship. According to the 1989 language law, Estonian-language re-
 uirements to be implemented over a transition period of 4 years were set out for
 those employed in government offices and in the service sector. These provisions are
 supposed to go into effect on February 1, 1993. Nevertheless, in districts where the
 language of more than one-half of the population is a language other than Estonian,
 the inhabitants are entitled to receive official information in that language, and the
 local government may conduct business in that language.
 There are less than 6,000 Jews in Estonia, most of them Russians who fled anti-
 Semitic repression in the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. The Estonian Jew-
 ish Society was reestablished in March 1988 to promote the social and cultural life
 that existed during the period between the two World Wars. There are several reli-
 gious schools, and Jewish papers are published in both Estonian and Russian. Al-
 though Jewish leaders do not consider anti-Semitism to be a serious problem, there
 were a number of anti-Semitic incidents in 1992, including desecration of two Jew-
 ish cemeteries. The Government has condemned these acts, and police investiga-
 tions are being conducted.
 Women possess the same legal rights as men and are legally entitled to equal pay
 for equal work. Although they carry major household responsibilities in addition to
 their employment burden, they have not publicized their complaints.
 Statistics on violence against women are not available, and there is little public
 discussion of the subject. Women's rights groups thus far have not been notably ac-
 tive or effective in asserting women's rights.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The new Estonian Constitution garantees the right
 to form and join freely a union or employee association. The Central Organization
 of Estonian Trade Unions (EAKL) came into being as a wholly voluntary and purely
 Estonian organization in 1990 to replace the Estonian branih of the ofiial Soviet
 labor confederation (AUCCTU). Workers were given a choice as to whether or not
 they wanted to join the EAKL While in 1990 the Soviet labor confederation claimed
 to represent 800,000 members in Estonia, in 1992 EAKL claimed to represent about
 500,000 members, organzed in 30 unions. In January Estonia rejoined the Inter-
 national Labor Organization. In late spring, a political warning strike was organized
 at the electric generator plants in Narva without government interferenc.
 There is a legal right to strike, and the unions are independent of the Govern-
 ment and political parties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectely.-Whie Estonian workers now
 have the right to bargain collectively, collective bargaining is still in its infancy. The
 Government remains by far the biggest employer, with 80 percent of the work force.
 According to EAKL leaders, the distinction between management and labor is not
 widely understood, and few collective agreements have been concluded between the
 management and workers of a specific enterprise. The EAKL has, however, con-
 cluded framework agreements with producer associations which it ho  will pro-
 vide the basis for specific labor agreements. The EAL was also involved with d-
 welon w Eswtnnia'a new Labor Cndi. coverinv emolnvment contrcts vacation, and c
 
 
 767
 cuptiona safety. The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employ-
 ees have the right to go to court to enforce their rights.
 No export processing zones have been established.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by' the Constitution and is not known to occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to labor law prevailing
 in Estonia, the statutory minimum age for employment is 16. Minors aged 13 to 15
 may work with written permission of a parent or guardian and the local labor in-
 spector, if working is not dangerous to the minor's health, considered immoral, or
 interferes with studies, and provided that the type of work is included on a list the
 Government is expected to prepare. State authorities effectively enforce minimum
 age laws through nspecions...
 e. Atceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government, after consultations with the
 EAKL and the Central Producers Union, sets the minimum wage and reviews it
 monthly. However, the minimum wag is not sufficient to provide a worker and
 family a decent standard of living. Under Estonian law, the standard workweek is
 limited to 41 hours. The average workweek is 40 hours for most white-collar work-
 ers and 41 hours for most blue-collar workers. According to EAKL sources, legal oc-
 cupational health and safety standards are satisfactory, but they are extremely dif-
 ficult to achieve in practice. The overriding concern of workers during the period of
 transition to a market economy is to hold on to their jobs and receive adequate pay.
