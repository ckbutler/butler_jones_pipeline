 AFGHANISTAN
 Human rights in Afghanistan must be seen in the context of
 the bitter war in which a highly independent people is
 pitted against a powerful and determined invader. The
 Soviet Union seeks not only to dominate Afghanistan stra-
 tegically with its 90,000-man expeditionary force, but also
 to reshape this traditional Muslim society into the Soviet
 mold. To achieve this purpose the Soviets are using not
 only military force and control of a pervasive secret
 police network, but also a comprehensive program aimed at
 indoctrinating the younger generation through large-scale
 and long-term educational programs in the Soviet Union.
 These efforts are accepted in Afghanistan by.a small
 minority of hard-core communist sympathizers. They are
 rejected, however, by the vast majority of Afghans, whose
 resistance, both active and passive, has fueled the continuing,
 devastating conflict. The Afghan war has caused enormous
 physical damage to the country and inflicted great hardship
 on the general populace.
 Wanton brutality and summary executions continue under the
 present regime, although probably at a lower level than
 during the two preceeding Marxist regimes of Taraki and
 Amin. At the same time, the scope and efficiency of Babrak's
 secret police operations are increasing in areas of the
 country under government control (chiefly the cities). The
 regime has developed more technical and human means with
 which to restrict freedom of expression and assembly and is
 using these tools to create a pervasive atmosphere of
 suspicion and fear in the cities and towns which it controls.
 The sanctity of the home is being systematically violated as
 the army and secret police search for arms caches, new
 recruits, and political opponents.
 In the' countryside, where the regime's control is generally
 minimal or nonexistent, a different order of human rights
 violations are occurring. The population in war zones
 suffers loss of life and property from being caught in
 crossfires, from increasingly frequent reprisals by regime
 and Soviet forces, and from sometimes forcible exactions by
 the resistance. In other areas, the disruption of agricul-
 tural production or of food supply lines has forced
 local inhabitants to seek uncertain refuge in the cities
 and towns. Many Afghans believe that the regime and the
 Soviet occupiers hope to subdue the rural resistance to them
 through a grim process of attrition.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Refugees frequently refer to torture by the Afghan security
 services in recounting their own experiences, and those
 of relatives and friends, in Afghan prisons. For example,
 an Afghan who was detained at Kabul's Pol-e-Charkhi prison
 in mid-1981 has reported being hung upside down for an
 extended period of time, and seeing and hearing other
 detainees undergoing torture as well. In August 1981, a
 second Kabul resident reported seeing his brother in a
 semi-conscious state at secret police headquarters with
 (921)
 
 
 922
 his face distorted by swelling and his hands and legs
 trussed behind him. There also are reports that Soviet
 security officers have used electric shock torture in
 interrogating Afghan detainees in whom they have taken an
 interest.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are reports that summary execution of prisoners taken
 by the government continues at a high rate, although probably
 less frequently under the Babrak regime than under either of
 the two preceeding Marxist governments. On several occasions
 in the past year, the official press has reported the
 execution of persons found guilty of attacks on government
 officials or installations very shortly after such attacks
 took place. It seems unlikely that those deemed guilty of
 these offenses were given an adequate opportunity to defend
 themselves. There are also occasional reports of assassi-
 nations, presumably government-inspired, of persons suspected
 of harboring anti-regLme sentiments. In mid-1981, one of
 the few members of the religious Mojaddedi family left alive
 in the country was shot while sitting in the garden of
 his home in the town of CharLkar north of Kabul. hojaddedi's
 young son was also shot when he tried to go for help.
 The policy of the resistance has been to execute most Soviet
 prisoners, while providing most Afghan army personnel the
 opportunity to join the resistance. It 'is also reported
 that many captured regime officials are executed after
 appearing before resistance tribunals. In at least one
 province such actions by the resistance has alienated some
 of the local populace.
 The number of political detainees is difficult to estimate.
 In June 1981, visiting Western journalists were told that
 there were 600 political prisoners in Pol-e-Charkhi prison, of
 whom 400 had been formally charged and sentenced. According
 to an official report not made available to the press, there
 were 1200 prisoners in the Herat jail in September 1981, of
 whom 430 were being held for political crimes. It is almost
 certain that the number of political detainees at Pol-e-Charkhi
 is many times higher than 600; reports during the first half
 of 1981 suggested there were from 6000-8000 prisoners there.
 Numerous political arrests were made in August and September
 and indications continue that the number of political
 fTetainees is steadily increasing. There also have been
 reports that wives and mothers of freedom fighters have been
 held hostage in Pol-e-Charkhi.
 In the fall of 1981, Afghan and Soviet forces conducting
 an offensive against the resistance made extensive use of
 scorched-earth tactics. In Parwan province, north of Kabul,
 tanks were used to destroy grape arbors and piles of freshly
 threshed wheat. Private houses and other buildings were
 bombarded both from the air and the ground, and other
 buildings were booby-trapped so that returning residents
 would be injured or killed. There were also numerous
 reports of the casual murder of civilians by Afghan and
 Soviet forces walking in the streets of Parwan towns. Such
 activity has been reported only in zones of active combat,
 and there is no evidence that security forces are engaged in
 
 
 923
 the systematic destruction of crops throughout the country.
 Non-lethal chemicals, such as riot-control agents and incapa-
 citants, have been used rather regularly by the Soviets in
 Afghanistan. In addition, there is growing evidence that
 Soviet forces have used lethal chemical agents against
 resistance forces. Evidence includes first-hand accounts
 of victims and bystanders, as well as testimony of Afghan
 Army defectors. Information from regime sources confirms
 that equipment has been issued to Afghan soldiers and
 officials to protect them against chemical agents presumably
 being used by security forces against the resistance.
 The security forces continue to use air-dropped anti-
 personnel mines in areas of suspected resistance activity.
 According to Western media reports, these "butterfly' mines
 are dropped in mountain passes regularly used by the resis-
 tance and local populace. They blend in with the landscape,
 making them hard to see even by day. At night they kill and
 maim humans and animals alike. There are also reports that
 booby-trapped pens, watches and other items dropped by
 planes have maimed those unwary enough to pick them up.
 Some of these booby-traps were in shapes and colors attrac-
 tive to children.
 c. Disappearances
 Disappearances of citizens from their homes are still
 frequent. The whereabouts of certain high officials of
 the pre-communist Daoud regime remains a mystery.
 There have been reports of abduction and murder by the
 invading forces. In September 1981, for example, eyewit-
 nesses in Kabul reported that Soviet soldiers riding in an
 armored personnel carrier stopped an Afghan couple on the
 street, beat the man and took the woman away in their
 vehicle. Also, a Soviet soldier in eastern Afghanistan is
 reported earlier this year to have stopped a taxi and
 murdered its occupants after robbing them. In both cases,
 the authorities indicated a willingness to redress the
 wrongdoing, though to what effect is uknown.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Large-scale and arbitrary arrests continue to be a fact of
 day-to-day Afghan life. In August, approximately 100
 members of a radical communist group opposed to the Soviet-
 backed regime were rounded up.  Large numbers of students
 were detained following demonstrations in September against
 reactivation of reservists. Refugee accounts suggest that
 many such arrestees are released quickly when documentary
 evidence against them is-not found. In some cases, at
 least, more or less regular visiting rights are granted'to
 friends and relatives of political detainees. Such visits,
 however, can only be infrequent and of short duration, and
 some of those detained seem to be allowed no visits at all.
 Persistent resistance to the draft has prompted widespread use
 of forcible induction of young Afghan males, literally right
 off the street or off public transport. Many such 'recruits"
 
 
 924
 appear to be well under the legal draft age. Some of those
 dragooned into service in this manner apparently manage to
 secure their freedom shortly after being detained.
 Journalists' accounts from the Panjsher Valley northeast of
 Kabul confirm that at least some resistance groups have
 established prisons, in which some Afghan military detainees
 may be kept, along with Afghans incarcerated for political crimes.
 There are also now resistance "courts" for judging offenders.
 The quality of justice dispensed cannot be determined.
 e. Denial of Pair and Public Trial
 Some Afghan political prisoners receive trials and formal
 sentences, though generally this follows months of summary
 detention. Such judicial processes are invariably conducted
 in secret, with the secret police playing a major role in
 the proceedings. Similarly, there are now some resistance
 "courts" for judging offenders. Limited evidence suggests
 that the fate of these resistance detainees, as well as of
 prisoners of the Kabul regime, is often decided in advance,
 on the basis of what activities they had been engaged in
 prior to their arrests.
 Most of those accused of nonpolitical, civil or criminal
 offenses are apparently tried in the existing court system
 under the provisions of pre-communist judicial codes. The
 court system is being transformed by the Soviet authorities
 through training programs in the USSR. In some cases,
 plaintiffs may be denied due judicial process because of
 political beliefs or social position. Earlier this year,
 for instance, a high official of the pre-communist regime
 who tried to have a household employee prosecuted for
 stealing found that the case had been dropped with only
 the flimsiest of explanations being given. The official
 reportedly learned informally that, because he was allegedly
 rich and reactionary, his compiaint would not be investigated.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Forced entry into private homes, both by day and by night,
 is a regular occurrence in Afghan cities and towns. Official
 intruders include military personnel looking for new recruits
 or draft evaders; army, police and other functionaries
 searching for hidden weapons; and secret police or party
 operatives pursuing leads on regime opponents. Officials do
 not present search warrants, and sometimes claim they are
 conducting surveys aimed at increasing social services, in
 order to disguise the security-related purpose of their
 visits. Lesser crimes by Soviet soldiers, such as stealing
 from shops and individuals, often go unredressed. Afghan
 refugees have cited persistent invasions of the home,
 particularly late at night, as one of the most nerve-wracking
 and personally degrading aspects of life in communist Afghanistan.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 All the media are controlled by the regime. Soviet
 authorities assert tight control over content. The
 press, radio and television are used solely to convey and
 
 
 925
 reflect official policy. On the other hand, in Kabul and
 other cities "shabnamas" (night letters), a traditional
 Afghan means of expressing political dissent, circulate
 surreptitiously. In them the Babrak regime and the Soviets
 are criticized and nationalist information is circulated.
 The regime considers circulation of night letters to be a
 crime.
 The government only permits assembly in support of the
 regime, and all such gatherings are carefully orchestrated.
 The most recent such manifestation was a meeting of the
 National Fatherland Front, which is intended to attract
 support from all walks of Afghan life. Some of those who
 participated have been targets of resistance assassination,
 including to date one general and two religious leaders.
 The Babrak regime goes to great lengths to make a public
 show of religious piety. All its major policy initiatives
 are quickly sanctioned by a regime-controlled council of
 religious notables. The official media regularly claim that
 regime activities are in accord with Islamic tenets.
 Despite this effort, much of the religious leadership of the
 country remains alienated. Concern for the preservation of
 Islamic values remains at the heart of the anti-communist
 resistance.
 The regime continues to develop official labor organizations.
 These have no right to negotiate or strike.
 The Babrak regime appears to be making an effort to end, or
 at least reduce, domination of Afghanistan by the Pushtun
 ethnic group. Pushtuns have been predominant in the
 country since it emerged as a national entity in the middle
 of the 18th century. The ministry of tribal affairs,
 formerly a channel for subsidizing Pushtun tribal groups,
 has been changed to the ministry of tribes and nationa-
 lities, giving the impression that minority ethnic groups,
 such as Uzbeks, Hazaras and Tajiks, will be given greater
 recognition. Also, newspapers and radio broadcasts are now
 produced in minority languages. The new nationalities
 policy closely resembles its Soviet model. Observers note
 that the Soviets in Central Asia have pursued a policy of
 divide and rule, keeping ethnic groups which might join in
 a common effort (i.e., resistance to Moscow) apart by
 emphasizing their uniqueness.
 Women continue to occupy an inferior place in this tradi-
 tional and feudal society. Western journalists are regularly
 shown government schools in which adult literacy classes for
 women are being held, but efforts to educate rural women and
 girls have apparently been dropped. The literacy rate among
 Afghan women is much lower than among their male counterparts.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Travel within Afghanistan is difficult because of the
 insurgency, but there is a certain amount of movement of
 goods and people over the country's roads. The safest way
 to travel within Afghanistan is by air, but government
 subsidies to the internal airline have probably not brought
 this mode of travel within the financial reach of most
 
 
 926
 Afghans. Surface journeys are difficult, not only because of
 fighting between government and resistance forces, but
 because of the financial exactions often levied on travellers
 by Soviet soldiers and resistance fighters alike.
 There are many restrictions on foreign travel. Legal
 permission to go abroad has been curtailed. Professionals
 such as doctors or engineers generally are denied passports
 for fear that they will not return. Businessmen can still
 obtain passports, but it is reported that many Afghans are
 forced to pay bribes, sometimes in excess of $1,000 to have a
 passport issued to them. In addition, bank or property
 deposits as high as $1,000 are often asked of Afghans
 applying to leave the country temporarily. Afghan pilgrims
 to Mecca have been issued travel documents valid only for
 the pilgrimage, in an effort to require their return to
 Afghanistan.
 While legal emigration is thus virtually impossible, large
 numbers of Afghans continue to depart the country, more or
 less clandestinely, and to seek refuge abroad. Most estimates
 place the number of Afghans who have sought refuge abroad at
 almost three million. (This represents about 20 percent of
 Afghanistan's population.)
 c. Preedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Since the Soviet invasion in December 1979, an dictatorial
 one-party state ruled by the People's Democratic Party of
 Afghanistan (PDPA) has given way to a puppet apparatus
 controlled ultimately by the Soviet Union. Soviet military
 and civilian advisors sit in almost all ministries and
 either make or approve every major decision made by the
 regime.
 The PDPA itself is ruled by a small group who form the
 party's politburo. The party is torn by feuding between its
 two factions, Khalq and Parcham. The less numerous Par-
 chemists (including Babrak) retain control of the PDPA
 apparatus. Actual party membership is estimated at from
 10,000 to 20,000 out of a population estimated at 15
 million in 1978. Membership in the PDPA (the only
 legal party) -- and, effectively, membership in the Parcham
 faction -- is a prerequisite for political participation and
 professional advancement.
 There are no legally sanctioned opposition parties. Any
 perceived opposition is harshly treated. There has been no
 constitution since Taraki deposed then-President Daoud in 1978.
 The Babrak regime has stated that the 64 principles enun-
 ciated in early 1980 will serve as an interim constitution.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-govermental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Babrek regime has declined to continue dialogues on
 humanitarian and human rights conditions in Afghanistan with
 the International Committee of the Red Cross or Amnesty
 International. (Representatives of both organizations had
 visited Kabul in early or mid-1980.) In mid-1981, Western
 journalists were given a guided tour of Pol-e-Charkhi prison
 and reported publicly that conditions there appeared tolerable.
 
 
 927
 The authorities never acted on a subsequent request by a
 second group of Western journalists to go to Pol-e-Charkhi.
 In response to Amnesty International's report covering the
 year ending April 1981, Kabul launched a bitter campaign
 against that Nobel Peace Prize winning organization, calling
 it a CIA tool which aims only at getting CIA agents out of
 jail.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Prior to the communist coup d'etat in 1978, Afghanistan was
 by all measures one of the poorest countries in the world,
 with an expected GNP of $170. Its people had an estimated
 life expectancy of only 41 years, while infant mortality
 averaged 237 per 1,000 live births; yet its population was
 growing at 2.6 percent per year. Since then, the massive
 emigration of refugees has turned this to a negative
 figure.
 Since the coup and the Soviet invasion in December 1979,
 economic and social conditions for most Afghans have
 deteriorated. In much of the countryside, there is no
 government presence whatever, and educational and health
 facilities are consequently at a minimum. In some areas,
 the populace relies on local resistance organizations to
 supply basic commodities and medicines. In areas under
 government control, some social services exist, but these
 are frequently disrupted by fighting between government and
 resistance forces. Further, the migration of large numbers
 of refugees from the countryside has severely strained
 already inadequate urban services and has almost certainly
 increased a high rate of nonrural unemployment. The literacy
 rate, before the Soviet invasion, was estimated at 10-12
 percent. Given the forced closing of many government
 schools, and the flight of many draft-aged students*, the
 primary school enrollment rate in Afghanistan has almost
 certainly declined below previous levels of'only 20 percent
 (33 percent for males, 6 percent for females.).
