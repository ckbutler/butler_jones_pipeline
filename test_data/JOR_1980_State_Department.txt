 JORDAN
 Disfavored by geography, a small population, climate,
 and lack of arable land and natural resources; Jordan is a
 poor country. During the past 10 years, however, Jordan has
 made substantial economic progress in an atmosphere of
 domestic stability in a politically volatile region. A
 participant in the Arab-Israeli wars of 1948 and 1967,
 Jordan gave shelter to large numbers of Palestinian refugees
 in each of those years. Tensions between the refugees and
 native trans-Jordanians boiled over in the disturbances of
 1970. Since these violent incidents, Jordan has remained
 under martial law which it justifies by pointing out the
 political instability of its neighbors and the generally
 tense situation in the region. The government resorts to
 authoritarian measures sparingly.
 Jordan is a constitutional monarchy in which, since its
 independence, the King has retained great power. He appoints
 afd dismisses the government and is the primary locus of
 foreign policy.. The Prime Minister and the cabinet exercise
 considerable responsibility in the formulation of domestic
 and economic policy.
 Although adversely affected by the 1973 and subsequent
 oil price increases, Jordan also has benefited from
 the general increase in wealth in the region. When security
 conditions in Beirut greatly deteriorated, Amman, with its
 agreeable climate, relatively good communications and
 transportation connections, stable government and free
 market economic policies began to play an increased
 role as a Middle East regional economic and commercial
 center. Spurred by the influx of foreign funds and re-
 patriated earnings of Jordanians working abroad, the Amman
 area is' experiencing an economic boom. The foundation of
 this boom is fragile, and there are recent signs of a
 downturning; however, barring the unforeseen, economic
 conditions for the coming year should be reasonably good.
 Jordan is committed to free enterprise, with a minimum of
 government interference in the market place. Economic
 stability and development are enhanced by the fact that
 Palestinian refugees have been given Jordanian citizen-
 ship and are allowed to participate fully in Jordanian
 economic, social, and political affairs. Despite the past
 tensions among and between West Bank Palestinians and East
 Bank 'Trans-Jordanians,* relations between the two communities
 are generally good. Jordanians, primarily Sunni Moslems,
 respect Islamic civil, legal and social institutions.
 The small but important Christian minority is not discrimina-
 ted against and, in general, enjoys considerable status and
 economic well-being.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture.
 No constitutional provision or law specifically forbids
 torture. Law 23 of 1953, which regulates the treatment of
 prisoners, guarantees that they receive medical treatment
 and provides for inspection of prisons in order to ensure
 that healthful conditions prevail in them. No accusations
 of torture are known to have been made in 1980. There is no
 evidence that Jordanian governmental authorities condone or
 practice torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman. or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
 As mentioned above, Jordanian law provides for the decent
 treatment of prisoners. Within the constraints of a limited
 budget, Jordanian prisons are spartan but adequate in
 the context of Jordanian society. Prison conditions do
 not appear to represent intentionally degrading treatment.
 There appears to be no discrimination according to religion
 or social class in the treatment of prisoners.
 In 1980, Jordan took steps to improve the treatment of
 juvenile offenders, establishing a new juvenile detention
 center. Thirty-eight juveniles were moved to the new
 center from the Mahatta Rehabilitation and Correctional
 Center, where they had been housed with adults due to lack
 of space in then-existing juvenile detention centers.
 Subject to fiscal constraints, the Government of Jordan
 is planning to institute a system of special juvenile
 courts.
 Summary executions do not occur in Jordan. Although the law
 provides for capital punishment, none has been carried out
 in memory. Jordanian law provides for trial in absentia of
 Arabs who sell West Bank property to the "enemy" (defined as
 an Israeli citizen, resident of Israel or Israeli corporation).
 The maximum penalty for this crime is death. Although such
 trials have occurred, and the death penalty pronounced,
 there has been no instance in which it has been carried
 out.
 C. Disappearances
 The Jordanian security forces do not secretly abduct
 people; however, they are empowered to detain people
 without trial. In such cases, family members can obtain
 information on the whereabouts of their relatives. No
 evidence has surfaced to indicate that persons so detained
 have died as a result of torture, cruelty, negligence or
 summary execution.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment.
 Jordan legally has been in a state of war since 1948.
 In force for much of that period, martial law was most
 
 
 1015
 recently reaffirmed in 1973. Under martial law, the
 executive authority has the power to detain persons indefi-
 nitely without trial. A detained person may take his case
 to the High Court of Justice (an administrative tribunal) to
 argue that his detention on security grounds is not justified.
 Jordanian martial law does not provide for habeas corpus.
 In recent years the Government of Jordan has made limited
 use of its detention powers. While exact statistics
 are unavailable, it appears that several dozen people were
 detained in 1980 for periods ranging from a few days to
 several months. Soon after assuming office in December,
 1979, the late Prime Minister, Abdul-Hamid Sharaf, freed
 forty persons who had been under such detention. On
 January 20, the Government of Jordan proclaimed a royal
 amnesty and released over 800 prisoners. The amnesty
 also provided that prisoners serving 20 years or more
 would have their sentences reduced to 10 years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.
 Although martial law is in force in Jordan, both civilian
 and military courts operate. The jurisdiction of the
 two systems is clearly defined in law, with the martial
 law court responsible for crimes such as espionage, bribery
 of public officials, trafficking in narcotics or weapons,
 black marketeering, and security offenses. The civil
 courts retain jurisdiction for most other crimes.
 Although the martial law court is not bound to observe
 normal rules of evidence or procedure, such generally
 accepted legal practices have been observed during the last
 five years. Accordingly, defendants before this court may
 be represented by legal counsel and may cross-examine
 witnesses. The three judges currently sitting on the
 martial law court all have legal education, as does the
 military prosecutor. Sentences of the martial law court may
 not be appealed. However, they must be ratified by the prime
 minister in his capacity as martial law governor. The prime
 minister has the authority to increase, reduce, or annul any
 martial law sentence. In practice, cases are reviewed for
 fairness by his legal advisor and/or the Ministry of Justice
 before the prime minister makes a decision.
 Under the civilian court system, cases must be reviewed
 by the public prosecutor's office within 24 hours of an
 arrest. The prosecutor must determine that sufficient
 evidence exists to warrant prosecuting the accused. The
 prosecutor then turns the case over to the Attorney General's
 office, which prepares a formal bill of indictment if
 satisfied that enough evidence exists to warrant prosecution.
 At all stages in this process, the accused is entitled to be
 represented by legal counsel. Many defendants, however, are
 unaware of this right and fail to exercise it. The Jordanian
 legal system provides that if the accused cannot obtain
 legal counsel for himself, the State, via the Bar Association,
 will assign a lawyer to defend him. An established appeals
 process exists for felony cases.
 Jordan upholds the principle that judges should be independent
 and insulated from political pressures. Judges are selected
 
 
 1016
 by a board composed of members of the High Court of Justice,
 a representative of the Attorney-General's office, and the
 Under Secretary of Justice (the senior civil servant in the
 ministry). Judges may only be removed from office on
 grounds of specific transgression of the law and after a
 hearing before a disciplinary board (made up of a membership
 similar to that of the selection panel).
 In addition to martial and civil law, for Muslims traditional
 religious law (Sharia) continues to play an important role
 in Jordanian life and society. Rights of inheritance and
 child custody, conduct between neighbors and especially
 women's personal status are largely adjudicated according to
 the Sharia. In accordance with Muslim tradition, polygamy
 is permitted though not widely practiced in Jordan. A man
 may divorce by unilateral repudiation: discriminatory
 inheritances exist under the Sharia and are applied in
 Jordan. A Muslim woman with children receives one-eighth of
 her husband's estate--the children get the rest; if she is
 childless, the wife gets one-fourth of the estate. A
 non-Muslim wife of a Muslim is not entitled to an inheritance.
 Islamic law provides that the father, or in his absence, the
 father's family, has ultimate custody of the children in
 case of divorce or the father's death.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary entry of private homes by Jordanian authorities
 is against the law and no reported cases have occurred.
 Search and arrest require legal warrants.
 Z.   Government Policies Relating to the Ful-
 fillment of Such Vital Needs as Food, Sheltet, Health
 Care and Education
 The economy of Jordan has enjoyed healthy growth--estimated
 to average 8 percent annually--during the five-year period
 ending in 1980 and covered by the 1976-80 development
 plan. Current per capita GNP stands at $1,050
 (1978 dollars). The economy is dominated by the services
 sector, which accounts for 65 percent of GDP, industry's
 share is rising and the government is carrying out plans to
 exploit scarce natural resources. Agriculture's share of
 GDP has declined to about 10 percent due to insufficient
 rainfall and more attractive economic opportunities in other
 sectors. About one-third of Jordan's work force is employed
 in the Gulf states, where wages are much higher. Besides
 remittance earnings (about one billion U.S. dollars a year)
 such employment opportunities in the Gulf have served
 virtually to eliminate unemployment in Jordan. Large
 numbers of Jordanians have realized increases in their
 income levels. The Jordanian workforce operates as a
 regional source of skilled and professional labor. Therefore,
 the government does not restrict its international movement.
 Jordan also continues to receive large transfer payments
 from the Arab oil states.
 Of Jordan's population of 2.15 million, 63 percent live
 in urban areas and about one-half of the total population
 
 
 1017
 live in metropolitan Amman. The natural rate of increase
 is 3.3-3.6 percent per year: 51 percent of the population is
 under the age of 15.
 The basic law governing education (Law 16 of 1964) stipu-
 lates that free education is compulsory through grade 9
 and that every Jordanian shall have equal access to
 education without regard to sex, religion or similar
 factors. Education facilities are generally good and
 widely distributed. Enrollments have grown rapidly from
 531,000 in 1970 to 670,000 in 1979 with 97 percent of
 primary-school-age children attending primary schools
 (grades 1-6), 82 percent in the preparatory grades (7-9),
 and 58 percent in secondary schools. Today about every
 third Jordanian is a full-time student.
 Because of the expansion in education cited above, Jordan's
 adult literacy rate exceeds 70 percent compared to the
 32 percent figure of 1960. About half of the female popula-
 tion is literate and over 77 percent of all males. In
 1960 only 15 percent of the female population was literate
 and 50 percent of all males.
 Health facilities are widely distributed, although limited
 availability of trained nursing and paramedical personnel
 has restricted expansion of medical care in rural areas, and
 particularly to the poorer, less densely populated areas.
 The most extensive and complete health services, including
 the more specialized ones, are found in the larger cities.
 In 1979 Jordan had 0.7 doctors and 1.2 hospital beds per
 1,000 persons. Improvements in available health care and
 expansion of services are indicated by rising life expectancy
 (56 years in 1978 versus 47 years in 1960), the halving of
 the child death rate from 30 to 15 per 1.000 children aged
 1-4 during the same period, and the fall in the infant
 mortality rate from 125/1,000 live births in the mid-1950's
 to about 81/1,000 in 1979. Women of child-bearing age and
 children remain, however, the segment of the population most
 at risk in terms of health.
 Before the great expansion in demand for labor in the
 Gulf States, which began    about 1973, Jordan had a serious-
 and chronic unemployment problem; this has been eliminated,
 i.e., reduced to less than two percent, by the flow of
 workers to the Gulf. There is, however, no good measure of
 underemployment. Two parallel developments tend to confirm
 the low level of unemployment. One is the rising numbers of
 foreign workers in Jordan--70,000 most of whom are unskilled
 agriculture and construction workers from Egypt. The second
 is the rapid increase in female participation in the work force
 from about four percent in 1975 to 14 percent in 1979. Many
 of the government's expanding vocational training efforts
 are directed toward training women to meet shortages in the
 technical skills areas.
 Wage rates have risen rapidly in all sectors, although
 
 
 1018
 civil service wages lag behind the private sector. Even
 so, inflation (now running at a yearly rate of 13.6 percent)
 has kept ahead of wage increases and is not expected to
 ease so long as world inflation rates stay high.
 Per capita income in Jordan has about tripled since 1960.
 Lacking baseline data, income distribution trends are hard
 to assess, although the gap between the highest and lowest
 income groups may be assumed to have remained constant, or
 to have widened, primarily reflecting economic advances
 at the upper levels.
 While the new five-year development plan for 1981-85 has
 not been completed, its general objectives are: meeting the
 Jordanian citizen's basic needs, achieving the greatest
 degree of equity in distributing development benefits,
 increasing women's participation in the labor force and
 creating additional opportunities for their education,
 training and employment, and promoting citizen participation
 in the development effort.
 In its 1980 1.721 billion U.S. dollars budget, the government
 allocated 236 million dolllars to health, social welfare,
 and education.  (This is in addition to the 625 million
 dollars set aside for "economic services"). In comparison
 to the 1977 budget, expenditures for health, social welfare
 and education increased 11 percent despite government budget
 stringencies. The only government hiring proposed in 1980
 is for teachers and paramedical staff.
 Hampered by a limited resource base and a rapidly growing
 population, the standard of living in Jordan. nevertheless,
 has risen during the past decade. While most citizens
 have benefited in some ways from this prosperity, the
 gains have been unevenly distributed. The Government
 of Jordan recognizes this problem and is attempting to
 combat it by such measures as improving income tax collec-
 tion especially from business and upper-and-middle-income
 groups, and increasing taxes on luxury imports.
 Jordan's free enterprise economy has created many oppor-
 tunities for its people, regardless of religious, ethnic,
 or tribal background. There is no evidence of government-
 encouraged discrimination. Women in Jordan traditionally have
 been disfavored economically and, to a lesser extent,
 educationally. This pattern is changing. Only a small
 fraction (14 percent) of women are gainfully employed.
 This is more than a three-fold increase over the 4 percent
 figure of 1975.
 Enrollment of girls has grown faster than that of boys at
 all levels of the education system in recent years in response
 to public demand and government support for construction of
 girls' schools. It is public policy to educate girls in
 separate facilities, reflecting cultural and religious pre-
 ferences. In the 1978/79 school year 45.5 percent of all
 Jordanian students were female, including 47 percent in
 the elementary cycle, 45 percent in preparatory schools,
 
 
 1019
 and 41 percent in secondary. of primary-school-aged girls,
 -95 percent are enrolled compared to the 99 percent figure
 for males.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press. Religion and Assembly
 The 1952 constitution guarantees the freedom of speech,
 press, and assembly within certain limits defined by law.
 In fact, Jordanians express their opinions freely in private
 and, to.a certain extent, in print. The radio and television
 system in Jordan are state-controlled. Private news-
 papers and periodicals (which are all subject to government
 influence) practice a form of self-censorship on important
 national issues. Low-key media criticism of the govern-
 ment's domestic policies occurs occasionally. The press
 generally reflects the government's position on major
 foreign policy and security issues. Newspapers have been
 closed down for varying periods in the past for printing
 articles of which the government strongly disapproves and
 journalists have been warned about cmaents 4dch may be considered
 critical of some groups or interests. No Jordanian news-
 papers or periodicals were closed during 1980. Foreign
 newspapers and magazines are widely available, although
 subject to occasional censorship. Similarly, foreign books
 and works of art are generaly permitted to circulate, being
 subject to censorship more on moral grounds than on political
 ones. Salacious and pornographic materials are banned.
 The government is not known to interfere with free academic
 inquiry. Persons who demonstrate without first obtaining a
 permit are liable to be dispersed by police action.
 Jordanians freely may .join labor unions and professional
 organizations. Such associations require government
 license, but these routinely are granted for groups which
 are not overtly political. These unions and associations
 are permitted to defend the interests of their members,
 and their officers-are freely elected by the membership.
 Islam, the state religion, is followed by the great majority
 of Jordanians. However, the constitution guarantees freedom
 of worship. Persecution or harassment of the Christian
 minority is against government policy; in fact, there
 appears to be little difference between adherents of the
 religions in social or economic status. Nevertheless, some
 tensions do exist between the Islamic and Christian communities.
 When theseidisputes occur, they are usually localized and
 quickly defused.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Travel within the country (with the exception .of certain
 defined and limited military zones) is unobstructed. The
 government does not restrict travel abroad by its nationals.
 Women and minor children are required to have written
 consent of their husband, father, or oldest male relative in
 
 
 1020
 order to obtain a passport. Such persons travelling alone
 generally are presumed by the authorities to have permission
 to travel.
 Jordan has confronted a long-term, major refugee problem,
 especially since the 1948 and 1967 influxes of Palestinians
 made homeless as a result of the Arab-Israeli wars. Jordan
 has committed substantial resources to help resettle these
 refugees and ameliorate their plight. According to the
 most recent United Nations Relief and Works Agency statistics,
 refugees and their descendants on the East Bank of the
 Jordan River now total approximately 896,000. This total
 does not include a large but undetermined number of other
 persons from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or the State of
 Israel, who have settled in Jordan since 1948. All of these
 people have been granted Jordanian citizenship and have the
 unrestricted right to live, work, and own property in
 Jordan. There are no restrictions on these or any other
 citizens who might wish to return to Jordan after a period
 spent residing abroad.
 Jordan defends the movement of peoples between the East Bank
 and Israeli occupied territories. In doing so, the government
 has reminded its critics that such travel is humanitarian,
 helps maintain West Bank Arab ties, and is economically
 advantageous to the inhabitants of the occupied territories.
 Jordan recognizes the right of asylum even in cases which
 have resulted in strained relations with neighboring states.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Jordan remains a monarchy in which the King enjoys a monopoly
 of political power. Governments are formed and dissolved at
 his command and he remains the ultimate arbiter of policy.
 Organized political parties are not permitted in Jordan.
 One, the Communist Party, is prohibited by law. According
 to the 1952 constitution, there should be an appointed
 Senate and a Chambers of Deputies elected by universal
 suffrage in secret ballot. The Chamber of Deputies was
 adjourned sine die in 1974. Parliamentary elections have
 been postponed indefinitely since Jordan believes that both
 East and West Bank must be represented in any future parlia-
 ment and it is presently impossible to conduct Jordanian
 elections in the occupied West Bank.
 In 1978, King Hussein established a National Consultative
 Council (NCC) with appointed members selected to represent
 the various geographic regions and social, ethnic, religious,
 and tribal groups in the country. Legislation is submitted
 to the NCC for review; it does not have veto power, but
 often discusses policies actively and sometimes heatedly.
 Thus, it has provided a forum for dialogue between the
 government and the public. The government generally has not
 promulgated legislation with which the NCC is in strong
 disagreement.
 The town councils of most towns in Jordan are elected by
 
 
 1021
 popular vote. In 1980, King Hussein called for increased
 democracy in local and regional government; the government
 is expected to introduce legislation to this effect in the
 coming months. Early drafts of legislation proposed to
 extend the franchise to all citizens over 18 years of age,
 (including women) to allow women to run for local office for
 the first time in Jordan's history, and to provide for
 election of mayors and councilors  of municipalities and
 villages.
 In 1980, King Hussein took other steps to increase the
 participation of women in the political process, appoint-
 ing the first female cabinet minister in Jordan's history
 and increasing the number of women in the NCC (from three
 to five out of sixty members).
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Jordan has attracted little attention from private and
 international human rights organizations. Amnesty Inter-
 national has made inquiries about specific cases from
 time to time. In February and March 1979, a delegation of
 the International Committee of the Red Cross was permitted
 to inspect most of Jordan's prisons. The Government of
 Jordan regards Human Rights issues essentially as an internal
 matter. The Jordanian lawyers' professional association has
 formed a human rights committee, which does not appear to be
 active. Extensive Jordanian government and private concern
 has focused on the.Ziyad abu Eain extradition case. Abu Eain
 is a Jordanian citizen of Palestinian origin.who is accused by
 the Israeli government of being responsible for a bomb ex-
 plosion in Jerusalem which resulted in a number of civilian
 deaths. On the basis of an Israeli government request, under
 the provisions of the U.S.-Israeli treaty on extradition, he
 was arrested in Chicago. He is being held for extradition to
 Israel. His case is currently under judicial review in the
 United States. The Jordanian perception is that abu Eamn is
 charged with a political crime and would not receive a fair
 trial in Israeli courts. Should abu Eain be extradited to
 Israel, Jordanians will intensify the international campaign
 to portray this as a violation of his human rights.
 The government has played an active role in the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission at Geneva. Jordan is a signatory to the
 Covenant on Political and Civil Rights and the Covenant on
 Economic and Social Rights.
