 CHINA
 The People's Republic of China (PRC) is a one-party state adhering to Marxist.
 Leninist principles, in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), backed by the
 military and security forces, monopolizes decisionmaking authority. A closed inner
 circle of a few senior leaders holds ultimate power. Some of these party leaders hold
 p ositions within the Politburo, the Central Military Commission, and other organs.
 Others hold no formal positions of authority but still wield decisive influence by vir-
 tue of their seniority in the Communist movement.
 The party maintains control through its ubiquitous apparatus and traditional so-
 cietal pressure as well as through a nationwide security network which includes the
 People s Liberation Army-, the Ministry of State Security; the Ministry of Public Se-
 curity; the People's Armed Police- and the state judicial, procuratorial, and penal
 systems. The security forces have been responsible for human rights abuses, includ-
 ing torture and arbitrary arrest.and detention.
 More than a decade of impressive economic growth and the spread of market
 forces have resulted in reducing the Government's control over the economy and
 many aspects of the everyday life of Chinese citizens. China's annual per capita in-
 come, estimated at $320, remains among the world's lowest, but wide disparities
 exist, with the living standards in some coastal areas approaching those in more de-
 veloped countries. The call of Deng Xiaoping, de facto leader of China, for higher
 growth and greater reliance on market economics gained wide support in 1992, de-
 spite some concern over potential overheating of the economy leading to resurgent
 inflation.
 The Government's human rights practices have remained repressive, falling far
 short of internationally accepted norms. Around the time of the third anniversary
 of the June 1989 Beijing demonstrations about 30 activists were detained in
 Beijing, with more dissidents reportedly held in other areas. The summer trials of
 former party central committee member Bao Tong and others allegedly linked to the
 1989 prodemocracy demonstrations were characterized by predetermined verdicts,
 effective denial of access to legal counsel, and no access to the trials by independent
 observers. Boston-based student activist Shen Tong was detained for amost 8 weeks
 after he attempted to exercise his right to free speech and association during a visit
 to China. Shen was released after he agreed to depart immediately for the United
 States. But at least one Chinese citizen detained in connection with Shen's activi-
 ties, Qi Dafeng, remained in custody at year's end. Meanwhile, hundreds, perhaps
 thousands, of prisoners of conscience remained imprisoned or detained. The repres-
 sion of believers who refused to affiliate with government-sponsored religious orga-
 nizations continued; human rights abuses persisted in Tibet and some other areas
 heavily populated by ethnic minorities; and cases of torture and mistreatment of
 those accused of crimes were documented.
 On the more positive side, dissidents in Beijing estimated that by mid-1992 some
 70 to 80 percent of those detained in that city or involvement in the 1989 democ-
 racy demonstrations had been released. China's limited dialog with its foreign crit-
 ics, while generally characterized by rigid PRC defense of the existing system, con-
 tinued to expose greater numbers of Chinese to a larger range of views on human
 rights practices. Modest progress was made in resolving a few individual human
 rights cases. A number of prominent dissidents have been allowed to leave China;
 other exit visa cases have been blocked despite a government commitment to allow
 dissidents to leave. The Governments of the United States and China concluded a
 memorandum of understanding on preventing trade in prison labor products in Au-
 gust. In the cultural sphere, there were indications that the rigid ideological controls
 reimposed after June 1989 were beginning to ease.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killin.-There were no confirmed deaths as
 a result of political or extrajudicial killing. However, some reports suggested that
 elderly Catholic bishop Fan Xueyan may have been beaten prior to his death in offi-
 cial custody in Hebei Province in April.
 b. Disappearance.-Although there were no reported cases of disappearance in
 1992, the Government has never provided a comprehensive public accounting of the
 fate of those detained during and after the suppression of the 1989 demonstrations.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degradin# Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and degrading treatment of detained and imprisoned persons persisted.
 Both official Chinese sources and human rights groups reported many instances of
 torture. Persons detained pending trial were particularly at risk, reflecting the em-
 
 
 541
 phasis on obtaining confessions as a basis for convictions. A June article in the offi-
 al Yunnan Legal News indicated that Chinese police sometimes made suspects
 kneel on broken glass, jolted them with electric current, or bound them tightly for
 long periods. Former detainees have credibly reported the use of cattle prods, elec-
 trodes, prolonged periods of solitary confinement and incommunicado detention,
 beatings, shackles, and other forms of abuse against detained women and men.
 Former prisoners and detainees have stated that ordinary workers and unemployed
 youths were more likely to suffer torture and mistreatment than well-known pris-
 oners. Refugees have frequently and credibly reported on torture and mistreatment
 in Tibet's penal institutions.
 In April the Procuratorate called for tougher penalties in cases of torture, and offi-
 cials, including Politburo member Qiao Shi and the Shanghai Public Security Bu-
 rau director tok a more open anreaealistic line on abuses, acknowledging publicly
 that torture by Chinese plice was a serious problem. In September China submit-
 teda supplementary report on torture in belated compliance with its reporting obli-
 gations under the U.N. Convention Against Torture.
 Procurator General Liu Fuzhi reported in March that 407 alleged cases of torture
 were investigated in 1991, down 13.5 percent from 1990. These figures cannot be
 confirmed. The number of incidents of torture and ill-treatment by government offi-
 cials is almost certainly far greater than the number recorded.
 Punishment of abusers has rarely been reported, but severe punishments have
 been imposed in at least a few cases.
 According to the Government's White Paper on "Criminal Reform in China," 24
 wardens and guards were sentenced to imprisonment in 1990 and 1991 for admin-
 istering corporal punishment to detainees.
 Conditions in all types of Chinese penal institutions are harsh and frequently de-
 grad iC , and nutritional and health conditions in China's "reform through labor
 camps are grim. There were credible reports that six dissidents held at a Liaoning
 labor camp, including Liu Gang and Zhang Ming, were denied family visits, beaten,
 and kept in punishment cells for having attempted hunger strikes. Medical care for
 prisoners has been another problem area, despite official assurances in the White
 Paper that prisoners have the right to maintain good health and receive prompt
 medical treatment if they become ill. In 1992 political prisoners who had difficulties
 in obtaining timelyand adeuate medical care included Wang Juntao, Xu Wenli,
 Ren Wanding and     Guiren. These reports come from credible unofficial sources but
 cannot be officially authenticated because the Government has refused to allow im-
 partial observers to visit the prisoners. In a few cases, prisoners have been allowed
 out on parole for medical treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.--China's Criminal Procedure Law pro-
 scribes arbitrary arrest or detention; limits the time a person may be held in cus-
 tody without being charged; and provides for notifying the detainee's family and
 work unit of the detention within 48 hours. These provisions are subject to several
 important exceptions and are frequently ignored in practice or circumvented by var-
 ious informal mechanisms. Public security authorities often detain people for long
 periods of time under these mechanisms not covered by the Criminal Procedure
 Law. These include unpublished regulations on "taking in for shelter and investiga
 tions" and 'supervised residence" as well as other methods not requiring procura-
 torial approval. These administrative forms of detention were purportedly abolished
 by a 1980 State Council document but are still used. In numerous cases, the precise
 le al status or location of detainees is unclear.
 Political dissidents are often detained or charged for having committed "crimes of
 counterrevolution," under Articles 90    through  104  of the   Criminal Law.
 Counterrevolutionary offenses range from treason and espionage to spreading
 counterrevolutionary propaganda. These articles have also been used to punish per-
 sons who organized demonstrations, disrupted traffic, disclosed official information
 to foreigners, or formed associations outside state control. Detention and trial of dis-
 sidents on other charges is possible. In January Shanghai democracy advocate Pan
 Weiming was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment on charges of "hooliganism."
 Beijing daily editor Qi Lin was given a 4-year jail term in April for allegedly leaking
 state secrets to a Taiwan newspaper; credible sources report Qi was later released
 from prison on medical parole. Security officials detainedWang Wanxing, who tried
 to stage an unauthorized one-man demonstration to mark the third anniversary of
 the June 1989 prodemocracy demonstrations. He later smuggled a letter to the
 Western press stating that because of his act of protest he had been committed to
 a mental institution. People participating in unauthorized religious organizations
 may be charged with criminal offenses such as receiving funds from abroad without
 authorization or changing such funds on the black market.
 
 
 542
 Those detained for committing "crimes of counterrevolution" are in theory treated
 the same as those detained for other crimes, and their cases ae supposed to be han-
 dled in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law. In practice, the law's provi-
 sions requiring family notification and limiting length of detention are often ignored
 in "counterrevolutionary" and other political cases. Bao Tong, chief aide to former
 CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and a former member of the party's Central
 Committee, was detained for about 2V years before being formally arrested in early
 1992.
 A well-documented estimate of the total number of those subjected to new or con-
 tinued arbitrary arrest or detention is not possible due to the Government's tight
 control of information. Many reported detentions of dissidents in 1992 were linked
 to the June 4 anniversary. Around that time, about 30 activists were reported to
 have been detained in and around Beijing. Some of the detained individuals, like
 labor activists Han Dongfang, Zhou Guoqiang, Zhang Jinli, and Song Jie, are re-
 ported to have been released after a few days, but the status of others is unknown.
 ere were detailed but unconfirmed reports from Hong Kong in August that about
 20 dissidents in northwest China had been detained at around the same time. Bos-
 ton-based student activist Shen Tong, who had returned to China, and two other
 Chinese citizens, Qi Dafeng and qian Liyun, were detained on September 1, hours
 before Shen was scheduled to hold a press conference announcing the formation of
 a Beijing branch of a prodemocracy organization. After nearly 8 weeks in detention,
 Shen was released after ageing to depart immediately for the United States. Qian
 was subsequently rele     but Qi remained in custody at year's end. There was
 scant information about other individuals in Hunan and Tianjin who may also have
 been detained in connection with the case.
 The Government still has not satisfactorily accounted for the thousands of persons
 throughout the country who were arrested or held in "detention during investiga-
 tion" or "administrative detention" status for activities related to the 1989
 prodemocracy demonstrations. Many, of these persons were not formally arrested or
 charged with any crime. A human rights organization published information in 1992
 speciying that in Hunan alone at least 594 participants in the 1989 demonstrations
 had been arrested or detained by the end of 1990.
 In March Procurator General Liu Fuzhi told reporters that more than 90 percent
 of suspects accused of crimes associated with the 1989 demonstrations had been
 brought to trial. Liu did not explain the status of the remaining suspects. Most per-
 sons held in connection with the events of 1989, however, were no longer under de-
 tention by 1992.
 According to dissidents in Beijing, by mid-1992 some 70 to 80 percent of the per-
 sons detained in that city in connection with the 1989 demonstrations had been re-
 leased, in many cases after serving full sentences. Others were released after
 lengthy detention without trial. Charges against labor activist Han Dongfang, who
 was released in 1991 on medical parole, were dropped, and he was subsequently al-
 lowed to leave the country. Two Hong Kong men arrested in 1989 for aiding dis-
 sidents Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao were given early releases on "medical pa-
 role" in May and allowed to return to Hong Kong, according to reports from south
 China. Intellectual Bao Zunxin was released in November on probation after serving
 more than 3 years of a 5-year sentence following reports of ill health in prison.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Officials insist that China's judiciary is independ-
 ent but acknowledge that it is subject to the CCP's policy guidance. In actuality,
 party and government leaders predetermine verdicts andsentences in some sen-
 sitive cases. According to the Constitution, the court system is equal in authority
 to the State Council and the Central Military Commission, the two most important
 government institutions. All three organs are nominally under the supervision of the
 National People's Congress. The Supreme People's Court stands at the apex of the
 court system, followed[ in descending order by the higher, intermediate, and basic
 peopvle's courts.
 There was a renewed focus on legal reform in 1992, though it is still difficult to
 project its ultimate effect. The court system remains deeply flawed. Due process
 rights are provided for in the Constitution but most often ignord in practice. Both
 before and after trial, prisoners are subject to severe pressur to confess their "er-
 rors." Defendants who fail to "show the right attitude by confessing their crimes
 are typically sentenced more harshly. Despite official media and other reports that
 indicate coerced confessions have led to erroneous convictions, a coerced confession
 does not in itself prevent conviction. According to judicial officials, however, confes-
 sions without corroborating evidence are an insufficient basis for conviction.
 Accused persons are given virtually no opportunity to prepare a defense in the
 pretrial process, during which the question of guilt or innocence is essentially de-
 cided administratively. Defense lawyers may be retained only 7 days before the
 
 
 543
 trial. In some cases even this brief period has been shortened under regulations is-
 sued in 1983 to accelerate the adjudication of certain serious criminal cases. Persons
 appearing before a court are not presumed innocent; despite official denials, trials
 are essentially sentencing hearings. Conviction rates average over 99 percent. There
 is an appeal process and, according to the White Paper on criminal reform, Chinese
 courts heard more than 40,000 appeals in 1990 and 1991. Initial decisions, however,
 are rarely overturned.
 Some officials have acknowledged that trials in China are conducted too rapidly.
 They blame a shortage of lawyers, of whom there are an estimated 50,000 in  ma.
 Under Chinese law there is no requirement that the court appoint a defense attor-
 ney for the defendant unless the defendant is deaf, dumb, or a minor. Knowledge-
 able observers report that defense attorneys appear in only a small number of crimi-
 nal trials. When attorneys do appear, they have little time to prepare a defense and
 rarely contest guilt; their function is generally confined to requesting clemency. De-
 fense lawyers, like other Chinese, generally depend on an official work unit for em-
 ployment, housing, and many other aspects of their lives. They are therefore often
 reluctant to be viewed as overzealous in defending individuals accused of political
 offenses. The Criminal Procedure Law requires that all trials be held in public, ex-
 cept those involving state secrets, juveniles, or "personal secrets." Details of cases
 involving "counterrevolutionary" charges, however, have frequently been kept secret,
 even from defendants' relatives, under this provision. The 1988 Law on State Se-
 crets affords a ready basis for denying a public trial in cases involving "counter-
 revolution." There were several closed trials of political cases in 1992, including
 those of Bao Tong and Fu Shenqi. Even when trials are nominally open, in many
 cases the only members of the public allowed to attend are officially selected "rep-
 resentatives of the people." Numerous requests by independent foreign observers to
 attend the trials of Bao Tong and others were turned aside. The Government as-
 serted that foreign observers were not permitted to attend trials unless the alleged
 crime directly involved a foreigner or a Chinese related to a foreigner.
 In the context of China's ongoing anticrime campaign, the CCP leadership has or-
 dered public security, procuratorate, and court officials to speed the process of inves-
 tigation, trial, and sentencing, raising additional concerns about due process. Lack
 of due process is particularly troublesome when defendants receive the death sen-
 tence. Chinese officials refuse to provide comprehensive statistics on death sen-
 tences or executions, but hundreds of executions are confirmed annually. The actual
 numbers may be much higher. All death sentences are nominally reviewed by a
 higher court. In a large number of cases, reviews are very rapid, often completed
 w:ithin a few days after sentencing, and result in a perfunctory confirmation of sen-
 tence. In addition to the formal judicial system, government authorities can assign
 persons accused of "minor" public order and "counterrevolutionary" offenses to "re-
 education through labor" camps in an extrajudicial process. This allows security au-
 thorities to deal with political and other offenders without reference to even the
 nominal procedures and protections the formal criminal process offers. 'Reeducation
 through labor" sentences were used to circumvent the formal criminal process in the
 cases of some 1979 Democracy Wall activists, and appear to have been used in the
 same way to deal with some persons involved in the spring 1989 demonstrations.
 In 1990 Chinese officials stated that 869,934 Chinese citizens had been assigned
 to these camps since 1980, with about 80,000 assigned each year and 160,000 under-
 g ing "reeducation through labor" at that time. Justice Mstry officials reiterated
 te 160,000 figure in 1991. Other estimates of the number of inmates are consider-
 ably higher The Government says that terms of detention run from a normal mini-
 mum~ 1f year to a maximum of 3, although the "labor reeducation" committee may
 extend an inmate's sentence for a maximum of 1 year if his "reform attitude" is not
 good.
 The number of persons in Chinese penal institutions considered  litical prisoners
 by international standards is impossible to estimate accurately. Wile government
 officials deny that the China has any "political" prisoners, they have stated in the
 White Paper on criminal reform that there are 680 prisons and "reform through
 labor" institutions, holding 1.1 million inmates. According to the Government, 0.5
 percent of these were convicted of "counterrevolutionary crimes," for a total of
 roughly 5,500 "counterrevolutionary" convicts. Chinese omicials gave an Australian
 human rights delegation in November a somewhat lower figure of 4,000 persons
 serving sentences or "counterrevolutionary" crimes. These figures include a sub-
 stantial number convicted of crimes such as espionage that are internationally rec-
 ognized criminal offenses. On the other hand, the figures exclude detainees in labor
 reeducation camps and an undetermined number sentenced for criminal offenses
 due solely to their political and religious activities.
 
 
 Estimates by some foreign researchers of the number of political and other pris-
 oners are much higher. Many prominent activists, including Chen Ziming, Wang
 Juntao, Wang Dan, and Wei Jingsheng, remained imprisoned in 1992. Trials of per-
 sons linked by the Government to the 1989 demonstrations continued in 1992. In
 the most closely watched trial Baa Tong was sentenced on July 21 to 7 years in
 prison. His appeal was rejected on August 6. Because he had already been detained
 or 3 years before his triai, he will become eligible for release after 4 years, in May
 1996. Bao was convicted for allegedly leaking state secrets and engaging in incite-
 ment for "counterrevolutionary" purposes. Gao Shan Bao's alleged accomplice, was
 given a 4-year sentence in August. Later that montI, economist Wu Jiaxiang, an-
 other Bao Tong associate, was given a 3-year sentence and released because of time
 served. The Government asserted that the trials had been fair and had resulted in
 lenient sentences but they were actually characterized by predetermined verdicts,
 effective denial of defense, and exclusion of independent observers. While some 1989
 cases were still being tried in 1992 other democracy movement activists were com-
 pleting their sentences. Li Minqi, Peng Rong, Chen Fugong, and Xiao Yuan, among
 others, finished their sentences and were released. In August the Government told
 an American human rights monitor that Zhu Jianbin, a 37-year-old dissident who
 had been imprisoned for 11 years because of his involvement in the Democracy
 Spring Movement of the late 1970's, had been released. Even after release, however,
 such persons have a criminal record, and their status in society, ability to be em-
 ployed, freedom to travel, and numerous other aspects of their lives are often se-
 verely restricted. This is also true in the case of persons who wer never prosecuted
 or sentenced but whom the Government still considered guilty of counterrevolution.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The au-
 thorities extensively monitor and regulate personal and family life, particularly in
 China's cities. Most persons in urban areas still depend on their government-linked
 work unit for housing, permission to marry or have a child, approval to apply for
 a passport, and other aspects of ordinary life. The work unit, along with the neigh-
 borhood watch committee, is charged with monitoring activities and attitudes. How-
 ever, changes in the economic structure, including the growing diversity of employ-
 ment opportunities and the increasing market orientation of many work units, are
 beining to undermine the effectiveness of this system. Search warrants are re-
 quired by law before security forces can search premises, but this provision is often
 ignored. In addition, both the public security bureau and prcuracy apparently can
 issue search warrants on their own authority.
 The 1982 Constitution states that "freedom and privacy of correspondence of citi-
 zens ** * are protected by law," but according to a Western expert on Chinese law,
 such legislation does not exist. In practice, some telephone conversations are re-
 corded, and mail is frequently opened and censored. The Government has continued
 its effort to control citizens' access to outside sources of information, selectively jam-
 ming Chinese language broadcasts of the Voice of America (VOA) and British Broad-
 casting Corporation. Despite the effort made to jam VOA the effectiveness of the
 jamming varies considerably by region, with audible signals reaching most parts of
 China.
 The compounds in which foreign diplomats, journalists, and business people live
 are under close physical surveillance, have conspicuously placed television cameras
 in elevators, and are presumed to be universally electronically monitored. Chinese
 wishing to visit foreigners are deterred by this pervasive system of monitoring.
 Since the 1989 crackdown, the Government has intensified its efforts to restrict con-
 tact between Chinese citizens and foreigners.
 China's population has roughly doubled in the past 40 years. As a result of in-
 creasing population pressure, in the 1970's and 1980's China adopted a comprehen-
 sive and highly intrusive family planning policy. This policy most heavily affects
 Han Chinese in urban areas. For urban couples, obtaining permission to have a sec-
 ond child is very difficult. Numerous exceptions are allowed for the 70 percent of
 Han who live in rural areas. Ethnic minorities are subject to less stringent popu-
 lation controls. Enforcement of the family planning policy is inconsistent, varying
 widely from place to place and year to year.
 The population control policy relies on education, propaganda, and economic in-
 centives, as well as more coercive measures, including psychological pressure and
 economic penalties. Rewards for couples who adhere to the policy include monthly
 stipends and preferential medical, food, and educational benefits. Disciplinary meas-
 ures against those who violate the policy include stiff fines (up to the equivalent of
 $4,000 in some parts of China), withholding of social services, demotion, and other
 administrative punishments, including, in some instances, loss of employment. Un-
 paid fines have sometimes resulted in confiscation or destruction of personal prop-
 erty. Because penalties for excess births can be levied against local officials and the
 
 
 545
 mothers' work units, many individuals are affected, providing multiple sources of
 pressure. Physical compulsion to submit to abortion or sterilization is not authorized
 but has continued to occur as officials strive to meet population targets. Chinese of-
 ficials acknowledge privately that there are still instances of forced abortions and
 sterilizations in remote, rural areas, although the number of such cases is well
 below levels of the early 1980's. While recognizn that abuses occur, officials main.
 tain that the Government does not condone force aborton or sterilization and that
 abuses by local officials are punished. They admit, however, that punishment is rare
 and have not documented any cases where punishment has occurred.
 Data from the relatively comprehensive 1990 census shows that the average num-
 ber of children per family (2.3) and the population growth rate (1.5 percent) re-
 mained significantly higher than comprehensive national enforcement ofofficial pl-
 icy would produce. Official reports in 1991 that China's population was already 1.15
 billion forced the Government to abandon the decade-old target of a poulation
 below 1.2 billion in the year 2000. In April 1992, noting that China was at  peak
 of a baby boom, State Family Planning Commission Minister Peng Peiyun referred
 to a revised target of 1.294 billion but warned that the country could not afford to
 relax its family planning policies.
 At least, five provincial governments have implemented regulations with eugenics
 provisions, beginning with Ganu in 1988. These regulations seek to prevent peple
 with severe mental handicaps from having children. National family plannin offi-
 cials say they oppose such legislation, but the Government has taken no action to
 override these local laws.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and self-expression remain
 severely restricted, although there has been a slight easing of these limits. Toler-
 ance of some criticism of government policies and officials, which had been curtailed
 after June 1989, began to reemerge in 1992. Citizens are still not permitted to criti-
 cize publicly senior leaders or to express opinions that contradict basic Communist
 Party doctrine which provides for a Socialist state under the party's exclusive con-
 trol. The Government interprets these principles as circumscribing the various indi-
 vidual rights guaranteed m the Chinese Constitution. People who violate these
 guidelines are punished.
 While television and radio broadcasting and the press remain under party and
 government control and are used to propagate the currently acceptable ideological
 line, some more adventurous programs, like the popular "Stories From the Editorial
 Room," began to appear on Chinese television in 1992. Several of director Zhang
 Yimou's critically acclaimed films, which had previously been distributed abroad but
 not in China, were finally permitted to be shown in Chinese theaters or broadcast
 on Chinese television. In August Politburo member Li Ruihuan called for cultural
 reforms to accompany the countr/s economic liberalization drive and argued for a
 relaxation of censorship and political control over artistic works.
 After June 1989, the Government had banned works by authors considered politi-
 cally unacceptable but in 1992 journalist Dai Qing, one of the banned writers, had
 her novella "Snowball" published in a literary anthology. In May the People's Uni-
 versity Press printed "Trends of History," an anthology of articles by liberal intellec-
 tuals. The book was quickly banned by hardline authorities, but 30,000 copies were
 distributed nevertheless.
 The Government continued to suspect foreign journalists' activities. Some were
 beaten and briefly detained after they tried to cover an attempted one-man dem-
 onstration at Tiananmen Square in June to mark the anniversary of the 1989 pro-
 tests. Foreign journalists have reported searches of their offices by public security
 officials and other episodes of surveillance and harassment.
 The Government has continued to impose tight controls on colleges universities,
 and research institutes. The entering freshman classes at Beijing University an
 Shanghai's Fudan University were again sent to military camps for a year of train-
 ing and ideological indoctrination. The State Education Commission has either
 censored or prohibited numerous textbooks and scholarly works. Mandatory political
 study sessions continued on campus and in the workplace, although an August com-
 mentary in the official Economic Daily criticized workplace political study sessions
 as a waste of time.
 The heavy ideological control of academic institutions and media censorship have
 forced Chinese journalists and scholars to exercise caution. According to reports in
 the Western press, Ding Zilin, a professor at People's University, was stripped in
 1992 of her Communist Party membership and banned from advising graduate stu-
 dents because she had protested her son's killing during the 1989 crackdown at
 Tiananmen Square in interviews with foreign reporters. Many scholars, including
 
 
 546
 some of China's most prominent, have been deterred from exercising free speech and
 have declined opportunities to publish or present papers on subects which they fear
 could be construed as sensitive. On some less sensitive but still controversia sub-
 jects, such as economic policy and the Three Gorges Dam Preject, the Government
 has tolerated mere vigorous public debate.
 b. Freedom of Peacefu Assembly and Associdaon.-While the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of peaceful assembly and association, these rights are severely re-
 stricted in practice. The Constitution provides, for example, that such activities may
 not infringe "upon the interests of the State and in practice protests against the
 political system or its leaders are proscribed.
 Applicaions for demnstrations in 1992 by dissident labor leader Han Dongfang,
 Zhang Fengying (the spouse of political prisoner Ren Wanding), and Hou Xiaotian
 (the spouse of poitical prisoner Wang Junta) were disapprved. 'The Government
 maintains that sme demonstrations have been authorized,-but independent observ-
 ers have not been able to confirm any demonstrations which involved expression of
 dissident politicl views.
 The CG  organizes and control professional and other mass associations for the
 most part. All organizations are required by 1990 regulations  to be officially reg-
 istered and approved. Ostensily aimed at secret socie and and criminal gangs, the
 regulations a   deter the formation of unauthorized political or labor organzations.
 They have also been used to disband .rops, such as unrgistered house churches,
 deeme potentall   subversve. Secrty fres mainn a cls watch on groups
 formed outside the party establishment. The Government often montr and re-
 stricts contact between foreers and Chinese citizens particularly disident.
 c. FWreedom of Relion.    pression of religion in dhina tihtned in early 1991
 with the Communist Party Central Committee's publication of Document Number
 6, which urged imposing tighter control over religious practice. The situation be.
 came more complex in 1992, with the Government placing renewed emphasis on re-
 form that would offer the government-sanctioned religious leaders an opportunity to
 speak out against abuses by "leftist' officials. Religious freedom in China neverthe-
 less remained subject to restrictions of varying severity. While the Constitution af-
 firms toleration of religious beliefs, the Government restricts religious practice out-
 side officially recognized and government-controlled religious organizations. Reli-
 gious proselytizing is officially restricted to government-registered and sanctioned
 places of worship. Unauthorized proselytizing is proscribed and sometimes pun-
 ished, although some discreet proselytizing and distributing of religious texts out-
 side official channels is tolerated. Local authorities have confiscated private prop-
 erty under the guise of searching for ilela religious materials.
 The management and control[of religion isthe resonsibility of religious affairs
 bureaus across China, staffed primarily by party membrs. Officially sanctioned re-
 ligious organizations are permitted to maintain international contacts as long as
 these do not entail foreign control, but proselytizing by foreign groups is forbidden.
 While some Catholic seminarians have been allowed to study at seminaries abroad,
 others have been refused permission to leave China for study at foreign seminaries.
 The Government, after forcefully suppressing all relous observances during the
 1966-76 cultural revolution, began in the late 1970s to restore or replace con-
 riscated churches, temples, mosques, and monasteries. The official religious organi-
 zations administer more than a dozen Catholic and Protestant seminaries, nine in-
 stitutes to train imams and Islamic scholars, and institutes to train Buddhist
 monks. Students who attend these institutes must demonstrate "political reliabil-
 ity," and all graduates must pass an examination on their theological and political
 knowledge to cTualify for the clergy. The Government supervises the publication of
 religious material for distribution to ensure reliqious and political conformity.
 Buddhists are by far the largest body of religious believers in China. The Govern-
 ment estimates that there are 100 million Chinese Buddhists, most of whom belong
 to the dominant Han ethnic group. Other Buddhists belong to the Tibetan, Mongo-
 lian, and other ethnic groups. Han Buddhist leaders generally cooperate with the
 Government and there havebeen few reports of difficulties.
 In Tibet, however, where Buddhism and Tibetan nationalism are closely inter-
 twined, relations between Buddhists and secular authorities have been tense. The
 Government tightly controls Tibetan Buddhism and does not tolerate religious mani-
 festations that advocate Tibetan independence. The Government condemns the
 Dalai Lama's political activities and his leadership of a "government in exile," but
 recognizes him as a major religious figure and has not clamped down on the open
 veneration of the Dalai Lama by Tibetans. Large amounts of money are being de.
 voted by the Government to reconstruction of the main sacred sites, including the
 Potala Palace. The practice of religion in Tibet is hampered, however, by the limits
 the Government imposes on religious education and by the small size of the reli.

 gious community comlaed to traditional norms. Monks at some Tibetan mon-
 asteries known or their opposition to Chinese rule face severe travel restrictions.
 In areas with large Muslim populations, particularly Xinjiang, Qinghai and
 Ningxia, there continues to be concern regarding the sharp restriction, on the bid-
 ing of mosques and the religious education of youths under 18 mandated by the
 1_988 religion law. Folowing the 1990 unrest in Xnjiang, the authorities issued reg-
 ulations further restricting religious activities and teaching. China permits Muslim
 citizens to make the haj to Mecca, but limited state financing effectively constrains
 the number of hajjis. Nongovement sources indicate that about 1,500 Chinese
 make the hal4 annually.
 Daoim, widely practiced in South China, is officially respected as an important
 part of traditional Chinese culture, but some of its practices conflicting with govern-
 ment strictures against superstition and waste of arable land have been sharply
 criticized in the press. Traditional folk religion appears to be flourishing in some
 areas (parts of rural Sichuan, for example) despite official opposition to "feudal su-
 perstition."
 Only those Christian churches affiliated with either the Catholic Patriotic Asso-
 ciation or the (Protestant) Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which the Government
 established in the 1950's to eliminate perceived foreign domination of Christian
 groups, may operate openly. Church membership is growing rapidly. In addition, ac-
 tive unofficial religious movements pose an alternative to the state-regulated
 churches and temples. The unofficial, Vatican-affiliated, Catholic Church claims a
 membership far larger than the 3.6 million registered with the official Catholic
 Church, though actual figures are unknown. It has its own bishops and priests and
 conducts its own services. In addition to the 4.5 million persons who are officially
 counted as following Protestantism, a large number of Protestants worship privately
 in "house churches" that are independent of government control. There is a dynamic
 house church movement in many cities and, like their unofficial Catholic counter-
 parts, house churches often attract more followers than the official Three-Self Patri-
 otic movement churches.
 The Government generally tolerates the existence of unofficial Catholic and
 Protestant churches as long as they remain small and discreet. In some parts of
 South and East China, official and underground churches seem to coexist and even
 cooperate. In other parts of South and East China and in Inner Mongolia, Hebei,
 an Henan provinces, there continued to be credible reports in 1992 of efforts by
 authorities to rein in activities of the unapproved Catholic and Protestant move-
 ments, including raiding and closing a number of unregistered churches.
 Authorities in areas including northeast China montor religious believers, restrict
 the movements of clergy, and control enrollment in seminaries. This repression has
 reflected official concern over the Government's inability to control the rapid growth
 of membership in Christian groups.
 Some elderiy Catholic priests like Hebei Bishop Liu Guandong, Tianjin Bishop Li
 Side, Zhejiang Vicar Wang Y'ijun, and Henan Vicar Jin Dechen were given condi-
 tional releases in 199.. Some reports suggsted that elderly Catholic bisho Fan
 Xueyan ma , have been beaten prior to his death in official custody in Hebe] prov-
 ince in April. Another Hebei Bishop, Li Zhenrong, also died in April, shortly after
 his release from detention. Many bishops, priests, and lay people remained in deten-
 tion or "reeducation." Gansu Bishop Casimir Wang Milu and Hebei priest Pei
 Ronggui were still imprisoned. Despite official assurances to the contrary, Shanghai
 Bishop Fan Zongliang remained under the Public Security Bureau's restriction of
 "out on bail pending trial," which prohibits him from saying Mass in public, meeting
 with foreigners, or leaigShangai. Protestant faced the same sort of pressure
 as Catholics. Members of the Guangzhou house church of Pastor Samuel Lamb (Lin
 Xiangao) faced intermittent harassment by local authorities, though the church re-
 mained open. Although some Protestant leaders and believers remained in detention
 or reeducation fo     er religious activities, others like Song Yude and Ding Hai of
 Henan, Sun idian of Guangdng, and Xie Moshan of Shanghai were said to have
 been released. In May credible unofficial sources reported that Liu Huanwen, a
 Christian who carried a cross at the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations, had been re-
 leased.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Count  Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government uses an identification card system to control and re-
 strict residence patterns within the country. This system's effectiveness has eroded
 during the economic reform of the last decade. The need for a supplemental work
 force in major cities has led to general, Albeir   official tolerance for a large
 itinerant population which is not in compliance with formal requirements to obtain
 permission to change residence.
 
 
 548
 A May 1983 State Council notice on the resettlement of ex-convicts stipulates that
 in principle they should be repatriated to their former residences or to where their
 immediate relatives live. However, some former inmates have been denied permis-
 sion, under the "staying at prison employment" system, to return to their homes,
 according to human rights organizations. For those assigned to camps far from their
 residences, this constitutes a form of internal exile. While the Ministry of Justice
 claims that only 200 to 300 former prisoners are currently held under this system,
 outside observers place the number much higher.
 While routinely permitting foreign travel or emigration by almost all Chinese who
 wish to do so, the Government has placed obstacles in the way of foreign travel by
 a few citizens on political or other grounds. Well-known dissidents like Hou
 Xiaotian, Yu Haocheng, and Li Honglin have been unable to obtain permission to
 travel abroad. Activist Xiong Yan was only able to leave the country by traveling
 without official authorization. Other prominent figures like labor leader Han
 Dongfang, writers Wang Ruowang and Bai Hua, scientist Wen Yuankai, journalists
 Wang Ruoshui, Zhang Weiguo, and Zhu Xingqing, and scholar Liu Qing were even-
 tually able to obtain the passports and exit permits needed to leave the country, In
 some instances, exit permission was granted only after the United States other gov-
 ernments or international human rights organizations repeatedly raised particular
 cases with the Government. Regulations issued in 1990 require those college and
 university graduates who received free postsecondary education to repay the cost of
 their education to the State by workin for 5 ears or more before being eligible for
 passports to go abroad to study. For those who have overseas Chinese relatives or
 have not yet graduated the regulations provide a sliding scale of tuition reimburse-
 ment exempting them from the work requirement. Implementation of these regula-
 tions has varied from place to place, and most students are still managing to obtain
 Fassports. Persons subject to the regulations on study abroad appear to have had
 ittle trouble obtaining passports to visit relatives overseas. Political attitudes, how-
 ever, are still a major criterion in selecting people for government-sponsored study
 abroad.
 The Government has made a concerted effort to attract back to China persons
 who have studied overseas. To reassure them, the official Xinhua News Agency re-
 ported that, effective July 1, Chinese citizens who returned from overseas would no
 longer be required to go through re-exit formalities, which had involved Public Secu-
 rity Bureau clearances. In August the Government made public a State Council cir-
 cular welcoming students to return to China. The official China Daily invoked Deng
 Xiaoping as the authority for these measures, stating that during his southern
 China tour early in 1992, Deng had pointed out that people who are studying over-
 seas may return 'regardless of-their past political views.-The article cautioned that
 before returning home, people who have joined foreign organizations hostile to
 China should uit them and refrain from activities that violate Chinese law. Procu-
 rator General Liu Fuzhi warned in March, however, that people wanted by the pub-
 lic security authorities were not covered by the official assurances extended to other
 overseas scholars.
 Some activists managed to reenter China in 1992, while others were prevented
 from returning. Journalist Dai Qing, who had been allowed to leave China in late
 1991 to do research at Harvard, was able to travel back to Beijing in the summer
 of 1992, after some initial difficulties, and then leave again for the United States.
 Others including dissident writer Xu Gang, also returned, apparently without inci-
 dent. goston-based student activist Shen Tong was released from almost 8 weeks
 of detention only after agreeing to depart China for the United States immediately.
 Some individuals, like Luo Haixing in Hong Kong and Harvard University student
 Gong Xiaoxia, were refused permission to reenter China, according to credible re-
 ports. A handful of prominent dissidents overseas continued to have difficulty in ex-
 tending or renewing passports.
 The Government accepts the repatriation of citizens who have entered other coun-
 tries or territories illegally, in most cases apparently without punishing them, al-
 though Lin Guizhen, a Chinese woman deported from Japan while seeking political
 asylum, was assigned to 6 or 12 months (accounts vary) of "reeducation" for leaving
 China without authorization.
 Although the Government denies having tightened its policy on accepting Viet-
 namese refugees, in recent years very few such refugees have actually been reset-
 tled in China. According to Chinese official figures, from 1989 to 1991 China grant-
 ed admission and provided resettlement to about 130 Vietnamese refugees who
 came to China to reunite with their families, and gave temporary refuge to 35 Viet-
 namese who subsequently settled in third countries. There were credible reports
 that larger numbers of Vietnamese have remained in China without official harass-
 ment. China has cooperated with Hong Kong to reduce the flow of Vietnamese refu-
 
 
 549
 gees into the colony. Although China has signed the Comprehensive Plan of Action
 negotiated at the International Conference on Indochinese Refugees in 1989, it is
 unclear whether China considers itself a 'participating state."
 Credible reports suggest that China has generally repatriated persons of other na-
 tionalities seeking refugee status. The Government stated in April it had granted
 temporary refue to an unspecified number of Burmese refugees, and denied press
 reports that Chinese border troops had attacked such refugees. No independent con-
 firmation is possible. In July China expelled to Pakistan aot 160 Afghan refugees,
 apparently without informing the Unie  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and despite the fact that the UNHCR had accepted the Afghans as 'per-
 sons of concern' and was in the process of deciding whether they qualified as refu-
 gees under the U.N. Convention on Refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens lack the means legally to change their government, nor can they freely
 choose or change the laws and offikals that govern them. China is ruled by the
 Communist Party, the paramount source of political authority. Within the party, a
 closed inner circle of a few senior leaders reserves the right to set ultimate policy
 directions. Some hold key positions within the standing committee of the Politburo,
 the Central Military Commission or other organs. Others, nominally retired, con-
 tinue to exercise great political influence. Deng Xiaoping, now 88, forcefully
 reasserted his de facto preeminence within the Chinese political leadership in 1992.
 According to the 1982 Constitution, the National People's Congress (NPC) is the
 highest organ of state power. It nominally selects the President and Vice President,
 decides on the choice of the Premier, and elects the Chairman of the Central Mili-
 tary Commission. The election and agenda of the NPC remains under tight control
 by the Communist Party. However, in March and April the NPC conducted rel-
 atively open debate and voting on the controversial issue of the Three Gorges Dam
 Project.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no independent Chinese organizations that publicly monitor or com-
 ment on human rights conditions in China. The Government has made it clear it
 will not tolerate the existence of such groups. After being detained in Shanghai in
 the spring of 1991 for publishing a human rights newsletter, Fu Shenqi was con-
 victed in 1992 of "counterrevolutionary" crimes; two others detained in the same in-
 cident were released without trial. However, three intellectuals, Guo Luoji, Yu
 Haocheng, and Wang Ruoahui, joined the board of an international human rights
 organization in 1992. Representatives from some international human rights groups,
 but not others, managed to get permission to visit China, but even in these cases
 access to information remained very limited.
 Despite the Government's adherence to the United Nations Charter, which man-
 dates respect for and promotion of human rights, Chinese officials d not accept the
 principle that human rights are universal. They argue that each nation has its own
 concept of human rights, grounded in its political, economic, and social system and
 its historical, religious, and cultural background. Officials no longer dismiss all dis-
 cussion of human rights as interference in the country's internal affairs but remain
 reluctant to accept criticism of China's human rights situation by other nations or
 international organizations. They reject reports by Amnesty International, Asia
 Watch, and other international human rights mnitoring groups on torture and
 other human rights violations. The Chinese~ore  Ministry characterized as unac-
 ceptable the Department of State's 1991 report on human rights practices in China.
 Chinese officials have stepped up their criticism of human rights problems in other
 countries while arguing, paradoxically, that foreigners have no right to criticize
 human rights abuses in China.
 The State Council information office published White Papers in 1992 on China's
 criminal justice system and on Tibet. While the reports stridntly  en  Chinese
 practices in both areas and glossed over fundamental problems, some critics saw
 them as offering a modest opening for further debate on these subjects. After pub-
 lishing the Whi'te Paper on the justice system, Justice Minister Cai Cheng stated
 that China was willing to promote contact and cooperation with foreign countries
 in criminal reform, but how far China is prepared to go in this area remains to be
 seen.
 Chinese officals continued efforts be un in 1991 to promote academic study and
 discussion of concepts of human rights, Research institutes in Shanghai and emjing
 organized symposia on human rights and established human rights research cen-
 
 
 550
 ters. A 4-member delegation from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences visited
 the United Kingdom France, and Sweden in February and March to study human
 rights practices in these countries. Such activities appear to have originated in a
 desire to improve China's image abroad and strengthen the Government's ability to
 respond to criticism of its human rights record. Chinese authorities continued their
 limited dialog with foreign governments on human rights issues in talks with a
 number of visiting delegations from the United States, the United Kingdom Aus-
 tralia, and other countries and also during visits abroad by Chinese leaders. What-
 ever the motivation, this process of study and dial
 to international standards and concepts ofhuman  tg has exposed more Chinese
 At the same time, Chinese authorities have refused requests by forei  human
 rights delegations to meet with political prisoners and certain former po-ticalde-
 tainees and dissidents and have turned aside calls by the United States and other
 governments and by human rights groups for International Committee of the Red
 Cross access to prisoners. Three Canadian legislators were expelled from China in
 January, apparently for having planned to make a symbolic gesture against human
 rights abuses. In a similar incident in April, a British parliamentarian and several
 European labor leaders were required to leave the country. An Australian human
 rights group led by Senator Schacht was refused permission to visit Tibet.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 While laws exist to protect minorities and women, in practice discrimination
 based on ethnicity, sex, and religion has persisted. Areas in which discrimination
 exists include housing, jobs, and education. Minorities benefit from a policy of *privi-
 leged treatment" in marriage, family planning, university admission, and employ-
 ment, as well as disproportionate infrastructure investment in some minority areas.
 In practice, however, discrimination based on ethnic origin persists, and the concept
 of a largely homogeneous Chinese people pervades the general thinking of the Han
 ethnic majority.
 The 55 designated ethnic minorities constitute just over 8 percent of China's total
 population. Most minority groups reside in areas they have traditionally inhabited,
 with standards of living often well below the national average. Government develop-
 ment policies have helped raise minority living standards but have at the same time
 disrupted traditional living patterns. In August the Dalai Lama asserted that the
 Government's plan to develop Tibet's economy would lead to a massive influx into
 Tibet of Han Chinese. This process already affects the ethnic mixture in LIasa, as
 tens of thousands of Han entrepreneurs move in.
 In some instances, the Government has tried to adopt policies responsive to mi-
 nority sensitivities but in doing so has encountered the dilemma of how to respect
 minority cultures without damaging minority interests. In Tibet and Xinjiang, for
 example, there are two-track school systems using standard Chinese and minority
 languages. Students can choose which system to attend. One side effect of this pol-
 icy to protect and maintain minority cultures has been reinforcement of a seg-
 regated society. Under this separate education system, those graduating from mi-
 nority schools are at a disadvantage in competing for jobs in government and busi-
 ness, which require good spoken Chinese. These graduates must take remedial Ian-
 guage instruction before attending universities and colleges.
 The CCP's avowed policy of boosting minority representation in the Government
 and the CCP has led to some increase in the number of members of minorities in
 leadership slots. This has failed, however, to alter the reality that ethnic minorities
 are effectively shut out of all but a few positions of real political and decisionmaking
 power. Some minorities resent Han officials holding key positions in minority auton-
 omous regions. Ethnic minorities in Tibet, Xinjiang, and elsewhere have dem-
 onstrated against Han Chinese authority. Central authorities have made it clear
 that they will not tolerate opposition to Beijing's rule in minority regions. Although
 martial law in Lhasa was lifted in 1990, Tibetans like Yulo Dawa Tsering, Ngawang
 Pulchung, and Jempel Tsering remained imprisoned in 1992. According to human
 rights organizations, demonstrations were held in Lhasa in March, with four monks
 and three nuns beaten and detained by public security forces. Another group of Ti-
 betans was said to have been arrested in June. Smaller scale protests are reported
 to occur frequently in the Tibetan capital. While repression continued, there was at
 the same time a resumption of dialog on Tibet. In the summer, the Dalai Lama's
 brother Gyalo Thondup visited Beijing, in the highest level contact between a rep-
 resentative of the Dalai Lama and the Government since 1989. China's White Paper
 on Tibet excoriated the "Dalai Lama's clique" for its advocacy of "separatist" prac-
 tices but left the door slightly ajar for further contacts.
 Ethnic tension in inner Mongolia and Xinjiang persisted at a low level. Three
 Inner Mongolian independence activists were given sentences ranging from 2 to 8
 
 
 years on charges of engaging in "splittist propaganda," according to press reports
 from Hong Kong. Following a bomb explosion in Urumqi in February, the head of
 the Xinjiang regional government accused separatists of stepping up sabotage and
 subversion and said the army, police, and militia were being mobiliied against this
 threat.
 The 1982 Constitution states that "women in the People's Republic of China enjoy
 equal rights with men in all spheres of life," and promises, among other things,
 equal pay for equal work. In fact, most women employed in industry work in lower
 skille and lower paid jobs. Women hold relatively few positions of significant influ-
 ence within the party or government structure. Persistent problems have remained
 with regard to the status of women, who have often been the unintended victims
 of reforms designed to streamline enterprises and give workers greater job mobility.
 Many employers prefer to hire men to avoid the expense of maternity leave and
 childcare. Rports by women of discrimination, sexual harassment, unfair dismis-
 sal, demotion, and wage cuts have continued. In March the NPC enacted legislation
 on the protection of the rights and interests of women designed to assist in curbing
 these types of sex-relatd discrimination.
 While the gap in the education levels of men and women is narrowing, men con-
 tinue to constitute the majority of the educated, particularly the highly educated,
 and government-funded sc olarships for overseas study go disproportionately to
 men.
 The Government strongly condemns and is working hard to curb the abduction
 and selling of women for wives, abuse of female children, violence against women,
 and female infanticide. It has severely punished a number of people accused of such
 crimes. Many discriminatory practices are rooted in traditional rural attitudes
 which highly value boys as prospective earners and as future caretakers for elderly
 parents. A number of provinces have sought to reduce the perceived higher economic
 value of boys in providing old age support by establishing or improving pensions and
 retirement homes.
 Female infanticide has persisted in impoverished rural areas. Insistence that local
 units meet population goals contributes to the persistence of this traditional prac-
 tice, generally carried out by parents who hope to have more sons without incurring
 official punishment. The Government strongly condemns infanticide and has pros-
 ecuted offenders but has been unable to eradicate the practice.
 There is evidence of discrimination in China on the basis of religion. Party offi-
 cials state that party membership and religious belief are incompatible. This places
 a serious limitation on religious believers, since party membership is required for
 almost all high positions in government and commerce. While there are some reli-
 gious believers in the CCP, especially in minority autonomous regions, few hold sub-
 stantial leadership positions. Officials responsible for religious affairs work are gen-
 erally not believers in religion.
 Another group against whom the Government discriminates is political prisoners'
 families. Zhang Fenying, wife of imprisoned activist Ren Wanding, was evicted,
 along with her sick teenage daughter, from her apartment in April. Ren's work unit
 owns the apartment. The work unit apparently wanted to reassign the housing to
 another worker. This is but one example of the kind of discrimination the familes
 of political prisoners sometimes encounter in obtaining jobs or permission to travel
 abroad, and in obtaining or keeping housing.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-China's 1982 Constitution provides for "freedom of
 association, but the guarantee is heavily diluted by references to the interest of the
 State and the leadership of the CCP. Though union officials recognize that workers'
 interests may not always coincide with those of the party, the union law passed at
 the National People's Congress in March states that the union is a CCP organ and
 its primary purpose is to mobilize workers for national development. The country's
 sole officially recognized workers' organization, the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions (ACFTU), ostensibly independent, is in fact CCP controlled. There are no
 overtly operating independent trade unions in China. While union membership is
 voluntary for individual employees, enterprises are generally required to have a
 union. Most state sector and uran workers are members of ACFTU chapters. Un-
 employed workers are not considered union members. Workers in companies with
 foreign investors are guaranteed the right to form unions (which then must affiliate
 with the ACFTU). Some managers of such companies report significant union activ-
 ity and have had to bargain with these unions over wages and benefits. Union offi-
 cials state that only 20 percent of joint and wholly foreign-owned ventures have
 unions, but add that the proportion is much higher in larger firms and in companies
 with investments by North American and European partners. These officials, who
 
 
 552
 attribute the lack of unions in other companies with foreign investors to the new-
 ness of the firms, claim to be actively organizing unions in unorganized companies
 with fore  investors and report little opposition from the fore  owners.
 The right to strike, which "had been included in China's 197 and 1978 constitu-
 tions, was not retained in the 1982 Constitution. In 1983, however, the ACFTU
 Chairman asserted that, if a trade union and its labor protection safety officers de-
 termine that a workplace is too dangerous, the union would organize the workers
 to leave the hazardous areas. This limited right to protest or strike was reasserted
 in a committee chairman's speech before the National People's Congress in March
 explaining the 1992 Trade Union Law; the law, itself, enables the union to "suggest
 that the staff and workers withdraw from the sites of danger" and to participate
 in accident investigations. In general, the union law passed in 1992 assigned unions
 the role of mediators or go-betweens with management in cases of work stoppages
 or slowdowns. While Ministry of Labor Officials deny that any strikes have recently
 taken place, Western and Chinese press and business people report labor unrest and
 even factory wide strikes occurred on an increased scale during the summer and
 spring. This has been particularly well-documented in Tianjin and Northeast China,
 where workers struck or engaged in violent acts when state enterprises began to
 fire excess workers. In response to worker unhappiness, the Government modified
 its labor reform efforts reducing administrative pressures to fire workers at the
 same time as rapid economic growth reduced the economic pressure. The result was
 a diminution in tension between workers and management by the end of the year.
 Since late 1991 the Western press has reported increasing underground union ac-
 tivity throughout China including one workers' movement that models itself on the
 Poland's Solidarity. Indep ent labor leader Han Dongfang, whom the PRC al-
 lowed after many delays to travel abroad, told the press in Hong Kong in September
 that workers in many parts of China are forming small "self-motivated" organiza-
 tions focused on worker welfare and factory floor issues. Press reports indicate that
 the Government is attempting to stamp out all clandestine union activity and that
 independent unions and worker groups feature prominently in lists of illegal organi-
 zations. There have been reports of additional union-related detentions in 1992, and
 some worker leaders who attempted to form independent unions in 1989 are still
 in detention. ACFTU international activities are subject to CCP policy guidance.
 The ACFTU claims to have contact with trade unions in over 120 countries, without
 regard to the foreign union's ideological orientation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Government does not
 permit collective bargaining in most enterprises. Without legal status as a collective
 argaining body, the ACFTUs role has been limited to consultations with manage-
 ment over wages and regulations affecting labor and working conditions and efforts
 to serve as a conduit for communicating workers' complaints to the management of
 enterprises or municipal labor bureaus. The ACFTU has shown itself concerned
 about protecting workers' living standards in areas such as unemployment insur-
 ance.
 Under the labor contract system that now covers approximately 10 percent of Chi-
 na's urban work force, individual workers may negotiate with management over
 contract terms. Although the number of workers involved is still proportionally low,
 since the practice started under reforms initiated in the late 1980's and was given
 new emphasis in 1992 the old permanent employment system is giving way to the
 more flexible contract-based system. When enterprises change the terms of employ-
 ment from permanent to contract based, however, the employees have no oppor-
 tunity to negotiate this basic structural change individually or collectively, but can
 only seek to modify the details of their new contracts. Only the very few workers
 with highly technical skills are able to negotiate effectively on salary and fringe ben-
 efits issues.
 A 1988 law states that trade unions in private enterprises, which currently em-
 ploy only about 1 percent of urban workers, have the right to represent employees
 and to conclude collective bargaining agreements. There have been no rep rts of
 unions in private enterprises actuall engaging in collective bargaining over wages,
 contract, or safety issues. The ACFU, which has never attempted collective bar-
 gaining, has taken the view that it is the sole legitimate Chinese workers' organiza-
 tion and is accordingly the appropriate union to organize the workers in private en-
 terprises.
 Worker congresses, held periodically in most Chinese enterprises, theoretically
 have the authority to remove incompetent managers and approve major decisions
 affecting the enterprise (notably wage and bonus distribution systems). Worker con-
 gresses generally take place only once a year, however, and serve essentially to
 rubberstamps agreements worked out between factory managers, party secretaries,
 and union representatives.
 
 
 553
 A dispute settlement procedure has been in effect since 1987. The procedure pro-
 vides for two levels of arbitration committees and a final resort to the courts. Almost
 all cases are resolved at the first or second level. According to Labor Ministry offi-
 cials, most arbitration cases are filed by contract workers or their employers, an in-
 dication that the new contract system provides a clearer set of ground rules which
 both sides can attempt to enforce.
 Laws governing working conditions in China's special economic zones are not sig-
 nificantly different from those in the rest of the country. Labor Minister Ruan
 Chongwu confirmed in 1992 that a previous regulation that limited joint venture
 employees' wages to 120 percent of state enterprise employees' wages was no longer
 in force. Numerous press reports indicate that some workers in special economic
 zones, although paid more than those in Chinese state enterprises, put in regular
 workdays as long as 12 hours.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-While China has generally aban-
 doned its traditional use of massive corvee labor for constructing infrastructure
 projects and public facilities, workers are still sometimes "mobilized" to augment
 public security forces and for public works projects. Imprisonment in China usually
 entails compulsory labor. As the names imply, forced labor is a cornerstone of the
 Chinese "reform through labor" and "reeducation through labor" systems. Almost all
 persons the courts sentence to prison or forced labor camps, including political pris-
 oners, are required to work, usually for little or no compensation. China also main-
 tains a network of "reeducation through labor" camps (see Section I.e.), the inmates
 of which generally must work. Reports from human rights organizations and re-
 leased prisoners demonstrate that at least some prisoners in pretrial detention are
 also required to work.
 Chinese penal policy emphasizes 'reform first, production second," but compulsory
 labor is an integral part of the system both to rehabilitate prisoners and to help
 support the facilities. According to prison authorities, prisoners in labor reform in-
 stitutions work a full 8-hour day and must also engage in both ideological and basic
 literacy and skills training. Justice officials have stated that in labor reeducation
 facilities there is a much heavier emphasis on education than labor. Most reports
 conclude that work conditions in the penal system's export-oriented ipht manufac-
 turing factories are similar to those in ordinary factories, but conditions on labor
 farms and in coal mines are harsh. There have been an increasing number of re-
 ports that "reform through labor," and possibly 'reeducation through labor" facilities
 as wel, rent prisoners out to ordinar  a ries  work,
 The State Council's 1992 White Paper on criminal reform reported that prison
 labor production for 1990 was valued at about $500 million. This figure, which can-
 not be confirmed, would not include the output from "reeducation through labor" fa-
 cilities.
 Various Chinese newspapers have reported that Chinese prison labor is used for
 .many types of production (examplea in parenthesis): infrastructure (roads)- heavy
 industry (oal; steel); light manufacturing (clothing, shoes; small machine tools); and
 agriculture (grai, tea, sugar cane). Press reports, the 1990 Chinese Law Yearook,
 and USq. Customs Service investigations demonstrate that some of these goods are
 The U. Customs Service has issued orders barring a number of products report-
 edly made by prisoners from entering the United States and has detained several
 shipments of such goods. In 1991 the Chinese Government published a reiteration
 of its regulations barring the exprt of prison-made goods. On August 7, 1992, the
 U S. and Chinese Governments signed a memorandum of understanding on trade
 in prison labor products, which alows for beth sides to exchange information and
 evidence related to suspected exports of prison labor products Trom China to the
 United States and enable U.oicasto visit suspt facilities.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment f Children.-Regulations promulgated in 1987
 prohibit the employment of school age minors who have not completed the compul-
 sory 9 years of education. Statistics on school attendance demonstrate that approxi-
 mately 20 percent of school age children in cities and villages do not attend school
 and therefore are likely to be working. The number may well be higher in poorer
 and isolated areas, where child labor in agriculture is believed to be widespread. Of-
 ficials note that state enterprises are generally overstaffed and therefore have no
 reason to hire children. Some independent observers believe there is some employ-
 ment of adolescents below the age of 16 in private enterprises in south China but
 agree with Chinese officials that China's urban child labor problem is relatively
 minor.
 In 1991 the State Council issued regulations designed to curb child labor prob-
 lems. They impose severe fines, withdrawal of business licenses, or Jail for employ-
 ers who hire child laborers under 16 years of age. Labor officials in South China
 
 
 554
 have described an active effort to curb child labor through periodic inspection and
 fines. Thus far these officials have been reluctant to use the more stringent punish-
 ments at their disposal.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-China does not have a labor code. A draft is
 reportedly circulating, but it remains unclear if or when it will be published or made
 law.
 There is no minimum wage in China, but administrative regulations reportedly
 fix the minimum "living wage" in at least some large cities at around $10 monthly.
 Union officials report t    re a plies to those who cannot work because of long-
 term unemployment, disability or For other reasons. In Beijing all employed workers
 earn more than $20 per month. This amount is believed to be lower in areas with
 a lower cost of living. These figures do not include additional free or heavily sub-
 sidized benefits in kind which employing work units commonly provide, such as
 housing, medical care and education. Factories or ministries are required to pay 70
 percent of final monthly wages to workers laid off because of a factory closing or
 reduction in force, but there have been numerous reported violations of this practice.
 The legal standard workweek excluding overtime is 48 hours, of which 3 to 12
 hours are generally spent in political study or "education" on current social issues.
 In recent years many factories have abandoned political study either for regular
 work or for an additional half day off each week. Starting in 1991 and 1992, fac-
 tories (including joint ventures) have been allowed to have shorter workweeks if
 they choose.
 Occupational health and safety are constant themes of posters and campaigns.
 Every work unit must designate a health and safety officer; the International Labor
 Organization has established a training program for these officials. These issues
 have received increasing attention from senior officials including Premier Li Peng
 and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, but pressures for increased output, lack of financial
 resources to maintain equipment, and a traditionally poor understanding of safety
 issues by workers have contributed to poor results thus far. State prosecutors deal
 annually with thousands of negligence and accident cases involving criminal or civil
 liability. In November 1992, the Standing Committee of the National People's Con-
 gress passed a law on mining safety. The law, effective in May 1993 will establish
 standards and provide for enforcement by fines and imprisonment. Because of the
 lack of similar legislation to bring together diverse and often unpublished regula-
 tions in other health and safety areas, compliance with existing regulations is often
 haphazard.
