 LIBERIA
 Founded in 1822 by blacks who were seeking the fundamental
 liberties denied them in the United States, Liberia, the
 oldest republic in Africa, retains strong cultural and
 political ties to the United States  On April 12, 1980, a
 small group of enlisted men killed President William R.
 Tolbert, Jr. and took control of the government. While
 the coup itself was unexpected, stresses in Liberian society
 had been developing over the past decade, and significant
 change in the social and political system was anticipated.
 At the time of the coup, wealth, arable land, and political
 power were concentrated in the hands of a narrow though
 expanding elite. In sharp contrast to that elite, the
 majority of the population was living at the subsistence
 level. Even in the modern sector of the economy, wages
 could not support the spiralling demands of urban living.
 Real gross national product had scarcely grown during the
 Tolbert regime (though for reasons outside of Liberia's
 control). There had been no significant new investment in
 Liberia since 1973; in fact there had been some disinvestment.
 Development was uncoordinated, with much of the upcountry
 area isolated from modern social services.
 These formidable problems were not handled effectively by
 the Tolbert administration. Although Liberia incurred major
 foreign debts for public investment, the decline in the
 return on private investment (especially iron mining) was so
 great that the economy stagnated. Liberia's citizens viewded
 the situation as deteriorating rather than improving.
 Social mobility, although significant, was not fast enough
 for a population with very high expectations. Corruption was
 rampant among high officials including the President and his
 family.
 Despite a good human rights heritage, the Tolbert administra-
 tion in its final months altered its attitudes toward
 dissent and political liberalization. The first contested
 election since 1959 was postponed from November 1979 to
 the summer of 1980, the property restriction on the franchise
 was resurrected from de facto nonobservance to become a
 subject of much domestic concern, and the registration of an
 opposition party was delayed, though finally granted. The
 opposition party subsequently was harassed, its organizers
 arrested without charges, and student leaders similarly were
 detained. In March 1980, the leaders of the opposition
 party were accused of treason, arrested, and indicted.
 The Tolbxt' refizau Keyeelr- 9lteAted these and other
 political detainees,.
 It was against this background that on April 12, 1980, two
 days before the first anniversary of the rice riot that
 occurred in 1979, a small group of enlisted men seized power
 in Liberia, killing President Tolbert and some 27 others
 while taking over the Executive Mansion. This group estab-
 lished themselves as the all military People's Redemption
 Council (PRC) in which supreme executive, legislative and
 judicial power is vested. The council is presided over by
 its Chairman, Head of State Master Sergeant Samuel K. Doe.
 
 
 Following a round-up of some 300 persons associated witn
 the Tolbert regime, a military tribunal was established and
 following hasty trials without due process 13 former
 high officials were executed. The Liberian constitution was
 suspended by  ecree  umber 2 of April 24, 1980. Special
 tribunals were estaolished for the administration of justice.
 At present martial law is in effect, habeas corpus has
 been suspended, and a 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew is
 enforced. All civil and political rights are suspended.
 There have been some prisoners released but an estimated 100
 political prisoners remain in detention.
 The new government came in with the expressed intention of
 raising the standard of living of the people and ending
 corruption in government. One of its first actions was to
 nearly double the wages of military and government workers.
 Goals of the revolution include free and universal education
 and a more equitable distribution of income. Severe budge-
 tary constraints hamper the implementation of these goals
 although popular expectations remain high.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is currently no legal prohibition against torture.
 Charges of torture have been made by defendants in an
 alleged countercoup plot; there have been no substantiating
 reports.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 During the final months of the Toloert regime, political
 detainees were severely maltreated. Flogging, physical
 anuse, and humiliation were condoned treatments for prisoners.
 In the first weeks after the April 12 revolution, many political
 detainees were beaten, paraded half-naxed, and humiliated.
 There has been no recent indication of the continuation of
 such treatment. Because of the efforts of former Tolbert
 detainees now in high government positions, prison conditions
 in Monrovia are reported to have improved somewhat over
 conditions during the Tolbert regime. Overcrowding,
 deplorable sanitary conditions and restrictions on visita-
 tion rights are common. There is no current information on
 conditions in the upcountry prisons, at the new prison at
 Zwedru or the isolated prison at Belle Yella, which was
 notorious for extremely harsh conditions. The government
 has denied access to political prisoners by family and legal
 counsel or international humanitarian organizations.
 The government is sensitive to the problems created by the
 high number, for Liberia, of civilian detainees currently
 being held. It rejects complaints about prison conditions,
 citing the inherited physical limitations of the institu-
 tions in Liberia and a lack of resources to improve them.
 Flogging remains a legal punishment for crimes of theft.
 There is no discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion
 or social class, although the government has been reluctant to
 detain women or place them under lengthy house arrest.
 
 
 145
 c. Disappearances
 While it is often difficult to obtain information on exactly
 who is neing detained and tne location of such detention,
 there is no government policy which results in Liberians
 being secretly abducted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Tolbert regime in its last months engaged in arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment of student leaders and opposition
 organizers, culminating in the arrest of the entire leadership
 of the registered opposition party, who remained in jail until
 the April 12 coup d'etat. Following the coup, the new
 government arrested about three hundred people, mostly
 former government and military officials. Many other
 arrests were not subject to central coordination, and
 releases were effected when senior officials were informed.
 Decree Number 6 of May 13 provides that *all arrests shall
 be made by the inister of ustice after a thorough investi-
 .gation." This procedure frequently is not followed; however,
 the incidence of such arrests has declined.
 The government does not publish a list of detained persons.
 Habeas corpus has been suspended. Persons detained for
 political purposes can be detained indefinitely, and releases
 do not appear to follow any specific pattern or procedure.
 27 persons were released in early November and 22 persons
 on December 24. As of December 1980 an estimated 100
 political detainees were held, of which 65 were former
 military/security force personnel.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In the immediate aftermath of the coup, a special military
 court tried some high officials of the Tolbert government
 and the True Whig Party on charges of corruption and misuse
 of public office. Defendants were not given the right of
 legal counsel or the benefit of due process. Following
 review of the sentence by the Council, thirteen of the
 fourteen tried before this tribunal were executed on April
 22. The outcry of world public opinion was so intense that
 Head of State Doe announced on April 29 that there would no
 further executions. An additional 35 persons subsequently
 were tried under similar conditions but have not had their
 verdicts confirmed by the Council.
 During the trial before the special military tribunal of
 nine officers who were accused of plotting a countercoup,
 all of the normal legal safeguards have been followed.
 The chairman and two other members of the tribunal were
 removed from office and detained in December, and the
 tribunal ceased functioning.
 Due process is followed in the special tribunals established
 under Decree Number 3 of April 24, 1980 and in normal civil
 and criminal matters. Appeals may be made to the People's
 Supreme Tribunal, which has not yet had a sitting. Although
 no procedures have been announced, the Head of State is
 believed to have the power to grant clemency or to com-
 
 
 146
 mute sentences. The Head of State granted a general amnesty
 to approximately 250 persons on April 14, 1980, many of whom
 had been imprisoned by the Tolbert government for long
 periods without having been brought to trial.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There were numerous incidents of invasions of the home
 in the period for several months after the coup when sol-
 diers or thieves dressed in military uniforms searched at
 gunpoint for wanted persons or demanded food, drink, money
 or valuables. Homes of political detainees, persons resid-
 ing abroad, and those executed have been occupied by mili-
 tary squatters.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Liberia has a mixed economy with government participation in
 such public service corporations as the Liberian Electricity
 Corporation. Most other businesses are in private hands,
 with foreign investors owning the iron ore and rubber firms
 that account for nearly all of Liberia's export earnings.
 Per capita gross domestic product has been estimated at
 $465, although income distribution is greatly skewed, with
 50 percent of total household income claimed by the top 5
 percent of total families and the remaining 95 percent of
 households sharing the other 50 percent.
 The new government is committed to fulfilling basic human
 needs such as food, shelter, health care, employment and
 education, and has made a concerted effort to insure a
 sufficient supply of rice (the main staple) in the country.
 Of highest priority is a military housing project to replace
 the present military housing. Health care facilities are
 being improved, including the staff livilng quarters and
 child day care centers. Liberia's literacy rate in English
 is about 21 percent.
 Liberia faces serious financial problems which will limit
 the government's ability to provide more services to the
 people. These problems stem from the worldwide depression
 in markets for Liberia's main exports, iron ore and rubber,
 and to capital flight and loss of business confidence which
 occurred after the coup, in part attributable to harrassment
 of businesses by military personnel. Corruption continues
 to exist in Liberia.
 Inflation has averaged about 15 percent while the real rate
 of growth is only 1.5 percent annually for the last decade.
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a two-year
 standby agreement with the government; by meeting the IMF's
 targets during this period, the government is eligible to
 borrow $85 million at intervals during this period. Even
 with this assistance the government's budget will be very
 limited in the foreseeable future, but it has allocated
 about one-third of the 1980-81 budget to social services.
 This provides about $80 million for recurrent costs and
 about $40 million for the development of new social programs.
 
 
 147
 Access to vital needs has been limited in Liberia by the
 relative isolation of the bulk of the population as 1.3
 million of the total population of 1.8 million live in rural
 areas. It is estimated that about 35 percent of the popula-
 tion has access to education and health services, but only
 20 percent have access to safe water.
 More than half the urban population is in the Monrovia area.
 The rural population is scattered in isolated communities
 many of which do not have access roads thereby limiting
 their ability to participate adequately in development or
 receive social services. The population growth rate is 3.3
 percent annually. Free and universal education remains one
 of the government's highest development priorities, which
 would cost a minimum of $25 million per year. Budgetary
 constraints limit the ability of the government to respond
 more favorably to meeting basic human needs.
 The right to own property is restricted to Liberian citizens.
 Citizenship is limited to persons who are of black ancestry.
 There are no additional formal restrictions on the right to
 own or transfer real property. Since the revolution, 34
 individuals or families, however, have had their real and
 personal property confiscated (except for homestead rights)
 due to alleged involvement in corruption or failure to
 return to Liberia.
 The majority of the population probably continues to
 live at the survival level. Economic opportunities have in
 the past been .concentrated in a few hands; out the government
 has pledged to open opportunities for a wider spectrum of
 the population. There is a social welfare program which has
 not yet been fully implemented due largely to a lack of
 adequate funding.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms have ganeally'eenbexmittedin Liberia during
 the past decade. The Tolbert regime encouraged discussion
 of national issues and the news media openly criticized
 government policies and corruption up to but not including
 the presidency. At present, with the suspension of the
 constitution, civil and political rights are exercised at
 the grace of the government. Liberians exercise most of the
 rights they had before the coup but with self-restraint due
 to the lack of legal safeguards.
 When asked by a senior official to show "self restraint" in
 airing problems in government administration and programs,
 the media objected strenuously to the suggestion that they
 exercise self-censorship. The Liberian press remains
 free of overt censorship, but is sensitive to the political
 climate. Local news dealers sometimes do not distribute
 interhational publications containing articles critical of
 the present government.
 In September, the Head of State made a speech warn-
 ing against the holding of secret meetings. No group
 
 
 148
 has been denied the right to hold meetings as such, but
 some fraternal organizations and social clubs feel in-
 timidated by these warnings and have suspended their
 meetings. On occasion, persons attending social func-
 tions have been accused of either plotting a countercoup
 or being disrespectful of the council, and put into de-
 tention.
 Decree Number 12 denied workers the right to strike.
 The government has, however, lifted the longstanding
 ban on the organization of agricultural workers by
 industrial unions, a legal prohibition that had drawn
 International Labor Organization condemnation for a number
 of years.
 Freedom of religion has been respected throughout this
 period. No religious group appears either favored or
 persecuted.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Under the Tolbert government, people were free to move
 tnroughout the country. With the advent of military rule,
 frequent roadblocks and a curfew were established. While
 the roadblocks have been terminated, the curfew still exists
 in a reduced form.
 Since the coup there have been restrictions on foreign
 travel. Everyone is required to have an exit visa as
 well as a passport, and the exit visas are subject to
 elaborate red tape, and often have been difficult to
 obtain. In recent months, this situation has eased. A
 general rule has developed that released detainees and
 close relatives of those executed or in detention may
 not leave the country.
 A significant number of Liberians have left the country
 since the April 12 coup. Many are women and children sent
 abroad to safehavens.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 In the final year of the Tolbert government, the issue of
 opposition parties was of great concern. The ruling party
 had not faced an organized opposition party since 1955, and
 there was great reluctance to permitting opposition groups
 to register officially as parties. After much turmoil, an
 opposition party was registered in Decmber 1979. Almost
 immediately, its organizing efforts were hampered by the
 government and its officials harassed and arrested.
 Following the mass arrest of opposition leaders in March,
 the Tolbert administration encouraged calls for the banning
 of the opposition party.
 The People's Redemption Council government has prohibited
 political activities. The government has repeated on several
 occasions its intention to return the nation to civilian
 rule, and on December 24 Sergeant Doe announced that the
 government would appoint a national commission shortly to
 draft a new constitution.
 
 
 149
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 On April 14, 1980 Anaesty International appealed to the
 Head of State to ensure that the trials of Tolbert admin-
 istration officials conformed to internationally re-
 cognized standards, and subsequently appealed for an
 end to all executions.
 The government responded to the international outcry
 over the April 22 executions of thirteen former gov-
 ernment officials by announcing on April 29 that there
 would be no further executions. It has been respon-
 sive to international appeals to improve prisoner treat-
 ment and to release the prisoners, although there re-
 main about 100 political detainees.
