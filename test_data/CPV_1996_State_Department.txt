 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is a parliamentary democracy in which constitutional powers are
 shared between President Antonio Mascarenhas Monteiro, an independent, and
 Prime Minister Carlos Wahuon Veiga, and his party, the Movement for Democracy
 (MPD). The MPD dominates the National Assembly, in which three of the five offi-
 cial political parties are represented.
 The Government controls the police, which have primary responsibility for main-
 tenance of law and order. There were no reported human rights abuses committed
 by the police.
 Cape Verde has a market-based economy but little industry and few exploitable
 natural resources. The country has a long history of economically driven emigration,
 primarily to Western Europe and the United States, and receipts from Cape
 Verdeans abroad remain an important source of income. Even in years of optimum
 rainfall, the country can produce food for only 25 percent of the population, result-
 ingin heavy reliance on international food aid.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 Domestic violence, discrimination against women and mistreatment of children con-
 tinued to be serious problems. Although the Government supported legislation to
 ameliorate these problems, it failed to adopt, implement, and enforce policies de-
 signed to address the most critical challenges. There were instances of media self-
 censorship.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials
 employed them. Severe overcrowding of prisons is a problem. The Government per-
 mits both formal visits by human rights monitors to prisons and routine visits to
 individual prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law stipulates that authorities bring
 charges before a judge within 48 hours of arrest. Police may not make arrests with-
 out a court order unless a person is caught in the act of committing a felony. In
 exceptional cases, and with the concurrence of a court official, authorities may de-
 tain persons without charge for up to 5 days. These laws are observed in practice.
 The Ministry of Justice has 40 days to prepare for trial in state security cases,
 and may detain persons until trial or for a period not to exceed 1 year. There is
 a functioning system of bail.

 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the right to a fair
 trial. A judiciary independent of the executive branch generally provides due process
 rights, but there are serious delays owing to understaffing.
 The judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court and the regional courts.
 There are five Supreme Court judges, including one appointed by the President, one
 appointed by the National Assembly, and three appointed by the High Council of
 aistrates. Judges are independent and may not belong to a political party.
 Ilefendants are presumed to be innocent; have the right to public, nonjury trial;
 to counsel; to present witnesses; and to appeal verdicts. Free counsel is provided for
 the indigent. Regional courts adjudicate minor disputes on the local level in rural
 areas. The Ministry of Justice and Labor appoints local judges, who are usually
 prominent local citizens. Defendants may appeal regional court decisions to the Su-
 preme Court.
 The right to an expeditious trial is constrained by a seriously overburdened judi-
 cial system. A backlog of cases routinely leads to tial delays of 6 months.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press The Constitution provides for freedom to ex-
 press ideas by words, images, or any other means, and for freedom of the press
 without censorship. The Government generally respected these freedoms in practice.
 Nevertheless, there was increased criticism by independent political figures of the
 performance of the state-controlled television, radio, and print media for their fail-
 ure to exercise vigorously their monitoring role in a multi party system.
 Journalists ar independent of government ontrol, and are not required to reveal
 their sources. However, self-censorship within government-controlled media, includ-
 ing the national television and radio networks as well as the state-owned newspaper
 Novo Jornal, influences media criticism of the Government.
 Government authorization is not needed to establish newspapers, other printed
 publications, or electronic media. Independent media outlets experienced no direct
 pressure in their daily operations or business activities. The national radio station
 roadcasts live National Assembly sessions, and while independent media routinely
 criticize government policies and officials, state-controlled media have been criti-
 cized for failing to exercise their monitoring role vigorously in a democratic political
 system.
 The Constitution provides for academic freedom, and the right is respected in
 practice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association without authorization and without
 harassment by the authorities. Throughout the year, labor organizations, opposition
 political parties, civic action groups, and numerous others exercised this right with-
 out government interference or objection.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the freedom of religion and
 the separation of church and state. It also prohibits the State from imposing reli-
 gious beliefs and practices. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides citizens with the right to travel and establish resi-
 dence without government restrictions. The Constitution provides for repatriation,
 and the Government respects this in practice.
 The Constitution provides for the right of asylum by refugees, and no violations
 have been reported. According to credible media reports and the Human Rights
 Commission, Nigerian citizens suspected of involvement in criminal activity have
 encountered discrimination by immigration authorities and mistreatment by police.
 The Government has not formulated specific policies regarding refugees or first
 asylum, and the issue of first asylum has never arisen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The citizens have the right to change their government and did so with legislative
 elections in December 1995, municipal elections in January, and presidential elec-
 tions in February. The elections were judged free and fair by international observ-
 ers.
 The Constitution provides for separation of powers. Cabinet ministers are not re-
 quired to be members of the National Assembly, but they are individually subject
 
 
 to confirmation by the President of the Republic. Collectively, they must retain the
 support of a parliamentary majority. The President may dismiss the Government
 with the approval of the Council of the Republic, which is composed of the president
 of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, the president of the Supreme Court,
 the Attorney General, the president of the Regional Affairs Council, and four private
 members. Referendums may be held under specified circumstances but may not
 challenge individual political rights and liberties or the right of opposition parties
 to exist and function freely.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice regarding the rights of women or
 members of minorities to vote or to participate in the political process. Women com-
 prise 11 percent of the deputies elected to the National Assembly. There is one fe-
 male cabinet minister.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There is one private human rights groups in Cape Verde-the National Commis-
 sion of the Rights of Man. No major human rights organizations conducted inves-
 tigations during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, or social status. However, the Government does not effectively enforce all
 its provisions, resulting in ongoing discrimination, particularly against women and
 children.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, including wife beating, remains com-
 mon. Victims rarely report crimes such as rape and spousal abuse to the police.
 Women's organizations are seeking legislation to establish a special family court to
 address crimes of domestic violence and abuse.
 Women continue to face discrimination in several ways. Despite constitutional
 prohibitions against sex discrimination and provisions for full equality, including
 equal pay for equal work, discrimination continues. Women experience difficulties
 in obtaining certain types of employment. Although they are often paid less than
 men, they are making modest inroads in the professions.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination against women in inheritance, family,
 and custody matters. However, largely because of illiteracy, most women are un-
 aware of their rights. Women are often reluctant to seek redress of domestic dis-
 putes in the courts. The Organization of Cape Verdean Women alleges disparate
 treatment in inheritance matters despite laws calling for equal rights.
 Children.-The Government has prepared studies of social policy priorities and
 legal rights for children and adolescents, and the Cape Verdean Institute for Chil-
 dren is being restructured in accordance with norms established in the Convention
 on the Rights of the Child. In education, the Government's priorities include extend-
 ing mandatory education to 6 years for all children. In health, the Government
 seeks to reduce infant mortality and disease, combat drug and alcohol abuse, and
 discourage teenage pregnancy.
 Child abuse and mistreatment are continuing problems, exacerbated by chronic
 poverty, large unplanned families, and traditional high levels of emigration of adult
 men. Mass media, including government-controlled media, continue to highlight
 children's problems, including sexual violence against children, juvenile prostitution,
 and drug abuse as well as health and education problems.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government   oes not mandate access to public
 buildings or services for the disabled. Job discrimination against the physically dis-
 abled is prohibited. There are no official schools or trained teachers for the disabled,
 although several nongovernmental groups, including an association for the blind,
 are active.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that workers are legally
 free to form and to join unions without government authorization or restriction.
 There are two umbrella union associations: The Council of Free Labor Unions, com-
 posed of 11 unions with about 14,000 members, and the National Union of Cape
 erde Workers, formed by the former ruling party but operating independently,
 composed of 14 unions with about 16,000 members. The Government does not inter-
 fere with the activities of these organizations, but both suffer from a shortage of
 funds.
 The Constitution provides union members with the right to strike, and the Gov-
 ernment respects this right. By law, an employer must reinstate a worker fired un-
 justly.
 
 
 Unions are free to affiliate internationally and have ties with African and inter-
 national trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize and operate without hindrance and to sign collective work con-
 tracts. Workers and management in the small private sector, as well as in the pub-
 lic sector, reach agreement through collective bargaining. As the country's largest
 employer, the Government continues to play the dominant role by setting wages in
 the civil service. It does not fix wages for the private sector, but salary levels for
 civil servants provide the basis for wage negotiations in the private sector.
 A 1991 legislative decree bans antiunion discrimination by employers, with fines
 for offenders. There were no reported cases of such discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is forbidden by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 14 years. The law prohibits children under the age of 16 from working
 at night, more than 7 hours per day, or in establishments where toxic products are
 produced; but the Government rarely enforces the law. In practice the Ministry of
 Justice and Labor enforces minimum age laws with limitedsuccess, and then only
 in the urban, formal sectors of the economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are no established minimum wage rates
 in the private sector. Large urban private employers link their minimum wages to
 those paid to civil servants which, for an entry level worker, is $120 (10,000 escu-
 dos) per month. The majority of jobs pay wages insufficient to provide a worker and
 family a decent standard of living; therefore, most workers also rely on second jobs,
 extended family help, and subsistence agriculture.
 The maximum legal workweek for adults is 44 hours. While large employers gen-
 erally respect these regulations, many domestic servants and rural workers work
 longer hours.
 The Director General of Labor conducts periodic inspections to enforce proper
 labor practices and imposes fines on private enterprises which are not in conformity
 with the law. However, the Government does not systematically enforce labor laws,
 and much of the labor force does not enjoy their protection. There are few industries
 that employ heavy or dangerous equipment, and work-related accidents are rare.
 There is no legal provision for workers to remove themselves from unsafe working
 conditions without jeopardy to continued employment.
