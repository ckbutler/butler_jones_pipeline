 MONGOLIA
 Mongolia, or the Mongolian People's Republic, is a        rigidly
 controlled communist state almost     totally  dominated by  the
 Soviet Union.   Political life is monopolized by the Mongolian
 People's  Revolutionary  Party  headed  by  Chairman  Yumjaagiyn
 Tsedenbal.  As in the political arena, Mongolian economic life
 is shaped by the Soviet Bloc: 95% of Mongolia's foreign trade is
 conducted with the USSR and Eastern Europe.        The Mongolian
 economy remains heavily agricultural with an emphasis on live
 animals and animal products.
 Little  information   is   available  concerning   the   internal
 treatment of Mongolian citizens.   Much of what information is
 available comes from the Mongolian regime.    The United States
 does not recognize, nor does it have diplomatic relations with
 Mongolia. The few resident diplomats and occasional visitors to
 Mongolia are mainly limited to the capital city of Ulaanbaator.
 Travel in other parts of the country is restricted.        It is
 known, however, that Mongolian life and society are tightly
 controlled.   Few   Mongolians  travel  abroad.    No  political
 opposition to the ruling Communist Party is permitted. Freedoms
 guaranteed to the individual under the Mongolian Constitution,
 including speech, demonstration, and assembly, can be exercised
 only to "strengthen the socialist state system.'      In effect,
 individual civil and political liberties do not exist and there
 is nothing to indicate that this situation is likely to change
 in the foreseeable future.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 0. Killing
 There  is  no   information  available  concerning  killing  for
 political motives   in Mongolia whether by    government or by
 opposition groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no information available concerning disappearances in
 Mongolia.
 c. Torture
 There is no information available concerning the question of
 torture in Mongolia.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There is no information available concerning this subject with
 regard to Mongolia.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There is no information available on this question with regard
 to Mongolia.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Current civil and criminal codes, written in 1949, stipulate
 the right of the accused to judicial. process, a legal defense,
 and public trial "except as stipulated by law.'  However, closed
 
 
 771
 proceedings are permitted in the case of crimes against the
 state.  As the civil code places a heavy emphasis on this
 category   of  crimes,   and   since  the   Mongolian   People's
 Revolutionary Party controls all legal systems, those accused of
 such crimes are unlikely to receive fair judicial process.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is
 guaranteed in the Constitution, but there is no information
 available  concerning  the   application of  these  rights  by
 Mongolian authorities.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Mongolian Constitution provides for freedom of speech, but
 specifies that the exercise of individual rights must be to
 "strengthen the socialist state system.' Actions deemed to fall
 outside  this parameter would    likely  result  in arrest and
 detention.   Criticism  of  the  Government  is  not tolerated.
 Control  is  exercised   through  various  government-controlled
 organizations,  notably  the   Peoples'  Control  Organization,
 extending down to the neighborhood committee level.   The press
 is strictly controlled by the Government. Non-communist foreign
 media  representatives  are  generally  not  allowed   into  the
 country. Academic   and  artistic   life  is  similarly  tightly
 controlled  and  directed  into  rigidly  determined  lines  in
 accordance with government policy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of demonstration and assembly are guaranteed by the
 Constitution,  but  in   practice  only  government   authorized
 organizations are permitted to assemble and the only demon-
 strations  allowed  are  carefully  orchestrated  by  government
 authorities.   A  wide   variety  of   organizations,  including
 professional and trade unions, exist, but all are controlled and
 directed by the central Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion exists in theory, but the current regime
 strictly controls religious activity. Religion no longer plays
 any significant part in the lives of most Mongolians.       The
 Buddhist church, which was a central force in Mongolian life
 prior to the establishment of the communist Government, has been
 reduced to a few showcase monasteries and a handful of monks.
 They serve primarily as propagandists and as show pieces for
 tourists.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Until recent years, very few Mongolians travelled abroad, even
 to the Soviet Union. Foreign travel usually has been permitted
 only for official purposes, but government-sponsored education
 abroad has become increasingly common.   Such foreign travel as
 takes places is almost exclusively to Soviet Bloc countries. No
 Mongolians are known to have requested repatriation to Mongolia.
 There is no known emigration from Mongolia.
 All Mongolians over 16 years of age must have internal passports
 and must obtain permission from the Security Bureau in order to
 travel  within  the  country.   Attempts   to  change  jobs  or
 
 
 772
 residences must be approved of by both the Security Bureau and
 the Peoples' Control Organization.
 Some Chinese refugees of Mongolian extraction fled to Mongolia
 during the late 1960's Cultural Revolution.   Most of these have
 since returned to China and there are no known refugees in
 Mongolia at this time.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party does not tolerate
 political groups outside its control. The Party is established
 on the Soviet model and      its organization   is hierarchical.
 Lower-ranking members have no real ability to influence the
 decisions of superiors. Elections are held at regular intervals,
 but only one candidate is listed for each office, so the choice
 is to vote for him or cross his name out. Many elections result
 in a 99.9% turnout. Winning candidates regularly receive 99.9%
 of the vote.   While there is no officially espoused policy of
 minority disenfranchisement, it is significant that there is no
 evidence of religious persons and only a very few minorities,
 other than the dominant Khalkha Mongols, occupying elite party
 or government positions. The sole method for participating in a
 real sense in the political process is through joining the Party
 and moving up through the ranks.     Similarly, while universal
 franchise and equal rights for women are official policy, in
 practice few women occupy positions of responsibility in the
 Government or Party structures.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Mongolia acceded to the United Nations Covenant on Civil and
 Politial Rights in 1976.     However, the Mongolian regime has
 consistently  followed  the   Soviet  human  rights  policy  and
 practice, whether or not it is consistent with the covenant.
 There have been no known opportunities for outside investigators
 to examine human rights practices.   It is highly unlikely that
 Mongolian officials would permit     such  investigation by any
 outside authority or organization. There is no known indigenous
 organization dedicated to the protection of human rights in
 Mongolia.   Freedom  House,   in  its  1982  report,  classified
 Mongolia as "Not Free.'
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 It is impossible to verify the claims of the current regime that
 the life of the average Mongolian has improved when compared to
 conditions before the communist takeover.      Mongolian figures
 indicate, however, that there were 20.9 physicians per 10,000
 population in 1978 and that infant mortality rate had declined
 to 70 per 1,000 live births in 1981.   Life expectancy at birth
 rose from 52 years in 1960 to 63.6 years in 1980. The limited
 data available   indicates similar   improvements  in education,
 employment, and food production. World Bank and USAID estimates
 tend to confirm the claims of an improved standard of living.
 Education has been a high priority       of Mongolia  since the
 mid-1950s. Adjusted primary school enrollment increased from 79
 percent in 1960 to 108 percent in 1978 (indicating a large
 proportion of the students are above or below the official
 primary  school ages).    There appears to    be  little sexual,
 racial, or religious discrimination in education.   The adjusted
 enrollment for males was only six points higher than for females
 in primary education in 1978.
 
 
 773
 The percentage of calories available for consumption relative to
 nutritional needs reached 104 per cent in 1977.   Gross national
 product per capita in 1979 was $780.00.    Population figures in
 1981 show 1,718,000 people in Mongolia.    The population growth
 rate remained constant at 2.9 per cent throughout the 1960's and
 1970's and into 1980.   The Government claims universal literacy
 within Mongolia, but there is no way to verify this.
 Despite the substantial rise in the Mongolian. standard of living
 over  the  last  fifty  years, the    country  remains  extremely
 backward.  The majority of the population remains engaged in
 agriculture,  primarily  herding.    An  inefficient  and  over-
 centralized bureaucracy, and a centrally-run economy integrally
 incorporated with the Committee for Mutual Economic Assistance
 (a Soviet-dominated arrangement designed to serve Russian rather
 than Mongolian interests) severely limit national growth. These
 combine with a lack of resources, extreme geographic isolation,
 and a severe climate to keep the quality of Mongolian life poor
 by any objective international standard.

 NEW ZEALAND
 New Zealand has an exceptional record in the human rights field
 and is continuing to improve and broaden respect for such
 rights. The country enjoys a firm tradition of democracy
 dating back to its founding in the 19th century. Universal
 suffrage, personal freedom, respect for minority rights, rule
 by law, humane treatment of prisoners, concern for the
 economically depriveo, freedom of the press, free trade union
 affiliation, and freedom of religion are deeply ingrained
 principles in New Zealand society and are fundamental,
 unquestioned tenets in its governance. New Zealand is a multi-
 party parliamentary democracy in theory and in practice. Its
 economy, which includes considerable socialization in areas
 such as health and welfare, is based on free market enterprise.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Killing for political motives, whether by government or
 opposition political organizations, does not occur in New
 Zealand.
 b. Disappearance
 Such practices do not occur in New Zealand.
 c. Torture
 Torture is illegal under a long tradition of common law and
 case precedents. It is not practiced in New Zealand.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 None of these exists in New Zealand. Capital punishment is
 illegal, and summary executions are unknown. Abuse of
 prisoners and use of excessive force by police are not
 tolerated and the Government has procedures adequate to deal
 with the police should any incident occur. Prison and
 detention facilities provide adequate shelter, food, and
 medical care. Prisoners' relatives and lawyers are allowed to
 visit them. There are no differences of treatment of prisoners
 based on type of conviction, social class, race, sex, or
 religion. Sentences are not unusually severe and in general
 correspond with sentences in the US and other developed Western
 countries.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 This does not exist in New Zealand and habeas corpus is honored
 in practice. Following arrest, persons must be and are charged
 promptly.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The law, which guarantees the right to a fair public trial, is
 respected. Defendants are entitled to and have free access to
 counsel. Consultations between defendants and counsel may be
 held in private. The Government does not harass defense
 counsel. Defendants are charged promptly after arrest and
 charges are stated formally and clearly. Under New Zealand's
 legal system defendants are able to call witnesses, present
 evidence, and cross-examine prosecution witnesses at trials and
 are not subject to double jeopardy. The judicial system is
 
 
 775
 independent of executive or military control. There are no
 special courts to deal with political or security offenses.
 Civilians are not tried by military courts.
 9. Invasion of Home
 Private property can only be searched in conformity with the
 law, which requires a warrant issued by a magistrate. Forced
 entries have not been alleged credibly, and no other violations
 of the home are known to have occurred.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are guaranteed in New Zealand by a long tradition
 of common law cases and principles. There is no censorship or
 control of the media by the Government apart from legislated
 exceptions relating to pornographic and similar materials and
 laws against defamation. Opposition viewpoints are freely
 discussed in the media. Journalists and academics work
 unhindered by the Government and they are not harassed or
 intimidated in their work.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings are free of restrictions and no one is denied
 the right to assemble freely. This applies equally to freedom
 of association. Trade union rights are respected and have a
 long tradition in New Zealand. Public sector employees
 generally are not prohibited from collective bargaining and
 striking with some limited exceptions (for the safety and well
 being of the general public). There are no state-organized
 unions, and the Government does not interfere with union
 matters.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in New Zealand and all religions are
 practiced freely. No advantage is given to adherents of any
 particular faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of internal and external travel,
 emigration, and repatriation to New Zealand. The right of
 voluntary repatriation is guaranteed. In addition, New Zealand
 has been responsive, within the limits of its resources, to the
 resettlement needs of refugees and has practiced a liberal
 asylum policy. The New Zealand Government, as well as private
 organizations, has been generous in this cause.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 New Zealand is a multi-party parliamentary state in which all
 New Zealanders participate freely in the political process.
 Two parties, National and Labor, dominate the political scene,
 with Social Credit, a small but well-known party, now holding
 two seats in Parliament. There are other smaller politial
 parties and groups, for the most part devoted to limited and
 parochial issues and usually of little consequence in the
 national electoral process. Suffrage is universal for persons
 18 years of age and older, in law and in practice. Voting
 rates are high and participation in political groups is
 common. Opposition groups have every opportunity to voice
 their opinions, and no groups are denied political
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 50
 
 
 776
 participation or suffrage. Problems of nationality,
 citizenship, or statelessness do not exist. Women have legal
 equality with men and participate freely in all phases of New
 Zealand life. Women now hold eight seats in Parliament, and
 the president of the ruling National Party is a woman.
 Discrimination on the basis of sex is illegal, and the
 Government has taken positive steps to see that it does not
 occur.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There have been no requests for such investigations. New
 Zealand's commitment to protecting human rights and opposing
 discrimination is exemplified by its adherence to a number of
 United Nations conventions including:  (a) the International
 Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights; (b) the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and (c)
 the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of
 Discrimination. Numerous organizations exist in New Zealand to
 protect human rights and oppose various forms of
 discrimination. Prominent among these are the New Zealand
 Council for Civil Liberties, and the Citizens' Association for
 Racial Equality, the New Zealand Human Rights Commission, the
 New Zealand Chapter of the International Commission of Jurists,
 the National Organization of Women, and the New Zealand Branch
 of Amnesty International. Such groups serve to focus public
 and government attention on possible instances of human rights
 violations, both in New Zealand and in other countries.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 New Zealand is'a highly developed social welfare state, and its
 people enjoy a high standard of living and health. These needs
 are met on a non-discriminatory basis. The right to own
 property, individually and jointly, is protected.  Food,
 shelter, health care, and education are available to all New
 Zealanders regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political persuasion. The population of New
 Zealand in 1981 was 3,268,000. Per capita GNP in 1980 was
 $7,085. Life expectancy at birth had reached 73.3 years, while
 the infant mortality rate had decreased to 13.8 per 1,000 live
 births. The nation's population growth for 1980 stood at .9
 percent. The adult literacy rate was 99 percent, while the
 adjusted primary school enrollment figures exceeded 107 percent
 for both males and females. There was available nutritional
 requirements in the supply of calories. No portion of the
 population was considered to have fallen below the absolute
 poverty level.
