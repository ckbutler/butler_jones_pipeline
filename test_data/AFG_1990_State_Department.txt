 AFGHANISTAN*
 The current regime in Kabul derives its political power from a
 coup in 1978, the 1979 Soviet invasion and 10-year occupation,
 and--following the withdrawal of'Soviet forces in 1989--a
 massive military and economic support program provided by the
 U.S.S.R. Since its establishment the regime has faced
 continuous armed opposition, supported by a large portion of
 the population. The regime physically controls the capital,
 Kabul, other major urban centers, and garrisons to protect
 them. Some roads are open to military movement by
 well-protected convoys. Since the Soviet withdrawal, the
 regime has survived but has not appreciably expanded its area
 of control. The regime leader, President Najib, withstood a
 coup attempt in March and remains seriously concerned about
 his personal security and political power.
 The keystone of President Najib's control is the Ministry of
 State Security (WAD), responsible for internal security
 functions in regime-controlled areas, which he headed before
 taking supreme power. Besides its intelligence and secret
 police functions, WAD disposes of sizable military forces.
 Since 1978, 5 million people, one-third of Afghanistan's
 prewar population, have fled the country and become refugees,
 primarily in Pakistan and Iran. At least a million more have
 been displaced internally. The regime practice of bombing
 civilian areas in response to mujahidin attacks has
 particularly affected the provinces where mujahidin are
 active. In 1990 villages and other civilian sites continued
 to suffer from air strikes and missile bombardment. Over 1
 million Afghans have been killed in the conflict, principally
 by regime and Soviet air strikes, artillery and missile
 bombardment, and landmines. Countless others have been maimed
 and wounded.
 Afghan resistance political leadership is fragmented among
 several major groups, covering.a broad political spectrum,
 from those favoring a return of the former King to
 fundamentalists who desire an "Islamic" system of government.
 Most power in the countryside is held by local military
 commanders and traditional leaders who are not answerable to
 political leaders or parties. The resistance continues to be
 plagued by rivalries that have occasionally erupted in bloody
 infighting. The Afghan Interim Government (AIG), established
 in February 1989 to oversee a transfer of power, has been
 largely ineffective in imposing any kind of discipline on
 commanders or party leaders.
 The Afghan economy is basically agricultural, with land tenure
 in the hands of individuals or family/tribal groups. An
 entrepreneurial/trading class and some small-scale
 manufacturing exist. The regime attemped, unsuccessfully, to
 impose a centralixed, planned economy in the Communist mode
 until 1990, when it modified its Constitution to allow
 economic liberalization. In resistance-controlled areas,
 economic activity continues along traditional lines, but it
 has been greatly affected by the devastation of the war, and
 continued fighting in 1990 only added to the already tremendous

 States has had no official observers in Afghanistan. This

 dislocation. The economic infrastructure will require years
 to recover, even with massive international assistance.
 On the surface, the human rights situation in
 regime-controlled areas improved in 1990, with the lifting of
 the state of emergency and the adoption of constitutional
 amendments providing for greater freedoms. However, in
 practical terms, virtually all of the main categories of human
 rights remain restricted by the regime. There are at least
 3,000 regime political prisoners. In areas outside regime
 control, there are somewhat fewer restrictions on personal
 freedoms, although there have been credible reports that some
 resistance groups have attacked, tortured, killed, or
 imprisoned persons opposed to their programs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect. for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Arbitrary killing and other acts of violence against suspected
 opponents of the Kabul regime still occur. This included
 reported summary executions during the failed March coup
 attempt. Regime forces and some resistance groups execute
 prisoners in the field. During 1990, several Afghans in
 Pakistan were apparently killed for political reasons. These
 murders have been ascribed to WAD agents as well as to some
 resistance groups, particularly the Hezb-i-Islami party, led
 by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, trying to intimidate their opponents.
 Pakistani authorities are investigating these cases but have
 not made any arrests.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances in areas under regime control are frequently
 the result of the impressment into military service of young
 males. When Afghans are picked up by the regime for political
 offenses, their families are usually not informed. Such
 detainees can be held for months without official notification
 of families. Some persons also disappear as a result of the
 action of resistance groups, who have abducted or captured
 regime military and civilian cadre and suspected regime
 collaborators. There were a number of kidnapings of refugees
 in the Peshawar area, including women involved in
 internationally sponsored development projects. The incidents
 were reportedly connected with agitation by some
 fundamentalist Islamic resistance groups, particularly the
 Hezb-i-Islami (Iekmatyar). These groups are opposed to
 programs they do not control and have attacked the women's
 programs as a means to incite opposition to Western relief
 efforts.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Reports continue of torture by regime authorities to extract
 information or confessions, although such activity is
 forbidden by the Constitution. Techniques include beating,
 electric shock, and immersion in water. Threats of abuse
 against family members and prolonged sleep deprivation are
 typical forms of psychological torture. Some victims of
 regime torture, later freed, have reported mental disturbances
 resulting from their treatment in regime prisons. In its 1990
 
 
 1362
 
 AFGHANISTAN
 Report, covering 1989, Amnesty International noted that it had
 continued to receive reports of the torture and ill-treatment
 of prisoners, although on a lesser scale than in previous
 years.
 In addition, the various resistance groups maintain prisons,
 both inside Afghanistan and in refugee camps in Pakistan, with
 detainees reportedly numbering several thousand. There are
 reports that some groups keep their prisoners in overcrowded
 conditions and routinely subject them to torture. The
 resistance groups most frequently linked to these prisons and
 cited for poor prisoner treatment are the Hezbi-i-Islami
 (Hekmatyar), the Hezb-i-Islami (led by Yunis Khalis), and the'
 Ittihad-i-Islami.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although the state of emergency has been lifted, legal
 safeguards to prevent arbitrary arrest or detention in regime-
 controlled areas are weak, and are ignored in state security
 cases. Afghans continue to face seizure by regime security
 personnel for vaguely defined crimes against the State.
 Often, arrest warrants are not issued, although the
 Constitution forbids detention without permission of the
 court. Detainees can be held incommunicado. Although bail is
 sometimes granted, it is not a standard feature of the
 regime's legal procedures. Formal charges may come only after
 months of interrogation.
 Continuing instances of arbitrary detention on a large scale
 in 1990 resulted from impressment of young men into military
 service in Kabul and, to a lesser extent, other cities
 controlled by the regime. The regime admitted to arresting
 over 600 people following the March coup attempt. The regime
 now permits the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) to visit detainees as well as convicted prisoners.
 There are some restrictions on the ICRC's ability to visit
 prisoners, particularly with regard to prisoners under the
 control of the Ministry of State Security (WAD).
 Some resistance groups also reportedly arbitrarily detain
 individuals, including non-Western social workers from the
 Pakistani refugee camps, relatives of Afghan military
 personnel, and political opponents. The ICRC has worked to
 establish sufficient rapport with resistance commanders to
 allow for visits to prisoners held in Afghanistan. Some
 commanders, but not all, now permit ICRC visits to prisoners.
 The ICRC has had some access to Soviet and regime prisoners-of-
 war held by the mujahidin, particularly those held by Hezb-i
 Islami (Hekmatyar), Jamiat-i Islami, and the National Islamic
 Front for Afghanistan.
 The regime does not use exile as a form of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most persons accused of nonpolitical crimes are tried in the
 ordinary criminal court system under the provisions of
 judicial codes in existence before the coup of 1978. Those
 political detainees who are charged and brought to trial are
 usually arraigned on allegations of treason, espionage, or
 terrorism and are tried and sentenced in secret. Frequently,
 as in the case of those suspected of beinglinvolved in the
 
 
 1363
 
 AFGHANISTAN
 March coup attempt, they are tried by special courts. As a
 rule, the accused must provide their own defense, without
 benefit of counsel.
 The Constitution calls for review of death sentences only by
 the President. Contrary to internationally recognized norms,
 there is no judicial procedure to appeal a death sentence. In
 areas not controlled by the regime, civil and criminal cases
 are tried by Islamic judges (qazis) and community elders under
 Islamic, or Shari'a, law and according to Afghan custom. Asia
 Watch reports that trials of Afghan prisoners by resistance
 parties do not conform to internationally recognized standards
 of fair trial.
 In late September, the regime provided Dr. Felix Ermacora, the
 United Nations' Special Rapporteur for Afghanistan, a list
 indicating it was holding 2,582 political prisoners.
 Resistance groups detain regime personnel for extended
 periods, and several groups operate prisons inside Afghanistan
 or within refugee camps in Pakistan, which are used to hold
 political opponents.
 An unknown number of Soviets, captured prior to the
 withdrawal, are still being held by the resistance in the hope
 of exchanging them for prisoners held by the regime and,
 resistance groups claim, by the U.S.S.R. The Soviets deny
 holding any mujahid-in prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution forbids arbitrary search. However, regime
 forces routinely sweep through residential areas to arrest
 suspected resistance members and confiscate property,
 including homes. Telephones are frequently tapped and
 correspondence monitored.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 During 1990 the Kabul regime continued high altitude bombing,
 artillery bombardments, and frequent launches of powerful Scud
 and Frog surface-to-surface missiles. Substantial but unknown
 numbers of civilian casualties resulted in the countryside
 during 1990 from attacks by the regime against areas where
 mujahidin operate. Significant civilian casualties also have
 resulted from rocket attacks by the resistance against targets
 in urban areas. Resistance leaders assert that they strive to
 minimize civilian casualties. A large-scale attack proposed
 for late 1990 against Kabul was condemned by most resistance
 leaders because of the large number of civilian casulaties it
 would have caused, and it eventually was abandoned due to
 their opposition.
 Millions of landmines emplaced by the Soviets or regime forces
 remain around fortifications or scattered near roads and in
 the countryside. Mines have also been sown by resistance
 groups. Little has been done by the Soviets or the regime to
 remove mines or help the United Nations accomplish the task.
 There is a U.N.-sponsored program to train Afghans to detect
 and remove mines, but these devices will pose a significant
 hazard to civilians for years to come.
 Regime forces and some resistance groups execute prisoners in
 the field. Credible reports describe large-scale executions
 
 
 1364
 AFGHANISTAN
 (up to 100 men in each instance) of regime soldiers by
 mujahidil following the capture of the town of Tarin Kot and a
 battle near the town of Qalat in October. Resistance leaders
 attributed at least some of these executions to long-standing
 tribal animosities and familial disputes between elements of
 mujahidin and some of the captured soldiers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While the Constitution contains provisions for freedom of
 expression, the regime tolerates little criticism in the
 public media, and private criticism can result in detention
 and arrest. Afghans are guarded in their conversations lest
 antiregime comments be reported to the secret police. With a
 few small recent exceptions, all media are owned, and
 controlled by the regime. All media, including the few small
 independent publications that reportedly have emerged in
 recent months, are subject to tight supervision. The major
 media, including all broadcast outlets, are devoted to
 conveying the regime's policy and interpretation of world
 events. In the absence of academic freedom, the exodus of
 academics and intellectuals continued in 1990. Although
 resistance groups have little ability to control media
 services, some Afghan intellectuals avoid public criticism of
 fundamentalist groups for fear of being attacked. Asia Watch
 has reported that the Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar) and some
 militantly Islamic Wahhabi resistance groups have warned
 Western journalists not to report from inside Afghanistan.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In spite of constitutional guarantees, there is no effective
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association in regime-
 controlled areas. The Constitution was amended in May to
 allow a multiparty political system, but no genuine opposition
 groups have emerged. In fact, leaders of the National Unity
 Party, arrested shortly after their group was formed in 1989
 to promote democracy and human rights, remained in prison
 during 1990. Nine parties registered in coalition with the
 ruling party are, by and large, front organizations and are
 not taken seriously by Afghans. The Kabul-based National
 Salvation Society, formed in 1989 by former high-ranking
 officials of pre-1978 governments, continues to seek
 international support for a peace settlement. However, it
 remains a small, poorly funded interest group, neither
 possessing nor seeking mass'support among Afghans in
 regime-controlled areas. Political demonstrations are
 occasionally staged by the regime on behalf of its positions.
 The regime strictly controls any other type of assembly,
 forbidding criticism of the President or the Constitution.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population of Afghanistan is overwhelmingly Muslim.
 Afghans' constitutional right to worship in regime-controlled
 areas is normally honored. The Constitution was amended in
 May to identify Afghanistan as an Islamic state. The regime
 seeks to broaden its popular support through evocation of
 Islamic themes and symbols and support-for mosques and
 religious schools, although this is seen by most Afghans as a
 cynical ruse. Members of minority religions are generally
 allowed to worship freely in both resistance and
 regime7controlled areas, but proselytizing is not allowed.
 
 
 1365
 
 AFGHANISTAN
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic travel remains severely restricted by wartime
 conditions. However, civilian travel between areas controlled
 by the regime and by the resistance does occur. In many
 cases, resistance groups allow the movement of goods,
 particularly food, into regime-controlled areas. Both the
 regime and resistance groups establish arbitrary checkpoints
 along highways at which travelers are screened and frequently
 required to pay fees. The large-scale Soviet and regime
 mining of the principal overland routes and passes as well as
 the smaller number of mines sown by resistance groups creates
 serious risks for travelers as well as for returning refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Afghan citizens do- not have the ability peacefully to change
 their government. The regime-controlled areas of Afghanistan
 continue to be ruled by a centralized nondemocratic party kept
 in power with the support of the Soviet Union. The ruling
 party, in spite of a name change and "reorganization" in 1990,
 remains a centralized organization. Despite constitutional
 amendments in May ostensibly designed to permit a multiparty
 system, no genuine political opposition has emerged. About 10
 different parties or political groupings have been allowed to
 form, even before the constitutional amendments, but none has
 been allowed to display genuine independence or to strongly
 criticize the Najibullah regime. Proposals from the ruling
 party for settlement of the conflict call for it to continue
 to hold the reins of power. Resistance groups vary widely in
 their degree of centralization, but their leaders generally
 acknowledge that an Afghan government needs a popular
 mandate.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 During 1990, the regime increased its cooperation with
 *international organizations investigating human rights
 practices. The ICRC continues to visit some persons detained
 by the Government. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on
 Afghanistan, Felix Ermacora, visited Kabul in January and
 September, at the invitation of the regime, to gather material
 for his fifth report on human rights in Afghanistan. Asia
 Watch was allowed to visit Kabul and Herat in July.
 During 1990, the ICRC and journalists were occasionally
 permitted to visit Afghans and Soviets held in some'resistance
 prisons in Afghanistan. Several groups of Soviet citizens
 seeking releabe of Soviet prisoners of war traveled to
 Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1990 and met with regime and
 resistance officials. Two Soviet prisoners were released in
 1989 and four in 199G.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In traditional rural Afghan society the participation of women
 in activities beyond the home and-fields is limited by long
 established beliefs, customs, and religious practices.
 However, beginning in the late 1950's, Afghan governments
 officially sanctioned a wider public role for women. Upper-
 
 
 1366
 
 AFGHANISTAN
 and middle-class women began working in the government and
 private sectors in the 1960's. While this practice was
 generally limited to Kabul, girls from elsewhere in the
 country attended secondary schools and sought admission to
 institutes of higher education to pursue careers, including
 teaching and nursing, which in some cases permitted employment
 in the provinces. The social position of women in
 regime-controlled areas has continued to improve over the past
 decade and the role of women in some nontraditional
 occupations has expanded. The war has significantly affected
 women, physically and socially. In the refugee community in
 Pakistan the freedoms women were allowed have been greatly
 circumscribed. Women's roles are a subject of serious debate
 within the resistance, and some fundamentalist parties seek
 further restrictions on women.
 Violence against women is known to occur in Afghanistan, but
 little is known about its extent. Abuse within the family is
 seldom mentioned publicly, and there are no official
 statistics on the subject. The regime has discussed this
 problem in the press and made some very preliminary efforts to
 deal with it. The regime announced in 1990 the opening of a
 facility in Kabul to counsel women who are in abusive
 relationships.
 During the spring and summer of 1990, some Afghan
 fundamentalists protested the influence of Western assistance
 organizations, particularly those working on women's
 programs. There was a campaign of intimidation involving
 instances of harassment and distribution of threatening
 leaflets and posters. At least one Afghan female refugee
 relief worker was tortured, raped, and murdered. One Western
 organization had a project in Afghanistan and in a refugee
 camp destroyed. By the fall of 1990 the tensions had
 decreased, but the basic issues remained unresolved.
 Afghanistan is home to several Muslim religious traditions and
 a number of ethnic, tribal, and linguistic groups whose
 relations to one another have historically been marked by
 rivalry and occasionally by hostilities. Local loyalties
 often override those to the nation as a whole. A particularly
 strong line of cleavage along religious, ethnic, and
 geographic lines lies between the minority Shi'a and the
 traditionally dominant Sunni Afghans. Relations between
 resistance groups and within the Kabul regime reflect these
 rivalries. The regime has tried to manipulate these rivalries
 for its own purposos. One practice is to use troops from one
 ethnic group in parts of the country where that group is not
 normally present. This tactic predates the Communist takeover
 and is designed to repress local populations with greater ease
 and prevent military defections. However, it also heightens
 hostilities between groups and sparks frequent violence.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution and the labor law (enacted in 1987) assert
 workers' right to form trade unions, and such unions are
 theoretically independent of state organs. In fact, however,
 union organization follows traditional Soviet practice.
 Individual unions are supervised by the Central Council of
 Trade Unions, controlled by the ruling party, and there is no
 evidence of worker participation in decisionmaking. The
 Central Council of Trade Unions is affiliated with the
 
 
 1367
 AFGHANISTAN
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Afghanistan, a member of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) since 1934, has ratified neither ILO Convention 87 on
 freedom of association nor Convention 98 on collective
 bargaining. The regime does not allow the existence of
 independent trade organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have the theoretical right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The labor law applying to large economic
 organizations stipulates that, at the end of each Afghan year,
 a new collective contract is negotiated between management and
 trade union representatives and signed with the consensus of
 the workers' collective. In practice, there is no genuine
 labor-management bargaining. The workers' collective rubber
 stamps decisions taken by officials. There has been some
 discussion about setting up labor courts and other mechanisms
 for the resolution of disputes, but by year's end no action
 had been taken.
 There is no indication that there are any special economic or
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids the imposition of forced labor but
 notes that the "performance of compulsory labor in wartime,
 natural calamity, and other states of emergency which threaten
 public life and order shall be excluded from this." Given
 that wartime conditions exist, this constitutional provision
 can be, in effect, ignored. The most frequent manifestation
 of the use of forced labor is the "voluntary" labor engaged in
 by students for short periods on construction projects during
 their annual vacations, when they are seconded to the military.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor law specifies the conditions of work for
 adolescents, noting that persons aged 13 to 15 may work a
 maximum of 30 hours a week, and those aged 16 to 17 should not
 work more than 35 hours a week. The law also specifies that
 adolescents should receive the same pay as persons 18 and
 older. In fact, children of all ages work without regard to
 conditions or law. Economic circumstances for most Afghans
 are so harsh that many families have no choice but to have
 every member work. There is no evidence that the regime
 enforces labor law as it relates to children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor law stipulates that the usual hours of work on
 average should not exceed 40 hours a week, and that on
 Thursdays working time should not exceed 5 hours. Provision
 is made for time off for prayers, meals, holidays, weekends,
 annual leave, sick leave, and emergency leave. No information
 on any statutory minimum wage is available. There are general
 provisions which set out the employer's responsibility to
 ensure healthy and safe conditions of work, and accident
 compensation. There appear to be no effective enforcement
 mechanisms to ensure fair and safe-labor practices. The State
 Committee on Labor and Social Security is understaffed and not
 very active.
