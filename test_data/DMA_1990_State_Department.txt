 DOMINICA
 Independent since 1978, Dominica is a parliamentary democracy
 and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Prime Minister
 Eugenia Charles' Dominica Freedom Party, in office since 1980,
 was reelected in 1985 and 1990 in free, fair, and open
 elections.
 The defense force was disbanded-in 1981 following two violent
 coup attempts. Since then the police have been-the only
 security force. The Commissioner of Police supervises the
 Special Services Unit (SSU), a small, paramilitary unit which
 was established in 1983 and which has been incorporated into
 the Regional Security System of the Eastern Caribbean States,
 and oversees a marine unit which functions as a coast guard.
 The police are controlled by and responsive to the
 democratically elected Government.
 During 1990 Dominica completed a 3-year restructuring of its
 economy with the support of the International Monetary Fund,
 the World Bank, and other international agencies. The
 primarily agrarian economy continued to prosper due to high
 earnings from banana exports to the United Kingdom.
 Dominica's mountainous terrain and periodic devastation by
 hurricanes have caused it to remain one of the least developed
 nations in the Eastern Caribbean. Several.small industrial
 plants are operating, but unemployment remained Dominica's
 main social problem. Per capita gross domestic product was
 $1,480. Unemployment was approximately 10 percent, down from
 its high of 18.3 percent in 1981.
 Dominica continued to have a good'human rights record in 1990.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances or politically
 motivated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture or other forms of cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, and there were
 no reports of such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Dominican law requires that persons arrested or detained be
 charged with a crime within 24 hours or be released from
 custody, and this is honored in practice. There were no cases
 of arbitrary arrest or exile in 1990.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Dominican law provides for public trial before an independent,
 impartial court. Criminal defendants are presumed innocent
 until proven guilty, are allowed legal counsel, and have the
 right of appeal. Indigents are provided free legal counsel
 only in capital cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry; search, and
 seizure. Search warrants are required by law. There were no
 reports in 1990 of arbitrary government intrusions into the
 private lives of individuals.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right of free expression is provided for by the
 Constitution and adhered to in practice. The political
 opposition openly criticizes the Government. Dominica's main
 radio station is state owned, and the other two stations
 confine their broadcasts to religious programming. However,
 Dominicans enjoy good access to independent news sources
 through cable television and radio reception from neighboring
 islands. The sole newspaper was founded by the Catholic
 Church. During 1990 the Church terminated.its interest in the
 newspaper, ending an 81-year involvement as the company's
 principal, shareholder. The editorial stance of the newspaper
 is generally progovernment, but opposition viewpoints are
 prominently reported. Political parties publish their own
 "journals", and the opposition United Worker's Party prints a
 weekly newsletter. In 1985 the Government discontinued live
 radio broadcasts of parliamentary sessions, a reflection of
 official displeasure over the opposition's use of the airwaves
 to promote its causes. The DLP responded by refusing to
 engage in parliamentary debate for 18 months. The broadcast
 ban remained in place throughout 1990.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government respects the constitutionally mandated freedoms
 of association and assembly and does not hinder opposition
 groups from holding political meetings or public
 demonstrations. Such meetings and gatherings were held
 frequently throughout the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholicism is the predominant faith in Dominica, and
 there are various Protestant denominations. There are also
 small Muslim and Rastafarian communities. There is no
 discrimination on the basis of religious faith or practice,
 and outside religious groups are not restricted in their
 activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are provided for by law and respected in
 practice. The Government may revoke passports if subversion
 is suspected, but has not done so in recent times.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Dominica has a long tradition of democracy and home rule.
 Power is exercised by a Cabinet appointed by the Prime
 Minister. Elections in 1980, 1985, and 1990 were free and
 fair. The 1990 elections were contested by the incumbent
 Dominica Freedom Party, the opposition Dominica Labour Party,
 and the opposition United Worker's Party. The Freedom Party
 won 11 of the 21 parliamentary seats, the UWP 6, and the DLP
 4. Elections are by secret ballot and are held every 5 years,
 or earlier at the discretion of the Prime Minister.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no government restrictions on the formation of local
 human rights organizations, although no such groups exist at
 present. There have been no requests for investigations of
 human rights abuses from international human rights groups.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are constitutional provisions, respected in practice,
 against racial or sexual discrimination in Dominica.
 Religious practice is not restricted, nor is it the basis for
 discrimination. Labor laws specify equal pay for equal work.
 According to the Permanent.Secretary in the Ministry of
 Community Development, there is no widespread significant
 violence against women in Dominica. While cases of rape and
 sexual assault do occur, the violent acts themselves are not
 accepted by the society. Victims of abuse do report such
 cases, and under the law may file complaints of violent and
 sexual abuse either to the Welfare Department or directly to
 the police. The police and the courts enforce the law with no
 lack of will to prosecute violators, although there is some
 reluctance on the part of the police to interfere in domestic
 quarrels. While there is no shelter for battered women, the
 Ministry said the Welfare Department often provides assistance
 to victims of wife beating and child abuse by finding them
 temporary shelter, providing counseling for the victim and the
 perpetrator, or recommending police action. The Welfare
 Department reports all cases of abuse to the police.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the legal right to organize, to choose their
 representatives, and to strike. Less than 20 percent of the
 work force is organized. Although there were no major strikes
 in 1990, there were disruptions by police and civil servants.
 in connection with salary negotiations, and port workers
 refused to handle cargo in protest actions against individual
 companies. While there is no restriction on forming national
 labor federations, the principal unions are unaffiliated to
 each other and maintain-diverse affiliations with
 international trade union organizations.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Antiunion discrimination by employers is prohibited by law,
 and union rights are enforced by judicial and police
 authority. Initial responsibility for ensuring compliance
 lies with the Department of Labor, whose inspectors operate
 under the supervision of the Commissioner of Labor. However,
 the small Labor Inspection Office lacks qualified personnel to
 carry out its duties under existing labor legislation. Unions
 have legally defined rights to organize workers and to bargain
 with employers. Collective bargaining is widespread in the
 nonagricultural sectors of the economy, including the
 government service, and there is also recourse to mediation
 and arbitration by the Government. Labor regulations and
 practice governing Dominica's three industrial estates (free
 trade zones) and its other export firms located outside the
 estates do not differ markedly from those prevailing in the
 rest of the economy. About half of the country's export firms
 have been organized by trade unions. However, it is not
 compulsory for employers to recognize legally constituted
 unions as bargaining agents.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal age for employment is 15 years. In practice
 employers generally observe this law without government
 enforcement.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages for various categories of workers are set by
 statute. In most instances the minimum rate is extremely
 low. The legal standard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. The
 law provides for a minimum of 2 weeks' paid vacation. The
 Employment Safety Act, an occupational health and safety law,
 is considered to be consistent with international standards.
 The enforcement mechanism consists of inspections by the
 Department of Labor, which can and does prescribe specific
 compliance measures, impose fines, and prosecute offenders.
