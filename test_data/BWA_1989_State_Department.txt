 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multiparty democracy. The Constitution vests
 executive power in the President, currently Quett K. J.
 Masire, who was elected in 1984. The President selects the
 Cabinet from the 38-member unicameral National Assembly.
 While there are several political parties in Botswana, in
 practice the country's politics are dominated by the ruling
 Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which has held a large
 parliamentary rnajority since independence in 1966. All
 citizens, including whites, are free to participate fully in
 the economic and political life of Botswana.
 Botswana's small army, the Botswana Defense Force (BDF),
 consists of 6,200 soldiers. The national police force numbers
 about 2,900. Both the BDF and the police are subordinate to
 civilian authority. The army is still being expanded to help
 resist incursions by the South African Defense Force (SADF)
 against suspected ANC (African National Congress) targets in
 Botswana. There were no cross-border raids by South African
 defense forces in 1989. However, there were continued bomb
 threats and minor explosions (believed by local observers to
 be engineered by South Africa) which reinforced Botswana's
 security worries.
 Botswana has a mixed economy and strongly encourages private
 enterprise. Fueled by the development of mineral resources,
 especially'diamonds, the country's economy has grown at a
 rapid rate, with real growth in gross domestic product (GDP)
 averaging 11 percent since 1979. Since independence in 1966,
 per capita GDP has increased from $69 to approximately $1,500
 in 1988. However, some 75 percent of Botswana's population
 lives in rural areas and remains partially dependent for its
 livelihood on subsistence farming and animal husbandry.
 Botswana's human rights record remained good in most
 respects. The legal rights of citizens are provided for by
 law and respected in practice. Political violence is
 virtually unknown, and there is a wide range of public
 expression. However, violence against women is a persistent
 problem in a male-dominated society, and mistreatment of
 detainees, though not condoned by the Government, persists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reported killings instigated either by the
 Government or opposition groups. Unlike previous years, there
 were no casualties from alleged South African incursions
 against suspected ANC targets in 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There are continuing reports of police improperly treating
 persons in custody. Some lawyers report that the police often
 beat up suspects and detainees, although the practice is not
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 universalor*condoned by political leaders or government
 officials.- Penalties for police abuses can range from
 internal police'disciplinary action to regular criminal
 prosecution, 'as in a recent case'where a constable was
 prosecuted for unlawful wounding of a suspect. Police may
 also be ,ued in civil court if they abuse arrestees.
 Flogging is commonly used as a sentence for men for a variety
 of'offenses, including violation of prison rules, rape, armed
 robbery, burglary, and related offenses.
 d. Arbitrary'Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Citizens are protected from arbitrary arrest-under the
 Constitution. After an arrest, a suspect must be charged
 before a magistrate within 48 hours. Once a suspect has
 appeareQ before a magistrate, he can be .detained only if the
 magistrate,issues a writ of detention, which is valid for 14
 days. The detention writ must be renewed eVery 14 days
 thereafter. There. are complaints that-.police and rangers from
 the Department of Wildlife sometimes hold people longer than
 the prescribed 48 hours, but it is not a general practice and
 offending officers are punished or sued successfully in civil
 actions. Persons pharged under the National Security Act must
 be arraigned before a magistrate within 96 hours. Under this
 Act, suspects, once arraigned,.may be held indefinitely, but
 this Act has rarely been invoked in practice. There are no
 reported abuses of these detention procedures. There is a
 functioning system of bail, and arrestees have access to
 -attorneys of their cjoice, although there is no functioning
 .system of public defenders for those unable to.afford a lawyer.
 There is no practice of incommunicado detention in Botswana.
 However, Botswana does not promptly or automatically notify
 embassies when foreign citizens are detained or arrested.
 The Constitution allows the President to declare a person a
 prohibited immigrant and deport him from.the country. No
 explanation is required, nor is any normally given, and the
 order is not subject to judicial review. A prohibited
 immigrant can reenter Botswana only with the permission of the
 President or his designated representative. In 1989 one
 person, a British journalist, was deported under this -
 provision, reportedly for maintaining a-relationship with
 African National Congress supporters.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Botswana's judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches-of government in both law and actual
 practice. Botswana has two court systems, the regular courts
 and the customary (traditional) courts.
 In the regular courts, the defendant's rights to due process
 are guaranteed by law and largely honored in practice. Trials
 are held in public, and court records are public. Trials
 under the National Security Act (NSA) may be held in camera,
 but no trials ï¿½ook place in 1989 under the NSA. Defendants
 have the right to be represented by an attorney, but the
 courts as a rule only appoint public defenders for those
 charged with capital crimes (murder and treason); the lawyers
 in these cases serve on a pro bono basis. Thus, those charged
 with noncapital crimes are often tried without legal
 
 
 24
 BOTSWANA
 representation if they cannot afford an attorney. Defendants
 can confront witnesses and present evidence. While the burden
 of proving guilt lies with the prosecution in ordinary
 criminal cases, some provisions of the National Security Act
 appear to shift the burden of proof to the accused. However,
 these provisions have yet to be tested because the Government
 has not yet brought charges under the National Security Act.
 The customary courts usually handle land, marital, and
 property disputes as well as minor crimes. There are clearly
 defined appeal procedures and appeal courts in both systems,
 with the possibility of appeals to the highest court in
 Botswana, the High Court. Customary courts are open only to
 members of a tribe. The chief presides over the court, and
 there are no attorneys for either side.
 There were no political prisoners in Botswana at the end of
 1989. Two South African commandos, who were convicted of .
 treason in October 1988 for their participation in a bloody
 commando raid inside Botswana, remained in prison.
 (Botswana's law, which is based on Roman-Dutch law, allows
 even noncitizens to be charged with treason.) The High Court
 turned down the commandos, appeal in July 1989, although it
 did set aside the sentence of corporal punishment.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are safeguarded by law and respected in
 practice. A search warrant issued by a magistrate is required
 for an official to enter a private residence, except in cases
 of suspected diamond theft, drug trafficking, or national
 security matters. There were no reported instances where this
 exceptional authority was exercised in 1989.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press:
 Freedom of speech and press are provided for in the
 Constitution and are respected in practice. Opposition
 viewpoints and criticism of the Government are freely
 expressed, as was evident during the campaigning for the
 October parliamentary elections. In two instances the police
 videotaped political rallies, but a public outcry forced them
 to cease this practice.
 Although the Botswana Press Agency (BOPA) is part of the
 Department of Information and Broadcasting, it functions with
 a great deal of autonomy, and its editorials do not always
 reflect the Government's view. However, both the Government
 and the independent press follow unwritten rules against
 criticizing senior officials directly or discussing the
 personal lives or financial affairs of important figures.
 Morever, one independent newspaper which printed a story
 critical of the Government soon found few advertisers and
 attributed this action to government pressure. In addition.
 access to government officials is difficult for the
 independent press as civil servants reportedly prefer the
 "tame" reporters from BOPA.
 There is an ongoing debate on the proper coverage of national
 security issues, which has, in the past, brought the
 independent press under strong government criticism.
 Controversy arose in 1988 when the Government barred reporters
 
 
 25
 BOTSWANA
 and seized their notes during the court-martial trial of a
 Botswana Defense Force (BDF)-corporal, claiming "national
 security" iould be  ompromised by coverage of the trial. The
 pres  insisted thaf the Government was using "national
 security' to biask politically embarrassing facts.
 Books 'ahd publications are'not censored. Academic fteedbm is
 respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly'and Association
 Botswana has a long history of peaceful assembly which is'
 integral to their traditional village life and is exemplified
 in the'village meeting, the kgotla. During jkgotlp meetings',
 peoplefreely question leaders and voice opinions on local
 politics. Permits are required for public meetings and
 demonstrations and are usually granted as long as the bolice
 believe public orider will be maintained.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, seb Section 6.a.'
 c. Freedom of"Religion
 Freedom of religion is practiced and encouraged, -There is no
 state religion in B6tswana, although the majority of the
 population clhim a deniomination of Christianity as their
 belief, Active groups of Hindus, Muslims, Bahalis, and others
 practice-their faiths freely. There are no restrictions on
 religious groups, their places of worship, the training of
 members of clergy, religious publishing, religious education,
 conversion, or participation in charitable activity.
 Missionaries are allowed to enter the country and proselytize,
 and foreign clergy can enter and serve expatriate
 congregations. There is no discrimination based on religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens of Botswana are not restricted in their movements
 within the country, in their foreign travel, emigration, or
 their right to retdrn. Passports are easily obtained.
 Refugees documented by the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) are readily accepted into Botswana,
 although they are required to live-in the refugee settlement
 at Dukweb Refugees may be authorized to live elsewhere for
 documented reasons. Due to allegations from neighboring
 countries that refugees are using Botswana as a launching area
 for operations against their home countries, Botswana has
 declared that Dukwe refugees found off the settlement without
 permission will have abandoned refugee status and will be
 repatriated.
 Although the Government revoked the refugee status of
 Zimbabweans remaining in Botswana in July 1989, the
 Government., in cooperation with the UNHCR, has been remarkably
 understanding regarding their plight. The Government has
 given special consideration to integrating selected persons,
 including students and employed workers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the right peacefully to change their government
 through democratic means, although in practice one party, the
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 BDP, has dominated Parliament since independence. The
 President and Members of Parliament are elected by universal
 suffrage and secret ballot. Thirty-four of the 38 members of
 the National Assembly are elected every 5 years; the remaining
 4 are appointed by the President. Following the October
 elections, the BDP holds 28 of the 34 elective seats in the
 National Assembly. At present there are eight political
 parties. Two of the parties were established just prior to
 the deadline for registering parties for the October
 elections. At the end of 1989, three of the parties were
 represented in Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no international investigations of human rights in
 Botswana in 1989, and the Government continued to permit
 international organizations involved in humanitarian affairs
 to operate in the country. In general, the Government rarely
 comments on human rights violations in other countries though
 it frequently denounces South Africa's apartheid.
 There are no active human rights organizations in Botswana
 which focus specifically on domestic issues, but a
 national-level, nongovernmental human rights watch group, the
 Botswana Association for Human Rights, was in the process of
 organization at the end of 1989. The goals of the Association
 are to focus national attention on those laws which need to be
 amended, to make recommendations to the national law reform
 committee, to heighten public awareness about human rights,
 and to pressure the Government to ratify more of the existing
 international instruments on human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Tswana majority comprises an estimated 95 percent of the
 population. Although ethnic differences are not entirely
 absent, no ethnic or other group suffers from serious
 discrimination. Groups that live in remote areas, including
 the Kgalagadi and the San (formerly called bushmen), are
 becoming increasingly integrated into social service programs,
 but still lag behind the rest of the population in terms of
 educational and economic development and continue to be poorly
 represented in the political arena.
 Women make up 53.9 percent of the population, and almost 50
 percent of female Batswana are heads of households.
 Political, social, and economic opportunities for women are
 limited by a series of laws, and women have no legal recourse
 to challenge sex discrimination cases.
 Women married under either common law or customary (tribal)
 law are subject to practices in which wives assume a legal
 status equivalent to the husband's child. Essentially, this
 means that a woman cannot make a legally binding agreement
 without her husband's consent or assistance. A woman can
 enter a binding transaction as a public trader, but she can
 become a trader only with the consent of her husband. Under
 customary law the husband is permitted to have other wives
 after consulting with the first wife and the families.
 Deference to the husband's wishes also carries over into the
 health field where a women is required to obtain her husband's
 permission for the use of contraceptives or for such operations
 
 
 27
 BOTSWANA
 as a hysterectomy.
 Many observers believe that domesticviolence is common in
 Botswana and is increasing. Undei customary marital
 practices, men have traditionally held theright to physically
 "chastise" their wives, although this attitude is gradually
 changing* Because marital problems are cpnsidered to be a
 problem to be dealt with between the husband and the wife, the
 police'are reluctant to intervene. Frequently problems are
 settled'through, the extended families, and as a result, few
 cases of domesticiviolence 'ever come-before the courts. The
 incidence of rape is also increasing in Botswana. The maximum
 penalty is life-imprisonment with mandatory corporal
 punishipent; the average-sentence is 4 years with corporal
 punishment. A form of female circumcision exists in Botswana,
 but is rarely performed and only by traditional doctors.
 The Government has been slow to introduce reforms to improve
 the status of women. The governing party only established a
 women's wing in 1987 to focus on women's issues. There has
 been, gihce 1981, in the Ministry of' Home Affairs, a women's
 affairs unit, which has published a woman's guide to the law
 and information on the citizenship law and undertaken research
 on maternity leave problems, teenage prdgnancy, and various
 laws affecting women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to establish or join labor unions.
 Government workers who are pensionable may not join unions,
 although they may have associations that function as
 quasi-unions. Unions are well developed in the mineral sector
 and also among railway workers and bank employees, but other
 sectors are less well organized by trade unions. There is one
 major confederation of unions, the Botswana Federation of
 Trad'Unions (BFTU).
 Trade unions in Botswana are independent of government control
 or party affiliation, and they actively seek to represent't-he
 interests of their members. ' However, union leadership is
 severely restricted by a government regulation that requires
 all elected union officials to work full time in the industry
 their union represents. This practice has been criticized by
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU),
 which has also noted that "the dissolution of trade union
 organizations by government is possible-under the law at all
 times."
 Botswana also severely restricts the unions' right-to strike.
 Legal strikes are theoretically possible, but only after an
 exhaustive arbitration process, so that there has never been a
 legal strike in Botswana's history. However, illegal wildcat
 strikes were common in 1989, including major job stoppages by
 teachers and bank employees. Once a strike has been declared
 illegal by the Government, management has the right to dismiss
 employees, and strikers can be jailed. The Government has yet
 to employ such extreme measures against strikers, although the
 Government did withhold prestrike pay from striking teachers.
 Unions may freely join international organizations and labor
 representatives regularly attend international conferences.
 BFTU is affiliated with the ICFTU. In addition, the Botswana
 Mine Workers Union belongs to a regional mine workers' union
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 federation. However, unions have chafed under government
 regulations which prohibit unions from receiving financial
 contributions from outside Botswana.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although employers are required under the Trade Union Act to
 bargain with any trade union that has organized at least 25
 percent of the work force, the actual frequency of collective
 bargaining varies depending upon the organizing strength of
 the union in a particular industry. Collective bargaining is
 common in sectors such as mining and railways where the trade
 unions are relatively strong, but virtually nonexistent in
 other sectors. Collective bargaining is also limited by the
 Government's incomes polioy, which sets public sector salaries
 as a benchmark for private sector wage settlements.
 Although there are laws in Botswana which prohibit employers
 from dismissing workers for union activities, there is some
 dispute as to how well they are enforced. Other reasons are
 always given for such dismissals, so it is difficult for the
 dismissed employee to prove that union activities were the
 real reason. Dismissals can be appealed to labor officers or
 the civil courts, but labor officers rarely do much more than
 order 2 months' severance pay, and most workers cannot afford
 civil litigation. There are no export processing zones in
 Botswana. Labor laws are applied uniformly throughout the
 country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is not practiced in Botswana and is.
 specifically forbidden in the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Botswana law prohibits the employment of children under 12
 years of age by anyone except members of the child's immediate
 family. No juvenile under the age of 15 may be employed in
 any industry, and only those over 16 may be employed in night
 work. No person 16 or younger is permitted to work in
 hazardous jobs, including mining. Botswana law also protects
 young people from recruiters for jobs outside the country.
 There are reports that some scattered violations of these
 standards do occur, especially in small-scale enterprises, in
 large part because the Department of Labor in the Ministry of
 Labor is insufficiently staffed to enforce full compliance.
 Although education is not yet compulsory, it is almost
 universally available, and most children attend school at
 least through the primary grades. The Government has
 indicated it hopes to make 9 years of education compulsory by
 1992.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Botswana requires a minimum wage of approximately $80 per
 month. The minimum wage is generally enforced. This amount
 is barely adequate for one persdn to maintain a decent
 standard of living, and, in most cases, workers must
 supplement this amount through other means, such as
 subsistence farming. Most Botswana families have more than one
 wage earner.
 Botswana law mandates a maximum 48-hour workweek, with
 provisions for overtime pay (time and a half) for work over 48
 
 
 29
 BOTSWANA
 hours. Most major employers adhere to the workweek laws, but
 some smaller firms refuse to pay overtime, and no action is
 tzken against them.
 The Government sets job health and safety standards, and these
 regulations appear to be generally observed, although the
 Department of Labor lacks personnel t6 ensure enforcement.
