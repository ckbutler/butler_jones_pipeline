 GUINEA
 In 1987 the Guinean Military Committee for National Recovery
 (CMRN) continued its hold on political power as General
 Lansana Conte entered his fourth year as Head of State. The
 CMRN assumed power in 1984 after the death of Sekou Toure,
 inheriting a 27-year legacy of mismanagement and leftwing
 authoritarianism. With the Constitution suspended since 1984,
 the military Government rules through ordinances, decrees, and
 decisions issued by the President and various ministers. The
 Guinean penal code, which took effect in 1965, regulates
 treatment of prisoners, delegates authority to permit public
 assemblies, and provides some guarantees of personal liberties.
 The code was generally disregarded during the Toure regime.
 The CMRN, however, has increased enforcement of the code, and
 it remains the only major legislative guarantee of certain
 rights.
 The armed forces number about 9,000 persons, with the army
 alone consisting of some 8,000 officers and soldiers. The
 national police (gendarmerie) helps provide internal security,
 as does a well-armed presidential guard.
 Eighty percent of Guinea's population of 5.8 million is
 dependent on subsistence agriculture, with per capita annual
 income estimated at barely $300. The country relies largely
 on mineral resources, mainly bauxite, for export income which
 has been declining due to falling world prices for bauxite.
 Under the CMRN, Guinea has been attempting to create an
 economic environment conducive to free market activities, and
 its comprehensive economic reform program has diversified the
 small salaried work force and made it less dependent on public
 service jobs.
 Guinea's human rights record was tarnished in May 1987 when,
 after secret trials, the CMRN confirmed that 58 persons,
 including 9 former cabinet ministers and 30 military officers,
 had been sentenced to death. Another 143 persons were
 sentenced to imprisonment. Some of the victims had been
 supporters of Guinea's former dictator, Sekou Toure. Others
 were opponents of the CMRN regime who had attempted a coup in
 July 1985. A December 31 presidential amnesty released 67
 persons, including the widow and son of Sekou Toure.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 On May 5, 1987, the ruling CMRN issued a communique announcing
 death sentences for 58 opponents of the current regime and
 supporters of the former Government. Twenty-one of the 58
 were sentenced in absentia. International press reports
 claimed the remaining 37 had been summarily executed before
 the sentencing was even announced, probably immediately after
 the 1985 coup atttempt.
 b. Disappearance
 No politically motivated abductions or disappearances were
 reported during 1987.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Puni-shment
 The CMRN has denounced the human rights atrocities of the
 former Toure dictatorship and has begun to enforce provisions
 of the 1965 penal code which forbid torture and abuse of
 authority. Some mistreatment of prisoners continues, and
 .prison conditions remain squalid and unsanitary. The
 Government is attempting to implement judicial and prison
 reformswhich will improve conditions. A program to train
 wardens and-:ther prison personnel is being developed with the
 help of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Government does not have total control of the police, and
 weak discipline in the lower ranks of the police, gendarmerie,
 and military forces has led to isolated abuses. For example,
 low level officials reportedly continue to make unauthorized
 .arrests in an -attempt to supplement low salaries through
 *extortion. Presidential admonitions and frequent campaigns
 against this practice in the government-owned media have not
 succeeded in eliminating this practice. By law, an accused
 criminal can be held incommunicado for 72 hours and only has
 the right to counsel after first appearing before a judge.
 There are sometimes delays in acknowledging arrests of common
 criminals. Political prisoners, such as those held after the
 1985 coup attempt, have been detained for extended periods of
 time.
 Compulsory labor is prohibited and not practiced in Guinea.
 e. -)enial of Fair Public Trial
 The numberof political prisoners and detainees still in
 prison is not known. The CMRN communique of  4ay 5., 1987, also
 announced that 143 opponents Gr the regime were sentenced to
 prison terms of 28 months to 8 years. -Most of these prisoners
 had been held since 1985. A presidential amnesty on December
 31 released, according to the Government, 67 of these-persons,
 including the widow and son of former dictator Sekou Toure.
 Much of the infoimationeoncerning procedures of arrest,
 interrogation, detention,%sentencing, and release of
 prisoners, under the jurisdiction of the Court of State
 Security and the Military Court, was not available.
 The Court of State Security was established in 1985 under the
 CMRN to try cases involving national security, including, but
 not limited to,-treason. Civilian officials of the former
 regime and civillans implicated in the. July 1985 coup attempt
 were tried by the Court of State Security in secret
 proceedings. All accused were charged with committing common
 crimes and were represented by lawyers. Sentences for some of
 the accused were announced only in May 1987. Likewise, the
 Military Court, also created in 1985 with jurisdiction-ovier
 offenses c6mmitted by Guinean military personnel, held secret
 proceedings to judge those military personnel involved in the
 July 1985 coup attempt. Details regarding those proceedings,
 including verdicts and sentences, remain undisclosed.
 Guinea's judicial and institutional reform continued in 1987,
 including new licensing procedures for attorneys, notaries,
 bailiffs and marshals. The Guinean penal code contains
 provisions for presumption of innocence of accused persons,
 independence of judges, equality of citizens before the law,
 
 
 128
 GUINEA
 the right of accused to counsel and to appeal a judicial
 decision, and provisions for amnesty. The judiciary has
 courts of first instance, or justices of the peace, at the
 local level and two courts of appeal (one in Kankan, one in
 Conakry). The Court of Annulment is the Guinean court of last
 appeal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government has stressed traditional family values and the
 inviolability of the home. In general, the CMRN is less
 willing than the previous regime to abuse police powers. In
 1987 the CMRN increased police authority to fight rising
 crime, but arbitrary interference in citizens, lives
 continues, including through police harassment. Though not
 officially sanctioned, mail and telephone calls are subject to
 monitoring in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press.
 All media are owned and operated by the Government, and
 freedom of the press does not exist.  The Guinean penal code
 contains numerous restrictions on speech and press freedoms;
 authors must indicate name, profession, and place of residence
 on every article published. Publications which incite crime
 or are contrary to good morals are prohibited, as are insult,
 defamation, and libel. The Ministry of Information and
 Culture continues to act both as administrator and censor and
 has permitted some movement in the direction of press
 freedom. There was increased investigative reporting and more
 noncontroversial editorials in the government-controlled media
 during 1987. Many foreign publications circulate freely in
 Guinea, including some critical of the Government, and no
 attempt is made to interfere with foreign radio broadcasts.
 Foreign press reports have raised public consciousness of
 human rights issues in Guinea. A cabinet-level film
 censorship board was established by decree in July 1987.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public gatherings can take place only with the approval of the
 Government. The CMRN has encouraged the formation of
 nongovernmental organizations, and a number were chartered by
 the Guinean Secretary of State for Decentralization in 1987.
 However, governmental respect for peaceful assembly has not
 been uniform. For example, meetings of the Rotary Club of
 Conakry were briefly suspended in late 1986 after a government
 official felt he had been insulted by the club. The Guinean
 penal code bans any meeting which has an ethnic or racial
 character or any gathering "whose nature threatens national
 unity."
 Most salaried Guineans--many of whom are civil servants--are
 affiliated with the Guinean National Labor Confederation
 (CNTG), a relatively new organization with close ties to the
 Government. Nongovernment workers can strike only with the
 permission of the CNTG board, a requirement which reduces the
 likelihood of strikes. The Government has dealt severely with
 wildcat strikers in the past. In April striking bus drivers
 returned to work after strike leaders were summarily
 dismissed. The strike was not sanctioned by the CNTG.
 Collective bargaining has taken place in Guinea, most notably
 
 
 129
 GUINEA
 in 1986 when the CNTG concluded an agreement with the mining
 companies. The CNTG maintains relations with recognized
 regiofial and international bodies, including the International
 Labor Organization (ILO).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Guineans enjoy religious freedom and tolerance of all faiths.
 Missionaries can proselytize in Guinea. Although an estimated
 85 percent of the population is at least nominally Muslim,
 there is no'official state religion. The Government observes
 both major Christian and Muslim holidays.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Guineans are free to move about the country and to change
 place of residence and work, although in practice they face
 harassment by police and military at unauthorized roadblocks,
 particularly at night. It is common for individual citizens
 to pay bribes to avoid police harassment. The Government
 acknowledges that drug-related crime and juvenile delinquence
 have been increasing, and police patrols and authorized-
 checkpoints have multiplied. Foreign travel for Guinean
 citizens is complex, involving considerable red tape to obtain
 passports and required exit visas. Foreigners are required to
 obtain prior authorization for travel into the interior of
 Guinea. 'Recently this authorization has been granted almost
 routinely.
 The rapid increase in the number of Western expatriates in
 Guinea since the CMRN seized power caused the Government to
 tighten immigration and residence requirements for foreigners
 in 1987. Foreigners require exit visas to leave Guinea.
 Applications are occasionally delayed. The Government has
 encouraged Guinean expatriates, including former exiles of the
 Sekou Toure regime, to return home. There are still
 significant numbers of Guineans living in neighboring African
 countries and in France.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guinea has had no long-term experience with democracy since
 independence, and citizens are unable to change their
 government under democratic procedures. The CMRN banned
 political parties when it took power in April 1984, and formal
 political activity does not yet exist in Guinea.
 Decentralization remained a major theme in 1987, and the
 Government strengthened development of local government
 advisory bodies at the village level in rural areas.
 Nonpartisan elections have taken place in most parts of the
 country, at the subprefecture level, for selection of
 officials responsible for local development projects, and
 social issues. These officials complement the subprefects,
 prefects, and provincial governors appointed by the military
 authorities in Conakry.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Human
 Rights Violations
 After the May 1987 announcement regarding the sentencing of
 201 persons, the CMRN allowed Amnesty International (AI) to
 send a two-member team to Guinea to investigate the legal
 
 
 130
 GUINEA
 proceedings of the Court of State Security and the Military
 Court. The AI team had access to high level government
 officials and to families and friends of the victims. The
 Government permits a local affiliate of AI to operate.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Racial or ethnic discrimination is prohibited by the penal
 code, but discrimination and mutual suspicion still affect
 relations across ethnic lines within and outside the
 Government. The CMRN has made efforts to include
 representatives of all major ethnic groups in the Government,
 but the Soussou group, to which President Conte belongs,
 predominates at the highest, most influential levels. The
 Government repeatedly urges Guineans to think of themselves as
 a nation and not as members of a particular ethnic group.
 Women in Guinea enjoy a special status conferred by law and
 custom. A 1986 decree created a national Office on the
 Condition of Women in the Secretariat of State for Social
 Affairs. Guinean women have held cabinet posts,
 ambassadorships, judicial positions, and other high level
 government posts. Women are prominent in music, dance,
 sports, and business throughout the country. Nevertheless, in
 traditional, rural Guinea, women's rights are more limited by
 custom. Overall, women lag behind in school enrollments and
 in employment opportunities. The Government has affirmed the
 principle of equal pay for equal work, but in practice women
 receive less pay than men in most jobs.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Children are not usually employed in nonfarm jobs outside the
 family. Guinea's labor and social security laws provide for
 modest compensation for work-related accidents and illnesses.
 Guinea's new labor code, drafted with ILO assistance, will set
 higher standards for occupational health and safety, a
 standardized workweek, and a minimum employment age of 17.
 Significantly higher standards apply to modern mining enclaves.
 In practice, application of labor standards and laws outside
 the mining enclaves is highly variable. There is no minimum
 wage.
