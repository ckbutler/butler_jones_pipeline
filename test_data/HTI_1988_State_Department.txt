 HAITI
 Haiti was ruled by four different governments in 1988, none of
 which came to power through a credible democratic process.
 The year began under the National Council of Government (CNG),
 headed by Lieutenant General Henri Namphy, which assumed power
 upon the overthrow of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in
 February 1986, and was to rule as a provisional government
 until presidential elections could be held. After the
 violence-aborted elections of November 29, 1987, -a second
 election, in which participation was very low, was held under
 military supervision on January 17, 1988, resulting in the
 election of Leslie Manigat. This election was widely believed
 to have been manipulated by the military. Manigat was
 installed as President on February 7. Four months later, on
 June 20, Manigat was ousted by the military when he attempted
 to force through various retirements and transfers of senior
 officers. Namphy resumed power, ignored the Constitution,
 dissolved the legislature, and established a military
 government. In early September, thugs who were widely assumed
 to have been acting for the Namphy Government, attacked
 several churches, radio stations, and political party
 headquarters. In part as a response to these attacks, on
 September 17 noncommissioned officers and soldiers of the
 Presidential Guard led a coup against President Namphy and
 asked Lieutenant General Prosper Avril to replace him.
 The Forces Armees d'Haiti (FAD'H) constitutes the state
 security apparatus. Politically motivated groups of hired
 thugs, acting at the behest of unidentified persons, were
 responsible for several unexplained killings, and occasional
 mob violence in Haiti in 1988. Additionally, remnants of the
 disbanded national militia, the National Security Volunteers
 (VSN), popularly known as Ton Ton Macoutes, disrupted public
 order frequently in 1988. The VSN was originally formed by
 President-for-Life Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier. Its remnants
 have often attached themselves to figures of authoritarian
 bent. The Macoutes themselves were the targets of "popular
 justice" killings immediately following the September 17 coup
 d'etat which toppled the Namphy Government.
 Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and the
 most densely populated. Its faltering economy continues to
 burden all other aspects of life. There is a great disparity
 between the income levels of the upper and lower classes, and
 urban slums in Haiti are widely viewed to be among the worst
 in the world. The withdrawal of foreign aid after the aborted
 elections of November 1987 further damaged the economy and
 encouraged the continuation of the contraband trade, mostly in
 basic commodities such as rice, wheat flour, and sugar.
 The first three governments which held power in Haiti in 1988
 (from January 1 to September 17) failed to defend effectively
 the human rights of the populace from attacks by
 extragovernmental organizations. In many instances, the
 Government instigated or tolerated these actions, and in
 others there was strong suspicion that acts of violence were
 committed directly by the Government or its officials.
 Politically motivated killings, mistreatment of prisoners, and
 arbitrary arrests and detention took place in Haiti before the
 coup which unseated the Namphy Government. Freedom of speech
 and of the press, of association, and of movement were, in
 general, not directly restricted by the governments in power
 during the year. Nonetheless, before the September 17 coup,
 bands of thugs attacked people and institutions with the
 apparent purpose of preventing the exercise of basic rights.

 HAITI
 These attacks were often perpetrated with at least the
 acquiescence, if not the approval, of the Government.
 Early actions in the human rights area taken by the Avril
 Government were positive. Avril removed many corrupt,
 abusive, or otherwise undesired officers from the military,
 appointed a mostly civilian cabinet, and declared his
 intention to resume the transition to democracy and to
 establish a permanent electoral commission which would set
 forth procedures, establish timetables, and monitor new
 elections at both the local and national levels.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.
 Section%1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Currently available evidence is insufficient to demonstrate
 conclusively that any of the four governments of 1988 took
 direct part in any political killings. However, the National
 Council of Government (CNG) and the Namphy Government, as well
 as individual government officials, were widely viewed as
 tolerant of such killings and possibly implicated in them.
 What is clear is that the first three governments failed'to
 protect the populace from politically motivated killings or to
 investigate and prosecute effectively those responsible for
 the killings which did take place.
 In July human rights attorney and activist Lafontant Joseph
 was murdered by unknown assailants. The Namphy Government
 announced the formation of a committee of inquiry, but no
 results were ever made public.
 In August four young people, members of a local youth group,
 were killed in the rural village of Labadie by four gunmen who
 opened fire on a public gathering of this youth organization
 which allegedly had a political orientation. Some witnesses
 contended that the gunmen were dressed partially in military
 uniforms. The local government official, termed the Section
 Chief, was widely accused of having instigated the killings on
 political grounds. A commission formed by the Namphy
 Government briefly investigated the killings, but again no
 results were ever made public. After the September 17 coup,
 this Section Chief's house was sacked and burned by
 townspeople in an apparent reprisal for the killings. He went
 into hiding.
 On September 11, a group of approximately 50 thugs armed with
 handguns, machetes, and truncheons attacked the Catholic
 church of St. Jean Bosco in downtown Port-Au-Prince, killing
 11 people, injuring more than 70, and burning down the
 church. The then mayor of Port-Au-Prince, Franck Romain, and
 the Namphy Government itself were thought by many to have been
 behind this incident. Others contended that the Government
 condoned the attack. The Namphy Government announced a
 commission of inquiry. No results were ever made public, and
 the Namphy Government was brought down in a coup d'etat 1 week
 after the attack on the church. After the coup, several
 persons were immediately identified by the public as the
 attackers of the church. They were killed by crowds in acts
 of uncontrolled public revenge. Such acts by the populace
 against those accused of participating in the September
 attacks, and against others accused of being former Macoutes,
 
 
 600
 HAITI
 have diminished since the early days following the coup.
 Romain sought political asylum in the Embassy of the Dominican
 Republic in Port-Au-Prince, where he remained at year's end.
 The Avril Government undertook an extensive housecleaning of
 the military and police, retiring or removing more than 100
 officers who were beyond retirement age or regarded as being
 corrupt, abusive, or otherwise unsuitable.
 The Avril Government released previously confidential
 investigative reports on the election violence of November 29,
 1987, and on the murder of presidential candidate Eugene
 Athis. In response to widespread criticism of the reports,
 the Avril Government invited human rights activists, lawyers,
 and others to nominate candidates to a new commssion to
 reinvestigate the November 1987 election violence. Further, a
 warrant for the arrest of a suspect in the killing of Eugene
 Athis was issued in December 1988. Additionally, the Avril
 Government announced that it had taken into custody four
 suspects accused of participation in the 1987 murder of
 presidential candidtae Yves Volel.
 There were no reports of any political killings perpetrated
 by, or with the complicity of the new Government after
 September 17, although the "popular justice" killings of the
 accused St. Jean Bosco church attackers were not hindered by
 the Avril Government. Additionally, there were several
 unexplained killings in the months following the September
 coup. These killings gave rise to public concerns at the
 perceived climate of insecurity. The perpetrators and their
 motives remain unclear.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reliable reported incidents of disappearances in
 Haiti in 1988. None of the governments which held power in
 Haiti in 1988 was known to have investigated a report of 50
 persons who allegedly disappeared after being taken into
 government custody in November 1987. Some human rights groups
 believed that these persons were murdered, while other persons
 suggested that the entire event was a fabrication. The CNG,
 which governed Haiti at the end of 1987 and the beginning of
 1988, denied that the Government had ever taken custody of
 these persons. No further evidence has yet surfaced.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 The Constitution specifically prohibits physical brutality
 during interrogation and provides for the right of the accused
 to have a lawyer and witnesses present during the
 interrogation process. Evidence indicates that torture did
 take place in Haiti in 1988, and that, at least before
 September 17, police beatings of prisoners was a common
 practice.
 Since the accession to power of the Avril Government, one
 substantiated case of abuse attributed to Haitian police
 authorities has received considerable public attention. This
 incident involved the arrest and beating of several innocent
 civilians in November during the conduct of an investigation
 into the death of a Haitian Air Force soldier and his wife.
 The new Chief of Police, who had issued a public statement on
 October 3 promising to professionalize the police force and
 prevent such abuses, immediately offered a public apology for
 
 
 601
 HAITI
 the incident and promised to discipline the police agents
 involved.
 In 1988 in five well-documented cases, examples of cruel
 treatment were noted. In March reliable eyewitnesses saw
 police in the coastal town of Cabaret kicking prisoners and
 beating them repeatedly with the butts of their rifles in
 front of the police station as they transferred them from a
 police vehicle into the station.
 In April two American citizens held by Haitian police were
 observed with severe bruises. The prisoners contended that
 these bruises were the result of having been beaten by prison
 guards using night sticks several times a day for several
 days.
 In July an army officer arrested a man who supposedly owed him
 money. The man was taken to an army barracks where he died
 after being beaten on the orders of the arresting officer.
 The officer was arrested, and court martial proceedings were
 initiated. The officer was subsequently discharged from
 military service, but no criminal charges were brought against
 him.
 In August nine persons were arrested in the Central Department
 and detained at the Departmental Capital at Hinche. It was
 widely reported that eight of the arrestees were severely
 beaten by police. A local human rights group stated that it
 had documented the abuses by medical examinations.
 Soldiers arrested by the Avril Government in October in
 connection with the alleged planning of another military coup
 were reportedly beaten in the course of being subdued.
 Complaints were frequent about physical abuse by rural Section
 Chiefs and some other local officials. Often the sole
 government representative in remote areas, the Section Chiefs
 act as a police authority and wields considerable power. The
 Avril Government removed a number of these officials from
 office and, in December, issued a decree stating that the
 position of Section Chief, once an appointed official, would
 become an elected office.
 Prison conditions are generally poor, and prisoners are likely
 to encounter limited hygienic facilities, inadequate food and
 health care, and ill-treatment by prison staff. The Avril
 Government ordered the closing of Fort Dimanche, a detention
 facility which had frequently been used by the Duvalier
 authorities and around which a cruel reputation had
 developed. Recherches Criminelles, another notorious
 detention center and the headquarters of many of the irregular
 "detectives" of the Duvalier era, was made into a purely
 investigative police facility.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Haitian law, a person may be arrested or detained if
 apprehended during the commission of a crime or pursuant to a
 judicial warrant based on evidence justifying the arrest. In
 all other cases, the person arrested must be brought before a
 judge within 48 hours to determine the legality of his
 detention. If the judge determines that a legal basis for the
 arrest exists, the person may be detained for further legal
 process; otherwise, he must be released. In practice,
 
 
 602
 HAITI
 weaknesses in the judicial system frequently lead to lengthy
 pretrial detention.
 Haitian law requires that a suspect be formally charged at
 least 2 weeks before trial. By law, the accused is permitted
 to meet with an attorney immediately before trial, although
 defendants are sometimes able to meet informally with counsel
 shortly after arrest. There is no public defender or system
 of bail in Haiti. However, judges may, and sometimes do,
 grant provisional liberty to a prisoner. Civilian cases may
 be brought before a jury, and, in the case of military
 personnel, before a court-martial.
 There were a number of arbitrary arrests in 1988. In January
 political leader and former presidential candidate Louis
 Dejoie was arrested on arrival at Port-Au-Prince International
 Airport on his return from a trip to Puerto Rico where he had
 been critical of the recent presidential elections. He was
 held in prison for 2 days, then released unconditionally
 without being charged. In a similar occurrence, Dr. Louis
 Roy, a member of the 1987 Constituent Assembly, was detained
 at the airport on his return from abroad, apparently on police
 orders, but was released after a few hours with no legal
 action being taken against him.
 In March four people were arrested on suspicion of illegal
 weapons possession. They were detained by the Haitian
 judicial system for more than 5 months without charges ever
 being brought. In another case in March, the Haitian
 Government detained four American citizens who were
 apprehended in the course of a shootout with members of the
 military. The Government of Haiti, despite its obligations
 under international law and practice, failed to inform the
 U.S. Embassy of their detention. After holding them in prison
 for several weeks, the Government released and deported them
 without ever formally charging them.
 Journalist and political leader Paul Constant, was jailed on
 October 1 and accused of possessing hidden weapons. Hi was
 freed 10 days later. Several persons arrested on suspicion of
 involvement in the September 11 attack on St. Jean Bosco
 church or in the November 29 election violence were detained
 on September 30. The status of judicial proceedings against
 them is unknown.
 The soldiers who were arrested on October 15 and accused of
 participating in a destabilization effort against the
 Government were held without formal charges until mid-December
 when an investigative commission submitted its report in their
 case. The report concluded that some of those accused had
 plotted against the Government and others had been misled by
 the plotters into thinking that they were stopping a coup
 attempt. All of the active-duty soldiers were released from
 prison before the end of Dedember and discharged from the
 military. Of the accused plotters, only ex-colonel Samuel
 Jeremie remains in prison where he continues to serve out a
 sentence on a previous, unrelated murder conviction.
 The Constitution prohibits deportation or forced exile of
 Haitian citizens. Nonetheless, ex-Presidents Manigat and
 Namphy were both exiled when deposed from office. Returning
 exiles have 2 years in which to renounce foreign nationality
 and regain Haitian nationality. Three recognized political
 figures exiled under previous governments were permitted to
 return to Haiti under the Avril Government.
 
 
 603
 HAITI
 In August a Canadian priest was summarily expelled from Haiti,
 without legal recourse, after reportedly having refused to
 partidipate in a rally in support of President Namphy and
 having criticized the Government. The Avril Government
 rescinded the order expelling the priest.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair public
 trial, but weaknesses in the judicial system sometimes deny
 this right in practice.- Misunderstanding, illiteracy, and a
 fear bred of 30 years of dictatorship cause many Haitians to
 ignore summons for jury duty.
 Arraignments and trials are held in public and often receive
 extensive media coverage. Defendants have the right to be
 present and to be represented by a lawyer. The judicial
 system allows the Government broad leeway in the prosecution
 of cases. Public trials under the existing system are not
 generally denied, but weaknesses in the system, such as
 lengthy delays and outside influence on judges and other
 judicial officials, can effectively limit the accused person's
 exercise of his right to a fair trial.
 As of December 25, 1988, there were no political prisoners
 known to be held by the Government.
 Many persons publicly accused of crimes are subjected to
 extralegal summary public justice, a traditional means of
 punishing criminals which is prevalent in remote areas of the
 country and in cases of great notoriety. After the September
 17 coup, several persons suspected of having participated in
 the various atrocities of the week of September 11 were killed
 by crowds and their bodies burned. The nascent Avril
 Government did not interfere in the exercise of this vigilante
 justice in the immediate aftermath of the September 17 coup,
 but after several days attempted to curtail such activities.
 A "people's court," which continued to operate some weeks
 after the coup, provoked the Ministry of Justice to order its
 dissolution, and government troops enforced the order.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 During 1988, there were instances in which government troops
 invaded private homes, ostensibly in search of arms, and
 sometimes robbed or ransacked the premises. In response to
 these incidents, the Avril Government instituted procedures
 whereby searches were put under tighter controls.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression for all citizens is provided for by the
 Constitution. There are several privately owned daily and
 weekly newspapers and radio stations, including influential
 stations owned and operated by the Protestant and Catholic
 Churches. The Government operates the L'Union newspaper,
 Radio Nationale, and a television station. A privately owned
 cable television system also operates independently. Print
 and broadcast media were frequently critical of the
 Government, giving voice to political and civil organizations
 
 
 604
 HAITI
 across the political spectrum. The government-owned
 television and radio stations followed a staunchly
 progovernment editorial line. Privately owned radio,
 television, and print media operated without censorship.
 Although the press and radio continued to operate following
 the aborted November 29, 1987, elections, they restrained
 their criticisms of the Namphy Government after the June 19-20
 coup. Several journalists from independent Radio-Cacique and
 other stations reported receiving threats by telephone and in
 some cases in person. During the week of September 11, Radio
 Cacique was attacked three times by thugs who also attacked
 Catholic Radio Soleil and the offices of two political parties
 and burned down three churches. In that same week,
 journalists were threatened by unidentified persons who warned
 them against entering certain neighborhoods in Port-Au-Prince.
 The Namphy Government, which fell the week after these
 attacks, took no measures to protect these stations. The
 Avril Government sent military guards to protect Radio Cacique
 for 3 days after the September 17 coup, and volunteered to pay
 half the cost of the damages to the station. Additionally,
 the Government formally declared that it would guarantee the
 rights of journalists to pursue their work.
 Government-run media has continued to follow a mostly
 progovernment line under the Avril Government, but private
 media freely criticized the Government without official or
 self-imposed censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association are provided for
 by the Constitution. Political parties and human rights
 groups, as well as other private organizations, were very
 active in 1988.
 However, under Namphy, the Government attempted to institute a
 regulation requiring all social, political, or other mass
 organizations to have a member of the military present at all
 meetings, allegedly to assure public order. Several
 organizations contended that it was an attempt by the
 Government to infiltrate, monitor, and intimidate them.
 Similarly, several groups protesting the arrest of eight
 peasants and their leaders in Hinche in August contended that
 the arrests were intended by the Government to restrict the.
 peasants* freedom of assembly.
 Soon after the September coup , a coalition of groups proposed
 a massive demonstration in downtown Port-Au-Prince in support
 of the soldiers of the new Government. The Government
 persuaded them not to stage the demonstration at that time in
 the interest of public order. The demonstration did take
 place, without incident, a week later. The Government did not
 interfere, and soldiers accompanied the marchers with the
 announced intention of protecting them. In addition, several
 rallies were held, without government interference, in
 September and October in support of popular and controversial
 Catholic priest Father Jean Bertrand Aristide. In ensuing
 weeks, demonstrations generally took place without government
 interference. However, in a few cases the Government did ban
 or disperse some demonstrations.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 
 
 605
 HAITI
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religion is an integral part of Haitian life and culture and
 is practiced widely without interference from the Government.
 Roman Catholicism is embraced in varying degrees by about 75
 percent of the population. Voodoo, a mixture of African
 Animism and Christianity, is also practiced by a majority of
 Haitians. Various Protestant denominations and foreign
 missionary groups openly proselytize in Haiti. There are no
 government restrictions on missionary activities, affiliations
 with overseas coreligionists, or religious instruction and
 publishing.
 Nonetheless, prior to September 17, the Namphy Government
 interfered with Catholic Church activities it deemed political
 by expelling a Canadian priest. He was permitted to return on
 October 9 by the Avril Government. Namphy's widely surmised
 involvement with, or toleration of, the September church
 burning was seen by some to have had religious as well as
 political overtones.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not normally restrict domestic travel of
 citizens or foreigners. An irregular network of military
 checkpoints operates across Haiti. Foreigners and interurban
 travelers infrequently are asked to register when entering
 certain towns. There are no restrictions on persons changing
 their residences or place of employment. Every Haitian
 citizen is eligible for a passport and generally travel
 documents are neither issued nor denied on the basis of
 political considerations.
 Economic migrants continue to leave Haiti bound for
 destinations in more prosperous areas of the Caribbean or the
 United States. Pursuant to a 1981 agreement with the
 Government of Haiti on the interdiction of undocumented
 migrants, approximately 5,000 would be illegal migrants to the
 United States mere repatriated to Haiti from international
 waters by the U.S. Coast Guard. U.S. Immigration and
 Naturalization Service officers are embarked on the Coast
 Guard vessels to interview potential applicants for political
 asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The right of Haitian citizens to change their government is
 embodied in the 1987 Constitution which provides that all male
 and female citizens 18 years of age and older have the right
 to vote. Voting is not mandatory but is noted in the
 Constitution as a citizen's duty. A secret ballot ks not
 guaranteed. The Constitution provides for a 5-year
 presidential term. Women enjoy full political'rights but
 there are few women at the upper levels of politics and
 government.
 The 1987 Constitution provided for regional, national
 legislative, and national presidential elections in 1987 under
 the supervision of an independent electoral commission None
 of the elections organized by the electoral commission ever
 took place in 1987 because of various incidents of public
 disturbance and violence. After violence caused the
 cancellation of the November 29, 1987 presidential elections,
 
 
 606
 HAITI
 the ruling National Council of Government (CNG) dissolved the
 standing electoral commission and nominated a new one with
 members of its own choosing.
 The new electoral commission organized national elections on
 January 17, 1988, and local elections on January 31. The
 participation in these elections was very low, and the results
 were widely viewed as having been manipulated by the military.
 Following his accession to power on September 17, General
 Avril, accompanied by Sergeant Hebreux (representing the
 non-commissioned officers) consulted with a broad spectrum of
 organizations, including the major political parties, the
 Catholic and Protestant Churches, and labor unions to
 ascertain their views on how the Government could best effect
 the return to democracy. President Avril called on these
 elements and others to submit final comments by December 22 on
 a new draft electoral decree which his Government had
 circulated. Based on their commentaries, Presijdent Avril has
 stated that a conference of political and social leaders will
 be convened in early January 1989 to work out the details of
 the newly proposed Electoral College. He stated that he hopes
 to have this body in place by early February so that the
 process of moving to new elections can get under way.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Under President Namphy, the Government received visits from
 the Organization of American States' (OAS) Inter-American
 Human Rights Commission (IAHRC) and a group of international
 human rights organizations led by Americas Watch, to Haiti in
 1988. Besides government officials, the groups met with
 church leaders, labor organizations, human rights
 organizations, and in some cases the general public. Both
 groups of visitors were granted access to several prisons and
 were allowed to interview prisoners, some of whom complained
 about the conditions and circumstances of their incarceration.
 Several local human rights organizations functioned in Haiti
 in 1988. Their activities generally were not obstructed,
 although some organization leaders expressed concern during
 the Namphy Government because of threats and the murder of
 Lafontant Joseph.
 Because some persons who had met with the IAHRC were present
 in St. Jean Bosco church during the attack on September 11,
 the IAHRC accused the Namphy Government of mounting reprisals
 against those persons.
 President Avril and members of his Government received a
 delegation of the International Federation of the Rights of
 Man in December. Also in that month the Government issued
 decrees putting into force four international human rights
 conventions: the U.N. Covenant on Economic, Social, and
 Cultural Rights; the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights; the Inter-American Convention Against Torture; and the
 United Nations Convention on Torture.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Ninety-five percent of Haitians are descendants of African
 slaves who gained their independence from France through
 
 
 607
 HAITI
 revolution in 1804. Most of the rest are Mulatto or of
 European or Middle Eastern descent. Under Haitian law, no
 distinctions are made with regard to race. Nonetheless, there
 are longstanding social and political tensions between blacks
 and mulattos which date back to Haiti's revolutionary period.
 Haiti has two official languages, French and Creole. All
 Haitians speak Creole. French is spoken by only about 20
 percent of the population and is primarily limited to the
 educated classes. There is no official linguistic
 discrimination, but some social class divisions are sometimes
 drawn along linguistic lines. Though the overwhelming
 majority of text is still in French, written media
 increasingly carry articles in Creole. Creole is the
 predominant language for radio and television.
 The role of women in Haiti is limited by tradition, but there
 is no legal discrimination between the sexes. Women enjoy
 equal legal rights in education, property, and voting.
 Peasant women remain largely in traditional occupations such
 as farming, marketing, and domestic tasks. Middle-class women
 make up a large proportion of the work force and dominate the
 secretarial, nursing, and teaching professions. Men-and women
 are generally paid equally for equal work.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers and employers do not need government authorization to
 establish and join organizations; a minimum of 10 members for
 the workers' groups and 5 for employers' groups are required.
 A group must, however, register with the Ministry of Social
 Affairs within 60 days of its establishment. Workers,
 including civil servants and public sector employees, are free
 to organize unions under the Constitution. Unions are not
 controlled or restricted by the Government but they may not
 engage in commercial activities or concern themselves with
 matters unconnected with the defense of workers' rights.
 It is impossible to judge accurately the number of workers who
 belong to unions because each federation claims thousands of
 unemployed or peasant members. It is estimated that, in
 total, there are fewer than 10,000 employed members who belong
 to local unions, which usually claim to represent all workers
 in individual factories, regardless of each worker's personal
 affiliation or loyalty to the union.
 There are four major labor federations in Haiti: the
 Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers (CATH), the Federation
 of Union Workers (FOS), the Autonomous Central of Haitian
 Workers/Latin American Workers Central (CATH/CLAT), and the
 Independent General Organization of Haitian Workers.- All have
 open contact with international labor organizations. For
 example, FOS is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and with its
 affiliate, the Inter-AmeLican Regional Organization of
 Workers; CATH/CLAT with the Christian Democratic World
 Confederation of Labor; and CATH with some Canadian and
 European unions. The federations depend largely on outside
 sources for their financial support. No Haitian unions are
 known to subsist on dues paid by their members.
 During the CNG period, the Government's relationship with the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) and other international
 
 
 608
 HAITI
 organizations stagnated; numerous requests by the ILO for
 information concerning complaints were not acted upon.
 Manigat reopened the dialog with the ILO after he became
 President.
 Also under the CNG, in June 1987, CATH was dissolved by
 administrative decree because of alleged illegal political
 activities. It was reinstated 1 month later after popular
 protests. CATH has operated without government interference
 since then.
 The ILO is reviewing complaints against the Goverment of Haiti
 presented by the CATH, the CLAT, the the World Federation of
 Trade Unions (WFTU), and the ICFTU alleging violations of
 freedom of association. The cases cited span the period from
 1985 to 1987; the majority of the alleged violations occurred
 under the CNG. These include accusations of arbitrary
 arrests, illegal administrative dissolution of the CATH, and
 antiunion reprisals.
 Shortly after taking office, President Avril met with the
 leaders of three of the major labor federations and indicated
 that his Government seeks to begin a dialog with the major
 federations and to revive the tripartite negotiations
 (labor/management/government) on the drafting- of a new labor
 code. Work is currently in progress on this issue. While
 some allegations of government and employer interference
 persisted into 1988, the Avril Government has pledged itself
 to expediting adjudication of alleged abuses. Thus far, it
 has followed through on this pledge, as illustrated in the
 Comme Il Faut cigarette factory dispute cited below.
 Chapter VI of the Labor Code recognizes the right to strike,
 although it restricts the duration of certain types of
 strikes. Strikes are not uncommon, but their legality is
 usually contested by the employer.
 Following the inauguratinn of Manigat on February 7, 1988,
 there was a spate of strikes, primarily over wage and benefit
 issues, in both the private and public sectors. Labor unions
 took a more prominent, if somewhat unsuccessful, role'in the
 strike negotiations, which for the most part involved the
 inconclusive intervention of the Ministry of Social Affairs.
 In several cases, there were accusations that workers who took
 part in union activities were fired. In June, under the
 Namphy Government, there was a second series of strikes
 involving accusations of antiunion discrimination.
 In late November 1988, workers at the Comme Il Faut cigarette
 factory went on strike over wage and benefit issues. The
 company dismissed several of the workers who had organized the
 strike. An appeal by FOS to the new Ministry of Social
 Affairs resulted in a government order to reinstate the
 dismissed workers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Haitian labor unions remain weak for social, historical, and
 economic reasons. Forbidden under the Duvaliers until 1981,
 they were then allowed to operate only within strictly
 circumscribed limits. It was not until Jean-Claude Duvalier's
 departure that unions were allowed to organize freely.
 Union contracts do not yet exist; rather, informal,
 unofficial, mostly unwritten agreements, and in some cases,

 tacit acceptance, allow the presence of unions in plants.
 Although unions have become relatively more active in
 grievance negotiations, formal management recognition of
 unions as bargaining agents is not yet the norm. Even with no
 government interference, the relatively new phenomenon of
 trade unionism has not developed quickly in Haiti, where
 unemployment is estimated to affect 50 percent or more of the
 available work force, and where employers still question the
 legitimacy of unions, due, in most cases, to the imprecision
 of the labor law.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Haitian labor code prohibits forced or compulsory labor.
 There wdre no charges of forced or compulsory labor in 1988.
 d. Minimum -Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for factory employment is 12 years. Fierce
 adult competition for jobs ensures that child labor is not a
 factor in the industrial sector. In both rural and urban
 areas, children often work at odd jobs to help supplement the
 family income.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor code, revised in 1984, governs individual employment
 contracts, protects apprentices and women, and establishes
 minimum health and safety standards, particularly for
 hazardous occupations. The code sets the normal workday at 8
 hours, and the workweek at 48 hours, with 24 hours' rest on
 Sunday. The code provides for paid annual leave of at least
 15 consecutive working days. Workers may take up to 15 days'
 annual sick leave. The current daily minimum wage prescribed
 by law is $3.00 in Port-Au-Prince and $2.64 in the rest of the
 country. The minimum wage is adequate to support most workers
 in Haiti, a country where the majority of the population
 subsists on much less.
 The Government has not systematically enforced labor laws
 regarding wages and minimum safety regulations, but the
 industrial sector generally adheres to at least minimum
 standards. Many Haitians support themselves by taking such
 work as they can find, e.g., domestic service, or street
 peddling. Artisans are generally self-employed. For these
 marginally employed workers there is virtually no safety net
 between them and abject poverty. There are few educational,
 health, hygienic, public housing, or other social services
 available to the average Haitian, particularly outside of
 Port-Au-Prince.
