 INDIA
 India follows a multiparty democratic system based on the
 British parliamentary model, with an independent judiciary and
 a free press. Free elections areheld regularly. National
 parliamentary elections were held on schedule December 24,
 1984, despite the tragic assassination of Prime Minister
 Indira Gandhi only seven weeks earlier. The Constitution
 effectively guarantees basic human rights and proscribes
 discrimination based on religion, caste, sex, or place of
 birth.
 India's democratic political system has remained stable and
 effective although the 19-month emergency period in 1975-77
 introduced severe strains. The Government's record in support
 of human rights has been generally good. The independent
 judiciary and free press are important elements in maintenance
 of this record. However, social tensions and the pressure of
 rapid population growth complicate efforts to preserve
 political stability and human rights. Despite the
 Government's support for basic human rights principles,
 historical patterns of social discrimination based on caste,
 religion, and ethnic divisons have persisted. There are also
 frequent complaints from human rights groups and minorities
 that the police occasionally overstep their authority,
 particularly in rural areas.
 The Congress (I) Party headed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 won commmanding control of India's Parliament with a-landslide
 victory in the December elections for the lower house.
 Congress (I) also controls the largely ceremonial upper house,
 as well as the legislatures of 14 of the 22 states. Other
 parties control six of the remaining states, while the central
 Government exercises direct control under a constitutional
 procedure known as 'President's Rule' in Punjab and in Sikkim.
 India's economy is mixed, with banks, air and rail transport,
 public utilities, and much heavy industry in government
 hands. The agricultural sector, the manufacture of consumer
 goods, and the supply of services are largely privately held.
 The Government has relaxed regulation of private business
 activity in recent years.
 India is a secular state. Although 83 percent Hindu, India
 has a large Muslim population (about 80 million, or 11
 percent). There are also sizable populations of Sikhs,
 Christians, Jains, Buddhists, and Parsis. In some outlying
 regions, there are locally important minorities or tribal
 groups, such as the Assamese and the Nagas.
 India faces a number of problems based on centuries-old
 patterns of social discrimination. Untouchability is banned
 by the Constitution, but the caste system continues to play an
 important role in social and economic relations. Both
 national and state governments discourage social
 discrimination and provide programs designed to benefit groups
 that have historically experienced social discrimination. A
 national commission report still under consideration
 recommends strengthening these programs.
 The situation in Punjab was the major issue of human rights
 concern in India in 1984. Sikh political agitation,
 complicated by a concurrent escalation of terrorism in Punjab,
 culminated in early June when the Government sent Army units
 into the Golden Temple, the Sikhs' most holy shrine. The
 
 
 1220
 INDIA
 Government's decision to use military force to remove armed
 extremists who had fortified the Temple followed unsuccessful
 public and private negotiations. (The negotiations--conducted
 by leaders of the Akali Dal political party, who had initiated
 the political agitation in mid-1981, and representatives of
 the central Government--had focused on political issues
 involving territory, use of river waters, and Sikh religious
 demands.) Heavy fighting with the armed extremists inside the
 temple complex resulted in 574 deaths, according to government
 tigures. Nonofficial sources claim the death total was much
 higher. Following this action the level of violence in Punjab
 dropped sharply.
 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assassination on October 31 by
 two of her Sikh bodyguards triggered anti-Sikh rioting in New
 Delhi and elsewhere in northern India, resulting in the deaths
 of over 1,200 persons. Following his appointment as Prime
 Minister, Rajiv Gandhi appealed for an end to the anti-Sikh
 violence and ordered deployment of the army and other security
 forces to quell the disturbances. The Government also offered
 to pay compensation to the victims of the rioting. As a
 result of an investigation into alleged dereliction of duty by
 the police during the riots, several senior police officials
 have been dismissed, demoted, or reassigned.
 Isolated acts of sabotage and terrorism still occur in
 Punjab. The province continues under President's rule without
 an elected government. A special terrorist ordinance permits
 preventive detention as well as closed trials for suspected
 terrorists. Punjab remains closed to foreign visitors without
 special permission to enter.
 Incidents of communal violence increased and were reported in
 several parts of India in 1984. There were clashes both
 between religious communities (usually Hindu-Muslim) and
 between castes of different economic levels, particularly
 attacks on untouchables by higher-caste Hindus.
 The state and central governments increasingly relied on
 paramilitary forces and the army to maintain law and order,
 leading to a rise in accusations of police brutality and
 torture, particularly in Punjab.
 The issue of "bride burning' or "dowry deaths' (i.e. murders,
 usually by burning, of married women by their in-laws or
 husbands because their parents cannot satisfy dowry demands
 after marriage) continued to receive attention. Women's
 organizations and civil rights groups have called for more
 effective measures to protect women. In 1984 Parliament
 passed a bill to amend the Dowry Abolition Act of 1961, but
 many women's organizations allege that the changes are
 inadequate.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for tne Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government does not engage in political killing. Communal
 differences, exacerbated by the competing economic and
 political goals of various religious and ethnic groups,
 increase the occurrence of political killing. Mrs. Gandhi's
 
 
 1221
 INDIA
 assassination occurred at the hands of two members of the Sikh
 minority allegedly at the behest of an extremist Sikh
 political faction. Incidents of communal violence increased
 in 1984, resulting in an increase in reported deaths at the
 hands of various security forces.
 Political agitation became increasingly violent in Punjab in
 early 1984, with frequent acts of terrorism against both
 Hindus and Sikhs. Terrorists in Punjab assassinated several
 prominent persons, including members of Parliament and the
 editor of a large newspaper chain in Punjab. Although these
 incidents involved both Hindus and Sikhs, there were many
 cases of Sikhs being killed by more extreme coreligionists.
 The bodies of some bore signs of torture. Some bodies were
 discovered just outside the Golden Temple precincts.
 Fighting in the action initiated by the army in June in the
 Golden Temple complex was heavy. Official figures are 491
 civilians and Sikh militants and 83 army dead in the two-day
 action in the Temple. Most nonofficial sources say the figure
 is much higher. The dead included the extremist leader Sant
 Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.
 Communal riots are a longstanding problem in India. After
 Mrs. Gandhi's assassination by two Sikh bodyguards, Hindu-Sikh
 violence exploded in New Delhi and several other cities in
 northern India as Hindu mobs attacked Sikhs and their
 property. Approximately 1,200 died in the Hindu-Sikh
 violence. Violence between higher Hindu castes and so-called
 'backward classes' or *scheduled castes' or *scheduled tribes'
 also took place in widely separated parts of the country in
 1984. More than 200 people officially were reported killed
 during Hindu-Muslim communal strife in the Bhiwandi-Bombay
 region of Maharashtra in May. Hyderabad, Bangalore and
 Dharwar-Hubli in Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and
 several places in Uttar Pradesh also experienced communal
 violence. The communal death toll in 1984 easily surpassed
 the annual totals of any of the past three years.
 In the northeastern state of Tripura, a guerrilla group, the
 Tripura National Volunteers, has been responsible since
 January for incidents of arson, looting, and murder. The same
 anti-Bengali sentiment which led to the massacre of over 3,000
 people in neighboring Assam last year prompted these attacks,
 which have resulted in 46 deaths. Security forces there have
 been the targets of a number of incidents since late June.
 The Tripura state government, headed by a coalition dominated
 by the Communist Party of India, has resisted the Government's
 suggestions for deployment of troops to bolster security.
 The law-and-order situation in Assam has shown marked
 improvement during the year. This year witnessed a few bomb
 incidents and occasional extremist violence, but government
 sources say they were able to close all relief camps in West
 Bengal to which some 23,000 Assamese residents had fled.
 b. Disappearance
 The whereabouts of some of those arrested in Punjab since
 early June are not known. While the Government disclosed
 places of detention of most of the almost 400 prisoners held
 under the National Security Act, the whereabouts of most of
 those arrested or being interrogated under provisions of the
 Terrorist Affected Areas Act remain unknown,. Some press
 
 
 1222
 INDIA
 accounts indicate that a large number have been taken out of
 Punjab, many to Rajasthan, where they have been interrogated
 by army personnel. Most recent reports suggest that some have
 been returned to Punjab to stand trial.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 Torture is prohibited by law. Under well-established and
 respected procedures, confessions, to be valid, must be made
 in the presence of a magistrate. Indian case law, extending
 over many decades, excludes from admission in court any
 confessions or information extracted through use of force or
 torture. Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment
 is also proscribed by law. The Government does not condone or
 encourage torture or cruel treatment.
 Press reports often assert, however, that police torture
 occurs. Newspapers in 1984 reported police brutality against
 prisoners and suspects in a number of states. The 1984
 Amnesty International report Torture in the Eighties charged
 that police brutality and torture have long been widespread.
 Police are often accused of staging mock "encounters' with
 suspects to conceal the fact that the victims had previously
 died in police custody. According to the Amnesty report, the
 use of brutal interrogation methods frequently resulted in the
 death of suspects in police custody. The police usually cite
 .suicide,' 'disease,* 'shock," or 'injuries received prior to
 arrest,' the report said, as causes of death, but post mortem
 reports usually indicated that the victims had died of
 multiple injuries sustained while in detention. The Indian
 press widely reports these incidents, and civil liberties
 organizations often launch their own investigations, but there
 have been few official inquiries.
 There is no doubt that some police brutality is practiced in
 India, and conditions vary widely from state to state and by
 locality. However, there is no evidence that state
 governments direct or condone such violence.
 Some press reports have alleged that the military in Punjab
 used torture to extract confessions and that army personnel
 were guilty of molesting women. These allegations are
 difficult to verify since most judicial proceedings are held
 in camera and have not been completed.
 Prison conditions continue to be a matter of serious public
 concern. Facilities are crowded and pretrial detention may
 last for months or years. Press accounts reported the use of
 convicts for domestic work by jail officials in contravention
 of regulations; sexual abuse of some prisoners; and lengthy
 detention 'for their own protection' of some women who had
 reported rapes to police. Some press reports claim that
 youthful prisoners are sexually abused by older prisoners and
 are forced to perform degrading or difficult physical labor
 for the authorities and for other prisoners.
 According to a classification system dating from the colonial
 period, prison authorities grant different privileges to
 prisoners of different social status. Foreign nationals and
 political prisoners are entitled to larger or less crowded
 cells, better food, and other amenities than ordinary
 prisoners; some middle class prisoners are segregated from
 other prisoners and given more privileges. This system enjoys
 wide support in India.
 
 
 1223
 INDIA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that a person in custody be told of
 the grounds for arrest, be given the right to be represented
 by counsel, and be brought before a magistrate within 24 hours
 of arrest. At that initial appearance the accused must be
 either remanded for further investigation or released on
 bail. These provisions are generally respected.
 The Constitution permits the enactment of preventive detention
 laws against threats to the public welfare and to the national
 security. Such laws provide for limits on the length of
 detention, generally not to exceed 12 months, and for review
 ot such detention. Two preventive detention laws are
 currently in force. One, used less frequently, permits the
 arrest of suspected "economic offenders."  The other is the
 National Security Act, which the Government amended in June to
 make its provisions more stringent. Now the courts, in order
 to release a detainee held under this Act, must determine that
 all grounds for detention are invalid, rather than any one of
 them as before. Further, when a detention order expires,
 another can oe issued, extending detention by up to another 12
 months. Also, a detainee now can be held indefinitely after
 expiry or revocation of a detention order by a series of
 extensions, if authorities add new grounds for detention each
 time. The amended act also provides for detention for 24
 months in the case of Punjab and Chandigarh.
 Under the Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers
 Act by which the army conducted military operations in Punjab,
 military personnel can arrest, without warrant, any person who
 can reasonably be suspected of having committed or is about to
 commit a cognizable offense. The act further provides that
 any person arrested or property seized under it should be
 turned over to the nearest civilian police station. This
 provision does not appear to have been universally followed.
 In the aftermath of the Golden Temple fighting, the security
 forces arrested most moderate Akali leaders. By October,
 according to official figures, over 5,000 persons had been
 arrested in Punjab and Chandigarh (a Central Territory and
 capital of both Punjab and Haryana). Reliable nonofficial
 sources estimated that the number arrested was higher,
 although probably under 10,000. Most are held under
 provisions pertaining to terrorism which permit detainees to
 be held without charges while investigations proceed.
 According to official figures, of the 398 people detained in
 1984 in connection with the situation in Punjab, 355 continued
 to be held by late August 1984.
 Following the Golden Temple action but prior to the Gandhi
 assassination, the level of violence in Punjab dropped
 drastically. The military was able to return most law and
 order responsibilities to the central paramilitary and
 civilian police forces. Some troops withdrawn from Punjab in
 September and October returned following the assassination and
 consequent renewal of tensions. Individual acts of violence
 and sabotage continue to occur. Under the Terrorist Affected
 Areas Act which is in effect in Punjab, the authorities may
 arrest suspected terrorists without warrant. The precise
 number and whereabouts of persons held under this act are
 unknown.
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 78
 
 
 1224
 INDIA
 Except as permitted by the Terrorist Affected Areas Act,
 incommunicado detention is not practiced. The process of
 habeas corpus is also available so that a detainee or his
 representative can petition for the detainee's release.
 Exile is not a legally sanctioned punishment in India; there
 is no evidence that any Indian citizen was exiled during 1984.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no constitutional guarantee of public trial. The
 criminal procedure code provides for open trial, but also
 permits the judiciary to close the proceedings under
 relatively narrow circumstances. For example, the Official
 Secrets Act permits closed proceedings on the plea that
 publication of any evidence or statements would be prejudicial
 to the safety of the state. The Act requires, however, that
 the passing of sentence take place in public.
 A new "Terrorist Affected Areas Act' promulgated July 14
 empowers the Government to declare any part of the country
 "terrorist affected" and to set up special courts which can
 hold trials in camera. On July 23 the Government declared the
 whole of Punjab "terrorist affected" and set up three special
 courts for trying terrorists. At least four other special
 courts are planned. Because the trials are in camera, there
 has been no coverage in the public media. Although they are
 in process, there is no public indication that any cases have
 been completed. Although certain laws, such as the Official
 Secrets Act, provide for in camera trials, there are
 provisions that judgments must be delivered in open court.
 The Terrorist Act effectively amends the previous Evidence Act
 to put the onus of proof of innocence on the accused. It
 applies to areas where there has been extensive disturbance of
 public peace for more than one month, and where violence was
 used against peacekeeping forces.
 Except for these closed-trial procedures and the resultant
 changes in the law, as a general matter Indian legal
 procedures effectively assure fair trial. Defendants have the
 right to choose counsel, and effective appeal channels are
 available at each stage of the judicial process. Cases heard
 in the special courts set up in Punjab also may be appealed
 directly to the Supreme Court.
 The Indian bar is independent of government at all levels.
 Judges of the state high courts and the-Supreme Court are
 selected by the Law Ministry, following consultations with the
 Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The central Government
 since 1983 has reversed previous practice and now appoints
 Chief Justices in states other than their states of
 residence. Although there was some apprehension among high
 court justices that the new practice could be used to remove
 judges who had given verdicts unfavorable to the Government,
 there has been no indication of any such abuse.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Indian law requires warrants for searches and seizures but
 also permits the police in a criminal investigation to
 institute searches without warrant if otherwise there would be
 undue delay. The officer must state in writing the grounds
 
 
 1225
 INDIA
 for making the search without a warrant and specify the object
 of the search. There is no indication that this provision has
 been abused.
 The authorities continued to invoke special powers during 1984
 in the 'disturbed areas' of Assam and Punjab. Under the
 provisions of law governing disturbed areas, civilian
 authorities down to the rank of subinspector of police, and
 military authorities down to noncommissioned officer, are
 given exceptional authority, including to search and arrest
 without warrant and to shoot to kill in some circumstances.
 The press has reported allegations of the tapping of
 telephones and interception of personal mail. Such
 surveillance is authorized by law "on the occurrence of any
 puolic emergency or in the interest of the public safety or
 tranquility.' These terms are not specifically defined and
 tnus lend tnemselves to a broad interpretation. A retired
 senior postal executive has written in the press that the
 Government runs "Post Research Centers' where mail from
 selected foreign countries is illegally censored. Censorship
 of mails under certain circumstances, such as public
 emergency, is legal. Aside from these instances, the
 Government does not routinely interfere in the private lives
 of Indian citizens.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and, by
 extension, of the press. However, material which, in the view
 of government authorities, may incite religious or communal
 hatred is proscribed from print. In October the Punjab state
 government registered a case against an Indian citizen
 representing a foreign news agency under provisions concerning
 provoking riot and disaffection among communal groups. He had
 reported from Amritsar that some persons had been tied up and
 shot during an army operation there. The story also appeared
 in the Indian press. There is no indication that any other
 journalist was similarly charged.
 Occasionally, some offending issues of publications, foreign
 as well as Indian, have been seized or banned. With the
 exception of maps of disputed borders, there is no
 prepublication censorship of domestic or foreign books or of
 artistic works.
 A film censorship ooard passes on all films before they are
 licensed for distribution. The board excises material deemed
 overly violent or offensive to public morals or to religious
 and communal sentiment. Radio and television are government
 monopolies, and opposition parties often accuse both of
 favoring the ruling party.
 Opposition viewpoints enjoy wide dissemination in print media,
 and many political parties control their own newspapers or
 journals. The press in general is lively and free, and there
 are no restrictions on it concerning criticism of the
 Government. Press censorship was imposed in Punjab
 immediately following the army action in June. Prior to the
 Gandhi assassination, censorship regulations were still
 technically in force, but not actively applied. Following
 Mrs. Gandhi's death, the Government embargoed material
 
 
 1226
 INDIA
 reporting anti-Sikh communal rioting. There is a tradition of
 investigative reporting, and the press has given major
 coverage to individual instances of questionable political
 maneuvering, mistreatment of women, 'undertrials' (i.e.,
 persons who have yet to be sentenced), corruption by public
 officials, and prison conditions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 As a hallmark of India's independence struggle, Indians
 consider the right of peaceful assembly and association an
 extension of freedom of speech. Groups and parties of all
 persuasions may assemble freely, and no hindrance is imposed
 on the size of gatherings. For reasons of crowd control,
 however, permits and advance notification to police are
 required in some instances.
 Trade unions may organize, negotiate, and strike with relative
 freedom. The right to form associations and unions is
 guaranteed in the Constitution. The Industrial Disputes Act
 of 1943 (as amended) provides for governmental conciliation of
 disputes and for prohibition of strikes and employer lockouts
 while such a dispute is under adjudication. The 1981 National
 Security Act permits a ban on assemblies which threaten the
 .public order' and on rare occasions can be used against
 strikes. More specifically, the Essential Services
 Maintenance Act (ESMA) of 1981 permits government intervention
 to ban strikes and to immediately institute conciliation in
 essential industries. This power is used only 'in exceptional
 circumstances' and has been invoked on 10 occasions since its
 institution, according to the Home Minister's statement in
 Parliament in August 1984. Five of these ESMA applications
 involved foreign policy considerations (e.g., 1982 Asian
 Games, 1983 NAM and Commonwealth meetings) and one was
 directed at the more general agitation in Assam which peaked
 in 1982-83. The ESMA was applied against a threatened strike
 in the coal industry in July 1984, but was not applied in the
 long and costly but apolitical dock strike of 1984.
 There is heavy emphasis on political activity by unions
 representing the relatively few workers in the economy's
 modern sector. Although political parties exercise strong
 influence on their trade union wings, the unions are
 independent. Four-fifths of the labor force is in the rural
 sector, where unemployment and underemployment are endemic,
 and where organization into effective unions is difficult.
 Employer associations and trade unions, as well as government
 labor officials and mediators, play a prominent role in
 developing industrial relations norms in both the private and
 public sectors.
 As many as 1 million Indian citizens are working abroad.
 Charges that unscrupulous employment agencies exploited these
 out-migrant workers led the Government to establish a
 Directorate in the Ministry of Labor in 1984 to monitor and
 regulate employment of these workers.
 Unions and professional bodies are free to maintain contact
 with international bodies. The Indian National Trade Union
 Congress and the Hind Mazdoor Sabha are affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The
 All-India Trade Union Congress is affiliated with the
 Soviet-supported World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and
 the Center of Indian Trade Unions attends WFTU meetings as an
 
 
 1227
 INDIA
 observer. Indian trade unions have complained several times
 in recent years to the International Labor Organization's
 Committee on Freedom of Association, charging violations in
 India of ILO conventions and recommendations. The two Marxist
 trade unions usually have presented these complaints.
 According to ILO documents, the Government has cooperated in
 the Committee's investigations.
 In its 1984 report, the ILO's Committee of Experts reviewed
 the Indian Government's efforts to abolish the now-outlawed
 system of bonded labor. The committee urged the Government to
 take the necessary steps to pursue that goal more effectively.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religious groups are allowed to worship freely and
 government policy favors no one religious community. However,
 communal tensions and violence based on religious differences
 occur with increasing frequency. Although foreign Christian
 missions are generally not allowed to replace retiring foreign
 missionaries with other foreigners, there is no legal bar
 against proselytizing by Indian Christians.
 During the cycle of political agitation and violence in
 Punjab, and particularly after the June military action,
 Sikhs, including many who had no political affiliationi have
 charged the central Government with anti-Sikh discrimination.
 The Government and many non-Sikhs say that the Government was
 forced to take strong action to halt the violence and to
 remove terrorists and weapons from places of worship. In the
 first days following Mrs. Gandhi's assassination, anti-Sikh
 mobs, particularly in New Delhi, raged out of control. To
 quell the violence the Government deployed the military,
 issuing shoot-to-kill orders against rioters. After bringing
 the situation under control, the Government instituted a
 program of compensation for victims of the violence. Despite
 conciliatory statements by the new Prime Minister urging
 communal peace, some Sikhs doubt the Government's sincerity.
 Some separatists have sought asylum abroad, claiming
 persecution because of their religion or political beliefs.
 Although Sikhs, particularly young males, are usually
 subjected to more careful security precautions than are others
 in certain situations (e.g., airport security), Sikhs
 generally are treated equally under the law. The President is
 a Sikh.
 In the first weeks after the June Army action, there were
 several press reports of Sikh troops (enlisted men and some
 noncommissioned officers) having deserted their units to go to
 Punjab. It is believed that rumors that their most sacred
 shrine had been destroyed in the fighting impelled these
 soldiers to desert. In at least one case, that of a Sikh
 Training Center for recruits in Bihar, the deserting troops
 killed their commanding officer. In several cases, newspapers
 gave accounts of soldiers firing at random at passersby on the
 road as they went towards Punjab. The number of deserting
 troops is unknown, but many estimate it to be 1,500 or more.
 Regular army units have apparently captured or killed most of
 them but a few remain at large. The precise whereabouts of
 those captured is unknown.
 
 
 1228
 INDIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 India has admitted millions of refugees since independence in
 1947. The vast majority of those who wanted to remain has
 been granted citizenship and integrated into the society.
 In Assam, migration of Hindus and Muslims from what is now
 Bangladesh led to violence in early 1983. As a result of the
 disturbances, a large number of Bengali-speaking people from
 Assam moved into West Bengal. However, with the improvement
 of the law-and-order situation in Assam, the 23,000 people
 who, according to West Bengal authorities, had been in relief
 camps there have now returned to Assam.
 A large number of Tamils, as many as 51,000 by June 1984
 according to official figures, have come from Sri Lanka since
 July 1982. Most arrived since the current ethnic disturbances
 in Sri Lanka began in mid-1983 and have remained in the state
 of Tamil Nadu. According to the Indian press, the Indian
 Government has provided shelter and training to certain Sri
 Lankan Tamil terrorist groups. The Government has denied
 tnese reports.
 Several thousand Afghans have entered India since the Soviet
 invasion in 1979. Many have since departed to other
 countries. Although India does not as a rule formally
 recognize Afghans as refugees, there is no evidence of
 forcible repatriation. The U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees operates an office in India under the umbrella of the
 U.N. Development Program's Resident Representative.
 There is full freedom of movement within India for all
 citizens with the caveat that travelers to certain sensitive
 border areas must obtain special travel permits. Foreign
 travel and emigration are without political restrictions, and
 in 1977 the rules for obtaining a passport and necessary
 foreign exchange were liberalized and simplified. More than 3
 million Indian citizens now live abroad. There are no special
 restrictions of movement applied to women or other groups. In
 mid-1984 the Government tightened visa requirements for
 foreigners coming to India so that now virtually every
 non-Indian must have an entry visa.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 India is a functioning multiparty democracy. The Constitution
 grants universal adult suffrage to all citizens over 21.
 Regular elections are held at every level. By law, a
 parliament can be constituted for no more than five years.
 An Election Commissioner, whose responsibilities are defined
 in the Constitution and who is responsible only to the
 President, administers elections. Although this arrangement
 ordinarily makes supervision of the electoral machinery
 impartial, there were allegations in 1983 that the
 Commissioner had followed the central Government's desires in
 holding elections in Assam even though the question of who
 constituted 'legal voters' in that state had not been
 settled. This issue remains unresolved, and Assam did not
 join the rest of the country at the polls in 1984.
 
 
 1229
 INDIA
 The Constitution empowers the President to declare a state of
 emergency or *President's Rule' on the advice of the Prime
 Minister in the event of war, external aggression, or internal
 disruption; collapse of the constitutional machinery in any
 state; or the financial breakdown of the federal or any state
 government. President's Rule has been in effect in Punjab
 since October 1983 and in Sikkim since May 1984. In August
 1984, Parliament amended the Constitution to allow for
 President's Rule to be extended for an additional year beyond
 the previous limit of one year. Following amendment of the
 Constitution, Parliament immediately authorized President's
 Rule to be extended for a second year in Punjab.
 A multitude of state and national parties are in active
 opposition to the Congress (I) Party, which holds power at the
 national level and in 14 of India's 22 states. The parties
 represent every shade of the ideological spectrum and freely
 contest elections at all levels. No group, whether social,
 religious, or linguistic, is denied political participation or
 suffrage.
 There are no legal barriers to female candidates, although
 their numbers have remained small since independence. The
 late Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, was a woman. There are,
 after the December 1984 elections, 42 women in the lower house
 of Parliament, and 22 in the upper house (of authorized
 memberships of 507 and 244 respectively).
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international investigations of the human rights situation
 in India are known to have been made since 1978. India is a
 member of U.N. bodies such as the Human Rights Commission.
 There are several independent Indian human rights
 organizations, including the People's Union for Civil
 Liberties and the People's Union for Democratic Rights. These
 organizations periodically send study teams to report on
 specific situations. In November, these two organizations
 published a detailed report on their joint inquiry into the
 anti-Sikh violence which followed the Gandhi assassination.
 The report accused, often by name, Congress (I) politicians
 and party activists of instigating and directing the violence
 and of interfering with the work of the police.
 Several women's groups monitor the status of women and were
 active in 1984 in agitating against "dowry deaths' and for
 stengthening legislation against dowries. They have also
 protested the exploitation of women in films, advertisements,
 and newspaper photographs. Some women's groups have also
 sought to improve the legal status of women under various
 statutes which govern the separate religious communities and
 provide for different treatment of women, according to their
 religion, in such areas as divorce, custody of children, and
 ownership of property.
 The Parliament and press continue to be the most significant
 channels for reporting human rights violations. In 1984 the
 press focused attention on violence against women, including
 "dowry deaths", rape and other physical violence; conditions
 in jails; and exploitation of low-caste, harijan
 (untouchable), or tribal people in rural areas.

 In its 1984 report, Amnesty International expressed its
 continuing concern about the use of preventive detention
 legislation to detain political opponents of the Government
 and about widespread reports that people arrested had been
 tortured and ill-treated by the police. It noted that it
 continued to receive occasional reports of deaths in custody
 and of extrajudicial killings in staged 'encounters' by the
 police, and that judicial executions, which had been
 temporarily suspended, had been resumed. Freedom House calls
 India 'free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Indian Constitution calls on the Government to endeavor to
 minimize inequalities in income, facilities, and opportunities
 for all citizens. Indian economic policies have been defined
 in a series of five-year plans since 1950, which have sought
 to establish a framework for realization of these objectives.
 In India's mixed economy, the private sector produces 80
 percent of the gross national product (GNP) and accounts for
 93 percent of employment.
 India's population is 746,388,000 with an estimated growth
 rate of 2.3 percent. Life expectancy at birth is 55 years and
 the infant mortality rate is 116 per 1,000 live births. The
 per capita GNP in 1982 was $257. Adult literacy is 36
 percent. Only 33 percent of the population have access to
 safe drinking water. The ratio of calorie supply relative to
 nutritional requirements is 89 percent.
 In both health services and education, there are great
 differences between rural and urban areas. The rural crude
 death rate exceeds the urban rate by 42 percent, and the rural
 infant mortality rate exceeds the urban by 43 percent. The
 difficulty in providing adequate health, nutritional, and
 family planning services in the countryside continues as a
 serious constraint to reducing both mortality and fertility
 rates among the rural poor.
 There has been a steady decline over many decades in the ratio
 of women to men. Women die in larger numbers than men, and
 the female infant mortality rate is higher. Both phenomena
 may reflect the greater economic value associated with males,
 especially in northern India, and consequent nutritional and
 health-care neglect of females in poorer homes.
 Although women are guaranteed equal rights and protection
 under the law in India, in practice longstanding cultural
 biases cause them to have fewer educational and career
 opportunities. In 1984, attention has focused on 'dowry
 deaths," the death under suspicious circumstances of women
 whose parents have been unable to pay a supplementary dowry
 demanded by the nusband's family after marriage. In New
 Delhi, which is perhaps the worst affected area, 690 women
 reportedly died of burns under suspicious circumstances in
 1984.   Most cases drew scant attention; according to a study
 tnat one women's organization made on bride-burning in Delhi,
 more than two thirds of the instances are investigated as
 accidents rather than murder. Since 1979, of the 110 cases in
 New Delhi listed under 'abetment to suicide" and 94 under
 "murder", only 12 resulted in conviction. Most reported cases
 of 'dowry deathsw have been in northern India, and most are in
 lower middle class urban families. There has been increasing
 agitation for legal protection, and Parliament has taken up
 the issue, so far without resolution.

 Education and literacy have both expanded rapidly since
 independence. Primary school enrollment, which was 43 percent
 in the 1950-51 school year, rose to 67 percent in 1979-80.
 School and college enrollments are noticeably higher for males
 (78 percent) than for females (55 percent), and are lower for
 children from disadvantaged groups such as scheduled castes
 and tribes. Certain castes and tribes are 'scheduled' for the
 purpose of assigning benefits of governmental action to
 relieve disadvantages resulting from social factors.
 Scheduled castes (including the so-called untouchables or
 harijans) make up 15 percent of the population. The tribal
 people are an estimated 7 percent. The Government has met
 only modest success in its efforts to improve the positions of
 these groups and some programs have had the unintentional
 effect of mobilizing the upper castes against efforts to
 benefit the disadvantaged. These programs include a quota
 system in educational enrollments, preferences for housing and
 government jobs, and reserved seats in Parliament for members
 of the scheduled groups.
 Press reports of violence against scheduled castes or
 scheduled tribes have decreased from previous years. The
 basis of such violence is often economic, involving perceived
 threats to the economic position of higher castes by lower
 economic groups demanding legal minimum wages or land
 tenancy. The Government provides some legal and physical
 protection to the victimized groups, and in the last two years
 the judiciary has taken an increasingly hard line against
 perpetrators of mass killings of harijans by handing down
 death sentences.
 The report of the Backward Classes Commission instituted in
 1979 was released in mid-1982 and is still under consideration
 at both state and national levels. The report covers not only
 the scheduled castes and tribes, but a number of other
 communities considered *oackward.1 A number of castes are
 trying to be included on the growing list of 'backward'
 communities in the hope of obtaining special government
 compensation and consideration for jobs. The Commission's
 main recommendations involve more than doubling the number of
 reserved seats in education and government employment from the
 22.5 percent provided under the Constitution to 49.5 percent.
 Bonded labor is proscribed by law but nevertheless persists.
 Estimates of the number of affected laborers vary between
 500,000 and 2.5 million, depending partly on the definition
 used. There has been considerable parliamentary and press
 debate over this practice, widely criticized in India as an
 unfortunate legacy of feudalism and poverty. Most vulnerable
 are landless, unemployed rural workers hired by small
 enterprises, particularly in the construction industry. The
 workers are placed in debt andkept there indefinitely by
 revolving loans from employers. In recent years the Supreme
 Court has taken a particularly active role in pressing
 responsible state and central government agencies to enforce
 protections against bonded servitude.
