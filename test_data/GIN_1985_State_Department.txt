 GUINEA
 Since coming to power in a bloodless cQup on April 3, 1984,
 the ruling Military Committee for National Redress (CMRN),
 headed by President Lansana Conte, has sought to portray
 itself as the antithesis of the previous regime led by Ahmed
 Sekou Toure. Its positive approach on human rights practices
 has in fact provided the CMRN with much of its legitimacy so
 far. While this approach is represented more in the
 relaxation of authoritarian controls than in the establishment
 of functioning due process or political participation, the
 Government's actions and attitudes in 1985 created an
 atmosphere in which human rights considerations were
 commanding greater attention. President Conte and his CMRN
 associates weathered a major coup attempt on July 4, 1985, by
 ex-prime minister Colonel Diarra Traore and his supporters who
 claimed the Government had failed to meet the serious economic
 crisis.
 The Government has identified economic recovery as its number
 one priority and has indicated that national-level political
 development must wait. Meanwhile, the Government has created
 special tribunals--one military and the other civilian--to try
 those persons who have been charged with crimes against the
 internal and external security of the State. No trials have
 yet been announced under these courts, and rumors of secret
 executions of some members of the Sekou Toure regime and of
 the 1985 coup plotters continue to circulate despite
 government denials. The Government has yet to announce any
 plans to allow for the formation of political parties or an
 eventual transfer of power to civilians.
 The economic situation, which the CMRN inherited and is trying
 to improve, is bleak. Despite abundant natural wealth,
 Guinea, after 26 years of centralized and corrupt rule,
 continues to be an extreme example of poverty and
 underdevelopment. Its agriculture, mostly at the subsistence
 level, provides a livelihood for over 80 percent of the
 population. The modern sector consists of a few mining
 operations, which produce nearly all of Guinea's foreign
 exchange, and various uneconomic state-owned enterprises, most
 of which are now slated for immediate privatization. With
 assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World
 Bank, and other donors, Guinea has embarked upon a plan to
 restructure the entire economy, including inducements to
 foreign investment and incentives for food production.
 Government respect for human rights in 1985 continued to show
 improvement over the dismal record of the past quarter
 century. During Independence Day ceremonies on October 2,
 President Conte was given an award for justice and liberty
 from the International Committee for Justice and Liberty. In
 accepting the award, Conte pledged further improvement.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 According to the Government, 19 people were killed and 220
 wounded on the night of July 4, 1985, during the exchange of
 fire between rebellious elements loyal to the former prime
 minister and forces remaining faithful to President Lansana
 Conte. The casualties reportedly included innocent
 
 
 137
 GUINEA
 bystanders. Despite considerable local sentiment in favor of
 summarily executing Traore and his followers, the Government
 asserts that no such executions have taken place. In his July
 7 speech, President Conte threatened summary justice for
 Traore and the others, but he also appealed to world opinion
 to intercede on the plotters' behalf "before it is too late."
 His appeal was answered immediately with interventions by
 several Western and African governments as well as by
 international human rights organizations and private
 observers, requesting the Government to ensure due process of
 law for those accused of coup plotting. On August 13, the
 Government announced the formation of two courts of
 justice--one military and the other civilian--charged with
 dispensing justice respectively to soldiers and civilians
 accused of crimes against the security of the state. However,
 there has been no indication that these courts have carried
 out their mandates.
 b. Disappearance
 While the state security apparatus of the Ahmed Sekou Toure
 regime has been largely dismantled, some of its practices
 linger on. As a result, many people who are arrested seem to
 disappear, since information about their arrest is not usually
 released. These practices, combined with poor communication
 facilities, leave relatives of detainees uninformed when
 arrests take place, although eventually there is usually a
 delayed official acknowledgment of arrest or detention.
 Politically motivated abductions and disappearances no longer
 take place.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Since coming to power in April 1984, the Government has
 repeatedly condemned the cruel and inhumane practices of the
 Toure government. However, most police and Gendarmerie
 officers are poorly educated, trained, equipped, paid, and
 supervised, and rough handling of prisoners occurs. The
 prisons are squalid and unsanitary.
 For the common criminal suspect, due to shortcomings of law
 enforcement forces, there may be a considerable incidence of
 minor abuse. Newspaper accounts and editorials have
 complained of police arrogance and injustice, and the
 Government continues to express concern over enforcement of
 police codes of conduct. Though the same types of abuses
 occurred during the previous regime, the motivation was more
 commonly political, and the consequences more severe for
 detainees. The fact that most Guineans no longer fear arrest
 for expressing political views denotes substantial improvement.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 From April 1984 to the end of 1985, former leaders of the
 Sekou Toure government, some Toure family members, and a few
 military officers have been detained without any known
 judicial process. At least until the July coup attempt, they
 were reportedly confined in the outlying city of Kindia and
 provided a satisfactory diet, medications when necessary, and
 occasional family visits. In May, 30 of these detainees were
 released along with 41 military officers who had been
 arrested in connection with a coup plot alleged to have been
 planned in late 1984. However, some of these persons were
 
 
 138
 GUINEA
 rearrested in the aftermath of the July 4, 1985, coup
 attempt. Ten of those rearrested were set free without public
 notice in September.
 Since July 1985, the whereabouts and prisons conditions of the
 Toure regime prisoners and of the 1985 coup suspects are not
 known. There is still no indication of the number and/or
 identities of those arrested for their alleged part in the
 coup attempt of July 4. The whole process of arrest,
 interrogation, and release, or further detention of the coup
 suspects has become shrouded in secrecy. There have been
 reports that some of these arrests were arbitrary. Most of
 those detained, however, were released between July 5 and 20,
 1985.
 Compulsory labor is prohibited and not practiced in Guinea.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Guinea is still in the early stage of establishing an
 independent judicial system, which on paper includes
 internationally accepted safeguards for the accused and
 guarantees of due process. While judges are no longer
 appointed on the basis of ideology, they are poorly paid and
 inexperienced. With the establishment on August 13 of special
 tribunals to hear cases of crimes against state security, the
 public has been given notice that those accused of such crimes
 will be accorded due process. Fair trials have long been
 promised for the earlier group of political prisoners (i.e.
 those detained for their alleged excesses as officials of the
 Sekou Toure regime). Their cases remain under investigation
 and are proceeding slowly, with no publicity so far.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The current regime stresses the inviolability of the home, but
 there are, as yet, no specific legal or constitutional
 safeguards. There are no safeguards for privacy, and the mail
 and telephones of foreigners are likely to be monitored. The
 CMRN seem, however, less willing to abuse its police powers
 than its predecessor. In the fall, the Government publicly
 reprimanded law enforcement officials who were overzealous in
 enforcing a nighttime curfew against loiterers by arbitrary
 arrests and abusive acts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil'Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Despite the changed climate, after 26 years of totalitarian
 rule, many Guineans remain hesitant to speak their minds on
 sensitive issues. A tradition of self-censorship limits
 personal criticism of government leaders, but constructive
 criticism of the implementation of government policies is
 accepted without fear of retribution. The Government's
 attitude toward freedom of the press is still unclear. The
 only newspaper available in Guinea, Horbya, is
 government-owned and published three times weekly. It
 contains virtually no criticism of the CMRN and little hard
 news on domestic affairs. An irregularly issued news
 magazine, Fonike, began to be published by the Government in
 November with in-depth articles on domestic issues, in which
 the opinions expressed did not necessarily follow official
 
 
 GUINEA
 statements. The Government operates radio and television
 stations which, although similarly uncritical of the CMRN,
 carry more substantial news concerning Guinean national
 events. In contrast to the situation under the previous
 regime, foreign books and magazines are now available, albeit
 in limited supply.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government permits all public meetings except those of a
 political nature. The most common form of voluntary
 arsociation is trade-related. An example is the loosely
 organized Conakry Merchants Association, a group which met and
 debated economic policy with President Conte in July. By
 presidential decree, Conte granted permission to form the
 government-sponsored Chamber of Commerce. For the first time
 since 1958, service organizations, such as the Rotary, are
 also permitted to hold meetings.
 In January, the National Confederation of Guinean Labor (CNTG)
 held nationwide elections which indicates movement toward a
 genuinely autonomous labor organization. Each of the nation's
 17 trade unions elected its own officers, who in turn elected
 a CNTG executive board. These elections were reportedly free
 and fair, as suggested by the considerable turnover in union
 leadership. Membership in trade unions is now voluntary.
 The CNTG, continually short of money, has sought assistance
 from all fraternal trade union movements. The CNTG maintains
 relations with recognized regional and international bodies
 and regularly sends representatives to their meetings.
 Guinea's delegates to the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) indicated Guinea's willingness to comply with
 international,,labor conventions but noted that progress on the
 labor scene in Guinea would hinge upon the outcome of the
 nation's economic recovery and development programs.
 A draft of the new labor code guarantees the right to strike,
 but the code had not'yet been promulgated in 1985.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Most ofthe population is Muslim, but some are Christians or
 animists  Guinea has no official religion but often
 identifies, itself with the Islamic world and is a member of
 the Islamic Conference. All religions have the right to
 establish places of worship and maintain links with
 coreligionists in other countries. The Government, which
 includes a Ministry of Religious Affairs, has declared both
 Muslim and Christian holy days as public holidays. It also
 subsidized Muslim and Christian pilgrimages in 1985.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Occasionally there is petty harassment by police at roadside
 checkpoints in an effort to augment salaries. All citizens
 and foreign residents are required to carry identity cards.
 In early 1985, the Government reinstituted the previous
 government's practice of requiring all foreigners to have a
 laissez passer for travel into the interior. Although this
 regulation is still in effect, it is not strictly enforced.
 
 
 140
 GUINEA
 Most of the estimated 1.5 million Guineans who fled overseas
 during the Sekou Toure era have not yet returned, although
 .free to do so. They appear to be awaiting the results of the
 economic reform program. Foreign travel involves considerable
 red tape for the prospective traveler; however, there are no
 unusual restrictions. Many Guineans with relatives abroad are
 now free to travel to neighboring countries. Foreigners are
 subject to passport/visa controls for entry into nor for exit
 from the country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since independence, Guinea has had no democratic tradition,
 and there has been no provision for political parties or
 formal opposition to the regime in power.| After wholesale
 cabinet changes and recent adjustments mae in the.wake of the
 July 4 coup attempt, Guinea's legislative and executive powers
 rest in the 17-member Military Committee for National Redress
 (CMRN), led by President Conte. CMRN members also fill
 ministerial portfolios. The cabinet, however, was reshuffled
 on December 22, 1985, with the result that 19 of the 31
 ministers are civilians. The CMRN has also appointed
 officials at the local and intermediate levels of government.
 Recognizing the potential in the country for ethnic cleavages,
 the CMRN has attempted to strike a reasonable balance among
 the major groupings as they are represented in the
 Government. The CMRN provides some limited avenues of dissent
 through public meetings in Conakry and by sending its members
 up country to hold town meetings in the various provincial
 capitals.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The CMRN has gone out of its way to stress its new approach on
 human rights, which included, in 1984, a much publicized
 Amnesty International visit to Guinea. In January 1985,
 Guinea received an official visitor from the Frankfurt-based
 International League of Human Rights, who subsequently was
 quoted as describing the new Government as open-minded and
 respectful of human rights. Amnesty International, in its
 1985 report, details the positive changes that took place in
 1984. Freedom House rates Guinea as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Guinea's population is approximately 5.6 million (1985) and
 continues to grow at a rate of at least 2.4 percent per year
 while food crop production is expanding at a rate of only 1.7
 percent annually. Its per capita gross national product
 reached $300 in 1983. About 80 percent of the labor force is
 employed in subsistence agriculture. Traders, artisans,
 government and quasi-government (state enterprises and joint
 ventures) employees make up the urban labor force. A
 government-subsidized rationing system has been abolished and
 commodities, particularly rice and fuel, are being sold at
 prices approaching free market levels.
 Since it assumed power in April 1984, the CMRN has committed
 itself to a major economic liberalization program. The
 Government, with the technical assistance of the United
 Nations, has adopted an Interim National Development Plan for
 
 
 141
 GUINEA
 the period 1985-87 to direct limited resources to priority
 projects which support, among other things, small farmer
 agriculture. It has also negotiated with the World Bank and
 the IMF for financial assistance to introduce major fiscal and
 monetary reforms which will encourage foreign investment and
 private enterprise. In 1985, President Conte closed the six
 nationalized banks and announced the establishment of three
 private banks. A new foreign exchange system more accurately
 reflecting the value of the local currency was established.
 In 1985, the life expectancy at birth was 37.3 years and the
 infant mortality rate 158 per 1,000 live births. The calorie
 supply is estimated at 80 percent of requirements. According
 to 1980 statistics, only 17 percent of the population has
 access to safe water (69 percent of the urban and only 2
 percent of the rural population). The literacy rate is about
 20 percent in French. Primary school enrollment of eligible
 children was 30 percent in 1980 (females 20 percent, males 38
 percent). In May, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs
 created a nonprofit private family planning organization,
 l'Association Guineenne Pour Le Bien-Etre Familiale, to
 promote family planning and maternal and child health care.
 There is no minimum age for employment. By accepted practice,
 children under the age of 17 are not usually employed outside
 the family. An exception is in the area of subsistence
 agriculture where farming is traditionally a family affair.
 There is no formal labor code, but one is being drafted.
 Actual working conditions in Guinea are more a function of the
 country's level of economic development than of enforcement or
 nonenforcement of labor statutes.
 women in Guinea enjoy a special status which has grown out of
 the political role they played in the preindependence period.
 The Sekou Toure regime stressed the role of women in the
 economy and society and in Guinea's political life, a legacy
 which continues under the current Government. The Ministry of
 Labor and Social Welfare is headed by a woman doctor and
 contains an active office of women's affairs. The majority of
 students enrolled in the national college of medicine are
 women. Market women wield substantial influence, as was
 demonstrated by the catalytic role they played in changing the
 economic policies of the Toure regime.
