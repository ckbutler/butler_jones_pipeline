 WiSTERN SAHARA
 The sovereignty of the Western Sahara remains the subject of
 diplomatic and military dispute. Morocco assumed
 administration of the northern three provinces of the Western
 Sahara after the withdrawal of Spanish forces in 1975, and of.
 the southernmost province of Oued ed Dahab in 19-79 when
 Mauritania renounced its claim to the area. Since 1973-the
 Polisario, an organization which Algeria has supported and
 which seeks independence for the Western Sahara, has challenged
 first Spain's and later Morocco-'s claim to the territory.
 Moroccan and Polisario forces have fought intermittently since
 1975. In August 1991, several military actions occurred in the
 weeks leading up to the U.N.-monitored cease-fire that began on
 September 6.
 At the request of the- United Nations Aneral Assembly, the
 International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion in
 1975 that the people of the Western Sahara were entitled to
 self-determination and that Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania were
 not entitled to exercise sovereignty over the territory. The
 Organization of African Unity (OAU) attempted without success-
 to mediate a solution. In 1981 Morocco agreed to hold a
 referendum to determine the population's wishes regarding-
 independence or integration with Morocc. Attempts to resolve
 the question of sovereignty through mediation or referendum
 collapsed in 19-84 when the Saharan-Arab Democratic Republic
 (SADR-, the-civilian arm of the Polisario, was- seated at the
 OAU summit and Morocco withdrew from the OAU in protest. In
 1986 Morocco agreed to revive efforts to reach a solution and
 asked the United Nations to administer a referendum; the same
 year U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar began efforts to
 arrange it. In November and December 1987, a U.N. technical
 team visited the territory to explore the practical
 arrangements for a referendum. On August 30, 198a, Morocco and
 the SADR accepted in principle the Secretary General'sjroposal
 for a referendum under U.N. and OAU auspices, and the Secretary
 General named a special representative to work out the details.
 In April the Secretary General presented a plan for a
 referendum in the Western Sahara in which the Sahrawis would
 decide between integration with Morocco and independence.
 Under the plan, approved by the Security Council in May, a
 cease-fire was to be established under the supervision of a
 U.N. Monitoring Force (MINURSO), to- be followed within 20 weeks
 by a referendum vote. The 1974 Spanish census of the region
 was to serve as the basis for the voting list. Morocco
 challenged the accuracy and completeness of the list and
 presented to the U.N. a supplemental list containing in excess
 of 120,000 names. On September &, the cease-fire went into
 effect, and the initial MINURSO forces were deployed. The
 weeks leading up to the cease-fire saw the first significant
 military action between Moroccan and Polisario forces since
 1989 as Morocco moved to drive remaining Polisario forces into
 Algeria and Mauritania. The referendum was originally
 scheduled to take place in late January 1992, but in December
 the Secretary General announced that the resolution Qf the
 voter identification issue would delay the referendum for at
 least several months. Before he left office in late December,
 the Secretary General presented to the U.N. Security Council a
 proposal for resolving the contentious voter identification
 issue.
 Since 1977 the northern provinces of Laayoune, Smara and
 Boujdour have participated in the'Moroccan elections. The

 WESTERN SAHARA
 southernmost province of Oued ed Dahab also participated in the
 1983 and 1984 Moroccan elections. Sahrawis fill all 10 of the
 parliamentary seats allotted to the Western Sahara, and 3 of
 the 4 governors of the region, who are appointed by the King of
 Morocco, are Sahrawis. In December 1989, Moroccan voters
 approved (by a majority of 99 percent with a reported
 100-percent participation, according to the Government) a
 2-year extension of the term of the current Parliament to allow
 time for holding a referendum in the Western Sahara. This
 delay was based on a Moroccan assumption that the referendum
 would favor integration with Morocco, which in turn would
 enable Western Saharans to participate in the next
 parliamentary elections, scheduled to be held by September 1992.
 The civilian population in the approximately 85 percent of the
 Western Sahara under Moroccan control is subject to Moroccan
 law. There are reports that Sahrawis often have more
 difficulty obtaining passports, that their political views are
 more closely monitored than those of residents of Morocco
 proper, and that police and paramilitary authorities react
 especially harshly against those suspected of supporting the
 Polisario. In addition, Sahrawi prisoners released in June
 alleged that they had been physically tortured by Moroccan
 security forces. The Moroccan Government denies such charges
 and counters with allegations of Polisario human rights
 abuses. Given the difficulty of access, we are unable to
 confirm these reports. Since there has been no opportunity to
 evaluate the human rights practices of the Polisario in areas
 outside of the Moroccan Berm, the earthwork defense line that
 defines the eastern and southern borders of the Moroccan-
 occupied area, these allegations cannot be confirmed or refuted.
 In June King Hassan II of Morocco granted a general amnesty to
 an unspecified number of Sabrawi prisoners arrested during
 military operations or because of their alleged past
 cooperation with Polisario. The freed prisoners, who are
 estimated to number about 300, reportedly included entire
 families and Sabrawis who had "disappeared" in the mid-1970's.
 Despite the releases, the Polisario continued to allege that
 Morocco was holding in excess of 800 Sahrawis as political
 prisoners. The Government of Morocco vigorously denied that
 any more Sahrawis were in Moroccan detention. It is not
 possible to establish with certainty how many Sahrawis remain
 in detention. A number of Sahrawis who returned to Morocco
 from Polisario camps near Tindouf alleged that the Polisario
 tortured and mistreated Sahrawis of Western Saharan origin
 residing in the camps.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates
 that 165,000 Sahrawi (i.e., Saharan native) refugees have
 resided in camps near Tindouf in Algeria since the mid-1970's.
 Recently returned Sahrawi refugees in Morocco, however,
 estimate that between 40,000 and 50,000 Sabrawis inhabit the
 Tindouf camps, along with an additional 20,000 to 30,000 Malian
 and Mauritanian refugees. Members of MINURSO similarly
 estimate that the Tindouf camps currently hold a total of
 approximately 80,000 refugees, of whom 25,000 to 30,000 are
 non-Sahrawi (i.e., from other countries in the region).
 Freedom of movement within the Western Sahara is limited in
 militarily sensitive areas but is otherwise unrestricted, as is
 travel in Morocco.
 The same labor laws that apply in Morocco apply in the
 Moroccan-controlled areas of the Western Sahara, and
 enforcement is equivalent to that in Morocco proper.

 WESTERN SAHARA
 Within the Western Sahara there is little organized labor
 activity. Since salaries in both the. private and public
 sectors are significantly higher than those in Morocco, wage
 demands are not an issue. Unemployment is also not a problem
 because of the Government's investment in the region and a
 program of taking young people out of the region to work in
 Morocco.
 Outside the territory controlled by Morocco, the Polisario has
 established a labor wing called the Sario Federation of Labor
 (UGTSARIO), which reportedly enjoys close relations with a few
 Arab and African national labor centers. The UGTSARIO does not
 engage in customary trade union activities in the Polisario-
 controlled areas.
