 ALBANIA*
 Albania is a one-party state ruled by a Marxist-Leninist
 dictatorship. The Government proclaims itself a People's
 Socialist Republic. Ramiz Alia, who officially replaced
 long-time dictator Enver Hoxha as Albania's leader in 1985,
 exercises personal leadership through the 140,000-member
 Communist party known as the Albanian Party of Labor (APL). A
 large, effective security service, the Sigurimi, assists the
 party in maintaining repressive controls over the Albanian
 people, who have only very limited civil and political rights.
 Albania has a centrally controlled command economy under which
 the State owns the means of production and the Government
 directs all significant economic activity. Within a strategy
 of economic self-reliance, the Government emphasizes a policy
 of rapid industrialization and development. In recent years,
 however, the rate of economic growth has declined.
 There is no persuasive evidence that the human rights
 situation significantly improved in Albania during 1986.
 Private international organizations have corroborated evidence
 of significant human rights violations, and the Government has
 repeatedly refused to cooperate with any international
 organizations which investigate human rights complaints.
 Since assuming leadership, Ramiz Alia has pledged continuity
 with Hoxha's policies, including the need for continued
 political "vigilance." Visiting Western journalists and
 tourists, however, have reported signs that some restrictions
 on everyday life have been relaxed somewhat under Alia.
 While the Alia regime has continued to isolate the Albanian
 population as much as possible from foreign influences, it has
 pursued a policy of cautiously expanding diplomatic, cultural,
 and commercial links abroad, especially with neighboring
 Balkan and Western European states. Albania is a member of
 the United Nations, but it has not signed the Final Act of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, nor has it
 ratified any international human rights covenants.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.    Political Killing
 No evidence came to light of political killings.
 b.    Disappearance
 Persons who have escaped from Albania report that
 disappearances occur, but corroboration is not available.
 c.    Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 The Criminal Code prohibits and provides punishment for the
 use of physical or psychological force during investigations.
 *The United States has not had diplomatic relations with or
 official representation in Albania since 1939. It is
 difficult, therefore, to comment authoritatively on conditions
 in Albania.

 ALBANIA
 Nevertheless, former political prisoners have often alleged
 that they were beaten or otherwise ill-treated during
 investigation proceedings to force them to make confessions.
 Although some of the worst abuses of the past may have ended,
 it appears that Albanian investigators still resort to threats
 and beatings to obtain confessions or collaboration. In the
 absence of independent means of investigating these charges,
 it is difficult to corroborate such reports, but the pattern
 of allegations suggests there is at least some truth to them.
 Private international humanitarian organizations have reported
 extremely harsh prison conditions in Albania, including a
 severe hard-labor regime with inadequate food and clothing,
 long-term solitary confinement, cramped cells without room to
 lie down, and unheated, unfurnished cells lacking any sanitary
 facilities. The Burrel prison and Spac and Ballsh labor
 camps, in particular, have been noted for their harsh
 conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that no one may be arrested without
 court or prosecutorial approval or be sentenced to jail
 without a court verdict or for an act which is not a crime.
 The Criminal Code, however, is explicitly ideological and
 officially characterized as a "weapon in the class struggle."
 Its provisions defining political offenses are loosely
 formulated, allowing the courts to interpret them broadly to
 punish whomever the regime desires.
 The Criminal Code lists 34 crimes, 12 of which are political
 offenses, for which the death sentence may be imposed. Among
 these are such nonviolent political offenses as: unauthorized
 leaving or "flight" from the State, agitation and propaganda
 against the State, creation of a counterrevolutionary
 organization or participation therein, concealment of a person
 who commits a crime against the State, activity against the
 revolutionary movement of the working class, and refusal to
 carry out a duty or coercing others to refuse.
 The Criminal Code also provides that banishment (generally to
 a state farm or enterprise) or internment may be
 administratively imposed, without trial, for up to 5 years on
 persons whom the authorities consider a threat to the
 Communist system and on the families of fugitives. Amnesty
 International's 1986 Report notes that several members of a
 family, regarded by the authorities as politically suspect,
 were interned for about 3 months shortly before the death of
 Enver Hoxha in 1985. Various members of this same family were
 said also to have been interned on earlier occasions.
 There are numerous reports that families of escapees from
 Albania have been imprisoned or interned as a deterrent to
 other potential illegal emigrants. Amnesty International has
 reported a number of such cases in recent years, but another
 source claimed that close relatives of recent escapees are no
 longer interned.
 Amnesty International reports that political detainees lack
 adequate legal safeguards during pretrial investigations. By
 law, investigations into crimes against the State must be
 completed within 3 months, but extensions are easily obtained,
 and no effective maximum period of investigation is enforced.
 Most investigations into political offenses are completed
 within 4 months, but Amnesty International charges that some
 
 
 853
 ALBANIA
 investigations have dragged on for more than a year.
 Political detainees have been held in solitary confinement for
 up to 6 months during pretrial investigations without access
 to lawyers or relatives. The Criminal Code provides that
 accused persons must be informed when investigation of their
 cases is concluded and allowed to examine all the evidence to
 be brought against them. Usually, however, they are not
 allowed to examine all the materials and are shown only a copy
 of the indictment. While investigators are theoretically
 bound by rules of procedure, and the accused may appeal to
 higher authority against investigators who violate proper
 procedures, there do not appear to be any effective controls
 on the powers of investigators in political cases.
 Information on forced labor is not currently available.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system includes a Supreme Court and regional and
 district courts. Like all organs of the Government and state
 authority, the judicial system appears to be under the total
 control of the APL. There is virtually no chance a court
 would render an independent verdict in conflict with the
 wishes or policies of the regime.
 Amnesty International reports that persons accused of
 political crimes lack adequate legal safeguards during their
 trials. Defendants at political trials have usually been
 denied defense counsel and have had to conduct their own
 defense. Major political trials of state officials are closed
 when it suits the purposes of the regime, but most political
 trials of ordinary citizens are held in open court. These
 trials last no more than 1 day, and there have been no known
 acquittals.
 Reports of the number of persons in prison range from 4,000 to
 40,000, including 300 members of the pre-World War II elite,
 as well as pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese, and other political
 prisoners. Many persons are serving sentences for expressing
 dissatisfaction with conditions in Albania or for trying to
 flee the country. Amnesty International reports it has the
 names of almost 400 political prisoners held in Albania during
 the 1970's and 1980's, but believes this is only a fraction of
 the true figure. Former political prisoners report about
 2,400 political prisoners were held in the Ballsh and Spac
 labor camps during the early 1980's. Some 300 more were
 imprisoned at Burrel, and others were held in Tarovic, Kosove,
 and Tirana prisons. Although the Government declared an
 amnesty on November 15, 1982, there is no independent
 confirmation of the number of persons amnestied, and there are
 reports of further political arrests since 1982.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution proclaims the inviolability of the home and
 the privacy of correspondence but at the same time provides
 that these and other civil rights are subordinate to the
 general interest and cannot be exercised in opposition to the
 Socialist order. Observers generally believe that the
 authorities can and do violate the privacy of the home
 whenever and to the extent necessary to achieve their ends.
 The Government uses its pervasive informer network to report
 on, among other things, the private lives of its citizens.
 Children are taught to report their parents' activities in the
 
 
 854
 ALBANIA
 home, such as whether they practice religion or speak against
 the Government. Contact with the outside world is carefully
 monitored. Refugees have reported difficulties they had while
 in Albania in receiving mail or telephone calls from relatives
 living abroad. Sometimes packages of food, medicine, and
 clothing sent to them were returned by the Albanian
 authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution states that citizens enjoy these
 freedoms, it provides that they may not be exercized in
 opposition to the Socialist order. Consequently, the
 Government has imposed rigid restrictions on freedom of speech
 and press. Any citizen who publicly criticizes the Government
 is subject to swift and severe reprisals under an article of
 the Constitution which forbids anti-State agitation and
 propaganda. Amnesty International claims in its 1986 Report
 to have received information about a number of persons
 convicted under this article and serving sentences of up to 20
 years for peacefully expressing views critical of economic or
 political conditions in Albania.
 All news media are government controlled and never criticize
 the state and party leaderships or their policies. Art and
 literature are deemed to be weapons of revolutionary change
 and are subject to rigid state control and censorship. The
 authorities also manipulate scholarly inquiry and publications
 for political purposes, particularly in such fields as
 linguistics, literature, economics, history, geography,
 folklore, and ethnology.
 Information from abroad is carefully controlled, and persons
 having unauthorized contacts with foreigners have been
 reprimanded or jailed, although there is some indication that
 such restrictions may have been relaxed somewhat lately.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The security police deal severely with group activities that
 do not have government sanction or that might appear to be in
 opposition to the leadership. There are no independent
 associations or organizations; all are controlled by the APL.
 Nearly all Albanians belong to trade unions that are part of
 the United Trade Unions of Albania, an arm of the APL. These
 unions have no significant independent voice in labor
 relations, although they play a key role in indoctrinating and
 propagandizing the workers, in maintaining labor discipline,
 and in organizing the periods of so-called "voluntary" manual
 labor in which all Albanians are expected to take part.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religious activity in Albania is expressly prohibited by
 the Constitution and by government policy. Historically,
 about 70 percent of all Albanians were Muslim, nearly 20
 percent were Orthodox, and a little more than 10 percent were
 Roman Catholic. A recent refugee report estimated that
 between 2,000 and 2,500 Jews live in Albania.
 In 1967 the Government proclaimed Albania the first atheist
 state in the world, abrogated all laws dealing with
 
 
 855
 ALBANIA
 church-state relations, and began an active campaign to
 eradicate all vestiges of religion. More than 2,100 mosques,
 churches, monasteries, and other institutions were closed,
 their fixed assets were seized without compensation by the
 authorities, and many religious leaders were persecuted,
 imprisoned, or even executed for continuing their religious
 functions. All religious literature was banned, as were any
 personal manifestations of religious belief or practice.
 While a few outstanding historic churches and their religious
 art are being restored as museums, most churches and mosques
 have been converted to other uses.
 The regime continues to suppress religious activity by
 threatening harsh penalties for believers who practice their
 faith and by obliging citizens to inform on believers.
 Nevertheless, there have been some signs that the regime is
 quietly toning down its antireligious campaign, as Tirana
 tries to improve its relations with Italy, Greece, and
 Turkey. There has been, however, no official statement that
 religious practice is once again allowed. Despite years of
 antireligious pressure, there are reports that some Albanians
 have continued to practice their faith in their own homes,
 particularly in villages and in more remote mountainous,
 areas. Tourists have also reported seeing Muslim Albanians
 faithfully kneeling in prayer along roadsides with apparent
 impunity.
 In November 1983, the Vatican publicly condemned religious
 persecution in Albania and claimed that a number of priests,
 members-of holy orders, and seminarians had died in prison.
 It also reported that two priests had been executed for
 baptizing children. The official press denies, however, that
 believers have been persecuted and maintains that religious
 belief is opposed only by argument.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution does not guarantee freedom of movement.
 Movement within the country and travel abroad are controlled
 very strictly, and transgressors against the laws are severely
 punished. The Criminal Code states that flight from the State
 or refusal to return to the fatherland by a person sent abroad
 on service or allowed to leave the State, is considered
 treason and punishable by imprisonment for not less than 10
 years or by death. Amnesty International stated in its 1986
 Report that it learned of 2 men serving sentences of 20 years
 in Burrel prison and Spac labor camp for having attempted to
 leave Albania illegally. Despite this, Albanians continue to
 risk their lives to cross heavily guarded borders into Greece
 and Yugoslavia. Albanians reportedly are allowed to leave the
 country legally only on official business or, very rarely, for
 family reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 No such right exists in theory or in practice. The Government
 is a totalitarian dictatorship, headed by Ramiz Alia in his
 capacity as First Secretary of the APL and Chairman of the
 Presidium of the People's Assembly. The Constitution
 establishes the APL as the sole political entity and
 Marxism-Leninism as the only political ideology. The APL is
 governed internally by the principle of "democratic
 centralism," under which decisionmaking power is concentrated
 
 
 856
 ALBANIA
 in the hands of a small elite. Any attempt by individual
 citizens, or even party members, to criticize policy or change
 the form of government or its leaders is dealt with severely.
 The Constitution provides that the People's Assembly (an
 unicameral parliament) is the supreme organ of national
 government in Albania; similar bodies, called people's
 councils, exist at the local level. Candidates for these
 assemblies are first designated by a mass organization known
 as the Democratic Front, which is controlled by the APL, and
 then "elected" without opposition by universal suffrage.
 After the last quadrennial elections, held on April 27, 1986,
 the Government announced that 100 percent of eligible voters
 had participated, and that the official slate of candidates
 had been elected with more that 99.99 percent of the votes.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government denies violating human rights and refuses to
 cooperate with any investigation of allegations to the
 contrary, including confidential investigations by the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution grants national minorities "guaranteed
 protection and development of their culture and popular
 traditions, the use of their mother tongue, and its teaching
 in the schools, and equal development in all fields of social
 life." Greeks compose the largest ethnic minority, but
 smaller numbers of Serbs, Bulgarians, Vlachs, Gypsies, and
 Jews also live in Albania. While there are differences of
 opinion over the extent to which minorities may exercise their
 cultural, educational, and linguistic rights, they are clearly
 restricted. Several reports indicate persecution, harassment,
 and discrimination against minorities solely because of their
 ethnic origin. There have even been reports of mass removals
 of segments of the Greek population out of traditionally Greek
 lands in the south to areas further from the Albanian-Greek
 border. Furthermore, insofar as the ban on religious practice
 has removed the Greek Orthodox Church from Greek communities
 in Albania, an important part of that ethnic group's
 commmunity life and links to Greece has been eliminated. The
 leadership of both the APL and the Government are
 overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian of Moslem background.
 The Constitution states that women shall enjoy "equal rights
 with men in work, pay, holidays, social security, education,
 in all social-political activity, as well as in the family."
 Information on the extent to which these rights are exercised
 is not available, but there are indications that the regime
 has advanced the status of women. Women are said to
 participate equally in the obligatory labor and military
 service programs. There are several women in party and
 government leadership positions.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no current data available on the minimum age for the
 employment of children, minimum wages, maximum hours of work,
 or occupational safety and health.
