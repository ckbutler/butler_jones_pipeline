 MEXICO
 Mexico is a federal republic governed by the Constitution of
 1917, which provides for separation of powers between a
 bicameral legislature, a judiciary, and an executive. The
 powers of the presidency, however, far outweigh those of the
 other branches of government in Mexico's centralized system.
 Since 1929, politics at all levels -- federal, state, and local
 -- has been dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary Party
 (PRI). Opposition parties are allowed and are even encouraged
 by the Government as outlets for criticism and dissatisfaction,
 but they have not been able to successfully challenge the PRI
 politically in presidential or gubernatorial elections, and
 Mexico remains virtually a one-party state. Opposition party
 opportunities have been thwarted by nationwide PRI voting
 strength and organizational power, by the party's maneuvers to
 co-opt and/or divide the opposition, and, the opposition
 claims, by electoral fraud.
 In the July 1982 election, the PRI lost only one of the 300
 single-member districts of the Chamber of Deputies seats;
 another four seats are to be decided by new elections or by an
 appeal to the Chamber of Deputies. The PRI won all 64 Senate
 .seats and the presidency. The official results indicate that
 74.8 percent of the 31,516,370 registered voters turned out.
 Of these votes, the PRI won 74.3 percent in the presidential
 tally and an average of 69.4 percent in the congressional
 contests.
 Mexico is more economically advanced than most developing
 countries, and its human and natural resources, particularly
 oil, provide the base for further growth. Over the last 40
 years Mexico has changed from a rural and agricultural society
 to an urban industrialized society with a mixed economy and
 large public sector involvement.
 During 1982 there was some improvement in the human rights
 situation in Mexico, although problems exist as noted by
 Amnesty International, Freedom House, and other independent
 observers. Most attention has focused on the fate of
 'disappeared' or missing persons held by the Government,
 alleged in 1982 to number approximately 500. This subject is
 often the theme of statements by Mexico's most prominent human
 rights advocate, Mrs. Rosario Ibarra de Piedra. She and others
 concerned with human rights are allowed to publicize their
 concerns, and the Mexican Constitution and laws call for social
 justice, equality, and human rights.
 In August, the President gave amnesty to 44 political
 prisoners, i.e., persons previously charged with various
 criminal acts that may in fact have been politically-
 motivated. This action brought to 1,604 the number of persons
 given amnesty during the Lopez Portillo administration. The
 political reform of 1977 provides possibilities for a greater
 variety of registered political parties through which minority
 or dissenting opinion can be expressed. Independent unions are
 being certified (accredited) by the Government, with over
 100,000 bank employees now permitted to form unions for the
 first time in Mexican history.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The quest for equitable distribution of land played a key role
 
 
 570
 in the Mexican Revolution. Critics of the Government feel that
 agrarian reform has not been carried out properly and that land
 isheld by too few individuals.
 Peasants continued in 1982 to carry out land takeovers, which.
 in a few cases resulted in deaths. Many peasant leaders and
 Mexican human rights advocates believe that the "Brigada
 Blanca," a para-military force created by the Government to
 combat terrorism during the 1970's, assisted landowners in
 violent attacks on peasants seeking land due them under
 presidential decree. According to peasant and Indian groups
 critical of government agrarian policy, 10 peasants were killed
 in Oaxaca in 1982 by Brigada elements from Veracruz and local
 landowners. A spokesman for the National Plan of Ayala
 Organization, an independent peasant organization, has claimed
 publicly that officially-inspired atrocities, including
 killings, have been committed against peasants not only in
 Oaxaca, but also in Veracruz, Chiapas, Jalisco, Guerrero, and
 Sonora. Although there are no available independent means for
 corroborating these allegations, these are credible reports
 that are widely believed by Mexican human rights advocates.
 The Government has responded positively to some reported
 incidents, denouncing the murder by large landowners of 26
 peasants in Puebla in June 1982, and expressing the
 Government's commitment to prevent such incidents in the
 future. It promised to investigate the incident, but no
 findings have been announced. The Government contends that the
 'Brigada Blanca' has been disbanded.
 b. Disappearance
 Reports by human rights groups, news reports, and letters
 smuggled out of prisons by those apprehended claim the
 existence of a government-controlled chain of underground
 prisons ranging from police station basements to installations
 at a military camp ("Numero Uno") in Mexico City. The National
 Front against Repression claims to have the names of the
 kidnapped victims and notarized testimonies of former prisoners
 detailing what they suffered and where they were detained, all
 of which, the Front states, has been ignored by the
 authorities. The Front claimed in 1982 that there were
 approximately 500 persons missing for political reasons, an
 increase of six over November of 1981. Amnesty International
 has urged unsuccessfully that the Mexican Government provide
 information about specific cases of possible disappearance.
 Mexico denies official involvement in the disappearance of
 individuals, and there is no reliable evidence to the
 contrary. The Government claims that those who are unaccounted
 for were either killed in encounters with security forces,
 changed their names, went underground, or sought voluntary
 exile.
 c. Torture
 The Mexican Constitution prohibits torture. Nevertheless,
 credible reports of mistreatment of persons during the arrest
 and interrogation stage continue. Amnesty International's 1982
 report highlights such reports. According to these reports,
 beatings, electric shocks, submersion in water, and forcing
 carbonated water up the nostrils are among the methods of
 torture. Those suspected of terrorism or drug-trafficking
 appear to be most likely to be physically maltreated. These
 credible reports tend to confirm allegations by American
 citizens of instances of maltreatment by Mexican law
 enforcement personnel.
 
 
 571
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 While Mexican penal institutions continue to be improved,
 unsanitary conditions and health problems exist. Most
 prisoners are allowed to have food and other necessities
 purchased and brought in for them by others. Medical care is
 provided and conjugal visits are permitted. Both in terms of
 the physical conditions and in the physical treatment of the
 prisoners, the prisons in Mexico City and along the US-Mexican
 border are better than those in the interior of Mexico. There
 are credible reports of continued physical maltreatment of
 prisoners in Mexican penal institutions, as well as of verbal
 threats directed toward prisoners' families or prisoners
 themselves.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution limits detention of an individual to three
 days without formal charges. Detentions of more than three
 days are rare, occurring most often in criminal cases,
 especially those involving drug trafficking. Such violations
 are less the result of calculated police tactics than the slow
 moving judicial process and/or bribe demands by police
 officials.
 Arbitrary arrest and detention for periods of time shorter than
 three days are more common. Those instances which occur often
 involve alleged "troublemakers* and members of opposition
 political groups. For example, in the wake of the August 1982
 devaluation, Mexico City police rounded up and held for a short
 period of time several persons as a form of intimidation to
 prevent any manifestations of social unrest. Some specific
 examples of arrest and/or detention follow:
 -- Luis Ortega Morales, Secretary of the Unified Socialist
 Party for the State of Puebla, claims to have been abducted
 from his home in late August 1982 by nine police officers,
 detained for one night at the local police station, and
 beaten. Mr. Ortega claimed the action was related to a suit he
 had filed against his landlord for wanting to raise his rent by
 200 pesod. The landlord is reportedly a relative of an
 official in the local justice tribunal.
 -- In August 1982, the Revolutionary Workers Party claimed that
 its press coordinator, Ulises Martinez, and two other party
 members were detained in Mexico City by unidentified men who
 questioned them regarding their political activities. The men
 extorted 5,000 pesos and threatened to take them to military
 camp "number one" before finally releasing them.
 Provision for amnesty on the federal and state levels exist for
 those convicted of crimes, including political activists.
 Prior to his September 1982 State of the Nation address,
 President Lopez Portillo, in keeping with the 1978 Amnesty Law,
 gave amnesty to 44 political prisoners. Mexican private
 organizations allege that there are several hundred political
 prisoners still in detention, however. Amnesty International
 reported in its 1982 report that the 'arrest and imprisonment
 of many people convicted on criminal charges were politically
 motivated and stemmed from their activities in trade unions or
 peasant groups.'
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The accused in Mexico is generally accorded a fair public
 trial, although delays are often encountered. Under the
 
 
 572
 Constitution, trial and sentencing must be completed within 12
 months of arrest for crimes that would carry a minimum of a
 two-year sentence. Such cases are often delayed due to
 cumbersome court procedures or to the inability of the
 defendant to provide the money which the law sets as a
 prerequisite to bring the case to trial. Defendants have a
 right to counsel and public defenders are available. Trial
 procedures usually involve only a judge, with no jury, and make
 use of written statements, expert opinion, and, less commonly,
 oral testimony. There are credible periodic allegations in the
 Mexican press of confessions obtained through coercion.
 Civilians may not be tried by military courts. To appeal a
 verdict, a defendant may ask the Supreme Court, the District
 Court, or the Circuit Court for a habeas corpus-type procedure
 known as "amparo.' There are ample guarantees for access to
 the courts as well as for appeals - and both are liberally
 exercised by Mexicans. There have been occasional reports that
 the executive branch influenced the extent of such
 interventions, but it is difficult to assess them.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Constitutional guarantees exist against entry into homes
 without a warrant. Such warrants may be issued, depending on
 the case involved, by a federal or state judge. The
 constitutional guarantees are generally respected.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and press are guaranteed by law and are
 exercised openly by the media. Political and social commentary
 and some criticism of government policy, individual political
 figures, and political parties are seen in the daily press and
 in periodicals. Traditionally, the President has been exempt
 from press criticism, but there has been more critical public
 commentary in the past year than is customary. Overt
 censorship is exercised mostly on moral grounds, be it in
 print, radio, movies, or television. Journalists are expected
 to respect the privacy of individuals and not-disturb public
 peace and morals in their reporting. In addition to libel and
 slander laws, there is an unwritten understanding between
 reporters and the Government that reporters should avoid
 indiscriminate critical exposes of the personal lives of
 prominent officials. The result is that journalists tend to
 practice self-censorship. Cable TV from the US is readily
 available, but sometimes censored. Local press freedoms are
 difficult to gauge since experiences vary from state to state,
 but there appear to be few institutionalized safeguards against
 infringement by local authorities.
 While the press is ostensibly free of government censorship,
 press sources report that the Government uses a number of means
 to exert influence. These means have included government
 financial supplements to individual reporters, withholding
 newsprint (a government monopoly) from papers, and selective
 placement of government advertising (an important source of
 income for the press). In the wake of the August 1982 economic
 crisis, the Government resorted to somewhat more overt
 censorship On a few occasions cable news programs from the US
 were censored to prevent reports critical of Mexico from being
 aired in Mexico.
 
 
 573
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution grants the right to peaceful assembly for any
 lawful purpose. Many demonstrations, including anti-government
 ones, take place throughout the country without government
 interference.
 Trade unions enjoy the right to organize, negotiate, and
 strike. The major portion of organized labor is affiliated
 with the Institutional Revolutionary Party, through the
 Confederation of Mexican Workers. As a result, the labor
 confederation both influences and is influenced by the
 Government. The Government generally provides police
 protection to strikers and acts to protect their right to
 strike. There is no official harassment of unions, and several
 powerful independent unions exist. About 85 percent of urban
 workers are organized. Unionization in the rural sector is
 much lower. Professional organizations function openly and
 they, as well as the unions, maintain international ties.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mexico is heavily Roman Catholic, but there has been no overt
 favoritism or discrimination based on religion. Under the law,
 freedom of religion is protected, but political activity on the
 part of the clergy, including speaking out on political issues,
 is not allowed. Other constitutional limitations include
 prohibitions against clergymen voting or holding elective
 office, authority vested in the states to regulate the number
 of clergymen allowed to practice within their boundaries, and a
 prohibition against ownership of real estate by religious
 groups. Most of these limitations are not strictly enforced.
 Two other prohibitions which have not been strictly carried
 out, but which nevertheless remain as law, are a limitation of
 the right of clerical practice to Mexican-born citizens and a
 restriction against pre-university religious schools.
 Attempts by the Church to speak out on political issues during
 the past year have brought quick negative reactions from the
 PRI and opposition political parties of the left. The PRI
 issued a protest in the electoral college of the Chamber of
 Deputies in August 1982 against Catholic Church activity during
 the election campaign. The protest was made following comments
 by Church officials that Catholicism and Marxism are not
 compatible and remarks by an archbishop that the current
 economic crisis would explode into a social crisis because the
 people have lost confidence in the system, due to its
 immorality and corruption.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted. Mexico is concerned,
 however, about the uncontrolled population growth of Mexico
 City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey, caused in large part by
 migration from rural areas. These newcomers often illegally
 settle on private lands and the Government has responded on
 occasion by demolishing their shanties and forcing them out.
 In other cases, the Government has expropriated land for
 national and/or development purposes, thereby forcing people to
 relocate. One example is the land used by squatter settlements
 in the hills overlooking Acapulco which the state government
 expropriated to use as a national park. The goal was to
 reduce the pollution of the bay and erosion caused by the
 squatter communities. The Government established a new city
 near Acapulco as compensation, but there was much resentment on
 the part of those who were compelled to move.
 
 
 574
 Mexico has maintained a liberal asylum policy, and many
 political exiles have come to find a home in Mexico.
 Emigration from Mexico is liberal, with no government
 restrictions to impede an individual's move. Likewise,
 immigration to Mexico is encouraged by Mexico's liberal
 immigration regulations and there are large communities of
 various groups such as Americans, Spaniards, Italians, Chinese,
 Lebanese, and Jews.
 Mexico has opened its borders to Central American refugees,
 particularly Guatemalans. Mexico maintains a number of refugee
 camps along its southern border. With the assistance of the
 Mexican office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mexico
 has inaugurated a number of aid projects for the refugees.
 There have been some abuses practiced against the refugees. In
 1981, the Government expelled approximately 2,000 refugees to
 Guatemala and, in October 1982, a local immigration official
 reportedly forced refugees out of one camp. The reason for the
 latter expulsion is unknown, but most of the affected refugees
 turned up in another camp inside Mexico. The Government has
 promised to end such abuses and the official responsible was
 transferred from the border area. Overall, the Government's
 attitude and assistance to the refugees has been positive.
 There are an estimated 30,000 Guatemalan refugees now living in
 Mexico.
 The National Front Against Repression claims in a credible
 report that there are four individuals, located in Cuba,
 France, and the Netherlands, who have been precluded from
 returning to Mexico because of their former political
 activities.
 Citizenship may be lost if a Mexican works for, accepts a
 decoration from, or receives a title or function from a foreign
 government without the permission of the Mexican Government.
 It can also be lost by accepting a title of nobility or by
 aiding a foreign country against Mexico. Over the past year
 there have been no known cases of revoked citizenship.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Mexico is a republic which has been governed for almost fifty
 years by one party, the PRI. Under the law, all citizens, 18
 and over, except the clergy, may vote. The Government runs
 extensive campaigns to generate voter participation, and the
 1982 election witnessed a record turnout.
 Politicians, both from the ruling party and the opposition,
 have reported that some elections - particularly on the local
 level are marred by fraud and at times by violence. Local
 election conflicts sometimes involve not only the pitting of
 opposition groups against the PRI, but also factional strife
 within the PRI itself. For instance, 20 municipalities in
 Chiapas were reported by the press as experiencing violence
 related to intra-party squabbles over the nomination of
 candidates. At least two people were killed and dozens
 wounded. The PRI, however, reported that the nomination
 process had proceeded normally and rejected all reports to the
 contrary as untrue. Opposition figures state that when they
 win elections, they sometimes experience harassment. For
 example, in Juchitan, Oaxaca, an alliance of leftist forces
 which supports the local Unified Socialist Party government
 reportedly experienced harassment from PRI groups. Federal
 Deputy Hector Sanchez claimed there were armed persons
 affiliated with the PRI who had engaged in violence against the
 left.
 
 
 575
 The July 4, 1982 national elections involved few incidents of
 violence. The election was marked by the participation of nine
 political parties fielding a total of seven presidential
 candidates. Both figures are records for Mexican politics.
 There were many charges of electoral fraud, largely from
 opposition parties. For example, early returns announced by
 the Federal Election Commission gave the Unified Socialist
 Party presidential candidate 1,113,000 votes or 5.81 percent of
 the vote. However, the final figures showed the United
 Socialist Party with only 821,995 votes or 3.65 percent. There
 were also some reports of death threats made against opposition
 candidates and their families.
 Minority groups, including women and Indians, are allowed full
 participation in the Mexican political process. In the 52nd
 legislature (convened September 1, 1982) there were six women
 in the Senate and 51 in the Chamber of Deputies, in both cases
 significant increases in the level of female representation.
 Persons of Indian heritage play a role in practically every
 level of Mexican politics and are well represented in local and
 national legislative bodies.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Mexican Government participates in international human
 rights fora and allows both domestic and international human
 rights groups to operate within Mexico without restrictions or
 harassment. Both Amnesty International and the Office of the
 UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) operate in Mexico.
 The latter opened its office in January 1982. A close working
 relationship has developed between the Mexican Government and
 the UNHCR in providing assistance to Central American refugees,
 particularly Guatemalans, in southern Mexico.
 Mexican human rights organizations have numerous contacts with
 other Latin Americanhuman rights groups. The National Front
 Against Repression claims to have been instrumental in
 obtaining the release of 40 "disappeared persons" since 1979.
 Mexican human rights advocates have access to government
 leaders, including the President.
 In January 1982, three representatives of the UN Human Rights
 Commission (UNHRC) visited Mexico at the invitation of the
 Mexican Government to obtain information on reports of
 disappearances.  (Mexico was the first country to invite the
 UNHRC Working Group since its creation in 1980.) The
 delegation met with government officials and human rights
 groups. The Government continues actively to examine the cases
 submitted to it. Nevertheless, in August 1982, the UNHRC in
 Geneva listed Mexico as one of 22 countries in which political
 disappearances are common. Freedom House in 1982 listed Mexico
 as "Partly Free."
 In reply to queries about missing persons, the Government
 claimed that most of the presumed disappeared were criminals or
 members of subversive groups who had been killed in battles
 with government forces or who were in hiding or voluntary
 exile. The Government claimed that it was difficult to account,
 for all missing individuals, since some of the local officials
 who were supposedly involved in older cases have died.
 Furthermore, some of the cases are as old as ten years, making
 it difficult to collect facts. The Government continues,
 however, to cooperate with the UNHRC Working Group.
 
 
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Mexico's major domestic economic and social problems continue
 to be inflation, unemployment, severely uneven income
 distribution, and population growth.
 A deterioration in the general economic situation in 1982 led
 the Government to devalue its currency in February, August, and
 December; in September, the Government nationalized domestic
 banking institutions. Regarding one of its major problems as
 being flight of capital, the Government has instituted various
 other limitations, including exchange controls. These include
 restrictions on the amount of money and gems an individual may
 take out of the country. The economic crisis has also spurred
 a somewhat greater flow of illegal workers into the US.
 The Government maintains the right to regulate ownership of
 private property in order to protect the public interest.There
 are also restrictions regarding the ownership of property by
 foreigners.
 Corruption continues to mar the Government's functions at all
 levels in spite of past efforts to eliminate it and to
 apprehend those guilty of malfeasance. As a sign of its
 continuing effort, the Government proposed in September 1982 a
 list of new and tougher anti-corruption bills for congressional
 consideration. The proposed legislation would establish
 sanctions for abuses of authority, embezzlement, bribery, and
 profiting from official services. President de la Madrid
 stressed during the campaign before his election his
 determination to fight corruption during his administration.
 Mexico's population in 1982 was estimated at 76 million. Its
 population growth rate declined to 2.34 percent by the end of
 1982, according to official figures, from a level of 3.2
 percent from six years before. Life expectancy at birth is
 65.4 (1980), as compared to 66 years in 1979. The infant
 mortality rate declined to 55.9 per 1,000 live births as of
 1980, compared to 60 per 1,000 in 1978. Mexico has become an
 urbanized society, with some 60 percent of the population
 living in cities.
 The primary school enrollment ratio in Mexico, including the
 primary age group and those outside it, is 124 (1979). Primary
 education is both free and obligatory and has been extended to
 include 10 years of schooling. Adult literacy as of 1976 stood
 at 82 percent. The ratio of calorie supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements is 114
 percent(1977). The GNP per capita was $2,134.70 in 1980 as
 compared to $1,640.00 in 1979.
 Inflation and unemployment continue to trouble the economy.
 Inflation in 1982 was about 54 percent. According to the
 Government, unemployment rose from five percent at the end of
 1981 to over eight percent in mid-1982, while underemployment
 was estimated by most observers at 40 percent. There is no
 generalized unemployment compensation system in Mexico. The
 Social Security Institute provides medical insurance,
 retirement benefits, and funeral expenses. The percentage of
 the population with access to safe water is 62 percent (1975).
 Men and women are equal under the law, enjoying the same rights
 and privileges. Mexican women have the right to file for
 divorce or separation. There are no travel restrictions on
 women and they can own property in their own names. Moreover,
 over the past ten years, Mexican women have increased their
 
 
 577
 presence in non-traditional occupations. Nonetheless, the
 traditional concept of women as homemakers continues to hold
 sway. This is more a result of the Latin cultural milieu than
 outright discrimination against women. For example, the
 National Women's Civic Association maintains that the role of a
 woman is that of wife and mother. Women comprise approximately
 20 percent of the work force and continue to work predominantly
 in non-supervisory jobs, with few on the executive level.
