 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic with a parliamentary
 government elected by universal suffrage. However, the
 Nationalist Party has been boycotting parliament in a political
 protest since the last election in December 1981. Although the
 ruling Labor Party received 49 percent of the total vote,
 versus 51 percent for the Nationalists, redistricting resulted
 in majority of parliamentary seats for Labor. The Nationalist
 Party accused their opponents of gerrymandering and refused to
 take their seats. On April 26, 1982 Nationalist members of the
 parliament were declared unseated by the speaker. The
 Nationalists refused to accept this unseating and since then
 the parliament has been functioning as a one-party body
 dominated by the Labor Party. The President serves as Chief of
 State, and direction of the executive is exercised by the
 cabinet under the leadership of the Prime Minister. There are
 65 seats in parliament. Malta is a member of the British
 Commonwealth..
 Reflecting an established tradition of respect for legal norms,
 the Maltese Constitution states that every person in Malta is
 entitled to fundamental individual rights and freedoms
 regardless of race, place of-origin, political opinion, color,
 creed, or sex., The threat to these generally observed
 standards exists primarily in Malta's intensely partisan
 political disputes, which affect negatively even vital
 non-political institutions such as the judiciary, the National
 Broadcasting System, hospitals, and schools. The functioning
 of superior courts was suspended by the Government for several
 weeks in early 1981. Since the last elections, there has been
 a series of boycotts and counter-boycotts affecting advertising,
 television, and the use of certain products. The passage of
 tle Foreign Interference Act on September 1," 1982, was a clear
 attempt by the Government to exert centralized control over
 foreign informational and cultural activities. In an act of
 civil disobedience inspired by the opposition on June 29, 1982,
 thousands of Maltese did not go to work for one day. The
 response of the government was to label this an illegal strike
 and to deprive those who had participated of the chance to go
 back to work. In some cases businesses were closed
 completely. Gas station owners, for example, were not allowed
 to purchase gas. On August 8 the Prime Minister decided that
 "as an act of mercy," he would allow most of those who had
 participated in this act of civil disobedience to return to
 work -- after six weeks of unemployment. Since then there has
 been no repetition of such civil disobedience.
 The Constitution guarantees social rights in principle and in
 practice.
 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no killings for political reasons in Malta
 during 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no incidents of unexplained disappearances from
 the actions of official or official-inspired organizations.

 c. Torture
 The Maltese Constitution prohibits inhumane or degrading
 punishment. Torture is not practiced by the Government of
 Malta.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from inhuman or degrading punishment is provided for in
 the Constitution and generally is respected in practice.
 However, there have been rumors of physical mistreatment of
 prisoners during interrogation by police. The approximately
 100 persons who make up Malta's total prison population are
 provided with adequate living space, food, health care, and
 recreational opportunities on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention is provided for in
 the Constitution and respected in practice. There are no
 political prisoners. People can be and are held for 48 hours
 of "questioning" without being charged with any crime. The
 right of habeas corpus is guaranteed by the Constitution.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial before an impartial court is provided for
 in the Constitution and is respected in practice. Malta allows
 no secret trials, and the Judicial system is fair. The
 Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and there
 is an appeals court. A Court Reform Act passed in 1981 imposes
 new limits on the jurisdiction of the courts, particularly in
 regard to oversight of administrative actions by the
 Government. Malta's system of military justice was taken over
 intact from the British forces. Only military personnel are
 subject to this system, and there are provisions for appeal to
 civilian courts.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Protection for privacy of the home is provided for in the
 Constitution and is respected in practice. Police searches of
 homes or private premises require warrants, issued only after
 proper administrative review. These provisions are respected,
 and any irregularities would be subject to immediate scrutiny
 through the press.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and are
 respected in practice, with the important exception of radio
 and television broadcasting. Broadcasting is completely
 controlled by the Government of Malta which makes no pretense
 of evenhanded coverage of the opposition. The Government of
 Malta has gone so far as to seek to apply this policy
 extraterritorially, by insisting that the Government of Italy
 close down an opposition station broadcasting from Sicily.
 With respect to printed new media, the opposition Nationalist
 party press is active and wide-ranging in its criticism of
 government policy.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is guaranteed under Maltese law
 and fully exercised in practice. Workers exercise the freedom
 to set up trade union associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice the religion of preference is guaranteed
 and respected. There are no restrictions on the conduct of
 religious services of any denomination. The overwhelmingly
 dominant religion is Roman Catholicism.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Neither domestic nor foreign travel is circumscribed. Freedom
 of movement, foreign travel, and emigration are guaranteed and
 respected.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is a high degree of participation in Malta's democratic
 political system. Voting is not compulsory, but approximately
 95 percent of eligible voters cast ballots during the 1981
 parliamentary elections.
 Very few women participate at the upper levels in Malta'a
 political life, except for the President of the Republic who is
 a woman. One of the 34 members of the House of Representatives
 is a woman. Both the Malta Labor Party and the Nationalist
 Party have active women's organizations, which are increasingly
 playing a prominent political role.
 There Is an active trade union movement representing
 approximately one-third of the labor force. Approximately 70
 percent of trade union members belong to the General Workers
 Union, which is formally integrated with the governing Malta
 Labor Party. The General Workers Union disseminates
 information and organizes political rallies in support of the
 Malta Labor Party. The present Government has a number of
 former*General Workers Union officials in its ranks. Most of
 the remaining unions are affiliated with the Independent
 Confederation of Trade Unions. There are also independent,
 company-based unions.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 No requests are known to have been made for outside
 investigation of the human rights situation in Malta. Freedom
 House in its 1982 report rates Malta as "2" in political rights
 and "3" in civil liberties, on a scale of 1 to 7, with "I"
 being "most free" and "7" being "least free".
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Constitution declares that availability to citizens of the
 highest grades of education and social welfare are fundamental
 aims of government. Both government and opposition are
 committed to pursuit of these aims and to support of the basic
 
 
 953
 economic rights to own property, to work with just conditions
 and remuneration, to a standard of living adequate for health
 and well-being, and to universal education. In 1980, per
 capita income was $3,467.
 Maltese public education is free, nondiscriminatory and
 extensive in relation to Malta's limited resources. The
 literacy rate is nearly 90 percent, and education is compulsory
 to age 16.
 Traditionally, general standards of health care in Malta are
 relatively high. In 1980 life expectancy at birth was 71.7
 years. Government programs in health care have concentrated on
 providing inexpensive health services to the largest possible
 segment of the population (infant mortality is low: only 15.5
 per thousand live births), but a prolonged labor dispute
 between the Government and the medical association has led to
 the departure fromMalta of many local doctors, and the
 remaining church-run private hospitals have been closed by the
 Government.
 Women participate freely in social and political life and
 continue to expand their economic role, although they are
 under-represented in the professions and management. There are
 traditional legal limitations on women's property rights within
 marriage which derive from traditional Maltese social values
 and traditional notions of women's property rights.
 Limitations on public sector employment of married women were
 removed in 1981. Strong private sector demand for female labor
 has ensured a very low level of unemployment among Women, who
 constitute about 27 percent of the labor force. Public
 economic and social services are extended on a
 nondiscriminatory basis.
