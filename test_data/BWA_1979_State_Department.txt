 BOTSWANA
 Throughout its thirteen years of independence, Botswana has
 maintained the fundamental principles of political democracy,
 the rule of law, and respect for human rights despite
 severe external and internal pressures. The constitution
 of Botswana, which came into effect in 1965 when Botswana
 was still the British-administered Bechuanaland Protectorate,
 contains in effect a bill of rights providing for the
 "protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the
 individual". Although threatened by the fighting in
 neighboring Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, Botswana has not resorted to
 a suspension of civil liberties on national security
 grounds. Botswana continues to permit political dissent;
 it holds its official and military forces accountable to an
 independent judiciary for official behaviour; and it
 enforces legislation protecting the rights of its white and
 Asian minorities. At the same time, Botswana is providing
 for the social welfare needs and security of thousands of
 refugees who have sought asylum in Botswana from nearby
 countries. Botswana, in sum, consistently has demonstrated
 a strong commitment to political liberties and civil rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law and there have been no allega-
 tions of torture in Botswana.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment is forbidden by law and is virtually unknown
 in practice. There have been no summary executions in
 Botswana. Prison conditions allow for adequate diet and
 health care, visits from family members and the attorney of
 one's choice. The international committee of the Red Cross
 has access to detainees.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Botswana. The constitu-
 tion contains provisions protecting Botswana citizens from
 arbitrary arrest.
 d.    Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for by law and
 honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel
 and consultation between defendants and counsel may be held
 in private. Incidents of harassment of defense counsel by
 the government are unknown. The government has upheld the
 separation of executive and judicial authority even in
 controversial and politically sensitive cases. The high
 court recently ruled that the constitution contains an
 implied "fifth amendment" i.e. that no one can be compelled
 to testify against himself; moreover, silence cannot be
 construed as guilt and the burden of proof remains with the
 prosecution. All trials are held in public, and accounts
 by foreign news sources indicate a scrupulous adherence to
 established procedures, including the rights of defendants.
 
 
 There-are no military courts nor special courts to
 deal with security or political offenses. There are
 problems in the administration of justice, but they center
 mainly on the difficulty in recruiting sufficient qualified
 magistrates.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is safeguarded by law and respected
 in practice. There are effective legal safeguards for
 protection against arbitrary invasion of the home.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The government of Botswana is committed to economic develop-
 ment with equity, and has demonstrated considerable sensitiv-
 ity to the basic human needs of the Botswana population.
 Preparation of the 1980-85 national development plan has
 resulted in a lively and constructive debate among government
 planners over how equitably to distribute among a fundamen-
 tally rural population the proceeds from a growing modern
 economy based on mineral extraction. A shift is being made
 from an emphasis on the provision of physical and social
 infrastructure to greater support for the twin objectives
 of rural development and the creation of employment opportu-
 nities in the rural areas. This will include programs in
 arable agriculture, commerce, and small-scale rural industry.
 Programs which have achieved success in bringing classrooms,
 sanitation facilities, roads, health facilities, and water
 supplies to the countryside will be continued as needed.
 By 1980, primary school education will be entirely free.
 Over 80 percent of primary school age children in Botswana
 are now attending school. The literacy rate is 35 percent
 in Setswana and 25 percent in English.
 Botswana has a progressive income tax. There is also a
 turnover tax on revenues of the Botswana Meat Commission
 (BMC) which is borne by cattle producers in proportion
 to their sales to the BMC. Botswana has avoided regressive
 sales taxes. As a result, the tax burden tends to fall on
 those most able to bear it.
 Government workers are granted periodic pay raises to
 offset inflation, and employers of urban workers in the
 private sector key their wage scales to those of the
 government.
 Women are finding increased employment in the modern sector.
 While most employed women are working in the fields of
 nursing, teaching and secretarial work, a small but growing
 number are entering the professions of accounting and
 government service (including diplomacy and law). In the
 modern sector, women receive equal pay for equal work.
 There is a growing, active trade union movement in Botswana
 which is focusing on the social concerns of its membership.
 Women are beginning to play an active role in the labor
 movement.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The people of Botswana are free to express independent
 political ideas in speech and peaceful assembly. Opposition
 political parties exercise these rights by sharply criticiz-
 ing the government and the ruling Botswana Democratic Party.
 Freedom of religion and of the press is guaranteed by
 the constitution. Up to the present, all of Botswana's
 information media are operated by the government, but
 are managed by editorial staffs which enjoy considerable
 independence. They often print articles strongly critical
 of government officials and policies. There is broad
 coverage of the activities and statements of the political
 opposition.
 Botswana has a nearly homogeneous ethnic population.
 Three minorities, however, remain distinct. While racial
 tensions occasionally manifest themselves, the government
 has vigorously pursued a policy of non-racialism which
 gives all citizens the same rights and responsibilities
 regardless of color. As a result, race relations are
 quite harmonious. The Kalanga tribal group in northeast
 Botswana makes up less than five percent of the country's
 population but is well represented in the central government
 and private sector. Tensions persist between Kalangas and
 Tswanas, who comprise 90 percent of the population, but
 there is no legal discrimination against the Kalanga
 minority.
 The Basarwas (or Bushmen), who inhabit the Kalahari Desert
 region, have presented a difficult problem. The steady
 incursions of modern agriculture have caused many Bushmen
 (some five percent of the population) to abandon their
 traditional life as hunter-gatherers. Faced with the
 dilemma of the Bushmen's desire to maintain their traditional
 existence and the economic necessity to make efficient use
 of all the nation's land, the government has undertaken
 policies designed to ease the Basarwas' integration into
 modern life.
 The white and Asian minorities in Botswana, although
 less than two percent of the population, play a significant
 role in the country's economy. Many whites and Asians are'
 Botswana citizens; their personal and property rights are
 protected by the same laws which protect all Botswanans.
 There is one white member in the newly-elected Parliament.
 b.    Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within Botswana,
 emigration or travel abroad.
 c.    Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Botswana is a multi-party parliamentary democracy based
 on constitutionally guaranteed universal suffrage. Its
 citizens enjoy complete freedom to participate in politics
 by voting, party activities and public advocacy of policies.
 In the October, 1979, Parliamentary election three oppositon
 parties challenged the ruling Botswana Democratic Party in
 
 
 21
 free and open elections in which secret ballots were cast.
 The Government made a strong effort to persuade eligible
 Botswanans to participate in the electoral process.
 Women have full political rights in Botswana. In practice,
 women increasingly are participating in social, economic and
 political life. There are two women members of the new
 Parliament, both of whom are cabinet members. Women in
 growing numbers serve on local governing bodies.
 Labor unions have the right to organize, strike, bargain
 collectively and lobby.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Botswana welcomes the attention and interest of the outside
 world in its human rights situation including Botwana's
 treatment of refugees. Its record of cooperation with
 international agencies involved in assisting persons
 displaced by the fighting in Rhodesia has been excellent.
