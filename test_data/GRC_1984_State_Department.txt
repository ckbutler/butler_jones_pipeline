 GREECE
 Greece is a republic with a democratically-elected
 Parliament. The full range of universally acknowledged human
 rights is guaranteed by the Constitution, which includes many
 of the provisions of the United Nations Universal Declaration
 of Human Rights. Parliamentary elections were held most
 recently in 1981 and local elections in 1982. Elections for
 representatives to the European Parliament took place in June
 1984. All were vigorously and freely contested.
 The judiciary is independent of both the executive branch of
 government and Parliament, and operates within a civil law
 framework with precedents from Roman Law and French and German
 sources. Police practices respect detainees' rights. An
 active and unfettered press functions throughout the country.
 Radio and television are state-operated, and the opposition
 has access to these media, although it complains that the
 access is insufficient. A combination of constitutional
 guarantees and sound administrative practices insure respect
 for human rights in Greece.
 Individual Muslims have occasionally complained of low-level
 administrative discrimination, but there is no evidence of a
 general pattern of abuses or an official policy of political,
 religious, or cultural discrimination against the Muslim
 community.
 A full member of the European Economic Community, Greece is
 classified according to United Nations standards as a
 developed country. Nevertheless, it has some attributes of a
 developing economy and a tradition of state intervention.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In general, the individual is secure in Greece. However, in
 the past few years there have been a number of as yet unsolved
 politically motivated assassinations in Athens, widely
 attributed to Greek and foreign extremists. The "November 17'
 Revolutionary Organization, which claimed the November 1983
 killing of a U.S. Navy Captain and his Greek driver, also took
 credit for the attempted assassination of a U.S. Army sergeant
 in Athens on April 3, 1984. Seven other murders in the past
 year have been attributed to Arab terrorist groups, including
 the assassination of the British Cultural Affairs Officer on
 March 28, 1984. The Greek Government has strongly condemned
 these terrorist acts and has increased security measures, but
 it has made no arrests.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of abduction, secret arrest, or
 clandestine detention during 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution guarantees freedom from torture.
 Prohibitions on torture are generally respected in practice.
 However, Amnesty International recorded in its 1984 report
 
 
 996
 GREECE
 that it had received allegations by foreign and Greek criminal
 prisoners of torture in police stations and prisons in 1983.
 The Ministry of Justice in November 1984 ordered disciplinary
 action and criminal charges against a prison guard charged
 with mistreating prisoners. On November 13, 1984, the
 Parliament passed legislation making the use of torture an
 offense against the State punishable by sentences of from 3
 years to life imprisonment. Waiving the legislation in
 .emergency situations' is expressly forbidden. Physical
 punishments are not administered as sentences for crimes.
 Conditions in prison and detention facilities are
 satisfactory. Adequate health care and diet are provided. No
 distinction according to social class, race, sex, religion, or
 type of conviction is made in the treatment of prisoners.
 Cases requiring medical treatment receive special attention.
 Once sentenced, prisoners may be visited by family members
 three times per week.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the Constitution, and this provision is respected in practice.
 Preventive detention does not exist in Greece. A person
 arrested on warrant or while committing a crime must be
 brought before an examining magistrate within 24 hours and
 charged. This magistrate must issue a warrant of imprisonment
 or order the release of the detainee within 3 days of the
 examination unless special circumstances require a 2-day
 extension of this time limit. The Constitution further states
 that the maximum duration of detention pending trial 'may not
 exceed a period of 1 year in the case of felonies or 6 months
 in the case of misdemeanors.* A decision of a judicial
 council is required to effect extensions of these maximum
 durations (by 6 or 3 months, respectively) in exceptional
 cases. In practice, trials generally take place within
 4 months of the submission of charges. Exile as a judicial
 remedy or government practice does not occur in Greece.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and the
 military. The Constitution states that military courts shall
 have no jurisdiction over civilians. Fair and public trials
 are guaranteed by the Constitution and provided in practice.
 Defense lawyers are available to all accused. Court sessions
 are public unless, as provided in the Constitution, the court
 decides that privacy is required for the protection of
 victims, when juveniles or morals offenses are involved, or in
 matters of national security. This latter provision is not
 abused. There is also a legal provision permitting a closed
 hearing for the sensitive portion of cases dealing with public
 order. In such instances, none of which are known to have
 occurred during the past year, the court by law must publicly
 pronounce its "reasoned decision' on the matters heard
 privately. A defendant may appeal a court verdict to an
 appeals court. A 1983 case involving the trial and sentencing
 of a U.S. serviceman in a manner which did not meet standards
 of due process set forth in the applicable Status of Forces
 Agreement is under review by Greek authorities.
 
 
 GREECE
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home as well as of an individual's
 personal and family life are guaranteed by the Constitution,
 which states 'every person's home is a sanctuary.' The
 personal and daily life of the individual is protected from
 interference. No house search may be made except when and as
 specified by law and always in the presence of representatives
 of the judicial power. These constitutional guarantees are
 respected in practice. Warrants, issued by a district
 attorney (who is considered a judicial officer in Greece) are
 required for an official to enter a private home. No cases
 have been reported in which forced entry has been alleged or
 in which the Government has practiced other violations of the
 home. A constitutional provision requires punishment and
 'liability for full damages to the sufferer" for violations of
 the sanctuary of the home and for the abuse of power. The
 Constitution further guarantees privacy of correspondence and
 communication, and this guarantee has been respected in
 practice in 1984.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is practiced as guaranteed by the
 Constitution, which states that every person may express and
 propagate his thoughts orally, in writing, and through the
 press, with due regard to the laws of the state.
 The Constitution states "the press is free. Censorship and
 all other preventive measures are prohibited." Opposition
 viewpoints are constantly ventilated in the active Greek
 press, and criticism of the Government is unhampered.
 Greece's two television and four radio stations are
 government-owned and operated, and news and information
 programming in particular tends to reflect the political
 perspective of the governing party. Opposition viewpoints are
 aired, although the opposition charges that it is treated
 unfairly by the electronic media. The Constitution allows for
 seizure, by order of the public prosecutor, of publications
 which insult the President, offend religious beliefs, contain
 obscene articles, advocate a violent overthrow of the
 political system, or disclose military and defense
 information. No periodicals or newspapers were seized in
 1984. Greece has strict libel laws. Violations of these laws
 are prosecuted under established legal procedures with the
 safeguards of due process.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the Constitution, which
 states 'Greeks shall have the right to assemble peaceably and
 unarmed.' Limits on outdoor public meetings exist, however,
 if police authorities determine that a serious disturbance of
 social and economic life is threatened. In 1984 no public
 assemblies were prohibited.
 Trade union rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and are
 respected in practice. The right to bargain collectively and
 the right to strike are exercised freely, as is the right to
 associate with international labor bodies. In its 1984
 report, the International Labor Organization's Committee of
 
 
 998
 GREECE
 Experts noted that sections of Greek maritime law continue to
 violate the Convention on the Abolition of Forced Labor, and
 the Committee urged the Government to bring the legislation
 into conformity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The prevailing religion is Eastern Orthodox. The Constitution
 guarantees freedom of religion and prohibits discriminatory
 practices against religious minorities, which in Greece
 include small communities of Muslims, Jews, and non-Orthodox
 Christians.
 The Muslim minority of approximately 120,000 is principally
 located in Thrace in northeastern Greece. The Treaty of
 Lausanne (1923) includes provisions relating to the
 educational and political rights of the Muslim minority, all
 of whom are Greek citizens. Two Muslim members serve in the
 National Parliament, many villages in Thrace regularly elect
 Muslim mayors, and there are over 250 mosques in Greece.
 Members of the Muslim community have occasionally alleged that
 low-level administrative discrimination has occurred in the
 areas of education (including the selection of textbooks and
 teachers), application of tax laws, approval to purchase land
 not owned by Muslims, and the issuance of driver's and
 business licenses. There is no evidence, however, that these
 difficulties reflect a policy of political, religious, or
 cultural repression of the Muslim community. Tensions between
 Greece and Turkey have made each country's perception of the
 treatment of its coreligionists in the other country a highly
 emotional issue, and both countries have viewed human rights
 questions in light of historical and political differences.
 There does not, however, appear to be either a generalized
 pattern of abuses or a policy of official discrimination by
 the Greek Government.
 Greece's small community of Jehovah's Witnesses was affected
 by the provision in the Constitution which states that 'no
 person shall be exempt from discharging his obligations to the
 state or may refuse to comply with laws by reason of his
 religious convictions.* In deference to Jehovah's Witnesses,
 the Government in 1979 modified the compulsory military
 service law to provide for alternative, noncombat service.
 While courts of first instance have, on occasion, handed down
 lengthy sentences to conscientious objectors who refused
 military or alternative service altogether, prison terms are
 sharply reduced in the appellate process. Under the law, a
 conscientious objector can work in conjunction with his prison
 sentence so that, in practice, he does not serve a sentence
 longer than his period of military obligation and could serve
 a shorter period. In its 1984 report, however, Amnesty
 International stated that it had reports of some 200 Jehovah's
 Witnesses imprisoned as conscientious objectors at any given
 time, and that it was working to obtain the release of 15.
 In December 1984, three Protestant missionaries were tried and
 sentenced on charges of proselytizing and causing involuntary
 abandonment of home by a minor. These sentences were
 suspended pending appeal.

 GREECE
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel, and emigration. This right is
 generally respected in practice. Persons intending to
 emigrate and those returning to Greece experience no
 discrimination. The Greek citizenship code authorizes
 expatriation of a citizen of foreign-born parents who is
 residing abroad. Refugees are not forced to return to
 homelands from which they have fled.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which all citizens enjoy
 full political rights, without regard to race, sex, religion,
 or political persuasion. Greek citizens freely choose the
 laws and the officials governing them. The opposition parties
 function freely, have access to the media, and hold public
 meetings.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Greek Government has not objected to visits and.
 investigations by human rights organizations. Freedom House
 regards Greece as 'free.' Amnesty International in its 1984
 report expressed concern about cases of conscientious
 objectors who had been imprisoned, and reported allegations of
 torture which took place in 1983 (see Sections l.c. and 2.c.).
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 A country of just under 10 million people, Greece has a
 relatively high standard of living. Greeks are well-fed: the
 ratio of calorie supply relative to nutritional requirements
 is 136 per cent. Life expectancy at birth is about 74 years.
 The adult literacy rate is 84 per cent for the total
 population, but almost 100 per cent for adults below 55 years
 of age. The infant mortality rate is 13.8 per 1,000 live
 births. The quality and availability of medical care,
 particularly outside the three major cities, is often
 substandard.
 The economy is experiencing problems, as recession and high
 inflation persist. Per capita gross national product (GNP) in
 1984 is estimated at $3,300. The rate of inflation, as
 measured by the consumer price index, is expected to be about
 19 percent for 1984 as a whole, slightly below the 1983 rate.
 This result, however, has been achieved partly through price
 controls. Exchange controls are a common feature of economic
 life. Greece has a tradition of state economic activities,
 and the public sector accounts for over 50 percent of GNP.
 The Greek Government has established a wide range of controls
 on retail and wholesale prices, placed strict limitations on
 the transfer of private capital abroad, rationed credit, and
 restricted the ability of companies to lay off workers.

 GREECE
 Women are guaranteed the same individual, political, and
 social rights as men by the Constitution. Women play an
 active yet still minority role in the political life of the
 country. At present there are 10 women in the 300-member
 Parliament and one woman minister and two deputy ministers in
 the Cabinet. Five of the 44 regional governors are women.
 The position of women in Greek society has undergone rapid
 change in conjunction with the process of industrializaton and
 modernization. The Greek Government has given concerted
 attention to the role of women in Greece and instituted
 significant reforms in marriage, divorce, and property laws.
 Women comprise over one-third of the industrial labor force,
 and the percentage is increasing.
