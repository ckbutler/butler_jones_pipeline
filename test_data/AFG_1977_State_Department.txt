 AFGHANISTAN
 Afghanistan is one of the world's least developed and
 poorest nations. Afghan society is highly conserva-
 tive, Islamic - and traditional. In many areas of the
 country the Government does not exert effective
 control. The country is sharply divided along ethnic
 lines and an Afghan's main loyalties are to his family,
 tribe and ethnic group. Afghanistan successfully
 resisted colonization by the British and consequently
 did not inherit (as did many former British colonies)
 a developed infrastructure, a trained civil service or
 Western parliamentary and legal systems.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Department has little reliable information re-
 garding the use of torture. There are occasional
 charges of torture of both political and ordinary
 criminals, but we have not been able to confirm these
 allegations.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 We have no information on instances of cruel, inhuman
 *or degrading punishment. This year a comprehensive
 penal code containing human rights guarantees was
 prepared and promulgated. This new code supplements
 the traditional mixture of Islamic jurisprudence and
 custom. Prison conditions are not good, but are
 improving as new facilities are constructed.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There have been instances of arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. However, the Department believes the
 Government is trying to investigate cases more fairly
 than in the past. Recently investigative powers were
 transferred from the police to the Ministry of Justice.
 The transfer appears to be working reasonably smoothly
 and has perhaps resulted in fewer arbitrary arrests;

 initially, however, the processing of cases is being
 delayed as the Ministry of Justice endeavors to in-
 crease its staff to handle the additional workload.
 Most of the individuals arrested at the time of the
 1973 coup in which King Zaher was ousted and a Republic
 under President Daoud was established have been re-
 leased, and martial law, which was imposed at that
 time, has been terminated. In 1975, about 20 indivi-
 duals were arrested for plotting the violent overthrow
 of the Government. In July 1977, the Government
 announced that three of these persons had been executed
 following their conviction by martial law courts
 and the remainder were given jail sentences or were
 released.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Individuals accused of offenses related to the security
 or existence of the State are tried in military courts.
 These courts are not open to the public and there is no
 right to counsel, appeal, etc. Individuals accused of
 other offenses are given fair public trials in civilian
 courts with rights to legal counsel, appeal, etc.
 Among the new generation of Afghan judges and prosecu-
 tors are several who have received U.S. legal training
 and employ Western concepts of equity.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Afghanistan is a very traditional, closed and conser-
 vative Moslem society. Most homes are shielded by
 massive walls and the privacy and sanctity of the home
 are sacred tenets. These tenets have been reaffirmed
 in the new Constitution adopted in 1977, and police are
 required to secure proper warrants before making an
 unconsented search of the home.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 .of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Afghanistan's natural resources are limited and only
 22% of the land is arable. Per capita income is about
 $132; life expectancy is only 40 years; approximately
 22% of all new babies die before they are one year old.;
 and less than 10% of the population is literate.
 The new republican government has committed itself
 through the new Seven-Year Plan to a more diversified
 economy, less dependent on agriculture. Creation of
 new industries and public infrastructure projects are
 key elements of the Plan; however, development ex-
 penditures in the social services are projected to more
 than double. Included in this plan are programs
 to:
 -- enhance basic self-sufficiency in cereals production;
 build 76 new basic health centers in addition to
 maintaining the 121 existing basic health centers;
 -- construct 2,800 replacement primary schools, 2,200
 to be located in rural areas. To go along with the
 schools, the Government wishes to train 27,000 new
 primary teachers and to expand enrollment in higher
 education by 38%. The Seven-Year Plan notes that a
 "specific objective" is to help females from the
 provinces to enjoy the benefits of modern education.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The rights of freedom of thought, speech, religion and
 assembly have traditionally been circumscribed in
 Afghanistan through direct and indirect means. The
 press is government-owned. Afghan citizens, from
 
 22-145 0 - 78 - 22
 
 
 330
 indigenous ethnic groups are generally expected to
 adhere to Islam, the designated national religion --
 but minority citizens, such as*Sikhs, Hindus and Jews,
 are permitted to practice their own faiths without any
 interference as-long as they do not proselytize.
 Political assembly is generally permitted only in
 support of the Government. Labor organizations are not
 allowed.
 The advancement of women in the last twenty years has
 been led and inspired by the Government. Legally women
 have the same political, social and economic rights as
 men. There are increasing numbers of women attending
 Kabul University and studying abroad. Many women
 have important government jobs. Many female lawyers
 have been placed in responsible positions in the
 Ministry of Justice, including one judge and several
 prosecutors. However, in rural areas most women are
 still in purdah and many do not attend school; of those
 that do, many drop out early.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Some restrictions on movement within the country exist
 as well as on foreign travel and emigration. Persons
 born as Afghan citizens who have been naturalized in
 other countries may face legal sanctions if they return
 to Afghanistan. Their foreign passports are confis-
 cated and they may be required to perform their mili-
 tary service if they have not already done so.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The new constitution provides for a political system
 with a single-party and single-chamber legislature.
 The charter of "The Party of the National Revolution"
 was proclaimed last August. Elections to the legisla-
 ture will not take place until late 1979. There will
 be no legislature in the interim. It is still too
 early to determine to what extent the process of
 choosing party members or legislators will be democratic.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 So far as we ard aware, no independent outside body has
 sought to investigate alleged human rights violations
 in Afghanistan. The Amnesty International Annual
 Report of 1977 contains the following sentence: "In
 June, 1977 Amnesty International Secretary General
 wrote to President Daoud welcoming the human rights
 provisions embodied in the constitution but expressing
 concern at certain unconfirmed reports of the torture
 of detainees in Afghanistan and seeking further infor-
 mation about how human rights provisions of the new
 constitution would be implemented." We also have not
 been able to confirm reports of torture.
