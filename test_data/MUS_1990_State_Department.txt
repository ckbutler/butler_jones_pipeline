 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius, a parliamentary democracy and a member of the
 Commonwealth of Nations, is governed by an elected prime
 minister, a council of ministers, and a legislative assembly.
 The Governor General, with largely ceremonial powers,
 represents Queen Elizabeth II, the titular Head of State.
 Elections at national and local levels take place at regular
 intervals. There are four major political parties, which
 reflect a range of ideological views, and several smaller
 parties. Executive power has changed hands twice in the last
 8 years through fair and orderly elections supervised by an
 independent commission. Prime Minister Jugnauth's coalition
 had its mandate renewed in general elections in August 1987;
 it was br oadened in July 1990 when he signed an alliance
 agreement with his former opposition, the Mauritian Militant
 Movement (MMM).
 A paramilitary Special Mobile Force of some 1,200 men and a
 240-man Special Support Unit are responsible for internal
 security. These forces, under the command of the Commissioner
 of Police, are apolitical, well trained, and backed by a
 general duty police force of approximately 4,000 men.
 The economy is based on export-oriented manufacturing (mainly
 textiles), sugar, and tourism. In 1989-90 the economy slowed
 as a result, inter alia, of labor and skills shortages, rising
 inflation, and two cyclones, which reduced production in the
 sugar industry.
 The Government continued to demonstrate respect for basic
 human rights. Political and civil rights, including the
 freedoms of speech and press, are protected under the
 Mauritian Constitution and respected in practice. In June the
 Prime Minister established the Garrioch Committee to conduct
 an independent review of several controversial laws generally
 considered to be repressive--the Public Order Act (POA), the
 Industrial Relations Act (IRA), the Newspapers and Periodicals
 Act, and the Criminal Code Amendment Act.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of government-inspired political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of the disappearance of persons for
 political causes.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and inhuman punishment are prohibited by law, and
 there were no reports of degrading treatment or punishment.
 There have been several allegations in the media of police
 mistreatment of suspects, but follow-up investigations failed
 to confirm any abuses.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been no reports of arbitrary arrests or detentions
 since the early 1970's. Detained persons have the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of their detention. In
 practice, this-determination is usually made within 24 hours.
 Bail is commonly granted.
 In the 1989 arrests of Harish Boodhoo, the well-known leader
 of the Mauritian Socialist Party (PSM), and Vedi Ballah, the
 editor of the PSM newspaper, The Socialist, the authorities
 held them for 3 weeks and 1 week respectively before bail was
 granted.   They were charged under the. Public.Order Act with
 giving out false information that could cause a public
 disturbance (see Section l.e.).
 Exile is legally prohibited and not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system, modeled on that of Great Britain,
 consists of the Supreme Court, which has appellate powers, and
 a series of lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the
 Queen's Privy Council in the United Kingdom and is routinely
 made in the cases of death sentences. About 50 percent of
 Supreme Court rulings referred to the Privy Council are
 reversed. There are no political or military courts.
 The Governor General, in consultation with the Prime Minister,
 nominates the Chief Justice and, in. consultation with the
 Chief Justice, nominates the senior puisne (associate)
 judges. The Governor General nominates other judges on the
 advice of the Judicial and Legal Service Commissions. The
 legal system has consistently provided fair, public trials for
 those charged with crimes. Defendants have the right to
 private or court-appointed counsel. The judiciary is also
 charged under the Constitution with ensuring that new laws are
 consistent with democratic practice.
 Recently several prominent legal specialists have been
 critical of government interference in the judicial process
 and have warned against undermining the independence of the
 judiciary. In particular, this criticism coincided with the
 Government's handling of the Boodhoo and Ballah cases.
 There were no political prisoners in Mauritius at year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law and generally
 respected in practice. The search of personal property or
 premises is allowed only under clearly specified conditions by
 court order or by police decision if an illegal act has been
 committed. There have been reports from reliable sources that
 the Government's intelligence apparatus occasionally opens
 mail and carries out surveillance of local opposition leaders
 and other major figures.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is protecied by the Constitution
 and by local tradition. Debate in the Legislative Assembly is
 
 
 244
 MAURITIUS
 lively, and parliamentarians express a variety of views.
 Sixteen privately owned daily, weekly, and monthly newspapers
 present varying political viewpoints and freely express
 partisan views. Newspapers are subject only to the legal
 constraints of libel laws. The Government owns the one
 television and two radio stations (one strictly educational),
 which broadcast in five languages. The television and radio
 tend to be less than objective in news and entertainment
 presentation, and opposition politicians accuse the
 Broadcasting Corporation of political bias in its local news
 coverage. Television and radio broadcasts are also easily
 received from the nearby island of Reunion (a French
 Department) and are not subject to interference by the
 Government. However, any foreign satellite broadcasts or
 programs from foreign sources that are deemed controversial
 are subject to approval by the Council of Ministers before
 transmission on local television or radio.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Mauritians enjoy the right to form associations, including
 political parties, trade unions, and religious organizations,
 although in practice all such organizations need government
 approval in order to operate officially. Mauritius has a
 multitude of such private organizations. Political, cultural,
 and religious assemblies are commonplace.
 Although police permission is required for holding
 demonstrations and mass meetings, such permission is rarely
 refused. The registered political parties freely held large
 public rallies during the campaign for the August 1987 general
 elections, the October 1988 municipal elections, and the June
 1989 La Caverne/Phoenix by-election. Political parties have
 been freely holding political rallies and meetings since
 January in anticipation of new general elections. All have
 been peaceful.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no official state religion in Mauritius, although
 Hindus are a majority. Hindus, Christians, Muslims,
 Buddhists, and others openly practice, teach, and proselytize
 their religions without prejudice. All religious institutions
 receive state subsidies in proportion to their memberships.
 There is no state-sponsored discrimination against any ethnic
 or religious community. The Government facilitates the travel
 of Mauritians who make the hajj. Foreign missionaries are not
 allowed to enter the country without a prior request from a
 local religious organization.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on full freedom of movement within
 the country. Foreign travel and emigration are also
 unrestricted. There is no blanket guarantee of repatriation,
 or general criteria for processing applications for
 repatriation; applications from the thousands of Mauritians
 abroad are handled on a case-by-case and sometimes arbitrary
 basis. This has resurfaced as an issue of political debate as
 more Mauritians abroad seek to reclaim their Mauritian
 citizenship.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Govermment
 Citizens have the right and ability to change their government
 through democratic means. Mauritius is governed by a freely
 elected, unicameral Legislative Assembly, with executive
 direction coming from a Council of Ministers, currently headed
 by Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth, whose Alliance
 coalition won elections in 1983 and 1987. On July 19 the
 Alliance was broadened when Jugnauth signed an electoral
 agreement with the opposition MMM party, which formally
 entered the Government on September 26. The Governor General
 has the right to designate the person charged with forming a
 new government following parliamentary elections or in a
 parliamentary crisis. Parliamentary, municipal, and village
 council elections are held at regular intervals. Voting and
 running for office are rights of al-I citizens 18 years of age
 and over.
 In the Legislative Assembly, 8 of the 70 members are appointed
 through a complex "best loser" system designed in part to
 ensure that all ethnic groups are adequately represented. The
 governing (three-party) Alliance coalition now controls 52 of
 the 70 seats. The four major political parties and the
 smaller parties often match the ethnicity or religion of their
 candidates to the composition of particular electoral
 constituencies. The bMM controls the five major
 municipalities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups monitor developments without
 governmental restriction. There have been no known requests
 by international organizations to investigate human rights
 violations in Mauritius.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although Mauritius has a Hindu majority, the country's active
 press and strongly egalitarian traditions mitigate against
 discrimination in all forms. However, tensions based on
 ethnicity and caste do exist.
 Traditionally, women in Mauritius have occupied a subordinate
 role in society, but the Government has tried to promote
 equality by eliminating various legal restrictions, e.g., in
 laws dealing with emigration and inheritance and, in 1990,
 removing a legal bar to women serving on juries. Nonetheless,
 women still face de facto discrimination, e.g., in education.
 In July 1989, the Government appointed "equal employment
 opportunity officers" in the major ministries to oversee
 women's activities and to ensure that the promotion of the
 interests of women is taken into account.
 According to the Ministry of Women's Rights and Family
 Welfare, physicians, attorneys, and religious and charitable
 organizations, violence against women is prevalent, although
 no reliable statistics are gathered. There are no special
 provisions in Mauritian law concerning family violence.
 Police authorities are generally reluctant to get involved in
 cases of wife beating. Moreover, in June 1989 the Ministry of
 Women's Rights and Family Welfare established a family
 
 
 246
 MAURITIUS
 counseling service, managed by the National Council of Women,
 one of whose principal tasks is to provide counseling and
 legal advice in cases of spouse abuse. Also, a Mauritian
 nongovernmental organization, S.O.S. Women, has recently been
 launched.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Mauritius has an active trade union movement. Almost 300
 unions represent about 100,000 workers, more than one-fourth
 of the work force. Unions are free to organize workers in all
 sectors, .including the export processing zone (EPZ) which
 employs about 90,000 workers, but in practice there are a
 variety of constraints, such as the need to get government
 approval to register new unions and difficult access to EPZ
 workers. Less than 10 percent of EPZ workers are believed to
 be unionized. Unions can press wage demands, establish ties
 to domestic political parties and international organizations,
 and address political issues. Three of the five trade union
 activists who ran in the August 30, 1987, general elections
 were elected to the Legislative Assembly on the government
 slate.
 In theory, unions have the right to strike. However, in labor
 disputes, the Industrial Relations Act (IRA) of 1973 requires
 a prestrike 21-day cooling-off period followed by binding
 arbitration, which has the effect of making most strikes
 illegal. Refusal to follow IRA procedures in a mid-1988
 textile plant strike led to the imprisonment of three union
 leaders for several days. Government-supported
 labor/management negotiations ultimately led to the
 reemployment of most of the striking workers. On March 20,
 the Central Electricity Board Staff Association went on a
 3-day illegal strike which led to the firing of 14 strike
 leaders, the calling in of the Special Mobile Force (SMF) to
 operate the power stations, and the arrival of an Indian team
 to train the SMF. Ultimately, all but the strike leader,
 Pierre Penny, were reemployed.
 One leading federation actively supports the MMM party and is
 affiliated with the Communist-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions. The largest confederation, the Mauritian Labor
 Congress, is a member of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While the right of association is guaranteed by law, the
 collective bargaining process has been distorted in
 Mauritius. The IRA addresses collective bargaining and allows
 it in theory, but in practice its provisions for establishing
 wages bear little resemblance to the traditional collective
 bargaining process, and the Government's restraints on that
 process render it ineffective.
 The Government has established a National Remuneration Board
 (NRB) whose chairman is appointed by the Minister of Labor.
 The NRB establishes minimum wages for 26 categories of private
 sector workers (sugar, tea, transport, etc.) which apply
 equally to workers in the Export Processing Zones (EPZ).
 Although originally established to set minimum wages for
 nonunion workers, the NRB has broadened its powers and now
 issues remuneration orders that establish minimum wages,
 
 
 247
 MAURITIUS
 bonuses, housing and transportation allowances, and other
 benefits for almost all private sector workers. About 85
 percent of all private sector workers (including unionized
 workers) are covered by NRB orders. Employers and unions are
 free to negotiate wages and benefits above the minimums
 established by the NRB, but this is rare.
 Wages and benefits for civil servants are esiablished by the
 Pay Research Bureau (PRB) on the basis of the annual Chesworth
 Report recommendations. NRB remuneration orders set minimum
 wages by sector but also establish a wage structure based on
 length of service and job classification. NRB orders thus set
 wages for skilled and experienced workers whose earnings are
 well above the minimum wage. The PRB functions in a similar
 way for the civil service.
 The Government has also established a tripartite committee,
 including employer and trade union representatives, which
 meets once a year and is chaired by the Minister of Finance.
 It may recommend only wage increases based on inflation. Its
 recommendations are not always unanimous, however, and the
 Government makes its decision on the basis of all the
 information it receives.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of
 Experts (COE) again in 1990 noted that the IRA does not give
 workers' organizations sufficient protection against acts of
 interference as provided for by ILO Convention 98 on the right
 to organize and collective bargaining. The Garrioch Committee
 established by the Prime Minister in June is reviewing the IRA
 and has asked for recommendations from trade unions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and is not
 practiced. The COE, however, noted again in 1990 that
 sections of the IRA, which empower the Minister of Labor to
 refer any industrial dispute to compulsory arbitration,
 enforceable by penalties involving compulsory labor, are in
 conflict with ILO Convention 105 on the abolition of forced
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum work age for employment of children is 15. The
 Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing child labor
 laws. In practice, there is minimal enforcement of these
 laws, especially in EPZ-related industries where a labor
 shortage exists.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Conditions of employment, including wage and leave conditions,
 are generally sufficient to afford an acceptable standard of
 living for workers in the agricultural, service, and
 manufacturing sectors. However, the current statutory rate
 paid for unskilled labor, $12 per week during the first year
 and $14 per week thereafter, is barely sufficient to provide a
 worker with a minimum standard of living, and much depends on
 the additional benefits offered. The Government mandates
 minimum wage increases each year based on inflation.
 A maximum workweek of 45 hours is allowed. Excessive overtime
 continues to be a problem in the EPZ. Following complaints
 that EPZ employers imposed long hours of overtime on
 
 
 248
 MAURITIUS
 employees--about 10 to 20 hours per week, making for a 55- to
 65-hour workweek--the Government established a committee to
 address these issues, but by the end of 1990 it still had
 issued no report. In addition, some EPZ employers still
 require women to work at night.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, and
 conditions are inspected by Ministry of Labor officials.
 Enforcement is minimal and ineffective due to the small number
 of inspectors.
