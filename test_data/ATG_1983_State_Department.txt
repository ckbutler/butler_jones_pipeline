 Antigua and Barbuda, which celebrated its second anniversary of
 independence from the United Kingdom on November 1, 1983, has a
 multi-party parliamentary system of government based on
 majority rule. It is a member of the British Commonwealth.
 Observance of human rights practices, mandated by law, are
 reinforced by the democratic political values and traditions
 that evolved prior to independence.
 The Constitution established a parliamentary system of
 government for the islands of Antigua and Barbuda, with
 elections at least every five years. The present Government
 was formed by the leaders of the Antigua Labor Party, which won
 a large majority in free elections held in April 1980. The
 Prime Minister is Vere C. Bird, Sr. One of his sons is the
 Deputy Prime Minister and another is the National Security
 .Advisor. The opposition energetically attacks the Bird
 Government, in particular about corruption. Separatist feeling
 in the smaller Island of Barbuda (with 2,000 of the country's
 entire population of 81,000) remains a problem with which the
 Government must deal.
 Security forces consist of the police and a small infantry
 unit, the Antigua Defense Force. The police are organized,
 trained, and managed along British lines. The security forces
 generally have a good reputation for respecting human rights in
 law enforcement.
 The country's political development has continued along
 democratic lines. Its population has a literacy rate of 88
 percent, supports democratic values and practices, and can
 express dissent openly, aided by a free press.
 The country is still developing economically, and poverty is
 widespread despite active development efforts centered on
 increasing investment. Although the State holds equity in some
 enterprises, the private sector is strong and individuals are
 free to pursue private interests and hold private property.
 Political opponents of Bird complain, however, that their
 businesses have suffered from government retaliation for their
 political activities
 In 1983, the state of human rights in this newly independent
 democracy continued to be good.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 No instances of political killing were reported in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances, extra-legal detentions or
 politically-motivated abductions were reported in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 
 (443)
 
 
 444
 There are constitutional prohibitions against torture and cruel
 or inhuman treatment of prisoners or detainees, which are
 respected in practice. Prison conditions are adequate.
 Regular visits by a prisoner's family and attorney are
 permitted as are visits by members of the clergy.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and detention is constitutionally prohibited.
 The right of habeas corpus is legally guaranteed, and anyone
 detained must be brought before a court within 48 hours. There
 have been no reported cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Accused persons are guaranteed a fair', open, and public trial.
 The judiciary is independent and is widely respected for its
 fairness and professionalism. The highly regarded regional
 West Indies Court of Appeal serves Antigua and Barbuda.
 Persons without means to retain a private attorney are
 guaranteed legal assistance at government expense.
 There are no political prisoners in Antigua and Barbuda.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Arbitrary police or government actions against a person's home,
 family, or privacy have not been reported in Antigua and
 Barbuda. A warrant must be obtained prior to the initiation of
 any search of private premises. There have been charges of
 mail tampering from left-wing elements, but no evidence has
 been produced and no cases brought to court.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press, and other
 forms of communication. Each of the four political parties in
 Antigua and Barbuda has an affiliated newspaper. Opposition
 party papers are openly critical of the Government. Religious
 organizations also publish their own newspapers. In addition,
 international news publications are readily available. The
 Government owns the radio and television service, and there is
 a privately owned radio station. Opposition politicians have
 charged that the Government-operated stations are biased toward
 the Government's perspective. They also complain that they
 have almost no access to air time in order to present their own
 positions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures the right of peaceful assembly.
 Public meetings and organized demonstrations are held without
 interference from police or government. While organized labor
 membership is not widespread, organized labor frequently holds
 large demonstrations to draw attention to its demands. Unions
 are free to organize, bargain, and strike in order to improve
 the economic situation of workers. Although the two major
 labor unions have been associated with specific political
 parties, in late 1983 discussions were underway to explore the
 
 
 445
 creation of an umbrella organization that would unite all of
 the unions into a confederation of workers. Government leaders
 have spoken out against this proposal. Unions are free to
 affiliate with international labor bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The free exercise of religious beliefs is fundamental in
 Antiguan life- While the population is overwhelmingly
 Protestant, adherents to other religious denominations
 proselytize openly without stigma or government interference.
 Foreign members of the Bahai faith, however, claim they have
 been warned to refrain from involvement in politics and to
 limit their evangelical activities, or risk the revocation of
 work permits and residency status. The evidence indicates that
 this harassment probably results from the prejudices of
 individual officials involved. The Ministry of Legal Affairs
 and the Office of the Attorney General say that they will
 monitor the situation and respond to any complaints.
 Members of the small Rastafarian cult also have complained of
 harassment, resulting in part from their reputation for using,
 cultivating, and selling marijuana. Most of those subjected-to
 police searches for drug dealers and smugglers have been
 Rastafarians.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on the movement of citizens within
 Antigua and Barbuda. Travel outside the country is generally
 unrestricted, although a few political opponents of the Bird
 Government have had their passports confiscated to ensure their
 attendance at legal proceedings which they claimed were
 politically motivated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Antigua and Barbuda has a multi-party political system, which
 accommodates widely divergent views. All citizens, 18 years of
 age and older, may vote if registered. Individual parties
 conduct voter registration drives free from Government
 interference. The Government is obligated, by law, to hold
 voter registration during a fixed period each year.
 The present Government was elected by an overwhelming majority
 of voters in 1980 and won all but four of the 17 constituencies
 contested. Recently, the ruling party and the opposition
 parties have organized rallies in preparation for the next
 elections, which must take place before April 1985.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Internationally recognized human rights organizations have not
 expressed particular interest in Antigua and Barbuda; there
 have been no requests for investigations or inquiries into
 alleged violations. The Government is sensitive to human
 rights issues, and it has joined international condemnation of
 human rights abuses elsewhere, especially those in South Africa
 and Central America.
 
 
 446
 Amnesty International did not mention Antigua and Barbuda in
 its 1983 report. Freedom House describes the country as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Tourism dominates the Antiguan economy. Latest figures
 indicate that half of the country's Gross Domestic Product
 (GDP) is derived directly or indirectly from tourism. There
 has been little growth in the economy over the past two years.
 The GDP was estimated at about $124.5 million annually in 1981
 or approximately $1,640 per capita.
 In 1967, when Antigua and Barbuda became semi-autonomous,
 agriculture was replaced with other economic activity and the
 countryside continues to lose its population to the city. As a
 result, agriculture accounts for less than 15 percent of the
 GDP. Government is now promoting a "back to the land"
 movement, providing financial incentives to young men and women
 willing to work in the agricultural sector.
 Manufacturing accounts for another 15 percent of GDP, but
 recent economic decisions by other Caribbean Community members
 have limited growth in this sector. Factory closings and
 bankruptcies have led to increased unemployment and government
 budgetary shortfalls as tax revenues from this source dry up.
 Efforts to attract foreign investors continue, but the primary
 problem remains the identification of potential foreign markets
 for domestically manufactured goods.
 The Government has continued its capital development program
 for education and health. Adult literacy approaches 90
 percent, and enrollment of eligible children in primary schools
 has risen to 85 percent since 1981. The Government has
 earmarked funds to upgrade secondary and higher education.
 Infant mortality has dropped to 31 per thousand live births.
 Antigua and Barbuda's annual rate of population growth is
 nearly 1.5 percent.
 There are no legal restrictions on the role of women in Antigua
 and Barbuda. The traditional perception of women's role,
 particularly in rural areas, confines them to home and family,
 but this is changing. The Government has instituted programs,
 including the enhancement of educational opportunities for both
 sexes and family planning, which are expected to lead to
 further opportunities for women.
 Currently, the Government of Antigua has a female senator, the
 highest ranking female political figure in the country. The
 permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health and the Chief
 Establishment Officer (equivalent to a director of personnel
 for the entire government) are female. A female also heads the
 Department of Tourism. There is a "woman's desk" in the
 Government to monitor complicance with the laws and statutes
 regarding women and to safeguard their legal rights. Ninety
 percent of the assistance permanent secretaries in the
 Government are women. Six out of ten personnel in the Civil
 Service of Antigua are women. Women receive equal pay for
 equal work by law.
