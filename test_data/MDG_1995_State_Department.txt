 MADAGASCAR
 Madagascar's transition from the 16-year authoritarian Socialist rule of Didier
 Ratsiraka officially ended in 1993 with the fair election of Albert Zafy as President
 and the selection of Francisque Ravony as Prime Minister by the National Assem-
 bly. Under the 1992 Constitution, power is divided between the President, the Prime
 Minister and his Government, and the National Assembly. A number of institutions
 provided by the new Constitution, including an upper house (Senate) of the National
 Assembly had not been established by year's end. However, communal elections,
 which are a necessary first step toward the creation of the Senate, took place on
 November 5. Departmental and regional elections, which must also precede a senate
 election, are scheduled to take place in 1996, although no date had yet been set.
 Relations between the President and the Prime Minister deteriorated amid
 charges of corruption and mismanagement of the economy, forcing a realignment of
 parties in the National Assembly and a national referendum-called by President
 afy-to amend the Constitution. Malagasy voters strongly supported increased
 presidential powers during the September 17 referendum, which was conducted in
 a free and fair manner. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers resigned
 in October, opening the way for President Zafy to name Emmanuel Rakotovahiny
 as Prime Minister, along with a new cabinet.
 In August the Government increased civilian control over the military through the
 passage of a new defense law. The law established a new cabinet-level policy body,
 the High Council of Defense, chaired by the President, and an Interministerial De-
 fense Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, to carry out the decisions of the
 High Council. After allowing the forces to shrink gradually, the Government has
 stabilized the overall size of the military at about 21,000 (13,000 military, 8,000
 gendarmes). There were occasional reports that police committed human rights
 abuses and many reports of abuses by village-level law enforcement groups.
 The Government has established targets for improved economic management, re-
 duced government expenditures, and increased revenues. Although some of these
 targets Were met, the country's overall economic performance was mixed. Living
 standards remained extremely low, and purchasing power continued to erode. Per
 capita gross domestic product was estimated at $230 for 1994. In early 1995, infla-
 tion was progressing at an annual rate of 60 percent, but with stricter economic
 management, including tighter control over the money supply, the inflation rate de-
 clined considerably by the end of the year. The economy remains highly dependent
 on agriculture. Primary commodities such as shrimp, vanilla, and coffee did rel-
 atively well, and rice production, the major staple, increased over previous years.
 Tourism also increased as did manufacturing in the export processing zones. The
 smuggling of vanilla, gold, precious stones, and cattle continued to be a major con-
 cern as did the rise in criminal activity. Unemployment and underemployment also
 remained serious problems, especially among those under 25, who comprise about
 60 percent of the population.
 The human rights situation remained the same. There was a notable absence of
 political violence, despite demonstrations and heated political rivalry between sup-
 porters of the President and then Prime Minister Ravony. However, there continued
 to be human rights abuses in the law enforcement and judicial systems. There were
 occasional reports of police brutality against suspects and detainees as well as in-
 stances of arbitrary arrest and detention. Prison conditions are harsh and life
 threatening, and in some prisons women may experience physical abuse, including
 
 
 rape. The authorities took no actions to relieve the overburdened court system. As
 a result, suspects continued to be incarcerated for lengthy pretrial periods, often ex-
 ceeding the maximum penalty for the alleged offense. A magistrates' strike over ju-
 dicial independence exacerbated this situation. Traditional- local law enforcement
 groups ("dina") carried out their own brand of summary justice. Women continued
 to face societal discrimination.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings by government forces. However, harsh prison conditions resulted in an un-
 known num er of deaths (see Section 1.c.). Also, to combat rising crime village-level
 dina continued to mete out justice, including summary executions (see Section i.e.).
 In addition, citizen mobs took summary action against suspected thieves in
 Antananarivo and elsewhere, resulting in severe injury or death to the suspects.
 The official investigation into the 1994 beatingdeath of radio journalist Victor
 Randrianirina, allegedly for his reporting on sapphire smuggling in Madagascar, re-
 mained open, but the authorities made no arrests and issuedno statements.
 Similarly, despite commitments by the Government that those responsible for
 1991-93 incidents, in which security forces killed or injured unarmed civilians,
 would be brought to trial, there was visible progress in only one case. The authori-
 ties tried in a civilian court the 14 soldiers arrested in April 1993 for alleged in-
 volvement in politically motivated violence in Antsiranana; several received prison
 sentences of varying length while others were acquitted. The Government has not
 reported on or made arrests in a case involving the deaths of more than 30 dem-
 onstrators who were killed by then president Ratsiraka's guards at the Iavoloha pal-
 ace on August 10, 1991. A formal commission named in 1994 to investigate this inci-
 dent did not hold hearings during the year. Nor was progress made in the investiga-
 tion of the March 31, 1992, incident in which soldiers killed six pro-Ratsiraka sup-
 porters at the National Forum (Constitutional Convention).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no permanent disappearances and no acknowl-
 edged cases of unsolved abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person. However, there were
 occasional reports of police or other forces mistreating prisoners or detainees. There
 were also isolated instances of dina-sponsored trials in which torture was used to
 solicit confessions from criminal suspects.
 Prison conditions are harsh and life threatening; government officials acknowl-
 edge that a serious situation exists. The diet provided is inadequate, and family
 members must provide or augment inmates' daily food rations. Prisoners without
 relatives nearby sometimes go for days without food. Each prisoner has on averge
 less than 1 square meter of space. The prison population, estimated at 22,000, suffer
 a wide range of medical problems that are not routinely treated, including malnutri-
 tion, infections, malaria, and tuberculosis. These conditions have resulted in an un-
 known number of deaths.
 Women in prison suffer abuses, as do the children who are sometimes confined
 with them. Gender segregation is not absolute, and there were some reported cases
 of rape. The Government permits prison visits by the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC), religious and charitable organizations, and a Malagasy legal
 association investigating abuses of pretrial detention. As a result of the access to
 prisons afforded to the media, a photographic exhibition on prison conditions was
 9eld.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Eile.-The Constitution provides for due process
 for accused persons, but in practice the authorities do not always respect these
 rights, frequently failing to observe legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and de-
 tention. In particular, excessive pretrial detention of the accused results in the de-
 nial of due process.
 According to the law, a criminal suspect must be charged, bound over, or released
 within 3 days after arrest. An arrest warrant may be obtained but is not always
 required. According to the Penal Code, defendants in ordinary criminal cases have
 the right to be informed of the charges against them, must be charged formally
 within the specified time frame, and must be allowed access to an attorney. Court
 appointed counsel is provided for indigents accused of crimes which carry a mini-
 mum 5-year jail sentence.
 Bail may be requested by the accused or by his attorney immediately after arrest,
 after being formally charged, or during the appeal process, but it is rarely granted
 at any stage for violent crimes.
 
 
 Approximately 70 percent of the estimated 22,000 prisoners were in pretrial de-
 tention. Despite existing legal protections, the average pretrial detention time often
 exceeds 1 year, and 3 or 4 years of detention is common, even for crimes for which
 the maximum penalty may be 2 years or less. Prisoners may wait years in prison
 only to be found not guilty. A Catholic nongovernmental organization (NGO), the
 Aumonerie Catholique, in conjunction with a lawyers association, intervened on be-
 half of a number of detainees and won release for 36 persons.
 Although the law allows prisoners to sue the Government for damages in unlaw-
 ful detention, it virtually never occurs. By law, persons suspected of activity against
 the State may be detained incommunicado for 15 days, subject to indefinite exten-
 sion if considered necessary by the Government; however, this provision is used in-
 fovernmentdoes not use forced exile as a means of plitical control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The 1992 Constitution provides for an independ-
 ent judiciary; however, implementing legislation to define the rights and responsibil-
 ities of the judiciary had not beenpassed by year's end, due in part to President
 Zafy's narrow interpretation of the degree of autonomy for the magistracy called for
 in the Constitution. This controversy led to an effective nationwide magistrates
 strike starting in January, with the magistrates subsequently providing only the
 "minimum service" necessary to ensure public security. In February the President
 onvoked an extraconstitutional '"Tational Forum," to debate legal reform. Since the
 magistrates refused to participate, the Forum was unable to reach consensus, al-
 though it did press the National Assembly to vote against geater pwers for the
 judiciary. The strike continued until August. Meanwhile, the National Assembly re-
 viewed draft legislation to define better the responsibilities and powers of the mag-
 istracy but deferred action until 1996. Although no precise statistics are available,
 the magistrates' strike contributed to an increased backlog of cases in an already
 overcrowded docket.
 The judiciary has three levels of courts: lower courts for civil and criminal cases
 carrying limited fines and sentences; the Court of Appeals, which includes a crimi-
 nal court for cases carrying sentences of 5 years or more; and the Supreme Court.
 The judiciary also has special courts designed to handle specific kinds of cases (e.g.,
 cattle rusting) under the jurisdiction oft te higher courts. The Constitutional High
 Court is a separate and autonomous body which reviews laws, decrees, and ordi-
 nances, and certifies election results.
 In the absence of reform, the judiciary remained under the aegis of the Ministry
 of Justice. The lack of internal controls and relatively low salaries for magistrates
 encourage corruption, although the Government began to address the problem by re-
 vising outdated and unevenly apportioned housing allowances. Trials are public, and
 defendants have the right to an attorney, to be present at the trial, to confront wit-
 nesses, and to present evidence. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence under
 the Penal Code.
 The right of traditional institutions at the village level to take measures to protect
 property and public order is specified in the 1992 Constitution, as well as in earlier
 laws. The traditional dina handle civil matters within and between villages and also
 operate in some urban areas. In practice, the dina are increasingly being used in
 criminal cases because of rising crime, the physical isolation of many rural areas,
 and practical inadequacies of the formal police and judicial systems. The Govern-
 ment began an effort in late 1995 to combat crime and insecurity in isolated rural
 regions by reinforcing the law enforcement role of the army and the gendarmerie.
 Dina punishments can be severe, in some cases including capital punishment. A
 study being prepared by a Malagasy Lawyers Association for publication in 1996
 found more than a dozen instances of execution following dina trials, usually for cat-
 tle theft.
 In November 1994, the National Assembly formally recognized the role of the dina
 in reducing crime and insecurity; it passed legislation giving dina verdicts the same
 weight as judgments handed down by lower courts and increasing fines and prison
 sentences to those refusing to abide by dina decisions. However, this legislation re-
 mained under review by the Constitutional Court at year's end and had not yet en-
 tered into force. Decisions by dina are not subject to codified due-process protections,
 but, in some instances, they can be challenged at the appeals court level. Some
 cases have also been referred to the attention of the Office of the Mediator (ombuds-
 man), which investigates and may seek redress from formal judicial authorities.
 Military courts have some jurisdiction over cases involving national security, such
 as acts constituting a threat to the nation and its political leaders, invasion by for-
 eign forces, and riots that could lead to overthrow of the Government. Military
 courts, like civilian courts, provide for a process to reexamine interpretations of the
 
 
 152
 law rather than the facts of the case. They are presided over by a civilian mag-
 istrate who is joined on the bench by military officers.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. However, there are approximately 25
 self-proclaimed political prisoners, all civilians, who were convicted for their roles
 in the politically motivated violence in Antsiranana in late 1992 and early 1993.
 f. Arbitrary interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 home is inviolable by tradition and law, and the State does not intervene in the pri-
 vate lives of the people. The law requires judicially issued warrants to search
 houses, but there were reportedly some instances of search without proper warrants.
 One newsmagazine reported that the Government had increased the monitoring of
 mail and correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, communication, and press and forbids press censorship. The Government gen-
 erally respected these provisions in practice. People generally spoke freely, and de-
 bate in the National Assembly was open and lively. The print media openly criti-
 cized both the Government and the opposition. Opposition groups, trade unions, pro-
 fessional associations, and private citizens have regular access to the press.
 Some journalists, however, although in decreasing numbers, continue to practice
 self-censorship fearing reprisals from the Government or others for aggressive inves-
 tigative reporting. Journalists rarely cite the names of sources, in part because Mal-
 agasy culture aspires to be nonconfrontational, and in part because journalists do
 not believe they can count on effective backing by their editors and publishers in
 case of a lawsuit. There is also a persistent reluctance by government officials and
 others to share information with the press.
 State-owned radio and television are the most important means of reaching the
 public and continued to feature discussion programs and debates on topics of public
 policy, although it rarely included editorial comnment. Malagasy television broad-
 casts network news from France via satellite each evening. There is one private tel-
 evision station in the capital, and licenses have been granted for two others. English
 and French language television stations are available via cable in the capital or sat-
 ellite dish throughout the country. Along with state radio, there are seven private
 radio stations in the capital area and a number of others in provincial cities which
 cover political subjects and are sometimes critical of the Government.
 Although a law dating from the previous Republic requires Ministry of Interior
 approval for films and videotapes shown in public, in practice this regulation is
 rarely enforced.
 There were no reports of threats to academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peacefid Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these freedoms, but there are some legal restrictions. Municipal permits, usually
 granted, are required before holding public meetings but may be denied if govern-
 ment officials believe that the meeting poses a threat to the State, endangers na-
 tional security, or significantly encumbers public thoroughfares. Officially estab-
 lished security zones are off-limits to demonstrators. The proliferation of political
 and nongovernmental organizations continued and is indicative of recent relaxations
 on free association rights. There are more than 60 political parties and some 900
 NGO's.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Missionaries and clergy are permitted
 to operate freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, and the Govern-
 ment places no formal restrictions on travel within or outside the country. However,
 domestic security concerns do effectively restrict travel in some places, especially at
 night. Malagasy and foreign residents require exit visas issued by the Ministry of
 Interior, but these visas are almost never refused unless the person is involved in
 legal proceedings.
 The Government generally cooperates closely with the United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Refugees in processing a small number of refugees or asylum seekers.
 However, the Government has failed to resolve the status of approximately 127
 Ethiopian asylum seekers, who have been in Madagascar for several years. There
 are several refugees from Zaire and Sudan. There were no reports of forced expul-
 sion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right. In 1993 Madagascar concluded more than 2 years of po-
 litical transition which were initiated by largely peaceful mass demonstrations
 against the previous regime of Didier Ratsiraka in 1991. Albert Zafy was elected to
 a 5-year term in 1992, and 138 members of the National Assembly were chosen for
 4-year terms in 1993 in generally free and fair elections, by direct universal suffrage
 and secret ballot.
 Under the Constitution, the President has primary responsibility for national de-
 fense and foreign policy while the Prime Minister is Head of Government and has
 primary responsibility for domestic policy. During the year political tensions be-
 tween the President and the Prime Minister continued; in July the President's sup-
 porters a ain brought unsuccessfully a motion of censure against the Prime Min-
 ister in the National Assembly, which, if the motion had passed, would have re-
 quired him to resign. In turn, some National Assembly supporters of the Prime Min-
 ister threatened, but did not carry out, impeachment proceedings against the Presi-
 dent.
 As a result of this political dispute, the President called a national referendum
 for September 17, to empower him to name the Prime Minister and the Council of
 Ministers directly. The President's proposal won 62 percent of the vote, although
 there was a high rate of abstention. Prime Minister Ravony resigned in October
 after the official results were published. President Zafy selected Emmanuel
 Rakotovahiny from among candidates proposed by each bloc in the National Assem-
 bly and subsequently approved the new Council of Ministers named by the new
 Prime Minister.
 The Constitution calls for the Prime Minister to be appointed every 4 years when
 a new National Assembly is elected, or upon vacancy. The Constitution gives the
 President, acting in conjunction with the Council of Ministers, the right to dissolve
 the National Assembly if there have been two governmental crises in the previous
 18 months. The High Constitutional Court must rule on what constitutes a crisis.
 The Prime Minister is required to submit his resignation (as must the Cabinet) if
 a motion of censure is passed by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly.
 The creation of the Senate moved forward with the holding of communal elections
 on November 5. Departmental and regional elections, which must also precede a
 senate election, are scheduled to take place in 1996, although no date had been set
 by yeaes end.
 There are no legal restrictions against women participating in politics, but in
 practice men dominate the political process. Only one ministerial position was held
 by a woman in the second and third Ravony cabinets, and women hold only 6 per-
 cent of the legislative seats. However, in the judiciary women have significantly
 higher representation.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 By law, human rights groups are considered to be political groups and must reg-
 ister with the Government. Some nongovernmental human rights groups exist and
 are increasingly active, for example in such issues as defending press freedoms.
 They have been joined by civic education organizations that have much the same
 agenda.
 The Constitution provides for the establishment of an independent organization
 charged with promoting and protecting human rights. In 1994 the National Assem-
 bly designated the Ofice of the Mediator (ombudsman) to assume that constitu-
 tional role. This action reversed an earlier decision by the Ravony government to
 abolish the mediator on the grounds that it was redundant given the President's
 constitutional role as the public arbiter in matters of government administration.
 The power of the Office of the Mediator rests on moral suasion. The Office of the
 Mediator published annual reports in 1994 and 1995 on its activities and has pro-
 duced and distributed a brochure to inform the public of its role.
 While slow to carry out investigations of major cases of violence, notably the Au-
 gust 1991 killings at Iavoloha palace, the Government did not penalize or repress
 anyone for criticizing its human rights record (see Section L.a.).
 The Government is open to visits by international human rights groups and to
 the presence of domestic and international election observers, although no foreign
 groups applied to observe the referendum. United Nations organizations, including
 the International Labor Organization (ILO), operated freely and extensively in
 Madagascar.
 
 
 154
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits all forms of discrimination and groups that advocate
 ethnic or religious segregation. However, there are no specific government programs
 to enforce antidiscrimination provisions.
 Women.-According to varous sources, including magistrates, journalists, and
 women doctors, violence against women is not widespread. In the rare cases where
 physical abuse is detected, police and legal authorities do intervene, although there
 is no law dealing specifically with violence against women, except in cases of rape.
 Spouses can be tried for nonrape abuses, generally under civil law. Some women
 prisoners have been victims of rape.
 Despite constitutional prohibitions, there is societal discrimination against
 women although less so in urban areas where women have an important, if second-
 ary, role in the business and economic life of the country, with many of them man-
 aging or owning businesses or filling management positions in state industries.
 However, women in rural areas face greater hardship, bearing the responsibilities
 of raising a family while also engaging in farm labor or other subsistence activities.
 Under a 1990 conjugal law, wives have an equal say in choosing where a married
 couple will reside, and they receive generally equitable distribution of marital prop-
 erty in instances of divorce. Widows inherit one-half ofjoint marital wealth. In prac-
 tice, some parts of the island still observe a tradition known as "the customary
 third" whereby the wife has a right to only a third of a couple's joint holdings. How-
 ever, a widow receives a pension, and a widower does not.
 Children.-While official expenditures on children's welfare are low, the Govern-
 ment has decided to maintain spending by the Ministries of Health and Education
 at current levels despite an overall climate of increasing budget austerity. These lev-
 els are insufficient, however, to halt the decline of public services in the high-infla-
 tion environment. There is no pattern of official or societal abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-Physically disabled people are not subject to discrimina-
 tion in education and in the provision of other state services, but neither are they
 the beneficiaries of special enabling or protecting legislation. The Government has
 not enacted legislation or otherwise provided for accessibility to buildings and trans-
 portation for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Mfmorities.-Madagascar is inhabited by over 12 million
 people. The Malagasy are of mixed Malayo-Polynesian and African origins and are
 made up of 18 distinct groups based on regional and ancestral affiliation. Although
 there are some linguistic differences among them, nearly all speak Malagasy, which
 is of Malayo-Polynesian origin. None of these groups constitutes a majority of the
 ppulation.
 Long-term historical processes of military conquest, ethnic domination, and politi-
 cal consolidation, however, have traditionally raised the political and economic sta-
 tus of highland ethnic groups of Asian origin over that of coastal groups of more
 African descent. The centralized planned economy of the previous regime reinforced
 the concentration of economic and political power in the highland, capital area. This
 policies have contributed to ethnic tensions between the two groups. Ethnic or re-
 gional solidarity may also be a determining factor in hiring practices.
 An Indo-Pakistani community of about 20,000, primarily engaged in commerce,
 has been in Madagascar since the early part of this century. Few, however, have
 been able to obtain Malagasy citizenship, since it is customarily bestowed matrilin-
 eally through native Malagasy women. The Indo-Pakistanis are frequent targets of
 mistrust and criticism, and their shops have often been targets of violent attack
 during civil disturbances. There were several reported instances of wealthy Indo-
 Pakistani businessmen or their family members being kidnaped and held for ran-
 son.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Citizens in both the public and private sectors have
 the right by law (the 1995 Labor Code-passed by the National Assembly in 1994,
 approved by the High Constitutional Court in 1995-and the 1992 Constitution) and
 in practice to establish and join labor unions of their own choosing without prior
 authorization. However, essential service workers, including police and military,
 may not form unions. Unions are required to register with the Government, and reg-
 istration is routinely granted. About 80 percent of the labor force of 5 million is
 agrarian. Unionized labor accounts for only about 5 percent of wage labor.
 There are a number of trade union federations, and many are affiliated with polit-
 ical parties. In practice, however, formal public and private sector unions have not
 played a major role politically or economically in recent years. The Government ex-
 ercised very limited control over organized labor.
 
 
 155
 
 The new 1995 Labor Code and the new Constitution provide for the right to
 strike, including in export processing ("free trade") zones. Those groups providing
 essential services-police, fire fighters, hospital workers-have only a limited right
 to strike. Labor unions fear that the 1995 Code could have the practical effect of
 discouraging strikes due to the mandatory requirement to first exhaust conciliation,
 mediation, and arbitration procedures. However, the new law was not used in 1995
 as a significant deterrent to legally called strikes.
 In addition to the magistrates' strike (see Section i.e.), there were strikes by the
 employees of the Ministry of Higher Education, two banks, an insurance company,
 and several state-owned organizations, and by university professors. There were
 also brief work stoppages (usually not exceeding 2 days) in several ministries, by
 staff members in the National Assembly, and in hospitals in the capital and else-
 where. For example, there was a work stoppage and blockade in the central market
 area of the capital in response to police efforts to enforce licensing and sanitary
 laws. Laws and regulations prohibit retribution against strikers who adhere to legal
 procedures governing strikes. In 1995 a court ruled in favor of employees of one firm
 who alleged that they had been discharged in retribution for a legal strike.
 Unions may and do freely affiliate with and participate in international bodies
 and may form federations or confederations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain CollectiBely.-Both the Labor Code and the
 Constitution provide for the right to bargain collectively. The Code states that col-
 let ive bargaining may be undertaken between management and labor at either par-
 ty's behest. Collective bargaining agreements exist but are not common, and the
 Government is often involved in the bargaining process, in part because of the large
 number of unionized employees in the public sector. The minimum wage is set by
 the Government. Other wages are set by employers with individual employees,
 sometimes below the minimum wage. When there is a failure to reach agreement,
 the Ministry of Labor convenes a committee of employment inspectors who attempt
 to resolve the matter. If this process fails, the committee refers the matter to the
 chairman of the Court of Appeals for final arbitration. No such cases reached the
 Court of Appeals in 1995.
 The Labor Code prohibits discrimination by employers against organizers, union
 members, and unions. In the case of antiunion activity, the union or its members
 may file a petition in civil court challenging the employer. Labor laws apply uni-
 formly throughout the country, including in free trade zones. However, the Govern-
 ment has difficulty enforcing labor laws and regulations due to lack of basic re-
 sources. Ministry of Labor inspectors, who number only 27, visit industrial work
 sites with some regularity but mostly in the capital region.
 There are several export processing zones (EPZ's). Firms in the EPZ's are re-
 quired to follow all existing labor laws, including minimum wage laws, for their in-
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Foiced labor is explicitly prohib-
 ited by the Labor Code and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code describes a child
 as any person under the age of 18. The legal minimum age for employment is 14
 years, and the use of child labor is prohibited at sites where there is apparent and
 imminent danger. The Government tries to enforce these child labor laws in the
 small formal employment sector through inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Security. However, in the large subsistence sector, many young children work
 with their parents on family farms at much earlier ages. Similarly, in the urban
 areas many children earn money by hawking parking spaces, newspapers or other
 wares, and by carrying water and begging.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code and its implementing legisla-
 tion prescribe the working conditions and wage scales for employees, which are en-
 forced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. The law distinguishes between
 agricultural and nonagricultural work.
 There are several a~ministratively determined minimum wage rates in Madagas-
 car, depending upon skill levels, starting at $25 (110,550 Malagasy francs) a month
 for unskilled workers. This wage is inadequate to ensure a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family, and workers must supplement their incomes through sub-
 sistence agriculture, petty trade, or reliance on the extended family structure. Given
 insufficient enforcement measures, official wage rates are sometimes ignored as
 high unemployment and extreme poverty lead workers to accept salaries below the
 legal minimum.
 There is a 40-hour workweek in nonagricultural and service industries and a
 42 2-hour workweek in agricultural industries. There are also provisions for holiday
 pay, sick and maternity leave, and insurance.
 
 
 The Labor Code sets rules and standards concerning building and work safety,
 machinery, weight-lifting limits, and sanitation. Ministry of Civil Service, Adminis-
 trative Reform and Labor inspectors visit industrial work sites and report on viola-
 tions of labor code rules. However, they are usually prevented from traveling regu-
 larly beyond the capital region by insufficient resources. If cited violations are not
 remedied within the time allowed, the violators may be legally charged and subject
 to penalties. Nevertheless, in some sectors safety measures are lacking due to the
 expense of even minimal protective clothing and other personal security apparatus.
 To date, there have been no published reports on occupational health hazards and
 accidents, although there is clear evidence that these hazards exist.
 There is no explicit right allowing workers to remove themselves from dangerous
 work without jeopardizing their continued employment. The ILO has cited the Gov-
 ernment within the past year for failure to observe ILO conventions and standards
 governing workplace safety and weight limits.
