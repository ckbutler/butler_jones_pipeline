 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa, a small Pacific island country with a
 population of around 169,000, is located approximately 1,600
 miles northeast of New Zealand, the country from which it
 became independent in 1962 and to which it still looks as a
 model for governmental and educational systems. The
 Constitution adopted at independence proclaimed the nation an
 independent and sovereign state based on "Christian principles
 and Samoan customs and tradition" and established a
 parliamentary democracy on the Westminster model but with
 certain concessions to Samoan cultural practices. It provides
 for a Samoan head of state, a unicameral legislature elected
 by the matai (the family heads), an independent judiciary,
 protection of Samoan land and traditional titles, and
 guarantees of fundamental rights and freedoms. Executive
 authority is vested in the Head of State, with the Government
 administered by a Cabinet, consisting of the Prime Minister
 and eight ministers chosen by the Prime Minister. All
 legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly needs the
 approval of the Head of State before it becomes law. The
 present Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili II, holds the
 position for life. His successors will be elected by the
 Legislative Assembly for 5-year terms.
 The culture of Western Samoa is essentially Polynesian but
 uniquely Samoan. Traditional authority is vested in the matai
 (leader of an extended family). Each extended family, or
 aiga, has at least one matai, who is appointed by a consensus
 of the aiga or by other traditional means. Ownership of land
 is legally vested in the matai. It is the matai's
 responsibility to direct the economic, social, and political
 affairs of the aiga. There are 362 villages in Western Samoa
 with a total of over 20,000 matai. Each village is governed
 by a Fono or council of matai, which can fine or otherwise
 punish offenses against village rules. Western Samoa does not
 have any defense force. The small national police force is
 firmly under the control of the Government but has little
 impact beyond the capital city.
 The economy is primarily agricultural, with limited potential
 for development. It is susceptible to shifts in world prices
 for its export commodities, such as coconut oil. Western
 Samoa is heavily dependent on foreign aid, particularly from
 New Zealand, and on remittances sent to family members by the
 approximately 300,000 Samoans living abroad in Australia, New
 Zealand, and the United States.
 Western Samoan society is based on a collective value system
 where obligations and reponsibilities to the extended family
 (aiga) are often given precedence over individual rights. The
 rule of law is tenuous outside the capital, Apia, and most
 disagreements are settled by traditional means (which can
 include corporal punishment, banishment, and destruction of
 houses). Within this context there were no significant human
 rights problems in 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Such killings do not occur.

 WESTERN SAMOA
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no dnstances of politically motivated
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 . punishment are prohibited by law, and there have been no
 reports of such practices by police or other government
 authorities. However, villages are controlled by customary
 law and beatings, stonings, theburning of houses, and other
 traditional- punishments are meted out by the village council
 on occasion.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The law contains safeguards against arbitrary arrest and
 preventive detention, and these are observed. Some villages
 have banished members who fail to comply with the rules of the
 matai, the family head. This is one of the harshest forms of
 punishment in this collective society.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Western Samoan law assures the right to a fair public trial,
 and this right is honored. All charges are stated formally
 and clearly. Defendants are entitled to counsel. There are
 no special .courts to deal with pQlitical orose-curity offenses,
 and the judiciary is independent of government interference or
 influence. Decisions of village patai about customary law are
 not subject to judicial review; however, the Government is
 trying to curb the excesses of some village leaders. The
 Government has a case pending against a group of village
 curfew guards who stoned a government worker driving through
 their village during prayers, a serious.offense according to
 local values.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 "Correspondence
 The Government respects the privacy of its citizenry and does
 not permit arbitrary interference with the family, home, or
 correspondence. Samoai law provides for protection from
 invasi-6n of the home or seizure of property without
 substantive and procedural safeguards, including search
 warrants. Practically, there is little or no privacy in the
 village. Village officials by law may not enter homes without
 -permission, but therb can be substantial social pressure to
 grant such permission.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and-of the press are fundamental parts of
 the Constitution. They are respected in law and practice.
 The press is independent of the Government.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly
 and the right to form associations. There are no significant
 restrictions.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution, along
 with freedom of thought and conscience. There is no
 government-favored religion. Nearly 100 percent of the
 population is Christian. While the Constitution grants each
 person the right to change religion or belief and to worship
 or teach religion alone or with others, in practice the matai,
 the extended family leader, often chooses the religious
 denomination of the aiga, the family. There is strong
 societal pressure to support church leaders and projects
 financially with contributions often totaling more than 30
 percent of income. Younger Samoans have begun to resist these
 enforced payments.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no controls upon citizens of Western Samoa regarding
 internal movement or resettlement. Emigration is actively
 supported by the Government as a social "safety valve" which
 allows the departure of disenfranchised, frustrated, and
 potentially rebellious youths and because it increases foreign
 income through remittances. Foreign travel is generally
 unrestricted, but there is an exit permit requirement which
 can only be denied because of pending court cases or
 outstanding debts to the Government. The right to return is
 guaranteed. There are no refugees from Western Samoa.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Samoan citizens do not have the right to change the government
 through direct, multiparty election with universal adult
 suffrage. Power in Western Samoa is vested in the Prime
 Minister and the Legislative Assembly. Under the
 Constitution, the Assembly is elected every 3 years.
 Forty-five of its members are elected by the approximately
 20,000 village chiefs (matai), and the other 2 seats are
 filled by elections among those citizens who are not Samoan by
 heritage. Although there is increasing pressure for popular
 elections, this concept is seen by many as conflicting with
 "Fa'a Samoa" (the Samoan way). Political leaders have blocked
 calls for a referendum on universal suffrage. Many Samoans
 view the existing political structure as democratic, in that
 the matai traditionally consult with their extended families
 before making decisions such as selecting candidates for the
 Assembly. The matai system is conservative but does allow for
 change. While Samoans must show respect and obedience to
 their matai in family and communal affairs, the matai have
 well-defined responsibilities which, if not met, can result in
 their removal.
 Western Samoa has only rudimentary political parties. The
 first one, founded in 1982, was the Human Rights Protection
 Party (HRPP); its leader, Tofilau Eti, is currently Prime
 
 
 1023
 WESTERN SAMOA
 Minister. Although a second party, the Samoan National
 Development-Party (SNDP), was formed during 1988, replacing
 the previous-Christian Democratic Party founded in 1985, the
 political process in Western Samoa remains very much a
 function of personality rather than party. As a result,
 several previou, elected governments fell before the end of
 their prescribed 3-year terms when supporters defected to the
 opposition.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental -Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no reports of any international or nongovernmental
 investigations of alleged violations of human rights. There
 are no official or private human rights organizations in
 Western Samoa.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 -.Language, or Social Status
 Samoa is a homogeneous society with no significant ethnic
 minorities. .Samoan politics-and'culture are-the product of a
 heritage of chiefly privilege-and power, and persons of good
 family have some advantages. There is clear discrimination
 based on social status and sex, and women traditionally occupy
 a subordinate role.
 Abuse of women, inoluding wife beating, is believed to be a
 prdblem,.but no-reliable data about the extent of it is
 -available. As-noted above, traditional punishments sometimes
 involve beatings; this is 'generally directed more at men than
 women. While abuse of women is prohibited by law, it does
 occur'and is often-unrepqrted or ignored. Some view wife
 beating as a male prerogative.. There are many cases of rape
 that go unreported. The few .convictions generally result in
 light punishment.
 The Constitution makes special provision to preserve the
 political rights of non-Samoans. Persons of mixed ancestry
 .who are culturally Samoan are-fully accepted and can attain
 positions of considerable wealth and influence. Thirty
 percent of the members'of Parliament are of mixed ancestry.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Western Samoan workers have complete and unrestricted rights
 to-:establish and join organizations of their own choosing.
 While trade unions have not emerged in -the private sector, the
 Government does not restrict efforts to Aevelop them. A
 public service association representing government workers, an
 increasingly important sector of the-work force, does exist.
 The Supreme Court has upheld-the right of government workers
 to strike, subject to certain restrictions imposed principally
 forireasons of public safety-. The Public Service Association
 freely maintains relations with international bodies and
 participates in bilateral exchanges. Western Samoa does not
 belong to the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While workers have the right to engage in collective
 bargaining, there is little practice of this right because of
 
 
 1024
 WESTERN SAMOA
 the absence of unions in the private sector. Mowever, the
 Public Service Association engages in collective bargaining on
 behalf of government workers. Arbitration and mediation
 procedures are in place to resolve labor disputes, although
 these rarely arise. Labor law and practice are uniform
 throughout the country, including in the one export processing
 zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While the Government does not demand compulsory labor and it
 is prohibited by law, in this collective society people are
 frequently called upon to work for their villages. Most
 people do so willingly, but, if not, they are compelled to do
 so by the matai.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children
 Under the terms of the Labor and Employment Act of 1972 and
 Regulations of 1973, it is illegal to employ children under 15
 years of age except in "safe and light work." The law does
 not apply to service rendered to the matai, some of whom
 require children to work at what might be considered child
 labor, primarily on village farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor and Employment Act of 1972 and Regulations of 1973
 established for the private sector a 40-hour workweek and a
 minimum wage of $0.35 an hour. This low minimum wage suffices
 for a minimum standard of living when supplemented by the
 subsistence farming and fishing in which most families
 engage. The law also establishes certain rudimentary safety
 and health standards. Independent observers report, however,
 that the safety laws are not strictly enforced except when
 accidents highlight noncompliance. In addition, many
 agricultural workers, among others, are inadequately protected
 from pesticides and other dangerous conditions because of
 limited employer awareness .of the hazards. Government
 education programs are addressing these concerns. The law
 does not apply to service rendered to the matai. Government
 employees are covered under different, more stringent
 regulations, which are adequately enforced.
