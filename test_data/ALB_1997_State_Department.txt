 ALBANIA
 Albania is a republic with a multiparty Parliament, a Prime Minister, and a
 President elected by the Parliament. The Prime Minister heads the Government; the
 Presidency is a largely ceremonial position with limited executive power. The Law
 on Major Constitutional Provisions serves in the place of a constitution. (A par-
 liamentary commission is authorized to begin work on a new constitution, but the
 principal opposition party has been reluctant to join the process.) The Socialist
 Pry()and its allies won 111 out of 155 parliamentary seats in June multiparty
 elections that observers deemed acceptable and satisfactory under the cir-
 cumstances. The elections followed a 5-month period of chaos and anarchy in the
 country. Fates Nano, the Socialist Party chairman, formed a new Government in
 July. The judiciary was unable to function for much of the year.
 Local police units reporting to the Ministry of the Interior are principally respon-
 sible for internal security. The police disappeared from the streets in many cities,
 especially in the south. Security forces were able to keep some control in Tirana for
 all except a few days of the unrest, but in the rest of the country they totally lost,
 and in many places still do not exercise, control and authority.
 The Albanian national intelligence service (SHIK) is responsible for both external
 and domestic intelligence gathering and counterinteligence functions. SHIK'S inter-
 nal responsibilities i support of law enforcement agencies include gathering infor-
 mation on government corruption and anticonstitutional activities,  public percep-
 tion arose bfore and during the violence in February and March that SHIK was
 irmly under the control of then-President Berisha and that he and the Democratic
 Party were using SHIK for their own political ends. SHIK personnel, particularly
 in the south, suffered beatings and harassment and in several cases were brutally
 murdered. At year's end SHIK was functioning but at an extremely limited level
 The new Government plans to restructure the intelligence organization. Police re-
 portedly committed some human rights abuses.
 Albanians suffered severely due to the collapse of a number of pyramid schemes
 in which many citizens placed large sums of money. This precipitated a political and
 social crisis, since many citizens had sustained themselves on the "interest" pay-
 ments received from such schemes. The ensuing violence and instability undermined
 economic growth, reversed improvements in infrastructure, and led to growing infla-
 tion and increased unemployment. The agricultural sector employs about 60 percent
 of the workforce. Remittances from Albanians working abroad and foreign assist-
 ance are major sources of income. Considerable income is also believed to derive
 from numerous criminal activities. Following formation of the new Government in
 July, efforts to restore order and confidence in the economy led to a modest recov-
 ery. The Government has committed itself to meeting the international inancial
 community's demands that pyramid schemes be clearly outlawed and that the re-
 maining pyramid schemes be audited and, if insolvent, liquidated to repay deposi-
 tors partially. However, measurable results have been slow in coming.
 The country's human rights record deteriorated sharply around the time of the
 state of emergency from March 2 until July 24, reflecting the country's general
 breakdown of governmental authority and civil society. Depending on the specific
 time and the government in power, accusations were made that police, STiK, and
 unofficial paramilitary groups committed killings and beatings. Given the break-
 down of order, however, there is very little, if any, firm evidence to substantiate
 these accusations, although the Government acknowledges that police may have
 killed some persons in custody. However, there were numerous casualties as a re-
 sult of the chaos and anarchy. According to unofficial estimates over 2,000 persons
 were killed and many more wounded during the first 6 months of 1997. Moreover,
 a much lower but continuous level of killings and injuries continued throughout the
 year. Most deaths were due to accidents, whether from firearms or grenades, as ar-
 (939)
 
 
 940
 mories were looted. Many intentional deaths, however, resulted from acts of re-
 venge, from traditional blood feuds, or from fighting among rival criminal groups.
 Some deaths also reportedly resulted from insurgent attacks on the police or SHIK.
 Poor prison and pretrial detention conditions continued; however, the escape of all
 prisoners in March enabled the Government to try to rebuild and reconstruct the
 facilities to meet international standards. Two prisons were repaired and are func-
 tioning again. A partial amnesty program attracted some prisoners to return to jail
 in exchange for reduced sentences.
 The judicial system, which was inefficient and subject to corruption and executive
 pressure in normal times, was undermined by the chaos and unable to function in
 many places. Many of the courts were vandalized or burned down. Some judges
 were intimidated by the fact that criminals they had sentenced were freed. There
 are still numerous complaints about unqualified and unprofessional judges. Mem-
 bers of the opposition say that the Government infringed on their privacy rights.
 The antigenocide (lustration) law-which could bar potential candidates-was
 amended twice, once prior to the June elections, to allow additional groups and indi-
 viduals to run for office despite their role in the former Communist regime, and
 again in August, to further lessen its impact.
 The Government is working with the Greek government to assure continuing im-
 proved conditions for the ethnic Greek minority. The two Governments ratified and
 put into force a seasonal worker agreement and the Greek Government has in-
 creased its bilateral assistance programs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government officials, but the Government acknowledged that police may
 have kiled some persons in custody.
 Numerous casualties resulted from the chaos and anarchy. According to unofficial
 estimates, over 2,000 persons were killed and many more were wounded during the
 first 6 months of the year. Moreover, a much lower but continuous level of killings
 and injuries continued throughout the year. Most deaths were due to accidents, as
 armories were looted; however, many instances of targeted killings occurred as well.
 Many intentional deaths resulted from acts of revenge, from traditional blood feuds,
 or from fighting among rival criminal groups. Some deaths also reportedly resulted
 from insurgent attacks on the polie or SHIK. An estimated 30 or more police were
 killed and dozens wounded during the worst violence in March and April. In Sep-
 tember inside the pariament bulding socialist p arty M.P. Gafur Mazreku shot
 democratic party M.P. Azem Hajdari four times. Hajdr survived and is recovering
 from the wounds. The two had previously been engaged in a physical altercation
 over "lack of respect" for each others' opimions.
 Authorities arrested former president Ramiz Alia on February 1, 1996, and
 charged him with the internment and imprisonment in concentration camps of thou-
 sands of citizens during the Communist regime. After Alia entered pretrial deten-
 tion, the prosecutor added other charges: ordering the killing of people who at-
 tempted to leave the country, ordering troops and police to fire on the people who
 topled the Hoxha monument in Tirana; ordering the arming of military students
 osubsequently klled some civilians; and ordering the shootings on April 2, 1991,
 in Shkodra that left four dead. The investigation was still ongoing at the start of
 the year. Alsa, however, went free along with all the other prisoners in March when
 all the prisons were abandoned. He was subsequently rumored to have fled to
 France and to be living there with his son. Ater apparently living in various Euro-
 ean cities with relatives, Alia returned to Albania December 21. On October 20 a
 irana court dismissed charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against
 Alia. Similar charges against two former Interior Ministers, Simon Stefani and
 Hekuran Isai, and against former General Prosecutor Qemal Lame, also were
 droppd.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms stipulates that "no one can
 be subject to torture, punishment, or cruel and brutal treatment." The Penal Code
 makes the use of torture a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In sporadic
 cases police beat journalists, political party representatives, students, and others
 during the unrest in the first half of the year and after the June elections.
 There were sporadic reports that police used physical force against demonstrators
 in February. During the June election campaign there was considerable praise for
 the police force's efforts to handle difficult situations in a tense and unstabla atmos-
 
 
 phere. The police used great restraint many times when demonstrators against the
 pyramid schemes as well as those in political rallies took to the streets and main
 squares in great numbers.
 The overwhelming majority of police have little or no professional training. In
 January a training course on human rights and freedoms was conducted for some
 police in Denmark. Other police training courses ceased when authorities lost con-
 trol of the security situation. International teams have been assessing the reconsti-
 tuted police force's needs and plan training and other assistance efforts. In July the
 Western European Union (WEU) organized a seminar for members of the public
 order police and later extended its mandate to assist police development and reorga-
 nization.
 The Interior Ministry opened an office in 1996 to deal with citizens' complaints
 and questions about police behavior and the office continued operating in 1997. Min-
 istry officials have met since August with representatives from the Albanian Center
 for the Documentation of Human Rights to coordinate on a curriculum for seminars
 to train police officers in fundamental human rights principles and for correct be-
 havior with the public. The Center published a book on human rights to help edu-
 cate police supervisors, and the WEU is producing elementary level leaflets on
 human rights for use by rank and file police officers.
 The Interior Ministry has an Internal Affairs Office to monitor police performance
 and to uncover corruption. Accusations of corruption among public officials have
 been raised during each of the three governments.
 At the beginning of the year 1,209 persons were imprisoned, but they were all re-
 leased by armed groups that stormed the prisons in mid-March during the worst
 of the chaos. All of the prisons were either severely damaged or totally destroyed.
 As of September there were 310 inmates. A total of 5 women of the 35 previously
 in custody were back in jail; no minors were held. Some 80 prisoners, mostly those
 convicted of lesser crimes, returned voluntarily when then-President Berisha in
 April offered to reduce their sentences by one-third under an amnesty law. The
 Nano Government extended this amnesty offer until January 15, 1998. The remain-
 der of those in prison were arrested after the original amnesty offer expired in April.
 President Berisha pardoned other prisoners in March, if they had less than 2 years
 to serve, and also pardoned Socialist Party Chairman and current Prime Minister
 Fatos Nano on March 14.
 Past prison conditions failed to meet minimum international standards, but with
 the total destruction or serious damage to all seven prison facilities when dem-
 onstrators attacked them from March 13 to March 15, the Government is rebuilding
 facilities to meet those standards. The destruction negated all improvements made
 in 1996. By September only two jails were functioning in Tirana and one in
 Lushnja, where reconstruction is well underway or complete. Other facilities under
 reconstruction were expected to be ready by years' end. Authorities plan to open two
 new prisons in Lezha and Vaqarri in early 1998. The prison at Vaqarri is to include
 a vocational training school. The European Union is providing much of the funding
 for these projects.
 Women currently have their own prison with dormitory sleeping facilities and an
 oTwn-air community atmosphere. Some training and education classes are available.
 Plans include a separate prison for minors at the new Lezha facility, where violent
 prisoners will be kept separate from those sentenced for lesser offenses.
 Family members may visit prisoners four times per month after sentencing, but
 only twice a month when in detention, with an opportunity for additional visits with
 the consent of the prosecutor's office. Personnel from nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's) as well as journalists can obtain unlimited visitation rights, but must first
 secure permission from the General Director of Prisons. Some NGO's complained at
 the start of the year that they could not get permission to visit detainees. The Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross started negotiating with the Nano Government
 in August for an agreement on visiting detention centers. The Red Cross signed
 agreements in October with the Ministers of Interior and Justice for visitation
 rights to see detainees in accordance with its standards. The visits took place with-
 out problems.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1995 Penal Procedures Code sets out
 the rights of detained and arrested persons. By law a police officer or prosecutor
 may order a suspect into custody. Detained persons must be immediately informed
 both of the charges against them and of their rights. If detained by the police, a
 prosecutor must be notified immediately. Within 48 hours from the arrest or deten-
 tion a court must decide, in the presence of the prosecutor, of the suspect, and of
 the suspect's lawyer, as to the security measures to be taken. Legal counsel must
 be provided free of charge if the defendant cannot afford a private attorney.
 
 
 Bail in the form of money or property may be required if the judge believes the
 accused may not appear for the hearing. Alternatively, a suspect may be placed
 under house arrest. The court may order pretrial confinement in cases where there
 is reason to believe the accused may leave the country or is a danger to society.
 The Penal Procedures Code requires completing pretrial investigations within 3
 months. The prosecutor may extend this period by 3-month intervals in especially
 difficult cases. The accused and the injured party have the right to appeal these ex-
 tensions to the district court.
 Pretrial detention conditions remained deficient at the start of the year, but the
 Government has begun building or renovating structures to address those needs.
 Plans for one building in Tirana under renovation envision a capacity for 334 de-
 tainees.
 The government does not employ exile as a form of punishment or political con-
 trol.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions pro-
 vides for an independent judiciary, but with the breakdown of society, the judiciary
 was unable to function in many places as courts were burned and some judges fled
 their posts. Fifteen out of 36 district courts were totally destroyed along with an
 unknown amount of records, papers, and other legal materials. A few courts contin-
 ued to operate to some extent, although they were inhibited by the chaos, the inabil-
 ity of police to enfoe court decisions, and the lack of prisons. Sme cases were sent
 to Tirana courts for adjudication. By year's end all courts had reopened.
 The judiciary was previously hampered by political pressures, insufficient re-
 sources, inexperience, patronage, and corruption. Numerous complaints remained
 about unqualified and unprofessional judges, but the g[overnment is seeking to im-
 prove an   pfessionalize the judiciary. The Justie Ministry's administrative role
 in the judicial budget process potentially constrains the judiciary's independence.
 The judicial system comprises district courts, six courts of appeal, and the Court
 of Cassation. Each of these courts is divided into three jurisdictions: criminal, civil,
 and military. The Court of Cassation hears appeals from the court of appeals, while
 the separate Constitutional Court reviews those cases requiring interpretation of
 constitutional legislation or acts.
 The President heads the High Council of Justice which appoints and dismisses all
 other judges. The Council's membership was increased from 9 to 13 in 1997. In addi-
 tion to the President, the Justice Minister, head of the Cassation Court, and the
 Prosecutor General, the Council now consists of three judges, chosen by other
 judges, two prosecutors, selected by other prosecutors, and four independent, well-
 known, and respected lawyers whom parliament names. The new composition of the
 Council gives the judicial branch significantly more independence from the executive
 than in the past.
 According to its internal statute, the High Council of Justice has broad powers
 to fire, demote, transfer, or otherwise discipline district and appeals court judges for
 incompetence, commission of a serious crime, or for questionable morality. Judges
 were previously not called before the Council to testify in their own behalf, but in
 the past there have been no cases in which dismissed judges have complained either
 through the press or directly to the courts. Some administrative staff from the Cas-
 sation Court who were removed did complain and were later reinstated. After it
 started meeting again in September, the High Council of Justice dismissed three
 judges and relocated a number of others as disciplinary measures. The three re-
 moved from the bench appeared before the Council during the proceedings against
 them. In December Parliament passed a law "On the Organization of Justice,"
 which gives judges the right to appeal their dismissals to the Cassation Court, and
 the President signed the new law in January 1998.
 Parliament has the authority to approve and dismiss the 9 judges of the Constitu-
 tional Court and the 11 members of the Court of Cassation. These judges may be
 dismissed only for mental incompetence or conviction of a serious crime. Constitu-
 tional Court justices serve maximum 9-year terms, rotating in three new justices
 every 3 years. Cassation Court judges are elected for 7 years.
 � Criticism continues about the appointment of judges who only completed a 6-
 month training course. The long-awaited magistrates' school, a government-sub.
 sidized and European-funded institution aimed at assuring the professional training
 of judges and prosecutors, began classes in mid-October with 20 students, who were
 selected competitively from 150 applicants. The school is expected to address the in-
 adequate educational preparation of judges and help increase the level of profes-
 sionalism among those who sit on the bench. Once in full operation, the training
 program will include mandatory initial training of candidates for the magistrature
 as well as a program of continuing education.
 
 
 Parliament appoints prosecutors on the recommendation of the President, and
 they also serve at the pleasure of the High Council of Justice, except forthe pros-
 ecutor general and deputy prosecutor general, who serve for 7 years and can only
 be removed for ment   incompetence or after being found guilty of a crime. After
 a new prosecutor general was appointed on August 14 and the Council was reorga-
 nized, it fired the prosecutor from the Elbasani district for violating procedures and
 for releasing violent criminals after the police arrested them. These criminals subse-
 quently killed one and wounded two others in a shoot-out in Elbasani's main square.
 me prosecutors and judges resigned after the Socialist Party's victory in June and
 the change of government in July.
 Parliament approves the courts' budget and allocates to each a set amount at the
 start of the year. Each court then determines how to spend the money. The Justice
 Ministry provides and approves administrative and support personnel, but the Min-
 istry stresses that it has no involvement with judicial budget decisions. The courts,
 however, have ontinued to _argue that this administrative role can be used to con-
 strain the judiciary's independence.
 The efforts of the Council of Europe and NGO's to work with the Government to
 print and distribute the penal codes and laws throughout the country were under-
 mined by the unrest and damage to the courts early in the year. Most foreign con-
 sultants and advisors were evacuated in mid-March and were slow to return, al-
 though some offices remained open with local staff. With the destruction of nany
 courts and public buildings and records in towns around the country, it will take
 a long time to resume functioning fully.
 At year's end, all courts were in session, but few cases came before them due to
 lack of investigation by local prosecutors' offices. The prosecutors are hampered, in
 turn, by the failure of police to provide sufficient facts and evidence for the prosecu-
 tors to take the cases to court.
 The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the riht to
 a fair and speedy trial. It also mandates public trials, except in cases where the in-
 torests of public order, morality, national security, the private lives of the parties
 involved, or justice require restrictions. If convicted, the accused has the right to ap-
 peal the decision within 5 days to the court of appeals and again to the Court of
 lassation, which renders the final verdict. The law does not specify any time period
 within which the court of appeals or the Court of Cassation must hear appeals.
 Ther wre eno reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the inviolability of
 the individual person, of dwellings, and of the privacy of correspondence. Parties op-
 posed to then-President Berisha and the Democratic Party, particularly at the be-
 ginning of the year, made a number of allegations of government-sanctioned tamper-
 ing with correspondence, wiretapping, or interference with telephone service. Al-
 though such complaints are less prominent about the Nano Government, which only
 came into offie mn July, members of the present opposition believe that the same
 type of invasion of privacy is occurring targeted against them.
 Parliament twie revised the anti-genocide and lustration laws, narrowing the list
 of those required to undergo scrutiny for past crimes under the Hoxha and Alia
 Communist regimes, which could render them ineligible to run for public office until
 2002. No candidates were banned, after appeals, from running i n the June par-
 liamentary elections, even though some were not decided until the last minute, and
 ballots had to be revised at that point.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and
 Freedoms provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government gen-
 erally respected these rights. Although journalists complain about lack of free om
 of the press, they areree to write, uncensored and unverified, virtually anything
 they wish. There was a period of a month and a half under the state of emergency
 when no newspapers except the Democratic Party paper were published and another
 period before the elections in June when, especially in the south, the democrats had
 difficulties distributing their newspaper. Each party during the time it has been in
 opposition complained about their lack of exposure on the state-ron electronic
 media, but there was no censorship of content.
 In September Parliament passed a well-received law that provided for broad press
 freedom. However, the law is extremely vague and had not yet been implemented
 by~year's end.
 During the unrest and the June election campaign, journalists complained of the
 difficulties in reporting stories (such as having cameras and equipment stolen and
 being attacked by criminal gangs), and political parties raised the problems and
 
 
 944
 
 dangers of campaigning and distributing respective party newspapers in different
 parts of the country.
 Little sense of journalistic responsibility or professional integrity exists. Sensa-
 tionalism is frequently the norm in the print media. Many criticisms, accusations,
 and fabrications are still printed in the party-oriented newspapers without substan-
 tiation, but also without reprisal.
 The press remains willing and able to criticize whichever government is in power
 and continued to do so during the three governments in 1997. The notable exception
 was in the first 6 weeks of the state of emergency when the government imposed
 censorship. No newspapers appeared for a month and a half except the Democratic
 Party paper Rilindja Demokratike. Access to newspapers in different parts of the
 country was limited, even after the immediate crisis, as carriers were threatened
 and the national roads blocked by well-armed groups.
 Political parties, independent trade unions, and various societies and groups pub-
 lish their own newspapers, some of which have only limited appeal and distribution.
 Dependence on outside sources for revenues may lead to pressures which limit the
 independence of reporting. Taxes on publications, in addition to rising printing
 costs, make it difficult for independent media to be economically viable without sub-
 sidies or loans from their patrons, e.g., political parties, social organizations, or pri-
 vate businesses. Journalists accused former President Berisha and the Meksi gov-
 ernment of using excessive taxation as a deliberate means to cripple the independ-
 ent and opposition press. The Nano Government had by September also refused to
 lower taxes, and journalists are concerned that taxes will go up even more as the
 new administration continues to pursue all potential revenue sources to offset the
 government's deficit. In November newspapers went on strike for lower taxes and
 other government subsidies ,and the Government promised to meet many of their
 demands.
 However, at any one time an estimated 200 different publications are available,
 including daily and weekly papers, magazines, newsletters, and pamphlets. Three
 Greek minority newspapers are published in southern Albania.
 Koha Jone, a mildly sensationalist, independent daily newspaper with the lagest
 circulation, took a strong anti-Berisha/Democratic Party line early in the year. Koha
 Jone and other then-oppositionapers accused the Meksi government and Berisha
 of systematic harassment. The Koha Jone office was ransacked and burned by un-
 known persons in the early morning of March 3, the first night of the state of emer-
 gency. r-Democratic Party forces were widely assumed to be responsible, but
 Koha Jone never produced any evidence to support this theory. Koha Jone's editor
 left the paper in May and =tad his own new newspaper, The Indipendent, con-
 tinuing his previous editorial approach. The Indipendent has since ceased publica-
 tion, and its former editor is now the Prime Minister's press spkesperson.
 Journalists seem uncertain about their relations with the Nano Government, but
 some reporters think the Government is exercising indirect pressure on the press
 by appointing a number of journalists to government jobs. Owner and director of
 oha Jane, Nikoll Lesi, an independent Member of Parliament and a member of the
 Media Commission, complained in September about the higher taxes and higher
 costs of running a newspaper in a Koha Jone article.
 Reporters regularly claim harassment from police and threats from unknown indi-
 viduals, and particularly during the first half-of the year, a number of beating and
 harassment incidents occurred involving journalists from both sides of the political
 spectrum.
 State-run radio and television provide the bulk of domestic programming, and the
 Nano Government has increased the number of members of the State Executive
 Committee of Radio and Television. The stated intention of this expansion is to help
 redress imbalance and political bias as well as access to the media. The Democratic
 Party, now in opposition, complained about a lack of equal access, just as the Social-
 ists had previously complained when the Democratic Party was in power. In August
 former parliamentary speaker PJETER Arbnori started a hunger strike to empha-
 size the need for equal access. His hunger strike lasted 20 days until a compromise
 between the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party was reached on the media law
 providing for equitable access for all the parties.
 Most municipalities offer international programs received via satellite. Home sat-
 ellite dishes abound and most citizens, even in remote villages, have access to inter-
 national broadcasts. In May Parliament passed a law authorizing private commer-
 cial broadcasting licenses that is expected to take effect in 1998. The law is liberal
 as far as ease in obtaining a license, but apparently is unsatisfactory to some be-
 cause it may limit the number of licenses available. The Government plans to con-
 trol the procedures through the establishment of a National Committee.
 
 
 There are 12 unlicensed private television stations and 10 private radio stations.
 The number keeps increasing. These stations are currently unregulated. There is no
 official state foreig language broadcasting. Widely received and listened to are sta-
 tions from Italy, Greece, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Voice
 of America (VOA) and the BBC are also popular. As of September, the VOA is
 broadcast on the FM band from a private radio station in Vlora.
 University professors continue to complain about the lack of academic freedom.
 Their complaints include firings and hiring for political reasons and the admission
 of unqualified students as political favorsUniversities were closed during the state
 of emergency and students were able to finish only part of their spring term. A new
 fall semester started on October 15. The Government apparently does not plan to
 extend the Meksi government's decision in 1996 to prohibit foreigners who were not
 the part of a university-to-university agreement from teaching in the country's uni-
 versities. During the fall semester, a number of professors and department heads,
 as well as all university rectors were removed from their posts. The Nano Govern-
 ment stated that these employment changes were designed to remove unqualified
 and incompetent professors, but those dismissed insist that the firings were under-
 taken for political reasons.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Law on Fundamental
 Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the right of peaceful assembly and states
 that "no one may be denied the right to collective organization for any lawful pur-
 pose." The government generally respected this right in practice. According to the
 law, rally organizers must notify police authorities 3 days in advance about the loca-
 tion, time, number of participants, and other details. The chief of police must issue
 his decision, with explanations for any refusal, no later than 24 tours before the
 event. The police may refuse the permit in cases when the rally may violate human
 rights and freedoms; traffic obstruction may be a problem; there is sufficient evi-
 dence that violent or criminal acts may occur; if another rally is planned for the
 same time; or if a rally would interfere with a national event, e.g., a presidential
 speech. No advance official permission is now required for meetings held in closed
 non-public places. The police no longer have the authority to pre-approve speech or
 slogan content. There were a large number of demonstrations in 1997, both to pro-
 test the country's situation and or the election campaigns. Most gatherings went
 on unauthorized and unchallenged, although police, mainly in Tirana, did try to as-
 sert control. A few demonstrations turned violent, with shootings and injuries, but
 it was unclear in all cases who was responsible.
 In early March, the Meksi government banned public gatherings of more than
 four people and imposed a curfew. The curfew and limit on public gatherings were
 part of the state of emergency, which the new Parliament lifted July 23 during its
 first session.
 The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the right of
 association, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. A political
 party must apply to the Ministry of Justice for official certification. It must declare
 an aim or purpose that is not anticonstitutional or contrary to law, and it must de-
 scribe its organizational structure and account for all public and private funds it re-
 ceives.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms
 rovides that "freedom of thought, conscience, and religion may not be violated."
 itizens may freely change their religion or beliefs and may manifest them alone
 or in community with others, in public or in private life, and in worship, teaching,
 practice, and observance. The Government respects these provisions in practice.
 There is no law to control either violation of religious rights or so-called religious
 groups which may violate or abuse the rights of others.
 The majority of citizens are secular in orientation after decades of rigidly enforced
 atheism. Muslims, who make up the largest traditional religious group, adhere to
 a moderate form of Sunni Islam. The Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox and Roman
 Catholic Churches are the other large denominations. The Albanian Orthodox
 Church split from the Greek Orthodox Church early in the century, and there is a
 strong identification with the national church as distinct from the Greek church.
 The current archbishop is a Greek citizen, even though the Albanian Orthodox
 Church's 1929 statute states that all its archbishops must be of Albanian heritage,
 because there are no Albanian clerics qualified for this position.
 Foreign clergy, including Muslim clerics, Christian and Ba'hai missionaries, Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses, and many others freely carry out religious activities. The Religious
 Council of the State Secretariat, an office that functions under the Prime Minister's
 authority, but has no clear mandate and is unable to make decisions on its own,
 estimates that there are 20 different Muslim societies and sects with around 95 rep-
 resentatives in country. There are more than 2,500 missionaries representing Chris-
 
 
 946
 tian or Bahai organizations. No religious missionaries have suffered any acts of vio-
 lence or been arrested because they are missionaries.
 The government has not yet returned all lands and religious objects under its con-
 trol that were confiscated under the Communist regime. Some warehouses in which
 church groups stored food and other basic commodities were seriously damaged and
 looted during the unrest. Each religion is slowly recovering old properties, but in
 cases where the sites or buildings were "cultural monuments protected by the state,"
 the transfer of ownership continues to be problematic and slow. All major religious
 groups continue to complain of this slow pace of property return.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the country.
 During the period of unrest, citizens either individually or in small groups were
 not prevented from traveling to Tirana. Rebels in the south set up roadblocks, and
 people had trouble traveling in that region. The police set up roadblocks around
 Tirana when rumors indicated that a group was coming from the south to cause
 trouble in the capital; the group never appeared.
 There are generally no restrictions on entry and exit from the countr.
 Albanian-born citizens abroad are eligible to apply for dual citizenshp. With the
 collapse of the pyramid schemes and the ensuing disorder, an unknown number of
 Albanians fled to Greece, Italy, and other western countries, with most entering
 those countries illegally. There are estimates that over 15,000 fled to Italy alone.
 Albanians who fled the country during the Communist dictatorship are welcomed
 back with citizenship restored and without adverse consequences, as are all Alba-
 nians who left at any time after the Communist regime fell.
 The Government has no formal refugee policy. Transit of refugees without visas
 is problematic, and organized criminal gangs have turned illegal refugee smuggling,
 including transporting Albanians illegally into neighboring countries, into a lucra-
 tive business. In some cases criminals have taken advantage of the illegals' plight
 by telling them that they were going to Italy, collecting their money (up to $500 to
 1,000 per head) up front, sailing up the coast to Durres, dropping them off, and re-
 turning to Vlora. The most numerous refugees are Kurds, Pakistanis, Chinese,
 Turks, and others from the Middle East and Asia on their way to Western Europe,
 usually through the port at Vlora on their way to Italy.
 The UniteNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in conjunction
 with the Albanian Red Cross, runs a "care and maintenance" program for those per-
 sons whom they consider "vulnerable"--those who arrive and cannot return where
 they came from, or have failed in their attempts to continue further. The UNHCR
 office in Tirana assesses refugees and, for those whom they believe should not be
 returned to the home country, approves grants of money, shelter, and food. The
 -N-CR also attempts to reunite families whenever possible, mostly in the case of
 refugees from Kosovo. However, most of the illegal refugees do not come to the
 UNHCR offices for assistance. Nationalities taking advantage of the UNHCR facili-
 ties include Kosovars, Macedonians, Iraqis, Syrians, and Algerians. Chinese, Paki-
 stanis, Sri Lankans, Iraqi Kurds, and Turks tend to avoid the UNHCR. The
 UNHCR also runs a public information program on radio and television to try to
 discourage Albanians from going abroad illegally, coordinates with the Albanian of-
 fice for refugees in the Interior Ministry, and works with the Labor Ministry to pro-
 mote repatriation of Albanians internally displaced during the crisis. During 1997,
 people came and went during the unrest; about 30 refugees were under unhcr care
 at any one time. The Government did not forcibly expel anyone who had a valid
 claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions states that citizens have the right
 to change their government "by free, general, equal, direct, and secret ballot," and
 in June citizens elected a government in what international observers considered to
 be a satisfactory process, given the preceding months of chaos and anarchy.
 In January and February, citizens who lost their savings in failed pyramid
 schemes took to the streets in protest, demanding that the government compensate
 them for their losses. Opposition parties, seizing the opportunity that this economic
 calamity presented, expanded the demands and called or the resignation of the gov-
 ernment of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi and President Sail Berisha, blaming
 them for the crisis. The demonstrations increased in size and frequency and on Feb-
 ruary 9 the first death, blamed on a local policeman, occurred in Vlora, prompting
 a massive funeral procession there February 11 and a subsequent student hunger
 strike at the university in Vlora. These events, in turn, sparked even more protests.
 Then-Prime Minister Meksi and his ministers resigned under pressure March 1.
 
 
 The Parliament declared a state of emergency March 2 and passed legislation de-
 signed to deal with the mounting civil disturbances. The next day parliament re-
 elected Sali Berisha President for a second 5-year term. An interim National Rec-
 onciliation Government was formed on March 9 following multiparty negotiations,
 with a limited mandate to restore order and prepare for new parliamentary elec-
 tions.
 Berisha appointed a new prime minister, Bashkim Fino, with the consensus of 10
 leading political parties. The same consensus process was used to agree on the nam-
 ing of the cabinet and in filling some other government positions. Ministers in the
 new government came from all 10 of these parties. In addition, the Democrats and
 other right of center parties, along with the newly created left of center Forum for
 Democracy (a temporary alliance of opposition parties led by former Communist-era
 political prisoners opposed to Berisha), met in a series of roundtable sessions, signed
 a number of agreements, and moved toward the ultimate goal of new parliamentary
 elections. During the period of public disorder, which developed into general anarchy
 and reached its high point in mid-March throughout the country, the political forces
 were able to find ways, often only after a series of political debates on a subject,
 to cope with the situation. The international community, working both bilaterally
 and multilaterally through the chairman in office of the Organization for Security
 and Cooperation in Europe's personal representative Dr. Franz Vranitzky, helped
 the various political forces develop the cooperation and compromises needed to con-
 duct the new parliamentary elections on June 29 and to see their results put into
 effect.
 A number of serious difficulties were encountered and eventually overcome
 throughout the process, including agreement on a new election law. As in the period
 preceding past elections, this law determined whether the Parliament would be
 elected on a majoritarian or proportional basis or, as worked out, on the basis of
 some compromise between the two. The law also changed the number of deputies
 to be elected from 140 to 155. The Democratic Party complained about problems
 campaigning in the south and there were some incidents of violence directed against
 their candidates and party officials. Other parties' candidates and leaders suffered
 in isolated incidents as well. Media access was monitored domestically and inter-
 nationally and was deemed fairly equitable.
 A simultaneous referendum on the type of government-parliamentary republic or
 a monarchy-took place on June 29 as well. The monarchy lost, but monarchists led
 by claimant to the throne Leka Zogu protested that the Socialists fixed the vote
 count. One person was killed and four were injured on July 3 when a pro-monar-
 chist demonstration turned violent.
 International and domestic observers mounted an intensive monitoring effort cov-
 ering almost the entire country. They judged the elections to be satisfactory, ade-
 quate, and acceptable under the circumstances. There were isolated incidents of vio-
 lence and some reports of fraud and manipulation, but observers determined these
 did not significantly affect the final outcome. Voter turnout was 60 to 65 percent.
 Discrepancies in a few districts were serious enough to require .the Government to
 rerun the parliamentary elections in these areas, and in a couple of more remote
 regions elections were delayed because not all the materials were delivered in time.
 The Democrats, who protested that they were not able to campaign freely in the
 south, initially called for a repeat of the elections in that half of the country. They
 later acceptedthe results and their role as an opposition party, but delayed their
 entry into Parliament and have continued to call the new Parliament a "Kalash-
 nikov Parliament."
 The Albanian Helsinki Committee (AHC), International Helsinki Federation,
 Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, and the Norwegian Helsinki Committee issued a
 joint public statement declaring that "considering the conditions surrounding the
 elections," they judged them "in general, as free and fair."
 The Socialist Party won 100 seats out of 155 in the Parliament, with another 11
 seats going to its allied parties. President Sali Berisha resigned July 23. The new
 Parliament elected PS Secretary General Rexhep Meidani as president on July 24.
 PS Chairman Fatos Nano became the new Prime Minister on July 27.
 In 1992 Parliament amended the old law on political parties; the amendment pro-
 hibits formation of any party or organization with an antinational, chauvinistic, rac-
 ist, totalitarian, fascist, Stalinist, Enverist or Communist, and/or Marxist-Leninist
 character, or any political p arty with an ethnic or religious basis.
 The Unity for Human Rights Party, founded by ethnic Greeks, but representing
 several ethnic minorities, is most popular in the south where the majority of the
 Greek minority resides. The courts approved in April the organization of one new
 political party, the Movement for Democracy Party (LPD) which was created by dis-
 
 
 948
 affected Democratic Party members. Courts did not approve an application by an
 "immigration party," citing lack of documentation.
 While there are no legal impediments to their participation, women are still
 underrepresented in politics and government. The major political parties have wom-
 en's organizations and there are a few women on the parties' leadership committees.
 As a result of the 1997 elections, there are 10 female M.P.'s, one of whom is deputy
 speaker of the Parliament. In the Nano Government one minister of state, one min-
 ister, and two deputy ministers are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally permitted various human rights and related organiza-
 tions to function freely, although all were severely limited during the first half of
 the year when it was too dangerous to travel in many parts of the country. The Al-
 banian Helsinki Committee (AHC) played an active role in monitoring the crisis sit-
 uation and elections. The AHC focuses on the status of minorities, rule of law is-
 sues, and the importance of a new constitution. It is still pressing for a new law
 on the organization of SHIK. Several local NGO's focus on the rights of women and
 children. The Albanian Human Rights Documentation Center continues to actively
 prepare human rights educational materials for use in elementary and secondary
 schools, as well as to train police. Like all local NGO's, the Center's work is ham-
 pered by a lack of sufficient funding and equipment. The Society for Democratic Cul-
 ture works with civic education, monitoring elections, and women's issues.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions prohibits discrimination based on
 sex, race, ethnicity, language, or religion, but women and some minority groups
 complain that, in practice, discrimination continues.
 omen.-Violence against women and spousal abuse still occur in this traditional
 male-dominated society, but the breakdown in police controls, coupled with the low
 level of concern that police showed in such cases in the past, means that most abuse
 oes unreported. No government-sponsored program protects the rights of women,
 ut one small shelter for abused women is found in Tirana. The shelter consists of
 a small room that can hold only one or two women for a limited time. The NGO
 that operates the shelter maintains a hot-line that women and girls can call for ad-
 vice and counseling. Over 1,500 calls were received since October.
 Many men, especially those from the north, still follow the old traditions, known
 as the kanun, in which the women are considered chattel and treated as such. The
 concept of marital rape is still foreign to many and is not considered a crime. In
 1996 1,901 cases of divorce were recorded in the courts; in the first half of 1997,
 even with the unrest, there were 1,116 cases. Women and girls continue to be lured
 into prostitution rings, especially in Greece and Italy.
 Women are not excluded, either by law or practice, from any occupations, but nei-
 ther do they typically rise to the top of their fields. The Labor Code mandates equal
 pay for equal work; however, no data are available on how well this is implemented
 in practice. Women have suffered more from unemployment and discrimination in
 seeking jobs. Although women enjoy equal access to higher education, they are not
 accorded full, equal opportunity and treatment with men in their careers. An in-
 creasing number of women are beginning to venture out on their own, opening shops
 and small businesses. Many are migrating along with Albanian men to Greece and
 Italy to seek employment.
 A number of NGO's are devoted to women's issues. However, seminars, training
 courses, and counseling for women were on hold during the period of unrest. Groups
 are now attempting to restart or restructure previous programs. International foun-
 dations and NGO's give much- needed financial support to women's NGO's.
 Children.-The Government's commitment to children's rights and welfare is
 based on domestic law and international agreements. School attendance is manda-
 tory through the eighth grade (or age 18, whichever comes first). Schools were
 closed during the state of emergency and reopened in some areas only at the end
 of April. All schools opened in September, although many suffered from either total
 destruction or severe damage and looting estimated at $35 million (5.25 billion Lek).
 There was also a problem with squatters in some school buildings as police were
 unable to remove them, but the squatters left when pupils came back to school.
 Child abuse is a little-reported problem, but authorities and NGO's believe it ex-
 ists. According to numerous reports, organized criminal elements kidnap children,
 especially young girls, and send them to Italy and elsewhere to work as beggars and
 prostitutes. Romani children particularly are used as beggars, in full view of the po-
 
 
 lice, who take no action either for the children or against the adults who use them.
 Child Hope, an NGO funded by the European Union, operates a center for street
 children.
 People With Disabilities.-Widespread poverty and poor medical care account for
 a large number of disabled persons. The disabled are eligible for various forms of
 public assistance, but budgetary constraints limit the amount received. The public
 care section of the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and Women organized social
 service administrators throughout the country whose goal is to improve the quality
 of services to disabled persons and promote their social integration. With the three
 changes in government during the year, there were no new measures to address the
 problems of the handicapped. No law mandates accessibility to public buildings for
 people with disabilities and little has been done on their behalf.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-There are two main minority populations,
 ethnic Greeks and Macedonians. While no recent official statistics exist regarding
 the size of the various ethnic communities, ethnic Greeks are the most organized
 and receive the most attention and assistance from abroad. Unknown numbers of
 ethnic minorities fled the country during the extensive rioting and unrest in the
 first half of the year. A few thousand ethnic Macedonians remain as do a small
 group of ethnic Montenegrins and ethnic Serbs in the north. No discrimination was
 reported against the Vlachs, who speak Romanian as well as Albanian, or against
 the Cams, non-Orthodox ethnic Greeks. Both groups live mainly in the south. oma
 are also present.
 Relations between Albania and Greece continued to improve and in 1997 the two
 Governments brought into force the 1996 agreement on Albanian seasonal workers
 in Greece. The government in 1996 opened three new first-year classes in Greek in
 the southern cities of Saranda, Gjirokastra, and Delvina when the school year start-
 ed. Classes for the Greek minority are held in villages throughout those districts
 and two villages in the Permeti district as well. Classes are also available for the
 Macedonian minority in villages in the districts of Pogradeci and Devolli bordering
 the FYROM. These classes also ceased when Albania's schools were closed under the
 state of emergency, but resumed in September.
 Schools throughout the country suffered severe damage and looting during the un-
 rest, and the Education Ministry plans new programs and texts (provided free of
 charge to the Government from Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Mac-
 edonia (FYROM) and teacher training (mainly in Greece and the FYROM) for mi-
 nority education classes. The Greek and FYROM Governments provide texts in their
 national language for use in these classes. Without their contributions, the minority-
 language classes would probably be conducted entirely in Albanian using Albanian
 texts, defeating the purpose of minority-language education. These classes are gen-
 erally conducted one-third of the time in Albanian. The Government introduced
 classes in Greek in high schools in areas inhabited by ethnic Greeks. There is a
 shortage of minority teachers. Many fled during the disturbances, and Education
 Ministry officials believe that many of these teachers prefer to stay in Greece or the
 FYROM due to the better wages and work conditions there.
 The Education Ministry, in cooperation with the Soros Foundation, plans to build
 four new schools for minorities and to reconstruct some others.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers obtained the right to establish independent
 trade unions in 1990. The 1993 Labor Code calls for protecting workers rights
 through collective bargaining agreements. The Independent Confederation of Trade
 Unions of Albania (BSPSH), with an estimated 280,000 members, acts as an um-
 brella organization. A separate Confederation of Trade Unions (KS) also represents
 a separate group of other unions (i.e., some workers in the school, food, petroleum,
 postal and telecommunications, and railroad sectors), and estimates its membership
 at 130,000 to 150,000. A few independent unions are not affiliated with either fed-
 eration. None of the unions claim any political party affiliation. The private sector
 normally employs more than 800,000 workers, mostly in agriculture, small shops,
 enterprises, and restaurants, but very few have formed unions to represent them-
 selves. The BSPSH and KS are attempting to get more accurate numbers on the
 private sector employment and determine how jointly to strengthen worker rights
 in all sectors. For example, in September, health workers in beth unions signed an
 agreement to work together on issues and not to act as strike breakers against each
 other. The government gives the unions no financial assistance.
 According to the Law on Major Constitutional Provisions and other legislation, all
 workers, except members of uniformed military forces, the police, and some court
 authorities, have the right to strike. The law forbids strikes that are openly declared
 to be political, or so judged by the courts.
 
 
 950
 Miners in the south and some employees at the Port of Durres went on strike de-
 manding higher salaries for a couple of days after the 20 percent value added tax
 went into effect October 1. There were no incidents during the strikes.
 Labor's major problem is rapidly increasing unemployment, a critical problem
 made worse with the number of enterprises damaged or destroyed during the rioting
 and chaos in the first half of the year. Union officers estimate that overall unem-
 ployment is about 35 percent, with figures reaching as high as 60 to 70 percent in
 more remote regions. Current retirement pensions in the villages are around $7
 (1,050 Lek) per month and approximately $20 (3,000 Lek) per month in the cities.
 The average family may spend $20-25 (3,000 to 3,750 Lek) per month on bread,
 which remains the diet staple.
 Labor federations are free to maintain ties with international organizations and
 have worked to increase those ties to get assistance in any form they can. Union
 officials cited the recovery of workers' money lost in the pyramid scheme collapse
 as their first priority, along with reestablishment of public order and safety. Unions
 hoped to meet with Prime Minister Nano and other appropriate government officials
 to discuss training, employment, rebuilding the industria sector, salaries, pensions,
 and other relevant issues. At year's end, the Nano Government had made no com-
 ment and taken no actions regarding workers or the unemployed. President
 Meidani's office sent the BSPSH a questionnaire to fill out and union officials hope
 to meet with the President after they send it in early in 1998.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Citizens in all fields of em-
 ployment, except uniformed members of the armed forces, police officers, and some
 court employees, have the right to organize and bargain collectively. In practice
 unions representing public sector employees negotiate directly with the government,
 but unions complain that government officials from none of the three governments
 in power during the year were willing to sit down with them to discuss outstanding
 issues. Privatization expanded to include many sectors in 1996, but slowed consider-
 ably in 1997 with the year's economic and political instability. The privatization
 ministry never effectively functioned during the second Meksi government, was dis-
 banded under the national reconciliation government, and was then resuscitated in
 August under the title of Ministry of Public Economy and Privatizatin.
 Salaries in the state sector are based on a prepared wage scale. Pensions are reg-
 ulated under a 1993 law on social security, which union officials would like to see
 amended and updated. There is no officia record of salaries in the private sector,
 but it is widely believed that they are much higher than state sector wages.
 In 1996 the BSPSH agd with the Meksi government to index workers salaries
 to inflation every 6 montha, starting in January. None of the country's three govern-
 ments honored this agreement. Un on officials say that Prime Minister Nano stated
 that he expected inflation to hit 50 percent by the end of the year, but nothing in
 his new government's program dealt with how workers might be compensated for
 or proteted from such increases in inflation.
 Parliament passed a law in 1996 establishing free trade zones between Tirana
 and Durres and elsewhere. The plan is for the areas to become export processing
 zones, but the zones still do not function due to the lack of implementing regula-
 tions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Law on Major Constitutional
 Provisions and the Labor Code prohibit forced labor, including that performed by
 children, and there were no cases reported.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code sets the minimum age of employment at 16 years and limits the amount
 and type of labor that can be performedby persons under age 18, but children ages
 14 to 16 may work in part-tieme  enial jobs during summer vacations.
 The Labor Ministry may enforce the minimum     age requirement through the
 courts. In rural areas, children continue to be called on to assist families in farm
 work. The law prohibits forced or bonded labor involving children, and there is no
 evidence that t occurs. In Tirana a number of children wander the streets selling
 cigarettes and chocolates.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for all workers over age
 16 is approximately $30 per month (4,400 Lek), a decline from 1996 due to nearly
 50 percent depreciation of the Lek. Thiis not sufficient to maintain a decent stand-
 ard of living, especially fororkers with a family. In the past, workers tried to find
 second or part-time mobs to supplement their incomes, or relied on remittances from
 family members residing abroad or proceeds from the pyramid schemes. Such jobs
 havebecome more difficult to find, and unemployment is growing. The law provides
 for social assistance (income support) and unemployment compensation; however,
 this is extremely limited, both in the numbers of unemployed who receive such aid
 and in the amounts that they receive. The average monthly wage for workers in the
 
 
 951
 public sector is approximately $58 (8,638 Lek), significantly lower than the 1996 av-
 erage of approximately $100, again due to the drop in the Lek's value. No data are
 available for private sector wages, but the average wage is still assumed to be con-
 siderably higher than in the public sector.
 Working hours are determined by collective and individual bargaining contracts,
 but the legal maximum limit is 48 hours per week. Many workers normally work
 6 days a week; the Council of Ministers must approve exceptions. The Labor Min-
 istry enforces this law whenever possible.
 The government sets occupational health and safety standards but has limited
 funds to make improvements in the remaining state-owned industries, and health
 and safety are generally very poor. The unions are attempting to include health pro-
 tection and safety standards in collective bargaining contracts, but even if they suc-
 cessfully negotiate terms, implementation is difficult. The Labor Code spells out ob-
 ligations of employers and their employees regarding workplace safety. The law,
 however, does not provide specific protection to workers who choose to leave the
 workplace for fear of hazardous conditions.
 ANDORRA
 The Principality of Andorra became a parliamentary democracy in 1993 when its
 Constitution was approved by popular referendum. Two princes with joint authority
 representing secular and religious authorities have governed since 1278. Under the
 constitution, the two princes-the President of France and the Spanish Bishop of
 Sue D'urgel-serve equally as heads of state and are each represented in Andorra
 b  a dele ate. Elections were held in February to choose members of the Consell
 General (the Parliament), which selects the head of government. The judiciary func-
 tions independently.
 Andorra has no defense force. The national police, under effective civilian control,
 have sole responsibility for internal security.
 The market-based economy is dependent on those of its neighbors France and
 Spain. With creation of the European Union internal market, Andorra lost its privi-
 leged duty-free status and is suffering an economic recession. Tourism is still an im-
 portant source of income. Because of banking secrecy laws, the financial services
 sector is growing in importance.
 The Government respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and the
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of abuse.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials
 employed them.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The highest judicial body is the five-member Superior Council of Justice. One
 member each is appointed by: the two princes; the Head of Government; the Presi-
 dent of the Parliament; and, collectively, members of the lower courts. Members of
 the 'diciary are appointed for 6-year terms.
 The judiciary provided citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides citizens with safeguards against arbitrary interference with
 their "privacy, honor, and reputation," and government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions. Private dwellings are considered inviolable. No searches of pri-
 vate premises may be conducted without a judicially issued warrant. Private com-
 munications also are protected by law.
 
 
 952
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independ-
 ent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system com-
 bine to ensure freedom of speech and the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. Since adoption of the
 1993 constitution, the Government has registered seven political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The Constitution acknowledges a special
 relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and the State, "in accordance with
 Andorran tradition." The Catholic Church receives no subsidies from the Govern-
 ment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them infpractice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refu-
 gees. It is government policy not to expel persons having valid claims to refugee sta-
 tus, and there were no reports of such expulsions. The issue of first asylum did not
 arise during the year.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Women have enjoyed full suffrage since 1970. Progress has been made, but
 women continue to play a relatively minor role in politics. Notwithstanding the ab-
 sence of formal barriers, few women have run for office. Only 1 of 28 members of
 Parliament is a woman, and only 2 women occupy cabinet level positions. Prior to
 the current administration, only 2 women held elective office.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no restrictions to prevent their formation, no formal human rights
 organizations operate in the principality.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution declares that all persons are equal before the law and prohibits
 discrimination on grounds of birth, race, sex, origin, religion, opinions, or any other
 personal or social condition, although the law grants many rights and privileges ex-
 clusively to citizens. The Government effectively enforces these provisions.
 Women.-No data exist on the incidence of domestic violence, but spousal abuse
 appears to be virtually nonexistent. No hot lines or shelters exist.
 There is no legal discrimination against women, either privately or professionally.
 Children.-There is no evidence of any special commitment by the Government
 to children's rights and welfare, although there is no indication of any problem in
 this area. Free public education begins at age 4; government-funded child care is
 not provided. No special programs for children's health care are offered.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The law man-
 dates access to new buildings for people with disabilities, and the Government en-
 forces these provisions in practice.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Spanish nationals are the largest group of
 foreign residents, accounting for 47 percent of the population. Other sizable foreign
 groups are Portuguese, French, and British. A small number of North African and
 African immigrants work mostly in agriculture and construction.
 Although the Constitution states that legal residents enjoy the same rights and
 freedoms as Andorran citizens, some immigrant workers do not believe that they
 have the same rights and security. Recent legislation has improved the quality of
 life for immigrant workers. Nevertheless, many immigrant workers hold only "tem-
 porary work authorizations." These permits are valid only as long as the job for
 which the permit was obtained exists. When job contracts expire, temporary workers
 must leave the country. The Government prohibits the issuance of work permits un-
 less the workers can demonstrate that they have a fixed address with minimally
 satisfactory living conditions.
 
 
 953
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution recognizes the right of all persons
 to form and maintain managerial, professional, and trade union associations with-
 out prejudice. In accordance with constitutional previsions, a registry of associations
 was established in 1996 and is being maintained. Strikes were illegal under the old
 system, and the new Constitution does not state explicitly that strikes are per-
 mitted.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution states that
 both "workers and employers have the right to defend their own economic and social
 interests." Parliament is charged with adopting legislation to regulate this right in
 order to guarantee the prevision of essential services. Antiunion discrimination is
 not prohibited under current law. However, no trade unions have been formally es-
 tablished.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor, including that per-
 formed by children, is not specifically prohibited by law, but it does not occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Children
 under the age of 18 are normally prohibited from working, although in exceptional
 circumstances children ages 16 and 17 may be allowed to work. Child labor regula-
 tions are enforced by the Labor Inspection Office in the Ministry of Social Welfare,
 Public Health, and Labor. Forced and bonded labor by children is not specifically
 prohibited, but there were no reports of its practice (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The workweek is limited to 40 hours, although
 longer hours may he required. The legal maximums for overtime hours are 66 hours
 per month and 426 hours per year. An official minimum wage is set by government
 regulations. Other, higher wages are established by contract. The minimum wage
 is approximately $4.50 (Ptas 600) per hour and it is enforced by the Labor Ins Rec-
 tion Office. Workers can be dismissed with 15 days' to 6 months' notice depending
 on how long they have been working for the company. A minimal indemnification
 of 1 month's salary per year worked is paid if a worker is fired without justification.
 A dismissed worker receives social security and health benefits for only 25 days;
 thereafter, there is no unemployment insurance. Retirement benefits are controlled
 by a board composed of Andorran nationals, although they represent only a small
 portion of the work force. Labor complaints are heard by the Labor Inspection Serv-
 ice.
 The Labor Inspection Service sets occupational health and safety standards and
 takes the necessary steps to see that they are enforced. The-law authorizes employ-
 ees to refuse certain tasks if the customary level of protection is not provided by
 their employers.
