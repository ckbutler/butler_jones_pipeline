 BOLIVIA
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president and bicameral legisla-
 ture. National and municipal elections held in 1993 were considered among the
 most honest and open in Bolivia's history. Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and Victor
 Hugo Cardenas were sworn in as President and Vice President in a peaceful transi-
 tion August 6. The executive, legislative, and judicial powers are separate.
 The police and the armed forces are responsible to and controlled by the civilian
 Government, but there were incidents of human rights abuses by security forces in
 1993.
 Bolivia, although rich in minerals and hydrocarbons (petroleum and natural gas),
 has a per capita gross domestic product of only $920. About 55 per cent of its inhab-
 itants live below the poverty line. The Government emphasized debt reduction, ex-
 port development, foreign investment, privatization, and a freer banking system to
 strengthen the economic base and accelerate development. The informal economy,
 including the smuggling of contraband across the country's extensive and porus
 borders, has been tolerated by the Government because it provides primary or sec-
 ondary employment to many Bolivians and reduces the need to deal with the social
 and political ramifications of large numbers of unemployed. The economy was ex-
 pected to grow about 4 percent in 1993.
 Human rights abuses in 1993 included instances of mistreatment of detainees and
 prisoners (generally with impunity or leniency for the perpetrators), substandard
 prison conditions, an overburdened and often corrupt judicial system, prolonged in-
 carceration of pretrial detainees, discrimination against women and indigenous peo-
 ple, and poor working conditions in many mines. Bolivia is waging an extensive
 counternarcotics effort against well-entrenched and violent foreign and domestic
 drug traffickers. Government efforts to stem the flow of narcotics resulted in some
 police abuses, including robberies and narcotics-related corruption.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings in 1993, but the police were responsible for at least one extrajudicial killing.
 In this instance, police beat to death a minor in Oruro; the officers involved were
 convicted of misconduct.
 Former dictator General Luis Garcia Meza's 7-year trial in absentia for human
 rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and other crimes,
 ended when the Supreme Court sentenced him in April to 30 years in prison, the
 maximum sentence under Bolivian law. Also sentenced were approximately 50
 codefendants, including former Interior Secretary Luis Arce Gomez and members of
 paramilitary groups active in 1980-81. Garcia Meza remains a fugitive; the new
 Government promised to make his apprehension a priority.

 b. Disappearance.-There were no known politically motivated disappearances
 during 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture. Still, there were occasional reports that police
 officers and prison personnel treated in a cruel and degrading manner detainees and
 prisoners, including minors. In more serious cases, including those involving minors,
 security personnel were rarely tried and punished for such acts. The previously
 mentioned beating death is a case in point. The La Paz police mistreatment of an-
 other minor resulted in severe injuries to his hands. The police involved were tried
 and punished for misconduct. A former president of the Congressional Human
 Rights Committee alleged that one detainee, who denounced mistreatment, faced
 retribution; the detainee was subsequently sentenced to over 10 years in prison on
 false charges.
 In Yacuiba, a policeman raped a minor while she was illegally detained. Charges
 were brought against the policeman; an internal police investigation found him
 guilty. He was dismissed and can be tried in a civilian court. However, police Colo-
 nel Luis Mealla Echazu, who attempted to cover up the crime, received only a reduc-
 tion of his seniority by 1 year, a measure insufficient to convince most Bolivian ob-
 servers that justice had been done.
 Conditions in Bolivian jails are substandard, except for some drug traffickers and
 terrorists, who pay for and receive special treatment. Poorer Bolivians endure over-
 crowding, malnutrition, unsanitary conditions, and drug and alcohol abuse in their
 cell blocks. Most prisoners must pay for their cells. A prisoner who cannot pay the
 minimal amount necessary to secure the smallest cell must become, as a practical
 matter, indentured to a prisoner who owns a cell. In the poorest parts of the San
 Pedro prison in La Paz, prisoners are housed in cells (3 by 4 by 6 feet) with no ven-
 tilation, lighting, or beds (gunny sacks are used as substitutes).
 The food budget amounts to $0.25 a day per prisoner. Malnutrition is common-
 place, and prisoners must supplement their diet any way they can: if their families
 do not regularly bring food, they may work in the prison factory or sell drugs, alco-
 hol, or other contraband. By law, children up to 6 years old may live in prison if
 the incarcerated parent so desires. Government authorities have sought to get chil-
 dren out of the prisons, but many are still there because they have nowhere else
 toere are several prison deaths every year related to malnutrition and poor medi-
 cal care. In May all 1,400 inmates at San Pedro prison in La Paz staged a hunger
 strike to protest prison conditions, the lack of day passes, and the delay in bringing
 cases to trial.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires a court order
 for an arrest except in cases where the suspect is apprehended in the commission
 of a crime; detainees are supposed to be charged or released within 24 hours. Many
 detainees remain incarcerated for months, or even years, before coming to trial be-
 cause of the inefficient and corrupt judicial system. The Constitution also provides
 for a judicial determination of the legality of detention, and prisoners are usually
 released if a judge rules that they have been detained illegally. After the initial de-
 tention, prisoners may consult a lawyer of their choice. Provisions for bail exist, ex-
 cept in certain narcotics cases and bail is generally granted.
 Exile is not used as a unishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The constitutional right to a fair public trial is
 adhered to in most respects. Delays commonly result in protracted judicial proce-
 dures lasting 3 to 4 years without sentencing; 78 percent of the prison population
 was unsentenced in 1993. Investigation, trial, and appeal procedures are so pro-
 tracted that many prisoners eventually serve more time than the maximum sen-
 tence for the crime for which they were charged. At no level of the judicial system
 do judges abide by timetables prescribed by the omnibus counternarcotics Law 1008,
 which does not allow bail or provisional liberty for those held on narcotics charges
 and which requires a three-stage appeal process for all cases, even where a defend-
 ant is found not guilty in the first instance. Consequently, many narcotics defend-
 ants, like other criminal defendants in Bolivia, are detained for long periods, some-
 times years, before their cases are finally resolved. Illiterate defendants may, at
 times, be made to sign or apply their thumb print to declarations incriminating
 themselves without completely understanding what they are doing.
 Defendants have the right to an attorney, to confront witnesses, to present evi-
 dence, and to appeal a judicial decision, and these rights generally are respected in
 practice. The law provides for a court-appointed defense attorney at public expense
 when necessary, but because of shortages of funds and qualified personnel, many
 prisoners do not receive this benefit. Further, even when a lawyer donates his or
 
 
 370
 her services, every step of the Bolivian legal procedure carries a fee. Thus, many
 indigent prisoners are tried and sentenced with no counsel present.
 Corruption and intimidation in the judicial system remain serious problems.
 Judges and prosecutors are poorly paid, making them susceptible to bribery. Bribing
 judges, including those on the Supreme Court, is common practice. Business leaders,
 politicians, and lawyers admit privately that special payments to Supreme Court
 justices and other judges are regularly required and solicited to resolve cases. In Oc-
 tober Supreme Court president Edgar Oblitas and Justice Ernesto Poppe were ac-
 cused of seeking to extort a bribe to decide the extradition case of an American citi-
 zen. At year's end, their impeachment case was before the Congress. Many of those
 forced to pay bribes were reluctant to testify about judicial corruption for fear of ret-
 ribution by the judiciary.
 Corruption is also common in the national police. In April a mjor scandal broke
 over "ghost" officers on the pall S  lice officials were suspended for their in-
 volvement in the scandal, and th  he o personnel was fired and arrested.
 Narcotics traffickers often bribe judicial and other officials to release suspected
 traffickers and their property and to purge incriminating files. In August two nar-
 cotics traffickers facing extradition to the United States apparently successfully
 bribed prosecutors to rlease them from jail.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens' hives are protected by the Constitu-
 tion. However, there were credible allegations that the rural countrnarcotics police
 (UMOPAR) engaged in robberies of peasants, rough treatment of suspects, and a
 showed a general lack of professionalism in the Chapare region where most of Boliv-
 ia's illega[ coca is grown. In response, UMOPAR has increased the human rights
 component of its training.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-No legal or institutional barriers to freedom of
 speech and press exist in Bolivia. Stat-owned and private radio and television sta-
 tio"ns operate. All newspapers are privately owned and are free to express political
 positions without government interference.
 During 1993 there were three attacks on major media figures. In one incident, the
 homo oR a prominent television commentator and news director was firebombed,
 with limitd damage and no injuries. In the second, a bomb was discovered at the
 iate of the home of a television station owner. In the third incident, an investigative
 journalist who had reported on government corruption received threatening phone
 calls, and a small explosive device was discovered at the gate of his home. As of
 the end of the year, no one had been arrested in these cases.
 The Government respects academic freedom. Public universities enjoy autonomous
 status by law; that status is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assodiation.-The rights of peaceful assem-
 bly     association are provided or by the Constitution andare respected in prac-
 tice. La Paz and other cities witnessed great numbers of demonstrations and rallies
 carried out by a wide variety of labor, political, and student organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Ro man Catholicism predominates, and the Constitution
 recognizes it as the official religion. Catholic bishops and other Church officials re-
 ceive salaries from the State and the Government has designated the Catholic
 Church as the coordinator of all official public rligious cremoners. Citizens are free
 to practice the religion of their choice, and an estimated 400 religious groups, mostly
 Protestant, are active.
 However, there were some efforts to impede the activities of non-Catholics. Two
 public hospitals in La Paz posted signs prohibiting the entrance of representatives
 of evangelical groups, religious propaganda, or proselytizing, or any activity by a
 "nontraditional (i.e., non-Catholic) religious group, including donating food to pa-
 tients. The director of one hospital claimed he was under pressure from a Catholic
 priest to post the prohibitions.
 In the Santa Cruz town of Cotoca, municipal authorities passed an ordinance pro-
 hibiting the establishment of any non-Catholic church and regulating" the activities
 of the non-Catholic groups that already exist in the town. In June the Education
 Ministry passed a resolution doubling the time students in both private and public
 schools must spend in Catholic education classes.
 Missionary groups-usually evangelical Christians-are re uired to register with
 the Foreign Ministry as nongovernmental organizations (NcOs). There is no indica-
 tion that missionary groups have been treated differently from other NGO's, and no
 registrations have been disampaproved.
 d.Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and  Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on travel within Bolivia or abroad. The wtv-
 
 
 371
 ernment does not impede emigration and guarantees departing citizens the right to
 return.
 Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president and an independent,
 bicameral legislature. Opposition groups ranging from the far left to the right func-
 tion freely. National elections are held every 4 years. The June national election was
 free and fair, resulting in a peaceful, constitutional change of government. There
 were allegations of electoral fraud, particularly the misuse by the former governing
 party of the registration process to register its supporters disproportionately. Most
 electoral problems were related, however, to administrative error. Municipal elec-
 tions,held in December, were open and orderly. There were no reportedelectoral
 irregularities.
 Suffrage is universal and obligatory. There are no legal impediments to women
 or members of indigenous groups voting, holding public office, or rising to leadership
 in the Government. Because of societal traditions, the number of women who have
 attained prominent positions in politics remains small.
 For the first time in Bolivia's history, an indigenous vice president was elected
 in 1993. Though indigenous groups still have little representation in the Govern-
 ment, the election of Aymara Victor Hugo Cardenas symbolizes the growing political
 power of indigenous groups and their determination that their needs not be ignored.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to the opinions of domestic and international human
 rights organizations and is willing to discuss human rights concerns with them.
 Both chambers of Congress have committees responsible for monitoring the observ-
 ance of human rights. The Catholic Church, the Bolivian Permanent Hauman Rights
 Assembly (APDHB), labor organizations, and the press aggressively monitor respect
 for human rights.
 International groups also observe human rights in Bolivia and visit the country
 without hindrance.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Constitution guarantees equal protection to all citizens regardless
 of gender. However, Bolivian women generally do not enjoy a social status equal to
 that of men. Many rural and urban poor women are unaware of their legal rights.
 Traditionalprejudices, social conditions, and limited political influence remain major
 obstacles to advancement for women. Women in most cases earn less than men for
 similar work. It is not uncommon for young girls to be forced by their families to
 leave school in order to work at home or in the economy. Though there are no legal
 impediments to attaining jobs, women are generally accepted only in traditional jobs
 in the marketplace and as domestic workers. Few professional positions are filled
 by women.
 Many women and women's rights gups made credible charges that violence
 against women is a serious problem. rliminary results of the National Statistical
 Institute (INE) study on violence against women registered formal complaints by
 8,500 women in Bolivia's four largest cities from July 1992 to June 1993. Of these
 complaints, 74 percent were reports of domestic violence (physical, emotional, and
 sexual) and 26 percent described violence suffered in work, public, and social situa-
 tions (psychological abuse, exploitation, kidnaping, physical violence, and sexual
 abuse). The study concentrated only on those crimes specifically related to gender.
 The researchers concluded that violence against women is seriously underreported.
 Women victims of violence report that police are generally unsympathetic and do
 not have the training to deal with crimes such as rape and domestic violence.
 Women are often reluctant to bring charges and thus abuses are underreported.
 Some legal counseling is available for female victims of violence through private or-
 ganizations. The San Gabriel Foundation dealt with 337 cases of domestic abuse in
 the first half of 1993. The predecessor to the newly created National Organization
 for Women, Children, and the Family gave legal advice in over 800 cases of domestic
 violence in 1992.
 Children.-In 1993 the Government created an agency under the Presidency, the
 National Organization for Women, Children and the Family, to help improve the
 welfare of children. However, the lack of adequate resources and pervasive poverty
 limit its ability to carry out its program.
 
 
 372
 Although the Government is implementing a new law for the protection of minors,
 children work in the underground economy.
 Children also help in family stores and work as domestic servants. Statistics pub-
 lished by the Ministry of Planning's education reform team note that in rural areas,
 only 0.7 percent of girls and 1.4 percent of boys finish high school. In urban areas,
 26 percent of girls and 31 percent of boys graduate from high school.
 Indigenous People.-Discrimination against and abuses of people of indigenous
 background continues. The Aymara- and Quechua-speaking Indian majority of the
 population generally remain at the lower end of the country's socioeconomic scale
 and are disadvantaged in terms of health, life expectancy, education, income, lit-
 eracy, and employment. Lack of education, negligible advances in farming and min-
 ing methods, the inability to speak Spanish, and societal biases combine to keep in-
 digenous groups in poverty.
 The civil and political rights of indigenous peoples are protected by the Govern-
 ment. Most demonstrations consist almost entirely of members of indigenous groups,
 and several "indigenous" political parties have sprung up in the past few years. Na-
 tional indigenous organizations, including the Single Labor Confederation of Boliv-
 ian Campesino Workers, the Indigenous Confederation of the East, Chaco, and the
 Amazon, and others, have proposed legislation on indigenous rights and negotiated
 with the Government on many issues. The 1953 agrarian reform satisfied the de-
 mands for land of most Aymara and Quechua people in the highlands and valleys.
 By presidential decree, Bolivia created 10 autonomous indigenous territories (all in
 tropical areas) with special provisions for land use.
 The law prohibits discrimination against indigenous people in employment. How-
 ever, they are frequently paid less than the minimum wage for work performed. In-
 digenous construction workers, for example, are often fired before they complete 3
 months' service, thus relieving the employer from the legal obligation to give sever-
 ance pay and other benefits. The workers will then be rehired by the same em-
 ployer, with the same process being repeated every 3 months. They are also fre-
 quently abused on the job. For example, a 12-year-old indigenous domestic servant
 was beaten to death by her employer in the Tarija department. A criminal case was
 opened against the employer. The new Government, with the involvement of its in-
 digenous Vice President, has promised to undertake measures to remedy the social
 problems of poorer sectors of society.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no legislation specifically directed at problems
 of people with disabilities, though legislation on other topics includes provisions for
 the disabled. For example, the 1992 electoral law required special voting arrange-
 ments for blind people. The law prohibits economic discrimination against the dis-
 abled. However, the Government has not provided services and infrastructure to ac-
 commodate their needs. Societal attitudes keep most disabled Bolivians at home
 from an early age with the result that they are rarely integrated into society
 through education and employment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Bolivian workers may establish and join organiza-
 tions of their own choosing. The Labor Code requires previous authorization for the
 establishment of a trade union, restricts more than one union from establishing it-
 self at a given enterprise, and allows the Government to dissolve trade unions by
 administrative act. However, the Government does not enforce these provisions of
 the law and has used none of these powers in recent history.
 Stemming from its key role during the 1952 revolution, the Bolivian Labor Fed-
 eration (COB) has purported to represent the entire work force, and successive gov-
 ernments have treated it as such, although a number of workers are members of
 non-COB affiliated unions. Approximately one-half of workers in the formal economy
 belong to labor unions. In addition, some members of the informal economy, such
 as unlicensed street vendors, participate in labor organizations. Workers in the pri-
 vate sector possess and frequently exercise the right to strike. By statute, solidarity
 strikes are illegal, but the Government does not prosecute those responsible for such
 strikes nor impose other penalties.
 In 1992 as a result of pressure from the COB, the Labor Ministryrescinded the
 "trade union leave" of two union leaders because of their ties to the American Insti-
 tute for Free Labor Development. The case was resolved in February when the labor
 court ordered the employer to reinstate the employees, and the employer complied
 with the order. In June government representatives informed the International
 Labor Organization's (ILO) conference committee that workers could declare general
 strikes and sympathy strikes, that many of Bolivia's legal restrictions criticized by
 the ILO's Committee of Experts were obsolete and not applied in practice, and that
 
 
 373
 these defects would be resolved in a new general labor law. However, the new draft
 labor law, addressing ILO concerns, remains under review by the new Government.
 The only significant strikes in 1993 centered on the Government's annual negotia-
 tions (in March) with the COB regarding salaries and benefits for government em-
 ployees. When the COB failed to accept the Government's "final" proposal, the Gov-
 ernment decreed the offer would take effect immediately. The COB responded with
 a series of work stoppages and marches, culminating in sometimes violent con-
 frontations with police, especially in some of the secondary cities. After a show of
 force, the Government returned to the bargaining table and made concessions to
 miners and teachers that were sufficient to obtain the COB's acceptance of the over-
 all package.
 After te new Government took office in August, a general strike (political in na-
 ture) called by the COB was declared illegal, and the Government stated its intent
 to withhold pay from government employees who participated in the strike. In the
 past, the Government ad not withheld pa, even when it declared strikes illegal.
 Subsequent negotiations apparently resulted in pay being restored to at least some
 of the striking government employees.
 Bolivian unions are not fully independent of the Government and political parties.
 Union officials are members of political parties which provide them a subsidy. They
 are also paid by their employers (in most cases a government agency or a state-
 owned compan    while working for the union. All unions are underfinanced and de-
 pend on outside support from political parties and foreign nongovernmental organi-
 zations. The political parties all have labor committees that attempt, with some suc-
 cess, to influence union activity, leading to barely concealed political party battles
 within the ranks of labor unions. Labr laws place no restrictions on a union's right
 to join international labor organizations. In 1988 the COB became an affiliate of the
 then Soviet-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-Bolivian workers have the
 legal right to organize and bargain collectively. The Labor Code, however, denies
 civil servants the right to organize and prohibits strikes in all public services, in-
 cluding banks and public markets. Nevertheless, these provisions are ignored by
 both the Government and employees; virtually al government workers are union-
 ized and conduct strikes on occasion. In practice, collective bargaining, defined as
 voluntary direct negotiations between unions and employers without the participa-
 tion of the Government, is extremely limited. Consultations between overnment
 representatives and labor leaders are common but do not result in collective bar-
 ang agreements. In state industries, the union issues a list of demands, and the
 veroment concedes some points. Private sector employers normally use public sec-
 tor settlements as guidelines for their own adjustments, and some private sector
 employers offer workers more generous settlments than what the Government
 grants. The Government generally does not intervene in private sector labor-man-
 agement relations.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers. Complaints are referred to the National Labor Court, which often takes a
 year or more to rule on a question. Labor activists say that the problem is often
 moot by the time the court rules.
 There are seven special commercial or industrial duty-free zones in Bolivia. Labor
 law and practice ae the same in these zones as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and the Government complied with and enforced the law. No cases
 of forced or compulsory labor were reported in 1993.
 d. Mini mum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits the employment
 of persons under 18 years of age in dangerous, unhealthy, or immoral work. Boliv-
 ia's Labor Code is ambiguous on the conditions of employment for minors aged 14
 through 17, and it permits apprenticeship for children aged 12 through 14. This
 practice has been repeatedly criticized by ILO committees; the Government has re-
 sponded that it would present legislation reforming this and other provisionsof the
 Labor Code. The responsibility or enforcing child labor provisions resides in the
 Labor Mininistry. Ing legal provisions concerning employment of children are en-
 forced only in larger state and private enterprises; young children can be found on
 urban streets hawking goods, shining shoes, and he pingransport operators, and in
 rural settings, including mining cooperatives, working alongside their parents from
 an earl y age.
 Children are not usually employed in factories or businesses. Where employed,
 such as assisting transport operators, minors usually work the same hours as
 adults. Bolivia has compulsory education through the elementary level. In practice,
 most urban children complete elementary education, while very few rural children
 do. Less than 30 percent of Bolivian children advance beyond elementary school.
 
 
 374
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government, both by statute and presi-
 dential decree, has established a minimum wage (approximately $38 per month) and
 a system of bonuses and fringe benefits. A worker earning only the minimum wage
 would not be able to sustain a decent standard of living, let alone support a family.
 Workers in most occupations earn more than the minimum wage. Although the min-
 imum wage is well below the prevailing wage in most occupations, it is significant
 because certain fringe benefits are pegged to it. Approximately 20 percent of the
 urban work force-stret vendors, shoe polishers, and lottery ticket sellers, for ex-
 ample-are not covered by the minimum wage. In addition, the minimum wage does
 not apply to rural subsistence farmers, who comprise 30 percent of the working pop-
 ulation.
 In urban areas, only half the labor force enjoys an 8-hour workday and a work-
 week of 5 or 51/2 days. As with many other labor laws, the maximum workweek of
 44 hours is not enforced. Responsibility for the protection of workers' health and
 safety lies with the Labor Ministry's Bureau of Occupational Safety. Labor laws that
 provide for the protection of workers' health and safety are not adequately enforced.
 Although the state-owned mining corporation COMIBOL has a special office charged
 with mine safety, the mines, often old and operated with antiquated equipment, are
 dangerous and unhealthy. In a tradition dating back to the Spanish conquest, many
 employers, particularly in the mining sector, promote the chewing of coca leaf as a
 substitute for food, water, and appropriate rest periods for laborers. The active pro-
 motion of coca chewing by some employers and politicians, by the Bolivian Labor
 Federation, and by persons having a personal financial interest in the manufacture
 and sale of cocaine contributes to conditions of work in many mines that fall far
 below generally accepted international labor and human rights standards.
