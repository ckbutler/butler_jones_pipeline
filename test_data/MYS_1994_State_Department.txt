 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a federation of 13 states with a parliamentary system of government
 based on periodic multiparty elections but in which the ruling Rational Front coali-
 tion has held power since 1957. Opposition parties actively contest elections, al-
 though they hold only 21 percent of the seats in the Federal Parliament; an opposi-
 tion party currently controls one state government. There is political competition
 within the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), the major party in the
 coalition.
 The Government asserts that internal security laws allowing preventive detention
 (and arrests under such laws) are required owing to Malaysia a "sensitive social bal-
 ance," the need to ensure that the peace and stability of the country are protected,
 and concern about endemic narcotics trafficking problems. However, the Govern-
 ment also has used these laws more broadly to detain persons when available evi-
 dence is insufficient to bring formal charges under the Criminal Code, as well as
 to detain political opponents. The existence of these laws serves to inhibit effective
 opposition to government policies.
 The Royal Malaysian Police has primary responsibility for internal security mat-
 ters; it reports to the Minister of Home Affairs. Prime Minister Mahathir also holds
 the Home Affairs portfolio. There continued to be some credible reports of mistreat-
 ment of prisoners and detainees by the  lice and prison officials.
 Rapidly expanding exports of manuactured goods, especially in the electronics
 sector, account for much of the country's economic growth. Crude oil exports and
 traditional commodities (tropical timber, palm oil, rubber) add to Malaysia's trade
 revenues. Strong economic performance in recent years has led to significant reduc-
 tions in poverty, improved standards of living, and more equal income distribution.
 While there is an efficient system of justice based on common law principles, the
 Government continues arbitrarily to arrest and detain citizens without trial. The
 Government also limits judicial independence and effectively restricts freedom of as-
 sociation and of the press. These restrictions make it very difficult for opposition
 parties to compete on equal terms with the long-ruling governing coalition. Domestic
 
 
 violence against women is a serious problem, which the Government is taking steps
 to address.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Rilling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by the Government or any other political organization.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances attributable to the
 Government or any other political organization.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There continue to be instances of police officers abusing criminal suspects during
 interrogation, including strong psychological pressure and sometimes ph
 abuse. In some cases, government authorities have investigated police officials for
 such abuses, but because they refuse to release information on the results of the
 investigations, it cannot be determined whether those responsible for such abuses
 are punished. There were no known instances in 1994 (or in recent years) of police
 officials being tried, convicted, and sentenced for abuse of prisners.
 Malaysian criminal law prescribes caning as an additional punishment to impris-
 onment for those convictedof crimes such as narcotics possession. Judges routinely
 include caning in sentencing those convicted of such crimes as kidnaping, rape, and
 robbery. The caning, which is normally carried out with a  '-inch thick wooden
 cane, commonly causes welts and sometimes scarring.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Tbree laws permit the Government to de-
 tain suspects without judicial review or filing formal charges: the 1960 Internal Se-
 curity Act (ISA), the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance
 of 1969, and the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1985. The Government continued to use
 lon-term detentions without triain cases alleged to involve national security, as
 well as in narcotics trafficking and other cases. Aring to the Home Affairs Min
 istry, as of December, there were 4,115 people being detained without trial; most
 of those detainees are being held under the Dangerous Drugs Act.
 Passed more than 30 years ago when there was an active Communist insurgency,
 the ISA empowers the police to hold any person who may act "in a manner preju-
 dicial to the security of Malaysia" for up to 60 days. According to the Government,
 the goal of the ISA is to control internal subversion, although there is now no seri-
 ous threat to national stability in Malaysia. The Government also uses the ISA
 against passport and identity card forgers, 20 of whom were being held as of Decem-
 ber 20.
 Security authorities soEme es wait several days after a detention before inform-
 ing the detainee's family. The Minister of Home Affairs may authorize, in writing,
 furIter indefinite detention for periods of up to 2 years. Even when there are no
 formal charges, the authorities must inform  detainees of the accusations against
 them and permit them to appeal to an advisory beard for review every 6 months.
 Advisoy board decisions and recommendations, however, are not binding on the
 Home Affairs Minister, are not made public, and are often not shown to the de-
 tainee. A number of ISA detainees have refused to participate in the review process
 under these circumstances.
 The Home Affairs Ministry reported in December that there were 27 ISA detain-
 ees at that time, down from 51 as of July 1993. The Government released approxi-
 mately 27 former detainees subject to "imposed restricted conditions," which will be
 in effect for the balance of their detention periods. These conditions limit their
 rights to freedom of speech, association, and travel outside the country.
 On September 2,the Government detained under the ISA nine members of the
 banned Al Aram   Islamic movement, including the Islamic sect's leader, Ashaari
 Muhammed. The Government said it took these actions on the grounds that Al
 Arqam posed a threat to national security, although it presented no crediole evi-
 dence of this.
 On October 20, after 50 days in ISA detention by the Special Branch Ashaari re-
 canted his beliefs in a 21ashour government-televised discussion with islamic lead-
 ers and confessed to propagating teachings and practices which deviated from true
 Islam. Since founding Al Arqam in 1968, Ashaari had been vigorously expounding
 these views for over 25 years at the time of his recantation. During the teleed
 confession, Ashaari appeared to have lost weight, and his head and beard had been
 shaved. Ashaari and move of his followers were freed on October 28 and Ashaari vis-
 ited the Al Aam commune at Sungai Pencala the next day to meet with his fol-
 lowers. He told his followers that his October 20 confession had been "voluntary."
 Ashaari remains under restricted residence, and his movements are limited to
 Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding state of Selangor.
 
 
 637
 In January the Government lifted restricted residence conditions for six persons
 including the brother of the then chief minister of the east Malaysian state of
 Saba2 who had been detained under the ISA in 1990 and 1991 for alleged involve-
 ment m a secessionist plot. They had been released in 1993, but their movements
 were restricted.
 Amendments to the ISA severely limit j dicial review of detentions, contravening
 international standards of due precess. Uuring 1994 opposition leaders and human
 rights organizations called on the Government to repeal the ISA and other legisla-
 tion that deprive people of the right to defend themselves in court. Some officials
 also have suggested that amendments are warranted, but senior government offi-
 cials insist that the ISA in its present form continues to be necessary to preserve
 peace and harmony in a multiracial society, without explaining convincingly why re-
 iance on the criminal law and the courts would seriously impair peace and har-
 mony. In May the Prime Minister, while not dismissing the possibility that some
 provisions of the ISA could be amended, said that the 715A could not be repealed
 as it was still needed under certain circumstances.
 The Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance was instituted
 after intercommunal riots in 1969. Although Parliament regained its legislative
 power in 1971, the Government has never lifted the state of emergency declared at
 the time of the riots. The Home Affairs Minister can issue a detention order for up
 to 2years against a person if he deems it necessary to protect public order or for
 the suppression of violence or the prevention of crimes involving violence." The
 Home Affairs Ministry in December said there were 200 people in detention under
 the Emergency Ordinance, up from 93 people in 1993. local human rights organiza-
 tions accept this figure as accurate.
 Provisions of the 1985 amendments to the Dangerous Drugs Act give the Govern-
 ment specific power to detain suspected drug traffickers. The suspects may be held
 up to 39 days-before the Home Affairs Minister must issue a detention order. Once
 the Ministry has issued an order, the detainee is entitled to a habeas corpus hearing
 before a court. In some instances, the judge may order the detainee's release. Sus-
 pects may be held without charge for successive 2-year intervals, with periodic re-
 view by an advisory board, whose opinion is binding on the Home Affairs Minister.
 However, the review process contains none of the due process rights that a defend-
 ant would have in a court proceeding. As of December 20, approximately 3,888 drug
 suspects remained under detention or under restrictions equivalent to house arrest
 under this statute. The police frequently rearrest suspected narcotics traffickers and
 firearms offenders under the preventive measures clauses of the Dangerous Drugs
 Act or the ISA after an acquittal in court on formal charges under separate provi-
 sions of those acts.
 A 1989 peace agreement allows members of the Communist Party of Malaya
 (CPM) to return to Malaysia. According to the Government, the agreement stipu-
 lates that they satisfy certain conditions, including taking a loyalty oath "to king
 and country" and renouncing the CPM in writing. Since 1989 more than 650 former
 CPM members have applied to return to Malaysia under the agreement. Sixty-six
 subsequently withdrew their applications because they objected to the conditions im-
 posed by the Government on their repatriation In 1994, 50 to 80 former CPM mem-
 bers returned to Malaysia, including a prominent member of the CPM's Central
 Committee who returned after spending 30 years in exile. The Government has re-
 jected an unknown number of applications by former CPM members to return to
 Malayaia.
 Since December 1989 338 former Communists and 50 dependents have been "re-
 habilitatedu by the Malaysian security authorities and resettled in Malaysia. This
 rehabilitation consists of detention without trial under the ISA at the Kamoting
 Detention Center in Perak state. In addition, rehabilitated former CPM members
 who have reintegrated into Malaysian society are restricted to certain areas where
 security authorities watch them carfully for up to 6 years. These rehabilitated per-
 sons cannot resume full participation in Malaysia's political life until this period of
 surveillance demonstrates to the satisfaction of the police that they have abandoned
 their former ideology.
 In November former student leader Hishamuddin Rais ended 20 years of exile in
 Englan d b returned to Malaysia. Hishamuddin was questioned by police for sev-
 eral days after his return to Malaysia and was released and issued a new identity
 card and passport. The former student activist did not discount the possibility of en-
 tering national politics.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria -Most civil and criminal cases are fair and open.
 The accused must be brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest, and charges
 must be levied within 14 pays.  efendnts have therightto ounsel, bail is avail-
 able, and strict roles of evidence apply in court. Defendiants may appeal court deci-
 
 
 638
 sions to higher courts and, in criminal cases, may also appeal for clemency to the
 King or local state rulers as appropriate. All criminal trials, including murder trials,
 are heard by a single judge. Parlament voted on December 21 to amend the Crimi-
 nal Procedure Code by abolishing jury trials in death penalty cases. Human rights
 organizations and the Bar Council have complained that they were not consulted
 by the Government prior to tabling this amendment. The defense in both ordinary
 criminal cases and the special security cases described below is not entitled to a
 statement of evidence before the trial.
 The right to a fair trial is restricted in criminal cases in which the Attorney Gen-
 eral invokes the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975. These regulations
 governing trial procedure normally apply only in firearms cases. In cases tried
 under these regulations, the standards for accepting self-incriminating statements
 by defendants as evidence are less stringent than in normal criminal cases. Also,
 the authorities may hold the accused for an unspecified period of time before mak-
 ing formal charges. The Attorney General has the authority to invoke these regula-
 tions in other criminal cases if the Government determines that the crime involves
 national security considerations, but such cases are rare.
 The Malaysian judiciary has traditionally been regarded by the public and the
 legal community as committed to the rule of law andhas ruled against the Govern-
 ment in some politically sensitive cases. However, the Government's 1988 dismissal
 of the Supreme Court Lord President and two other justices, along with a constitu-
 tional amendment and legislation restricting judicial review, has undermined judi-
 cial independence and strengthened executive influence over the judiciary in politi-
 cally sensitive cases. These developments created the possibility that Malaysians
 who might otherwise seek legal remedies against government actions would be re-
 luctant to do so and have resulted in less willingness by the courts to challenge the
 Government's legal interpretations in politically sensitive cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-These
 rights are normally respected and protected by law. Provisions in the security legis-
 lation (see Section 1.d.), however, allow the police to enter and search without a
 warrant the homes of persons suspected of threatening national security. Police may
 also confiscate evidence under these acts. In some cases each year, police have used
 this legal authority to search homes and offices, seize books and papers, monitor
 conversations, and take people into custody without a warrant.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and press, some important limitations exist, and over the years the Gov-
 ernment has restricted freedom of expression of media organizations and individ-
 uals. The Constitution provides that freedom of speech may be restricted by legisla-
 tion "in the interest of security * * * (or) public order Thus, the Sedition Act
 Amendments of 1970 prohibit public comment on issues defined as sensitive, such
 as citizenship rights or non- alays and the special position of Malays in society.
 The Government has not brought charges under the Sedition Act since 1986, when
 a trial court acquitted a former president of the Bar Council.
 The PrintingPresses and Publications Act of 1984 contains important limitations
 on press fenedom. Domestic and foreign publications must apply annually to the
 Government for a permit. The Act was amended in 1987 to make the publication
 of "malicious news- a punishable offense, expand the Governments power to ban or
 restrict publications, and prohibit court challenges to suspension or revocation of
 publicationpermits. In December the authorities detained six local leaders of the
 opposition Democratic Action Party under the Printing Presses Act for distributing
 pamphlets without permission. The banned pamphlets dealt with a local land deal
 and compensation payments to residents and businesses. Government policies create
 an atmosphere which inhibits independent journalism and result in self-censorship
 of issues government authorities might consider sensitive. Government displeasure
 with press reporting is often conveyed directly to the newspaper's board of directors.
 There have also been credible reports of efforts by the Government to stop reporters
 from pursuing stories on sensitive subjects.
 In practice, press freedom is also limited by the fact that leading political figures
 or companies controlled by leading political figures in the ruling coalition, own all
 the major newspapers and all radio and television stations. These mass media pro-
 vide generally laudatory, noncritical coverage of government officials and govern-
 ment policies, and give only limited and selective coverage to political views of the
 sopposition or political rivals. Editorial opinion in these mass media frequently re-
 flects government positions on domestic and international issues. Chinese-language
 newspapers are generally more free in reporting and commenting on sensitive politi-
 cal and social issues.
 
 
 639
 Despite strong political influence on the editorial decisions of major publications
 small-circulation publications of opposition parties, social action groups, unions, and
 other private groups actively cover opposition parties and freqently print views
 critical of government policies. The Government does retain significant influence
 over these publications by requiring annual renewal of publishing permits. In June
 the Home Affairs Ministry revoked the publishing license of a popular Tamil-lan-
 piage tabloid, Thoothan (The Messener) after the aper ublished an article alleg-
 mg corruption on the part of the aaysian-indian Minister of Energy, Tele-
 communications and Posts. In May the Government threatened to review the publi-
 cation permit of'the opposition party PAS newsletter, Harakah, after it ran articles
 the Government claimed could disrupt national unity and harmony. Also in May,
 the Home Affairs Ministry directed newspapers not to publish information about a
 confrontation in Penang between police and local Hindu worshipers who were cele-
 brating a religious festival Earlier, in March, the Home Affairs Ministry decided
 not to renew the work permit of a Filipino correspondent for the Manila-based Inter
 Press Service because of what it described as negative reports on Malaysia's treat-
 ment of foreign guest workers that purportedly posed a threat to national security
 and racial harmony. In August the Government seized books, publications, and
 other materials belonging to the banned Al Arqam religious sect and made it illegal
 to possess sell, distribute, or display books, logos, and other printed materials pre-
 pared by the organization.
 In June 1990, Parliament enacted legislation making the government-controlled
 Malaysian news agency (Bernama) the sole distributor of foreign news in Malaysia,
 formalizing previous practice. The parliamentary opposition opposed the bill, argu-
 ing that it would increase government control over foreign news. Although the Gov-
 ernment has not to date used this law to restrict foreign news coverage or availabil-
 ity, n the past the Government has banned under separate legislation individual
 editions of foreign publications. In 1994 the Government censored portions of photo-
 graphs and text in issues of foreign newsmagazines and stopped airing the British
 Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) news programs, allegedly because the BBC's condi-
 tions for use would undermine Malaysia's dignity, according to a government
 spokesman.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and association, but there are significant
 restrictions. These rights may be limited in the interest of security and public order,
 and the 1967 Police Act requires police permits for all public assemblies with the
 exception of workers on picket lines. Spontaneous demonstrations occur periodically
 without permission, but they are limited in scope and generally occur with the tacit
 consent of the police. In the east Malaysian state of Sarawak, groups of indigenous
 people have held peaceful demonstrations to protest government policies and ac-
 tions.
 In the aftermath of the intercommunal riots in 1969, the Government banned po-
 litical rallies. The Government has announced that political rallies will continue to
 be banned during national elections likely to be held in early 1995. While the formal
 ban has not been rescinded, both government and opposition parties have held large
 indoor political gatherings dubbed "discussion sessions!' Government and opposition
 candidates campaign actively. There are, however, some restrictions on freedom of
 assembly during campaigns. During the actual campaign period, political parties
 submit lists of times and places for their "discussion groups. Although theoretically
 no police permit is required, some opposition discussion group meetings in past cam-
 paigns have been canceled for lack of a police permit. Outside of the campaign pe-
 nod, a permit is required, with most applications routinely approved.
 Other statutes limit the right of association, such as the Societies Act of 1966,
 under which any association of seven or more members must register with the Gov-
 ernment as a society. The Government may refuse to register a new society or may
 impose conditions when allowing a society to register. The Government also has the
 power to revoke the registration of an existing society for violations of the Act, a
 power it has selectively enforced against political opposition groups. On August 27,
 the Government declared the Al Arqam religious movement to be an illegal organi-
 zation under the Societies Act and seized computers and other materials belonging
 to the organization. More than 300 members of the sect had been arrested as of Sep-
 tember 22 for being associated with the organization (see also Section 1.d.). In 1993
 the Registrar of Societies deregistered a political party of long standing in the east
 Malaysa n state of Sabah when it formed a coalition with the ruling opposition
 party, and threatened to do the same to the national opposition party emangat '46
 if it continued to claim that it was the legitimate successor to the original UMNO
 party. The threat of possible deregistdation inhibits political activismby public or
 special interest organazations.
 
 
 640
 Another law affecting freedom of association is the Universities and University
 Colleges Act; it mandates government approval for student associations and pro-
 hibits student associations, as well as faculty members, from engaging in political
 activity. Campus demonstrations must be approved by a university vice chancellor.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion. Religious minorities, which
 include large Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian commumties, generally are per-
 mitted to worship freely but are subject to some restrictions. Islamic religious laws
 administered by state authorities through Islamic courts bind ethnic Malays in some
 civil matters, such as family relations and diet. Government funds support an Is-
 lamic religious establishment, and it is official policy to "infuse Islamic values' into
 the administration of Malaysia. At the same time, the Constitution provides for free-
 dom of religion, and the Government has refused to accede to pressures to impose
 Islamic religious law beyond the Muslim community.
 The Government opposes what it considers extremist or deviant interpretations
 of Islam and in August banned the Al Arqam religious movement for what it termed
 "deviationist teachings." In the past, the Government has imposed restrictions on
 certain Islamic sects. It continues to monitor the activities of the Shi'ite minority.
 There are persistent allegations that some state governments are slow in approv-
 ing building permits for non-Muslim places of worship and some non-Muslims allege
 difficulty in obtaining land for cemeteries. In one instance, a municipal council had
 approved the construction of a Catholic Church headquarters only to rescind its ap-
 proval in August 1993, after a public outcry by the predominantly Muslim local com-
 munity. A compromise was proposed which would have permitted the church to
 build a two-story structure but was rejected by church officials. The Government
 has limited the circulation of a popular Malay-language translation of the Bible, and
 some states restrict the use of religious terms by Christians in the Malay language.
 The Government permits but discourages conversion to religions other than Islam.
 Some states have long proscribed by law proselytizing of Muslims and other parts
 of the country strongly discourage it as well. In a March 1990 decision, the Supreme
 Court upheld the primacy of the Constitution over inconsistent state laws by ruling
 that parents have the right to determine the religion of their minor children under
 the age of 18. The decision eased fears of the non-Muslim community over state
 laws that in religious conversion cases set the age of majority at puberty based on
 Islamic law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Malaysians generally have the right to travel within the country and
 Jive and work where they please, but the Government restricts these rights in some
 circumstances. The states of Sabah and Sarawak have the independent right to con-
 trol immigration into their territories; Malaysians from peninsular west Malaysia
 and foreigners are required to present passports or national identity cards for entry.
 The Government regulates the internal movement of provisionally released ISA de-
 tainees. It also limits the movement of some released ISA detainees to a designated
 city or state (see Section i.e.).
 The Government generally does not restrict emigration. Malaysians are free to
 travel abroad, although in some cases the Government has refused to issue or has
 withheld passports on security grounds or in the belief that the trip will be det-
 rimental to the country's image. Most government action is taken because of sus-
 pected drug trafficking offenses or other serious crimes. In an unprecedented move
 m August, the Government revoked the passport of Al Arqam leader Ashaari
 Muhammed and nine of his followers while Ashaari and his followers were still re-
 siding in Thailand.
 In July 1993, immigration authorities withdrew the passport of a poet allegedly
 to prevent him from reading his poems, which supported antilogging activities. Im-
 migration authorities returned his passport in late August 1993. Also in August
 1993, the Immigration Department in the east Malaysian state of Sarawak, on in-
 structions from the Home Affairs Ministry, confiscated the passport of a Sarawak
 native who was on his way to an international conference of indigenous peoples.
 Two other Sarawak natives who planned to attend conferences had their passports
 confiscated in 1992; government authorities still have not returned their passports.
 Malaysians are not permitted to travel to Israel, and in June following a public
 outcry, the Government revoked the passport of Tunku Abduliah, brother of the
 King of Malaysia, after Abdullah made what was described as a "private business
 trip" to Israel. Recently, however, the Government has loosened travel restrictions
 for Malaysian pilgrims to visit Jerusalem.
 According to a report by the Home Affairs Ministry, a total of 455,070 foreign
 workers were issued work permits as of June 1994. However, there may be up to
 1 million foreign workers in Malaysia, many illegal, who work in low-skill jobs in
 the plantation and construction sectors of the economy. Although some illegal work-
 
 
 641
 ers ultimately are able to regularize ther imirtion status, others depart volun-
 tarily after a few months, while some are formally deported as illegal migrants. In
 1992 the Government conducted a registration program designed to regularize the
 immigration status of illegal workers. After the registration program ended, how-
 ever, the Government launched combined police and militay operations to enforce
 immigration and passport laws. In 1994, more than 130,000 foreign workers were
 detained, of whom about 50,000 were deported. On March 27, Kuala Lumpur police
 conducted an immigration roundup of some 1,000 Filipino maids at a prominent
 Catholic cathedral just after mass. The roundup, which included some persons pro-
 ducing valid residence and work permits, led to strong protests from the Philippine
 Embassy. In most cases th     e released those detained within 24 hours.
 In 1991 and 1992, separate groups of asylum seekers (totaling approximately 300)
 from the Indonesian province of Aceh arrived in northwestern  asi        n allegedly
 fleeing violence stemming from a separatist rebellion in Indonesia. These asylum
 seekers requested refugee status, and thei plight has received attention by inter-
 national and local human rights organizations. Although the Government has re-
 fused to recognize them as political refugees, in early 1994 it offered to regularize
 the status of Acehneae in Malaysia and release those being held in detention. The
 Government offer to those in immigration facilities and to the group residing at the
 UN. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) compound included promises of
 on         tations and the same residency permits enjoyed by other guest workers.
 The Acehese rejected the Malaysian offer, contending they were political refugees,
 not economic migrants. As of December 20, 131 Acehnese were being held in immi-
 Gration detention facilities, and 53 were residing at the UNHCR compound in Kuala
 Lumpur. The latter were part of a group of Acehnese who took refuge in the
 UNHCR compound in 1992 demanding refugee status. Members of this group come
 and go freely, although one has been detained. In 1994 there was no evidence of
 forced repatriation of Acehnese although the Government has offered to assist those
 who wish to return voluntarily. According to government sources, approximately 163
 Acehnese asylum seekers had returned home voluntarily as of June 1993.
 Having provided first asylum to more than 254,000 Vietnamese boat refugees
 since 1975, the Government began to deny first asylum to virtually all arriving Viet-
 namese in May 1989 in contravention of its commitments under the Comprehensive
 Plan of Action (CPA) on Indochinese refugees adopted in 1989. From May 1989 to
 November 1993, Malaysia denied first asylum to 10,495 Vietnamese boat people, of
 whom all but 145 arrived in 1989-90. In late 1993 the Government reversed this
 plicy and permitted a boat carying three Vietnamese asylum seekers to land and
 screened by the UNHCR for refugee status under provisions of the CPA. In addi-
 tion, four Vietnamese who had arrived by land and were being held in immigration
 detention facilities were transferred to the Sungei Besi refugee camp and screened
 for refugee status. In 1994 the Government returned to full compliance with first
 asylum provisions of the CPA. In accordance with the CPA, Malaysia finished
 screening Vietnamese boat people in its first-asylum camps. Final appeals were re-
 viewed in September. Malaysian military officers do the screening, with legal con-
 sultants from the UNHOR p resent during each interview. As of December 20, about
 5,44 Vietnamese remained in camps in Malaysia. The Government has reiterated
 thst it will not forcibly return screened-out asylum seekers but will continue to urge
 voluntary repatriation. UNHCR officials have praised the Government's treatment
 of Vietnamese asylum seekers in Malaysia under provisions of the CPA.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The R~ght of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 By law citizens have the right to change their government through periodic elec-
 tions, which are procedurally free and fair, with votes recorded accurately. In prac-
 tice, however, it is very difficult for oppsition parties to compete on equal terms
 with the governing coalition (which has held power at the national level since 1957)
 because of some electoral irregularities and legal restrictions on campaigning, as
 well as restrictions on freedom of association and of the press. Malaysia has a West-
 minster-style parliamentary system of government. National elections, required at
 least every 5 years, have been held regularly since independence in 1957. Through
 the UMNO, Maay domate the rling national front coalition of ethnic-based par-
 ties that has controlled Parliament since independence. Within the UMNO there is
 active political debate.
 Non-Malays fill 8 of the 25 cabinet poats. The Government coalition currently con-
 trois 12 of 13 states. Ethnic Chinese leaders of a member party of the government
 coalition hold executive power in the state of Penang. An Islamic opposition party
 controls the northern state of Kelantan.
 
 
 642
 Women face no legal limits on participation in government and politics, but there
 are practical impediments. Women are represented in senior leadership positions in
 the Government in small numbers, including two cabinet-level ministers. Women
 comprise approximately 6 percent (holding 11 seats out of 180) of the elected lower
 house of Parliament and approximately 19 percent (13 seats out of 68) of the ap-
 pointed upper house. They also hold high-level judgeships.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 After a 2-year struggle for registration, the National Human Rights Association,
 a local human rights society of prominent Malaysians, began operating in 1991. This
 association publicly criticizes the Government, although it does not investigate the
 government except in response to individual complaints. It seeks repeal of the ISA
 and is reviewing Kelantan's efforts to impose Islamic restrictions in that state. A
 number of other organizations, including! the Bar Council and public interest groups,
 devote attention to human rights activities. The Government tolerates their activi-
 ties but rarely responds to their inquiries or occasional press statements. Malaysian
 officials criticize local groups for collaborating with international human rights orga-
 nizations, representatives of which have visited and traveled in Malaysia but rarely
 have been given access to government officials. In 1992 a group seeking to form a
 local chapter of a prominent international human rights organization appealed a
 government rejection of their application under the Societies Act. In 1993 the Gov-
 ernment rejected the appeal.
 The Government has not acceded to any of the major international treaties on
 human rights, generally maintaining that such issues are internal matters. It re-
 jects criticism of its human rights record by international human rights orniza-
 tions and foreign governments. However, during 1993 and 1994, the Prime Minister
 and other cabinet officials were vocal advocates of human rights with respect to Ser-
 bian atrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 Foreign government officials have discussed human rights with their Malaysian
 counterparts, and private groups occasionally have done so.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The cultural and religious traditions of Malaysia's major ethnic groups
 heavily influence the condition of women in Malaysian society. In family and reli-
 gious matters, Muslim women are subject to Islamic law. Polygyny is allowed and
 practiced to a limited degree, and inheritance law favors male offspring and rel-
 atives. The Islamic Family Law was revised in 1989 to provide better protection for
 the property rights of married Muslim women and to make more equitable a Mus-
 lim woman's right to divorce.
 Non-Muslim women are subject to civil law. Changes in the Civil Marriage and
 Divorce Act in the early 1980's increased protection of-married women's rights, espe-
 cially those married under customary rites.
 Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) concerned about women's issues push for
 legislative and social reforms to improve the status of women. These groups raise
 issues such as violence against women, trafficking in women and young girls, em-
 ployment opportunities with equal pay, and greater participation by women in deci-
 sionmaking positions. Statistics on domestic violence are sketchy, but government
 leaders have identified domestic violene as a ontinuing social ill The Government
 is taking steps to address the problem. In May Parliament passed the first domestic
 violene bill after 8 years of lobbying by women's groups. It offers a broad definition
 of domestic violence, gives powers to the courts to protect victims, and provides for
 compensation and counseling for victims. However, it fails to make an act of domes-
 tic violence a criminal offense, and women's groups have criticized it on those
 grounds. Those covered under the bill include a spouse, former spouse, a child, an
 incapacitated adult, or any other member of the family. Cases of wife beating or
 child abuse normally are tried underprovisions of the Penal Code governing assault
 and battery, which carry penalties of 3 months to 1 year in prison and fines up to
 $300. Women's issues continued to receive prominent coverage in public seminars
 and the media in 1994.
 Government policy supports women's full and equal participation in education and
 the work force. Women are represented in growing numbers in the professions, al-
 though their participation as of 1990 in the administrative and managerial occupa-
 tions was less than 1 percent, and they generally receive lower wages. In the sci-
 entific and medical fields, women now make up more than half of all university
 graduates and the total intake of women into universities increased from 29 percent
 in 1970 to 44 percent of the student population in 1990. The participation of women
 
 
 643
 in the labor force increased from 37 percent in 1970 to 47 percent in 1990, including
 a tripling of the number of women involved in manufacturing.
 In the opposition-controlled state of Kelantan, the state government has imposed
 restrictions on all female workers, including non-Muslims. Female workers cannot
 work at night and are restricted in the dress they may wear in the workplace. The
 state government justifies these restrictions as reflecting Islamic values. Given Ma-
 laysia s federal structure of government, there are no legal means, short of amend-
 ing the Constitution, by which the central Government can overturn such state
 laws.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare; it
 spends roughly 20 percent of its current budget on education. According to statistics
 publicized by the National Unity and Social Development Ministry, 1,064 cases of
 child abuse were reported in 1993. The Government has taken some steps to deal
 with the problem. Parliament passed the Children's Protection Act in 1991, effective
 in 1993. In 1994 public attention and debate on child abuse increased significantly
 as Malaysia hosted the worldwide conference of the International Society for the
 Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. In 1994 Malaysian news media featured
 regular reports, commentary, and graphic public service announcements on these so-
 cial problems.
 Statistics on the extent of child prostitution are not available, but women's organi-
 zations have highlighted the problem of trafficking in underage girls. The Health
 Ministry announced that it would work closely with the police to stamp out child
 prostitution, and some brothel owners have been prosecuted.
 Indigenous People.-Indigenous groups and persons are accorded the same con-
 stitutional rights as the rest of the population, along with the same limitations. In
 practice, federal laws pertaining to indigenous people vest almost total power in the
 Minister of National Unity and Social Development to protect, control, and other-
 wise decide issues concerning them. As a result, indigenouspeople have very little
 ability to participate in decisions. State governments make decisions affecting land
 rights in peninsular Malaysia. The law does not permit indigenous persons (known
 as Orang Asli) in west Malaysia, who have been granted land on a group basis to
 own land on an individual basis. In some cases, groups of Orang Asli have appLied
 for titles, but state authorities have not provided them. Land disputes between
 Orang Asl and others resulted in three people being killed in April 1993. In Feb-
 ruary 1994, Orang Asli from Perak complained to their member of Parliament about
 encroachment on their land.
 In east Malaysia, although state law recognizes indigenous people's right to land
 under "native customary rights," the definition and extent of these lands are in dis-
 pute. Indigenous people in the state of Sarawak continue to protest the alleged en-
 croachment by the State or private logging companies onto land that they consider
 theirs by virtue of customary rights. In Sarawak in 1992 the Government arrested
 95 indigenous people who protested these alleged encroachments. The protests and
 arrests continued in 1993, and, in January 1994, four persons were arrested in
 Sarawak for attempting tosop a logging company from operating within what they
 claimed was their native customary rights land area.
 According to government figures, the indigenous people in peninsular Malaysia,
 who number fewer than 100,000, are the poorest grup in Malaysia. However, ac-
 cording to Malaysian government officials, Orang Asli are gradually catching up to
 other Malaysians in their standard of living, and the percentage of Orang Asli who
 were still leading a nomadic lifestyle has dropped to 49 percent.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic minorities are represented in cabi-
 net-level positions in government, as well as in senior civil service positions. Never-
 theless, the political dominance of the Malay majority means in practice that ethnic
 Malays hold the most powerful senior leadership positions in overnment.
 The Government implements extensive "affirmative action programs designed to
 boost the economic position of the ethnic Malay majority, which remains poorer, on
 average, than the Chinese minority despite the former's political dominance. Such
 government affirmative action programs and policies do, however, limit opportuni-
 ties for non-Malaya in higher education, government employment, business permits
 and licenses, and ownersp of newly developed agricultural lands. Indian Malay-
 sians continue to lag behind in Malaysia's economic development, although the na-
 tional economic policies target less advantaged populations regardless of ethnicity.
 These programs which have operated since the 1969 riots, are widely credited with
 helping assure the generally strife-free ethnic balance.
 People With Disabilities.-While the Government does not discriminate against
 physically disabled persons in employment, education, and provision of other state
 services, budgetary allotments for people with disabilities are very small. Public
 transportation, public buildings, and other facilities are not adapted to the needs of
 
 
 644
 
 the disabled, and the Government has not mandated accessibility for the disabled,
 through legislation or otherwise. Special education schools exist, but they are not
 sufficient to meet needs.
 Disabled persons work in all sectors of the economy, but the prevalent feeling in
 society remains that disabled people cannot work. In May the Government did take
 a major step to acknowledge the rights of those with disabilities when the Deputy
 Prime Minister signed the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
 (ESCAP) Proclamation on Full Participation and Equality of Peo le with Disabilities
 in the Asia and Pacific region. By signing this agreement, the Government commit-
 ted itself to implementing new policy initiatives and actions aimed at systematically
 imp roving the living conditions of people with disabilities.
 The Government has sought to register those with disabilities under four cat-
 egories-blind, deaf, physical, mental-and by May had identified 60,632 persons
 with disabilities. It is estimated that there are 180,000 persons with disabilities in
 Malaysia.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-By law most workers have the right to engage in
 trade union activity, and 12 percent of the work force are members of trade unions.
 Exceptions include certain limited categories of workers labeled "confidential" and
 "superskilled," as well as defense and police officials. Within certain limitations,
 unions may organize workplaces, bargain collectively with employers, and associate
 with national federations.
 The Industrial Relations Act prohibits interfering with, restraining, or coercing a
 worker in the exercise of the right to form trade unions or in participating in lawful
 trade union activities. The Trade Unions Act, however, restricts a union to rep-
 resenting workers in a "particular establishment, trade, occupation, or industry or
 within any similar trades, occupations, or industries," contrary to International
 Labor Organization (ILO) guidelines. The Director General of Trade Unions (DGTU)
 may refuse to register a trade union and, in some circumstances, may also withdraw
 the registration of a trade union. When registration has been refused, withdrawn,
 or canceled, a trade union is considered an unlawful association. The Government
 justifies its overall labor policies by positing that a "social compact" exists wherein
 the Government, employer, and worker are part of an overall effort to create jobs,
 train workers, boost productivity and profitability, and ultimately provide the re-
 sources necessary to fund human resource development and a national social safety
 net.
 Trade unions from different industries may join together in national congresses,
 but must register as societies under the Societies Act. Government policy disour-
 ages the formation of national unions in the electronics sector, it believes enterprise-
 level unions are more appropriate for this sector. At year's end, there were six such
 enterprise-level unions registered in the electronics industry (it takes only seven
 workers to form a union) of which four were recognized through elections in which
 they represented 50 percent plus 1 of the workers, and two hadcollective bargaing
 agreements negotiated with their employers. In one case in 1990, a company dis-
 missed all members of one of these unions. The union charged the company with
 union-busting and wrongful dismissal in industrial court. The case was filed in Sep-
 tember 1990; the union appealed an industrial court decision of May 1994 (in favor
 of the company) to the High Court. The court has set a hearing date for February
 21, 1995. Restrictions on freedom of association in the electronics industry have
 been the subject of complaints to the ILO.
 Unions maintain independence both from the Government and from the political
 parties, but individual union members may belong to political parties. Although
 union officers are forbidden to hold principal offies in political parties, individual
 trade union leaders have served in Parliament as opposition politicians. Malaysian
 trade unions are free to associate with national labor societies that exercise many
 of the responsibilities of national labor unions, though they cannot bargain for local
 unions. Enterprise unions also can associate with international labor bodies and ac-
 tively do so.
 Although strikes are legal, the right to strike is severely restricted. Malaysian law
 contains a list of "essential services" in which unions must give advance notice of
 any industrial action. The list includes sectors not normally deemed "essential"
 under ILO definitions. There were 18 strikes in 1993 resulting in a loss of 7,162-
 man days. Most of the strikes (13) were in the plantation sector, only 3 strikes took
 place in the manufacturing sector.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1967 requires the parties to notify the Ministry
 of Human Resources that a dispute exists before any industrial action (strike or
 lockout) may be taken. The Ministry's Industrial Relations Department may then
 
 
 645
 become actively involved in conciliation efforts. If conciliation fails to achieve a set-
 tlement, the Minister has the power to refer the dispute to the Industrial Court.
 Strikes or lockouts are prohibited while the dispute is before the Industrial Court.
 According to 1994 data, the Industrial Court found for labor in 62 percent of its
 cases and for management in 14 percent. The remaining 24 percent were settled out
 of court. The Industrial Relations Act prohibits employers from taking retribution
 against a worker for participating in the lawful activities of a trade union. Where
 a strike is legal, these provisions would prohibit employer retribution against strik-
 ers and leaders. In the absence of any reports of employer retribution, it is not pos-
 sible to assess whether these provisions are effectively enforced.
 There are three national labor organizations currently registered: one for public
 servants, one for teachers, and one for employees of state-based textile and garment
 companies. Public servants have the right to organize at the level of ministries and
 departments. There are three national joint councils representing management and
 professional civil servants, technical employees, and nontechnical workers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Malaysian workers have the
 legal right to organize and bargain collectively, and collective bargaining is wide-
 spread in those sectors where labor is organized. Malaysian law prohibits antiunion
 discrimination by employers against union members and organizers, though some
 union leaders say the legal system is not capable of dealing prmptly and fairly with
 their complaints. Charges of discrimination may be filed with the Ministry of
 Human Resources or the Industrial Court. When conciliation efforts by the Ministry
 of Human Resources fail, critics say the Industrial Court is slow in adjudicating
 worker complaints.
 Companies in free trade zones (FTZ-s) must observe labor standards identical to
 those elsewhere in Malaysia. Many workers at FTZ companies are organized, espe-
 cially in the textile and electrical products sectors. During 1993 the Government
 proposed amendments to the Industrial Relations Act to remove previous restric-
 tions on concluding collective agreements about terms and conditions of service in
 "pioneer industries." Legislative concurrence, which had been expected by year's
 end, did not take place because of other pressing legislative initiatives. The Govern-
 ment took these measures in part to respond to ILO criticism of its previous policy
 with respect to pioneer industries. The ILO continues to object to other legal restric-
 tions on collective bargaining. Some labor leaders criticized amendments to Malay-
 sia's Labor Law in 1980, designed to curb strikes, as an erosion of basic worker
 rights. The labor critics contend that these changes do not confirm to ILO stand-
 ards.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no evidence that forced
 or compulsory labor occurs. In theory, certain Malaysian laws allow the use of im-
 prisonment, with compulsory labor as a punishment for persons expressing views
 opposed to the established order or who participate in strikes. The Government
 maintains that the constitutional prohibition on forced or compulsory labor renders
 these laws without effect.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Children and Young Persons
 (Employment) Act of 1966 prohibits the employment of children younger than the
 age of 14. The act permits some exceptions, such as light work in a family enter-
 prise, work in public entertainment, work performed for the Government in a school
 or training institution, or work as an approved apprentice. In no case may children
 work mre than 6 hours per day, more than 6 days per week, or at night. Ministry
 of Human Resources inspectors enforce these legal provisions. In December a Japa-
 nese electronics firm was fined $5,400 for violating the Children and Young Persons
 Act. This was the first time a large firm has been fined under the Act.
 According to credible reports, child labor is still prevalent in certain sectors of the
 country but not those which export to the United States. A joint report by the Inter-
 national Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the Asian and Pacific Regional Or-
 ganization put Malaysia's child work force at 75,000. In the last nationwide survey
 of child labor undertaken in 1980, it was estimated that more than 73,400 children
 between the ages of 10 to 14 were employed full-time. NGO surveys indicate that
 most child laborers are employed on agricultural estates but there are indications
 that some are being employed in small factories. Government officials deny the ex-
 istence of child labor and maintain that child laborers have been replaced by foreign
 guest workers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Malaysia does not have a national minimum
 wage, but the Wage Councils Act provides for a minimum wage in those sectors or
 regions of the country where a need exists. Under the law, workers in an industry
 who believe they need the protection of a minimum wage may request that a "wage
 council" be established. About 140 000 workers, or 2 percent of the over 7-million-
 member labor force, are covered by minimum wages set by wage councils. Rep-
 
 
 resentatives from labor, management, and the Government sit on the wage councils.
 The minimum wages set by wage councils generally do not provide for an adequate
 standard of living for a worker and family. However, prevailing wages in Malaysia,
 even in the sectors covered by wage councils, are higher than the minimum wages
 set by the wage councils and do provide an adequate living.
 Under the Employment Act of 1955, working hours may not exceed 8 hours per
 day or 44 hours per workweek of 5 1/2 days. Each workweek must include one 24-
 hour rest period. The Act also sets overtime rates and mandates public holidays, an-
 nual leave, sick leave, and maternity allowances. The Labor Department of the Min-
 istry of Human Resources enforces these standards, but a shortage of inspectors pre-
 cludes strict enforcement. In October 1993, Parliament adopted a new Occupational
 Safety and Health Act (OSHA) which covers all sectors of the economy, except the
 maritime sector and the military. The Act established a National Occupational Safe-
 ty and Health Council, composed of workers, employers, and government represent-
 atives, to set policy and coordinate occupational safety and health measures. It re-
 quires employers to identify risks and take precautions, including providing safety
 training to workers, and compels companies having more than 40 workers to estab-
 lish joint management-employee safety committees. The Act requires workers to use
 safety equipment and to cooperate with employers to create a safe, healthy work-
 place.
 There are currently no specific statutory or regulatory provisions which create a
 positive right for a worker to remove himself or herself from dangerous workplace
 conditions without arbitrary dismissal. Employers or employees violating the OSHA
 are subject to substantial fines or imprisonment for up to 5 years.
 Significant numbers of contract workers, including numerous illegal immigrants
 from Indonesia, work on plantations. Working conditions for these laborers compare
 poorly with those of direct hire plantation workers, many of whom belong to the Na-
 tional Union of Plantation Workers. Moreover, immigrant workers in the construc-
 tion and other sectors, particularly if illegal entrants, may not have access to Malay-
 sia's system of labor adjudication. Government investigations into this problem have
 resulted in a number of steps to eliminate the abuse of contract labor. For example,
 in addition to expanding programs to regularize the status of immigrant workers,
 the Government investigates complaints of abuses, endeavors to inform workers of
 their rights, encourages workers to come forward with their complaints, and warns
 employers to end abuses. Like other employers, labor contractors may be prosecuted
 for violating Malaysia's labor laws. The Government has taken action against labor
 contractors who violate the law, and has assessed fines. The minimum fine cur-
 rently assessed by law is $8,000. In principle, serious violators can be jailed, but,
 in practice, such punishments are rare.
