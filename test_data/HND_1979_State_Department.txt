 HONDURAS
 Since December 1972, Honduras has been governed by
 the military, which exercises its authority through a Su-
 perior Council composed of 31 officers. The Government
 is run on a daily basis by a three-member Junta, chosen
 by the Superior Council from among its own ranks. During
 1979, the Junta reiterated the Government's commitment
 to hold elections in April of 1980 for a Constituent Assem-
 bly. Voter registration was completed in August and campaign-
 ing began in December.
 Honduras is a poor agrarian country with serious economic
 and social problems--illiteracy, poverty, malnutrition
 and inadequate health care. The fundamental freedoms of
 speech, press, religion and emigration are respected.
 Legal guarantees against arbitrary arrest or imprisonment,
 and against torture or degrading treatment are observed
 in practice, although the administration of justice is
 hindered by an overburdened and inadequately financed court
 system.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited by the Honduran constitu-
 tion, and there were no verified reports of torture during
 1979.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The press reports freely on allegations of mistreatment
 by local police and the use of unnecessary force and bruta-
 lity is sometimes alleged, most often during the arrest
 process. During 1979 over 120 policemen were reported
 to have been dismissed for committing various abuses against
 the public. The government is aware of police deficiencies,
 particularly insufficient professional training, and is
 attempting to remedy the problem.
 With few exceptions, jail conditions are poor, although
 there exists one model female prison and a similar one
 for males is planned. Normally, access to prisoners is
 not a problem for relatives, attorneys, consular officials,
 or international humanitarian organizations; on occasion,
 press visits are allowed. Problems and delays are occasionally
 experienced, but these appear to be the result of inefficiency
 rather than any deliberate policy to prevent communication
 with prisoners.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Honduras. Habeas corpus
 is guaranteed by the Constitution and Honduran law provides
 for an arraignment within 24 hours of arrest. This appears
 to be the practice in most cases, although hearings may
 be delayed due to administrative backlogs. When there
 
 (348)
 
 
 349
 is reasonable indication of an offense, Honduran legal
 procedures permit the judge to hold a person for up to
 six days for questioning, before determining if charges
 are to be brought. If the judge determines that there
 is sufficient evidence to warrant a trial, charges are
 then specified in a court order. The individual may then
 be held while further investigations are carried out.
 Bail is allowed in many cases.
 Over 150 persons were detained immediately following the
 destruction by fire of a large textile factory in March
 1979. The majority, workers who had been on strike, were
 released shortly thereafter. A   small number of persons
 have been charged with arson and are now being held pending
 trial while further evidence is collected. Others are free
 on bail. Some groups have charged these persons are poli-
 tical prisoners, but their treatment, albeit slow, has
 followed established legal procedures.
 A continuing problem involves the detention of peasants
 on charges such as arson, cattle rustling, wood cutting,
 destruction of fences, and theft, often in connection with
 land disputes and invasions. According to the peasant feder-
 ations, the charges are a trumped-up form of harassment,
 while landowners claim the crimes were, in fact, committed.
 In May 1979 the Communist-dominated World Confederation
 of Labor wrote the Supreme Court asking about fourteen
 campesinos held in various parts of the country. None,
 however, were alleged to have been held for an extended
 period. In November 1979 the authorities deported a Jesuit
 priest who was active in promoting social action among
 campesinos. The deportation gave rise to protests'by a
 wide range of organizations including the church, students,
 labor unions, political parties and others who charged
 the Government acted illegally in deporting and stripping
 of his- citizenship a naturalized Honduran.
 Agrarian unrest, with attendant illegal land occupations
 and sporadic tension, is not new in Honduras. Pressure
 tactics by peasant groups are sometimes used to urge more
 rapid implementation of agrarian reform laws. In fact,
 after moving squatters off land, the Government in many
 cases awards that or other land to them, under the terms
 of the law.
 Honduran military and police have generally been successful
 in handling agrarian incidents without serious violence.
 An exception occurred with the June 1975 killing of fourteen
 persons in a peasant federation march calling for more
 rapid land reform in Olancho Province. In an ensuing trial
 in 1978, two officers were convicted of murder. Their
 civilian and soldier co-defendants were acquitted. Both
 prosecution and defense took the case to an appeals court
 and then to the Supreme Court, which in 1979 confirmed
 the guilt of the two officers and also found eight of the
 remaining nine guilty of murder and imposed lengthy prison
 sentences.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Honduran judiciary suffers from a number of problems.
 Reform has been a stated goal of recent Supreme Court Pres-
 idents, but they have been unable to make much progress
 
 
 350
 in the face of a lack of tenure for judges, an archaic
 legal code and a chronic shortage of funds. Access to
 the legal process often varies with the socio-economic
 standing of the litigant. Inordinately long delays are
 frequently encountered in the administration of justice
 and the system is overburdened. The judiciary's budget
 was increased from $2.5 to $4 million in 1979. It will
 be $5.25 million in 1980. With all its problems, the ju-
 dicary does act, and it is worth noting that, under a mi-
 litary government, military officers have been brought
 to trial in civilian courts and found guilty of crimes.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are no reports involving invasion of the home, the
 sanctity of which is constitutionally protected.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 Honduras is primarily an agricultural country, with coffee,
 bananas, timber and meat accounting for the majority of
 exports. In spite of favorable economic progress brought
 about in recent years by a vigorous development program
 and the high price of coffee, Honduras has many problems
 to overcome and illiteracy and malnutrition remain substan-
 tial. Many farmers produce at little more than subsistence
 levels and per capita income is among the lowest in the
 Hemisphere.
 In 1974 the Government embarked on an ambitious five-year
 development plan, the primary objectives of which were
 to integrate the rural poor into the national economy and
 substantially increase social services in rural areas.
 The plan was relatively successful despite problems of
 implementation. Similar priorities are contained in a
 new five-year plan. Government expenditures for economic
 and social development programs in such sectors as agricul-
 ture, education, and health more than doubled between 1974
 and 1978, and in 1979 represented over 40 percent of the
 total budget. In contrast, defense, including police forces,
 accounted for 7.5 percent of the budget. Significant invest-
 ments are being made in basic infrastructure, including
 transportation, communications and energy. This will con-
 tinue in the next five-year plan.
 Agrarian reform efforts suffer from shortages of resources,
 capital and technical assistance. Programs of agricultural
 research and extension, crop diversification and storage
 have been expanded. In 1975 the Ministry of Health institu-
 ted a program to extend basic health services to the rural
 areas. Primary education is provided to an estimated 57
 percent of primary school-age children, although a high
 percentage of these never finish primary or begin secondary
 school.
 Corruption is a serious problem at most levels of Government
 and society.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 
 
 351
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of speech and religion are respected, although
 books and other materials are sometimes confiscated from
 travelers returning from Communist countries. These confis-
 cations are often vigorously denounced in the press.
 Political parties have not been allowed to hold mass rallies
 or parades since 1972. According to the electoral law,
 they will be permitted to do so during the campaign for
 the April 1980 elections. Political parties are allowed
 to hold organizational meetings and issue declarations
 which are often very critical of the Government. This
 includes the Honduran Communist Party which is tolerated
 despite being officially prohibited from participation
 in the political process.
 Students, workers and other interest groups have held numer-
 ous demonstrations without interference. During 1979,
 school teachers seeking salary raises demonstrated as did
 many groups supporting the Sandinistas in Nicaragua's civil
 war.
 The Honduran press conducts a lively national debate free
 of overt government control. In spite of occasional Gov-
 ernment expressions of annoyance, both Government programs
 and its leaders, -including the top military officers, are
 frequent objects of media criticism.
 In March 1979 a Jesuit-operated radio station was closed
 for two months for broadcasting material the Government
 considered subversive. The press strongly criticized the
 Government's action and after some negotiation the radio
 station returned to the air. The media generally acknow-
 ledged that there might have been some substance to the
 Government's claims, but argued that the Government should
 have brought charges against the individual responsible
 rather than closing the station.
 Such overt attempts at limiting press freedom are rare.
 However, interest groups (including the Government) often
 exert economic pressures to influence media treatment of
 an issue.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 These rights are respected in Honduras, although travel
 to and from El Salvador is restricted because of an unre-
 solved border dispute that erupted into war in 1969.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Since the 1972 coup, the legislature has been suspended.
 Elections to a constituent assembly are scheduled for April
 1980. If precedent is followed, the elected Constituent
 Assembly will convert itself into a legislative assembly
 and choose a president. It could, however, leave the choice
 of a president to a subsequent direct popular election.
 A voter census and registration process began August 15,
 1978 and ended August 30, 1979, with over 1.2 million persons
 enrolled out of an estimated eligible electorate of 1.4 million.
 
 
 352
 Since 1972 civilian political parties, labor unions, trade
 organizations and other interest groups have been free
 to organize and articulate their positions. Political
 parties all have access to the media. While no parties
 are formally banned, only those which are legally recognized
 can appear on the ballot. Recognition is obtained after
 completing a process provided for in the electoral law.
 Three parties are now recognized. The Christian Democratic
 Party failed to overcome legal challenges to its registration,
 which were based on unestablished allegations that the
 party receives funds from foreign sources and advocates
 violence. The Christian Democrats vigorously deny these
 charges, which were never resolved as legal maneuvering
 prevented the issue being aired before the October 20,
 1979 cutoff date for registration passed. As a result,
 that party cannot participate in the election as an organi-
 zation, although individual Christian Democrats may stand
 for election under the label of other parties. Party members
 and sympathizers, if registered to vote, will be able to
 do so.
 Charges of manipulation in the voter registration process
 have been made by the Liberal Party, and are given some
 credence. The Government agreed to a Liberal sponsored
 amendment to the electoral law in an effort to correct
 any irregularities.
 By reason of tradition and custom most women are restricted
 to traditional roles. Of all women aged 15 to 60, 18.4
 percent are considered members of the labor force. Outside
 of the agricultural sector women most often are employed
 as domestic servants, clerical workers, itinerant or market
 vendors and in food processing or in clothing manufacture.
 In public service, women are sometimes discriminated against
 although they hold a growing number of key intermediate
 and senior level positions.
 Honduras has a long tradition of effective and democratic
 trade union activities. The labor movement is well organized
 and has a history of service to its constituency. Trade
 unions are not hampered by the Government and provide members
 with advisory services, health and housing benefits. The
 usual reasons for strikes are for improved wages, grie-
 vances and efforts to gain recognition from employers.
 Although unions are guaranteed the right to organize and
 bargain, Honduras' labor code includes a cumbersome procedure
 of negotiation and arbitration before a union can go on
 strike, resulting in some strikes being declared illegal.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Honduras was one of the first countries to ratify the Inter-
 American Human Rights Convention. The Honduran Government
 cooperated fully with a 1976 Amnesty International investi-
 gative mission, as well as with one which visited in 1979
 to look into the situation in the refugee camps set up
 for refugees from Nicaragua's recent civil war.
