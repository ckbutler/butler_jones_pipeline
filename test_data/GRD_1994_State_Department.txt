 GRENADA
 Grenada is a parliamentary democracy, with a Governor General as titular Head
 of State. When no political party received a clear majority in the 1990 elections, the
 Governor General appointed Nicholas Brathwaite as Prime Minister. He success-
 fully formed a majority government around National Democratic Congress (NDC)
 parliamentarians. The next elections must be held by July 1995.

 The 750-member Royal Grenada Police Force is responsible for maintaining law
 and order. It is controlled by and responsive to civilian authorities.
 Grenada has a small free market economy based upon agriculture and tourism.
 The real economic growth rate was about 2.1 percent in mid-1994, in comparison
 with 1.0 percent in 1993.
 Grenadians enjoy a wide range of civil and political rights. Human rights prob-
 lems included allegations of police brutality in the course of criminal investigations,
 but there were no documented cases. The Commissioner of Police handles percep-
 tions of police abuse swiftly and effectively.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there were no reported incidents
 of torture in 1994. The press occasionally reported individual claims of police brutal-
 ity, some of which arose following the complainants' alleged attempts to resist ar-
 rest. The Police Commissioner supervised officers investigating a few complaints,
 but did not release any results. No one brought a case of police brutality beore the
 courts in 1994. The Police Commissioner can discipline officers in valid cases of bru-
 tality with penalties which may include dismissal from the force. The Police Com-
 missioner has spoken out strongly against police use of unlawful force.
 Flogging, a legal form of punishment, is rare but has been used recently in sex
 crime and theft cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-According to law, the police have the
 right to detain persons on suspicion without a warrant, but they must bring formal
 charges within 48 hours. The police adhered to this time limit in practice. If the
 police do not charge a detainee within 48 hours, they must release the person.
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality of detention within
 15 days after arrest on a criminal charge. The police must formally arraign or re-
 lease a detained person within 60 days, and the authorities generally followed these
 procedures. There is a functioning system of bail, although persons charged with
 capital offenses are not eligible. Persons charged with treason may be accorded bail
 only upon recommendation of the Governor General.
 In 1994 no one was detained for political reasons. Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for the right to a fair public
 trial, and the authorities observe it in practice. There is a presumption of innocence,
 and the law protects persons against self-incrimination and requires the police to
 explain a person's rights upon arrest. The accused has the right to remain silent
 and to seek the advice of legal counsel. The lawyer has the right to be present dur-
 ing interrogation and may advise the accused how to respond or not to respond to
 questions. The accused has the right to confront his accuser.
 Those arrested on criminal charges are brought before an independent judiciary.
 Following a determination by a judicial hearing that there is sufficient evidence to
 substantiate a criminal charge, the judge remands the defendant for trial. The court
 appoints attorneys for indigents only in cases of murder or other capital crimes. In
 other criminal cases that reach the appellate stage, the court will similarly appoint
 a lawyer to represent the accused if he was not previously represented or reappoint
 the defendants earlier counsel if the appellant can no longer afford the lawyer's
 services. Due to the backlog of cases caused by a shortage of judges and facilities,
 up to 6 months can pass before those charged with serious offenses face trial in the
 High Court. With the exception of murder and foreign-born drug suspects, the
 courts grant most defendants bail while awaiting trial.
 The judiciary, a part of the Eastern Caribbean legal system, is highly regarded
 and independent. Final appeal may be made to the Privy Council in the United
 Kingdom. There are no military or political courts.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for protection from these abuses, and there were no reports
 of such actions. The law generally requires judicially issued warrants for searching
 homes, except in cases of hot pursuit. The Firearms Act of 1968 and the Drug Abuse
 Prevention Act No. 7 of 1992 contain other exceptions which give the police and se-
 curity units legal authority to search persons and property without warrants in cer-
 
 
 400
 tain circumstances. In practice, police obtain warrants in the majority of cases be-
 fore conducting any search.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and the Government does not restrict these rights. There are four weekly
 newspapers and several newspapers which publish irregularly. One of the weeklies
 is affiliated with an opposition political party, but the three most widely circulated
 newspapers are independent and are frequently critical of the Government. The
 newspapers frequently c     press releases by the opposition parties, one of which
 regularly provides a weekly column expressing the oppositionpirty's views.
 Grenada has four radio stations. The main station is part of the Grenadian Broad-
 casting Corporation (GBC), a statutory body not under direct government control.
 Grenada's main television station is also part of the GBC. A privately owned tele-
 vision station began broadcasting in 1992, and a cable company began operating in
 the capital area with plans to expand eventually throughothe he country. Through-
 out 1994 the television news often carried reports on opposition activities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and                          n provides for
 the right to assemble for any peaceful purpose. Supporters of political parties meet
 frequently and hold public rllies; permits are _required for the use of a public ad-
 dress system but not for public meetings themselves.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this provision.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreig Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country,
 and all citizens have the right to enter and leave the country, except in special cir-
 cumstances as outlined in and limited by the 1986 Act to Restrict the Freedom of
 Movement of Certain Persons. This law allows the Minister for National Security
 to restrict travel out of Grenada by any person whose aims, tendencies or objectives
 include the overthrow of the democratic and parliamentary system o? government;
 it has not been invoked in the past few years. Anyone so restricted may appeal after
 3 months to an independent and impartial tribunal. The Chief Justice appoints an
 accredited lawyer to preside over such a tribunal.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government
 through elections to be held at least every 5 years. It provides that Parliament sit
 no longer than 5 years and that the Governor General call elections within 3
 months of its dissolution. Grenadians held national elections in 1984 and 1990.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on participation by women in govern-
 ment and politics. Two of the 15 elected members of Parliament are women, as well
 as 2 of the 13 appointed senators, 1 of whom is Senate president. Women account
 for five of the nine permanent secretaries, the highest civil service position in each
 ministry, in addition, a woman is the Cabinet Secretary, the highest civil service
 position in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups operate without government restriction, and the Gov-
 ernment cooperates with visits from international human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based upon race, place of origin, politi-
 cal opinions, color, creed, or sex, and the Government generally adheres to these
 provisions.
 Women.-There is no evidence of official discrimination in health care, employ-
 ment, or education. Women frequently earn less than men performing the same
 work; such wage differences are less marked for the more highly paid jobs. Knowl-
 edgeable women's rights monitors report that violence against women in Grenada
 is common and that most cases of spouse abuse go unreported. The police confirm
 that most cases of alleged abuse are not reported and others are settled out of court.
 Grenadian law stipulates a sentence of 15 years' imprisonment for a conviction of
 rape. Sentences for assault against a spouse vary according to the severity of the
 incident.
 Children.-The Social Welfare Division within the Ministry of Labour provides
 probationary and rehabilitative services to youths, day care services and social work
 programs to families, assistance to families wishing to adopt or foster children, and
 
 
 financial assistance to the three children's homes in Grenada run by private organi-
 zations.
 The Government reported 47 cases of child abuse through September. The law
 provides for harsh penalties against those convicted of child abuse and disallow the
 victim's alleged "consent" as a defense in cases of incest.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not protect job-seekers with disabilities
 from discrimination in employment, nor does it mandate pravision of accessibility
 for public buildings or services. The National Council for the Disabled, which re-
 ceives a small amount of financial assistance from the Government, was instrumen-
 tal in placing visually impaired students into community schools, which in some
 cases previously were reluctant to accept them. The Council also approached archi-
 tects to assist in construction of ramps at various hotels and public buildings, and
 ramps have already been installed at some hotels.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers are free to organize independent labor
 unions. Labour Ministry officials estimate the percentage of the work force that is
 unionized to be between 20 and 25 percent. Union leaders play a significant role
 in the political process, and one labor leader serves in the Senate.
 While workers in the private sector are free to strike at will, workers in the public
 sector must give advance notice. There were several incidents of industrial action
 including strikes in 1994, but all were short-lived and settled with the intervention
 of the Ministry of Labour. All unions were free of government control, and none re-
 ceived government financial support. All the major unions in Grenada belong to one
 umbrella labor federation, the Grenada Trades Union Council (GTUC), which holds
 annual conventions and determines some policies for member unions. The GTUC
 and its unions freely affiliate with regional and international trade union groups.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are free to organize
 and to participate in collective bargaining. Legislation requires employers to recog-
 nize a union that represents the majority of workers in a particular business. The
 law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members and or-
 ganizers. If a complaint of discrimination arises, mechanisms exist to resolve it.
 After all avenues for resolving a complaint have been exhausted between union rep-
 resentatives and employers, both sides may agree to ask for the assistance of the
 Labour Commissioner. If the Labour Commissioner is unable to find a resolution to
 the impasse, the Minister of Labour may appoint an arbitration tribunal if both par-
 ties agree to abide by its ruling. The law requires employers found guilty of
 antiunion discrimination to rehire dismissed employees, but in most cases the em-
 ployee accepts the option of compensation rather than return to work. No such cases
 took place in 1994.
 Unions may organize and bargain anywhere in the country, including in export
 processing zones (EPZ's), which are not exempted from Grenada's labor legislation.
 However, the one unionized firm previously operating in an EPZ closed its Grenada-
 based operations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, and there were no reports of it.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment of children is 16 years. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labour enforce
 this provision in the formal sector by periodic checks. Enforcement efforts in the in-
 formal sector are lax.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legislation sets minimum daily wage rates for
 the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. Most recently revised in 1990,
 minimum wages vary from $4.80 (EC$13) per day for farm laborers to $556
 (EC$1,500) per month for administrators. Most workers, including nonunionized
 ones, receive other benefits from their employers through the collective bargaining
 agreements reached with that firm's unionized workers. Even when these benefits
 are added to wages from a full-time minimum wage job, it is insufficient to provide
 a decent standard of living.
 The law does not prescribe a set number of hours as the standard workweek, ex-
 cept for the public sector which is expected to work a 40-hour week Monday through
 Friday. The normal workweek in all sectors seldom exceeds 40 hours, although in
 the commercial sector this includes Saturday morning work.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but they are minimal, and the
 authorities do not effectively enforce them. Workers can remove themselves from
 dangerous workplace situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
