 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic with a parliamentary
 government elected by universal suffrage. Executive power is
 vested in a President who appoints as Prime Minister the
 leader of the party which gains the most seats in the
 quinquennial election for the unicameral legislature. The
 outcome of the December 1981 election, in which the
 Nationalist Party won 51 percent of the popular vote while the
 Labor Party, in part because of the redrawing of electoral
 districts, took a majority of parliamentary seats, has caused
 prolonged and persistent domestic political conflict. As a
 former British colony, Malta is a member of the Commonwealth.
 The Maltese economy is dependent on export manufacturing,
 tourism, and other service industries.
 Malta's human rights performance in 1985, as in 1984, was
 marked by reported instances of police beatings and
 ill-treatment, political pressure on the judicial system, and
 strains between the Government and the Roman Catholic Church
 over operation of church-sponsored schools.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No known incidents of political killing by government
 personnel or clandestine groups occurred during 1985.
 In November, heavy loss of life resulted when terrorists
 hijacked an Egyptian airliner to Malta and began murdering
 their hostages.
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of disappearance are known to have occurred in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Maltese Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading
 punishment. In several instances during 1985 victims
 testified in court that the police had inflicted inhuman and
 degrading treatment on them. The police denied the charges.
 In one case medical opinion confirmed beatings and cigarette
 burns during police interrogation. In two court cases
 defendants testified that they had signed confessions under
 duress or threat from the police. The judge found the
 defendants not guilty, but no action was taken against the
 police.
 In 1985 Amnesty International wrote to the Minister of Justice
 concerning allegations that detainees had been ill-treated at
 police headquarters between 1977 and 1985.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention is provided for in
 the Constitution and generally respected in practice. There
 are no known political prisoners or persons in political exile.

 MALTA
 Persons can be held for 48 hours of "questioning" without
 being charged. On several occasions during the past few years
 prominent opposition figures or activists have been held under
 this provision. There were no such instances reported during
 1985.
 On September 19, 1985, an Italian citizen, Massimo Gorla,
 President of the European Union of Young Democrats, was
 arrested by the police and held at police headquarters for
 approximately 6 hours. Gorla was to have taken part in
 activities organized by the opposition Nationalist Party. A
 government statement said: "Gorla did not ask for, and did
 not get, the permission required by law." The law referred
 to, the Foreign Interference Act of 1982, requires that all
 foreigners apply for and receive permission before
 participating in any foreign activity in Malta, except
 activities which are purely cultural, educational,
 philanthropic, religious, or of an entertainment nature.
 Approval may not be given for activities which constitute an
 interference in the internal affairs of Malta or the foreign
 policy pursued by its Government or which would give an
 advantage to any Maltese political parties. The next day the
 police deported Gorla from Malta without a court order.
 The Constitution also guarantees the right of habeas corpus.
 However, there is no right to legal assistance during
 interrogation. In at least one case a foreign citizen was
 twice detained and claimed to have been harassed by the police
 without any apparent justification.
 The Constitution prohibits the use of any form of forced or
 compulsory labor, and this prohibition is respected in
 practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees a fair public trial before an
 impartial court. The judicial system, which is
 constitutionally independent, is nonetheless in practice
 sometimes subject to political pressure. Some political and
 constitutional cases which were before the courts in 1984 or
 earlier years have not been resolved. These include several
 constitutional cases brought by the Catholic Church and other
 organizations against the Government during 1984, contesting
 the Government's suspension of licenses for certain private
 schools. Although the Government renewed the licenses for
 these schools to operate until the end of the 1984-85 academic
 year and again for the 1985-86 academic year, the
 constitutional issues in the cases remain in dispute.
 In November 1984 a judge resigned from one of the church
 school cases after the Government proposed a motion in
 Parliament to remove him. Two other judges abstained from the
 same cases in February 1985. When the Constitutional Court
 began hearing government appeals, the Government challenged
 the legality of the composition of the court, but on February
 25 the Constitutional Court declared itself validly
 constituted. Within days both cases were adjourned
 indefinitely by the First Hall of the Civil Court, which had
 originally heard the cases. In April and June the Archbishop
 of Malta and the Federation of Private Parent-Teacher
 Associations requested the court to continue with the cases by
 the appointment, if need be, of an acting judge under clause
 
 
 1039
 MALTA
 99 of the Constitution. No action has been taken on these two
 applications.
 In February 1985 the Prime Minister, in a statement to
 Parliament, said "the Government has never interfered with any
 court when it was doing its duty." He added that he "expected
 the court to do its duty but if the court was not doing this,
 they (the Government) had every right to tell the people this
 and come to the House to censure the court."
 The Court Reform Act of 1981 limits the jurisdiction of the
 courts in the area of oversight of administrative actions by
 the Government. Defendants may not use lawyers in cases
 before the Industrial Tribunal, which has exclusive authority
 in cases of unfair dismissals of workers employed on
 indefinite contracts of employment. Thus, a dismissed
 employee may find himself in the position of having to defend
 his own case before the Tribunal without aid, even if such
 person is illiterate or has no knowledge of legal or
 administrative proceedings. Nor may civil servants be
 represented by lawyers in cases held before the Public Service
 Commission.
 During 1985 there were several complaints that awards
 delivered by the Industrial Tribunal were not based on a
 correct and faithful interpretation of the law.
 A government-established Court Commission, charged with
 ensuring professional and ethical adherence by lawyers,
 remains unrecognized by the Chamber of Advocates.
 Maltese citizens do not have the right of individual petition
 to the European Court of Human Rights.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Protection of the privacy of the home is guaranteed in the
 Constitution and is respected in practice. Most police
 searches require warrants which are issued only after proper
 administrative review. However, any police officer of the
 rank of inspector or higher may carry out a search without a
 warrant. The Postmaster General employs several people to
 ensure that postcards, periodicals, and other publications
 which might be regarded as pornographic are confiscated and
 destroyed. In 1985 the Prime Minister denied opposition
 allegations of telephone tapping.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 generally respected in practice. Persons contributing to the
 opposition press may, however, suffer some form of
 retribution. For example, an opposition youth leader was
 suspended from work for publishing an article in the
 opposition press and has not been reinstated. In another
 instance, a young opposition party political activist sued the
 Government in 1984 for not issuing his civil architect's
 warrant after he had successfully graduated from the
 university. In the protracted court case, during 1985, it was
 revealed that he had written antigovernment articles in the
 press. His warrant has still not been issued.

 MALTA
 Moreover, several ministers in parliamentary statements have
 accused individual Maltese citizens of potentially treasonous
 behavior for criticizing Malta while abroad.
 In 1985 the Government lifted a 4-year ban on the sale and
 distribution of The Times of London. It had imposed the ban
 after that paper refused to publish its reply to an article
 deemed detrimental to Malta. The ban was lifted after The
 Times carried an interview with the Prime Minister.
 Television and radio are state-owned. The opposition's
 request to have its own radio station has been turned down.
 The Constitution requires that there be an independent
 broadcasting authority to oversee the impartial operation of
 the broadcast media. This has not been in existence since
 1981. The opposition party and independent trade unions
 complain frequently that they receive biased television and
 radio coverage. During 1985 a Parliamentary Select Committee
 was established to discuss a number of political issues,
 including radio and television broadcasting. No agreement on
 broadcasting has been reached.
 Government statements issued through the Department of
 Information are privileged, i.e., the right of reply does not
 apply to such statements.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and:Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is guaranteed by law. Police
 permits are generally given for political meetings and other
 public activities of the opposition Nationalist Party.
 However, three European Christian Democrats--all of whom had
 previously criticized the Government--were denied permission
 to address the Nationalist Party meeting in February, and a
 fourth, Italian Christian Democrat Massimo Gorla, was arrested
 after addressing a Nationalist Party rally for violation of
 the Maltese Foreign Interference Act (see Section l.d.).
 Trade unionists and other interest groups freely exercise the
 right to set up associations. The largest labor organization,
 the General Workers Union, has been unified by statute with
 the Malta Labor Party since 1978. There are also several
 independent unions which have, since 1982, been excluded from
 the Maltese delegation to the International Labor Organization
 (ILO). The independent unions were, nevertheless, separately
 represented at the annual ILO conference in Geneva in July
 1985.
 The Constitution guarantees the right to bargain collectively
 and to strike. Government employees who have exercised the
 right to strike have, in several instances, been transferred
 or suspended.
 During 1985 one. opposition party club was requisitioned, while
 a court case on the withholding of permits to build another
 one has been pending for.sQme time. In another case a permit
 to open an opposition club was issued after a court case.
 c; Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice the religion of one's choice is
 constitutionally guaranteed. The overwhelmingly dominant
 religion is Roman Catholicism, and there are small groups of
 Protestants, Hindusi Muslims, Baha'is, and Jews.
 
 
 1041
 MALTA
 In 1985, for the second consecutive year, strains persisted
 between the Roman Catholic Church and the Government
 concerning church-sponsored private schools. Since 1984,
 secondary schools have not been permitted to charge tuition or
 to accept direct loans or donations from parents. The Church
 presented an inventory of its wealth to the Government, and
 discussions among the Church, the Government, and the Vatican
 continue over the financing and operation of church schools.
 The Government has indicated its interest in concluding a
 concordat with the Vatican.
 In 1983 the Government enacted the Devolution of Certain
 Church Property Act, which provided a mechanism for the
 Government to take over a significant portion of the Catholic
 Church's wealth. The court has ruled, in a case brought by
 the Church against the Government, that this law is
 unconstitutional. The Government has appealed this decision.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Neither domestic nor foreign travel is circumscribed. Freedom
 of movement, foreign travel, and emigration are guaranteed and
 respected in practice. A 1984 restriction on the amount of
 foreign exchange Maltese travelers to Italy could take abroad
 was lifted on September 16, 1985.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political activity and partisan feelings run high in Malta.
 In the last parliamentary elections (1981), more than 95
 percent of registered voters actually voted.
 The opposition has charged that the most fundamental human
 right, that of citizens to change their government, is
 threatened because, in the 1981 election, the party which
 received a majority of the popular vote did not win a majority
 of parliamentary seats. A Parliamentary Select Committee,
 formed during 1981, is to address, among other issues, the
 structure of the voting system so as to avoid a repetition of
 the result of that election. No progress on this issue has
 been reported.
 During 1985 the Communist Party of Malta and a new political
 party, the Dwmocratic Party, announced that they intend to put
 forward candidates for the next parliamentary election.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1984 Maltese citizens established a human rights group
 named "Hielsa" (Free). This group, the first of its kind, was
 active in 1985. Amnesty International's Bulletin reported in
 1985 that the organization had written to the Minister of
 Justice and Parliamentary Affairs concerning allegations that
 detainees had been ill-treated at police headquarters in
 Valletta between 1977 and 1985.
 Amnesty International's 1985 Report did not mention Malta.
 Freedom House in its 1985-86 report rated Malta "partly free"
 and described the ruling party as "increasingly
 antidemocratic."
 
 
 1042
 MALTA
 In May 1985 the Vienna-based International Helsinki Federation
 for Human Rights issued a report on "Human Rights in Malta"
 which stated that "the jurisdiction of Maltese courts has been
 circumscribed and their possibility to disagree with the
 government has been undermined by verbal and physical
 attacks... violations of human rights have occurred despite the
 presence of a constitutional court and the very advanced
 provisions of the Maltese Constitution."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Malta, with a population in 1985 of 332,000, had a per capita
 gross national product in 1984 of $3,318. According to
 government statistics, unemployment is 8.6 percent.
 The Constitution declares that the fundamental aims of
 government are to make available to all citizens the highest
 levels of education and social welfare. Both the Government
 and the opposition support the basic rights of individuals to
 own property, to work with just conditions and remuneration,
 to maintain a standard of living adequate for health and
 well-being, and to receive universal education.
 Public economic and social services are extended on a
 nondiscriminatory basis though there are frequent charges of
 government partisan favoritism in the allocation of public
 housing, phone services, and import and export licenses.
 General standards of health care in Malta are average. In
 1984, life expectancy at birth was 72.54 years, and infant
 mortality is 11.7 per 1,000 live births. Government programs
 in health care have concentrated on providing inexpensive
 health care services to the largest possible proportion of the
 population. A prolonged 8-year old labor disputp between the
 Government and the medical association has led many Maltese
 doctors to leave the country. The Government also withdrew
 licenses and support for the remaining church-run private
 hospitals, which were consequently forced to close.
 Maltese public education is free and open to all. The
 literacy rate is nearly 90 percent, and education is
 compulsory to age 16. The primary school enrollment ratio in
 1979 was 96 percent. Enrollment in the only university on the
 island is dependent on sponsorship. Graduates of state
 schools have an advantage as regards admission over students
 coming from private schools.
 The minimum age for employment of children is 16. Maltese law
 guarantees acceptable conditions of work, including minimum
 wages, maximum hours of work, and provision for occupational
 safety and health.
 Women participate freely in social and political life and
 continue to expand their economic role, although they are
 underrepresented in the professions and management. Women
 constitute only 27 percent of the labor force, but strong
 private sector demand for female labor has ensured a very low
 level of unemployment among women. There are legal
 limitations on women's property rights within marriage, which
 derive from traditional Maltese social values. The
 Government, howvever, is working on legislation to remove a
 number of limitations, and restrictions on public sector
 employment of married women were removed in 1981.
