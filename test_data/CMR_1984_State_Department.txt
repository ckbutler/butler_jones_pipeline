 CAMEROON
 Political power in Cameroon is concentrated in the presidency.
 The President makes all major decisions and appoints all
 important governmental and party officials. Cameroon had an
 active multi-party system at the time of its independence;
 under former president Ahidjo all parties were gradually
 consolidated into the Cameroon National Union. Although
 Cameroon's 1972 Constitution provides for a democratic,
 multi-party system, in actuality the sole political party also
 selects candidates for public office, who run unopposed. In
 the 1984 Presidential elections President Biya officially
 received 99.98 percent of the votes cast.
 Cameroon's political system is in part a product of the
 country's ethnic and linguistic diversity, encompassing some
 200 different ethnic groups with over 230 separate languages,
 as well as three colonial heritages (French, British, and
 German). During the 22 years of President Ahidjo's rule, the
 diversity and armed violence in some parts of the country were
 used to justify authoritarian control and harsh restrictions on
 civil liberties. The Ahidjo legacy still shapes President
 Biya's policies, despite the steps he has taken to liberalize
 the political system. Cameroon's economy continues to thrive,
 and its per capita income ranks Cameroon among the middle
 income developing countries, even though it remains plagued by
 many problems of underdevelopment. Growth, propelled by oil
 revenues, continues at a steady pace.
 In 1984, the human rights environment in Cameroon was
 influenced by the Biya Government's continuing concern about
 former President Ahidjo and his supporters and the relaxing of
 some controls on freedom of expression and political
 participation.
 Ahidjo and two former aides were tried in February on charges
 of conspiracy to assassinate President Biya and to overthrow
 the Government. All three were found guilty (Ahidjo in
 absentia) and sentenced to death, but the sentences were later
 commuted to life imprisonment.
 In April members of the presidential security force who were
 still loyal to Ahidjo staged an unsuccessful coup. From 200 to
 possibly as many as a thousand soldiers and civilians were
 killed before government troops regained control. During a
 November 15 press conference, President Biya said that 1,205
 people had been detained, and 491 had been prosecuted, of whom
 232 were acquitted, 205 sentenced to prison terms, and 54
 condemned to death (including three who had been listed earlier
 as sentenced to death, in absentia). Charges in absentia
 against one other person were dropped because he had died from
 wounds suffered in the coup attempt. These figures appear to
 be substantially correct. A state of emergency was declared
 April 18 for the Yaounde area; in addition, a continuing state
 of emergency has been in effect in some parts of Cameroon since
 the crushing of a violent uprising by the opposition Union des
 Populations Camerounaises, in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
 Internal travel was subjected to close surveillance throughout
 the country, and there were numerous arrests and searches
 without warrants. Foreign diplomats were often stopped and
 searched.
 Despite the above, the Biya Government stated on various
 occasions its desire to press ahead with 'democratization.*
 Press controls were loosened during the course of the year, and
 
 
 CAMEROON
 several private newspapers were started. Several employees of
 a prominent English language newspaper were arrested, and later
 released, for publishing articles overly critical of senior
 politicians. Party debates on government policy also were more
 open than they had been previously, and Cameroonians in
 general were less inhibited in discussing political issues.
 Fifteen political prisoners (including one cited in Amnesty
 International's 1983 report) were released in January. As of
 October 1984, there were estimated to be fewer than 10
 political prisoners still in custody.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no confirmed reports of political killing during
 1984. Amnesty International cited allegations that loyalist
 troops summarily executed some people they suspected of
 involvement in the coup, but it has not been possible to
 confirm these reports. There is no confirmation of the murder
 of any civilians by the rebels, although a prominent
 businessman was murdered during the coup attempt by persons
 whom the Government reported to be rebels.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of the disappearance of individuals in
 Cameroon during 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is proscribed implicitly in the Constitution.
 Cameroon's criminal procedures provide that evidence obtained
 by torture is inadmissable. In addition, the penal code
 prohibits public servants from using force against any person.
 However, there were credible reports during 1984 of ill
 treatment, such as beatings, during police intertogation and
 imprisonment. Amnesty International has also reported
 allegations of harsh prison conditions and ill treatment of
 detainees.
 Persons under "administrative detention" (i.e., political
 prisoners) are kept in special camps or prisons. In former
 times, some of these prisoners were confined in totally dark
 cells for long periods of time. It has not been possible to
 confirm whether this practice continues. Access to the
 'administrative detention" centers by families and friends is
 reported to be severely restricted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Cameroonian law a person arrested on suspicion of
 committing an offense may not be held for more than 48 hours
 without a court order, and this provision is generally observed
 in non-political cases. However, after an investigating
 magistrate has determined that the case should be brought to
 trial and has issued a warrant to this effect, there is no
 limitation on how long the person charged may be held in
 'preventive detention' pending trial. Accused persons awaiting
 trial constitute the great majority of persons in the prisons
 
 
 51
 CAMEROON
 at Yaounde and Douala. Release on bail is infrequent. Other
 legal provisions are sometimes used to obtain the release of
 persons detained illegally.
 Citizens continue to be stopped by local police who harass or
 threaten to detain them unless a bribe is paid, but for the
 most part those detained are released within 24 hours. These
 actions are not initiated or condoned by high government
 officials and have been sharply criticized by the President.
 Persons may be held in 'administrative detention' under
 legislation pertaining to subversion.  Such detention by
 regional authorities is initally for one month, renewable
 twice, and may be extended up to an additional six months by
 the Minister of Territorial Administration.
 Generally, those arrested and placed in administrative
 detention do not disappear--their families are told where they
 are and they are eventually released, although the detention
 may be a long one. President Biya released 15 such prisoners
 on January 21 as part of a general remission of sentences. The
 Government is also reported to have released in June four
 asylum seekers from neighboring countries, who had been held in
 administrative detention since 1982. As of October 1984, there
 were estimated to be fewer than 10 prisoners still under
 "administrative detention.'
 Under the state of emergency which exists in Yaounde and
 portions of three provinces, authorities may also order
 detention for up to one week for persons judged *dangerous to
 public security.' The Minister of Territorial Administration
 may also order detention of such persons for up to two months;
 the order is renewable without limitation. This provision also
 provided additional license for the police, the gendarmes, and
 the army to harass or detain anyone whose papers were not in
 order, who was suspected of being a mercenary, or otherwise
 seemed suspicious. These detentions involved both Cameroonians
 and foreigners (including 14 Americans), but generally lasted
 only overnight. The exact number of such short-term detentions
 is not known, but the total is believed to be at least several
 hundred and possibly in the thousands.
 The Government announced in May that 1,053 persons had been
 arrested and detained at length during the state of emergency;
 by November that official figure increased to 1,205. An
 additional group of about 52 accused were either tried or
 released without trial in November and December, but at year's
 end it was not clear what sentences had been handed down, or
 how many more suspects remained in custody. One source says
 that no one was sentenced to death.
 There are an unknown number of former members of the outlawed
 Union Des Populations Camerounaises party in self-imposed
 exile. The Government has held discussions with some of those
 who desire to return, and there have been reliable reports that
 a few have returned.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trial by a presiding magistrate is guaranteed by law, and this
 practice is followed with the exception of individuals held
 under administrative detention. Public trials are also
 guaranteed by law, although exceptions for the public good or
 national security are allowed, and trials which involve
 
 
 CAMEROON
 prominent persons or which are controversial sometimes do take
 place in camera. Magistrates in Cameroon are drawn from a
 corps of career civil servants who must possess law degrees.
 They are generally free from government interference and are
 considered to conduct fair trials. Defendants in felony cases
 are provided attorneys if they cannot afford to engage their
 own.
 Former President Ahidjo was tried in absentia along with
 military officers Ibrahim Oumarou and Adamou Salatou by a
 military tribunal as mandated by the 1972 military procedures
 code. An attorney representing Ahidjo was present on the
 opening day of the trial, but declined to take part because of
 the absence of his client. Court appointed attorneys were also
 present to represent Salatou and Oumarou, but they declined
 representation. Observers from international human rights
 organizations were present throughout the trial, including at
 one session in camera. Amnesty International expressed two
 concerns about the trial: the lack of the right to appeal the
 decision, and the lack of investigation of allegations that
 Salatou and Oumarou had been tortured in pre-trial custody.
 Those accused of involvement in the coup attempt were also
 tried before a military tribunal, but all of the trials were
 closed to the public. A court-appointed counsel was available
 to defendants if they wished, although in some cases there was
 little time for that attorney to prepare a defense. According
 to a government statement released November 15, 491 people had
 been tried, of whom 232 were acquitted, 205 were sentenced to
 prison terms and 54 were sentenced to death (three in
 absentia). About 52 others were tried or released without
 trial in November and December. It is believed that about 45
 people have actually been executed, although Amnesty
 International reported in August that "well-informed sources
 have given the total number of such executions at over 120.'
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both invasion of the home and tampering with correspondence are
 violations of Cameroonian law. There are reports that police
 do enter homes without warrants, however, during periodic
 searches for criminals in the lower income neighborhoods.
 After the April 1984 coup attempt, there also were reports of
 government scrutiny of private correspondence, primarily of
 letters and pamphlets entering the country from external
 dissident groups, and monitoring of telephone calls. Although
 membership in the country's sole political party, the Cameroon
 National Union, is not mandatory, there have been credible
 reports that zealous local party officials have denied routine
 services, such as a driver's license, to persons who do not
 possess party cards. The Government does not condone such
 actions.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution of 1972 guarantees the freedoms of
 expression and press, under Cameroonian law and practice, these
 freedoms are restricted. However, 1984 saw the restrictions
 loosened somewhat. Independent newspapers proliferated,
 including 24 registered as 'general information' papers. These
 newspapers regularly print criticism of government programs for
 
 
 53
 CAMEROON
 education, development, or censorship, and also print
 occasional articles on security issues. There are still many
 taboo subjects, however, and two journalists were detained for
 three days after having written an article critical of a high
 government official. Another journalist was arrested and held
 for five days, and his newspaper temporarily closed, for
 publication of criticism of police corruption. In addition,
 Blaise Pascal Talla, a Cameroonian businessman affiliated with
 the weekly magazine "Jeune Afrique," was arrested in November
 for illegal possession of arms and ammunition. He is not a
 reporter, and the arrest does not appear to be related to his
 duties with the magazine.
 There has also been a continued increase in the amount of
 comment on internal politics in the government-controlled press
 and radio, although the Government affords official journalists
 much less latitude than it does their private counterparts.
 Most official journalists are civil servants, and if they are
 not sufficiently careful in their self-censorship, they can be
 transferred to less desirable jobs. Senior government
 officials recently instructed private journalists on their
 responsibility to represent the views of the Government.
 International magazines are now permitted, with a few
 exceptions, on the newsstands. The government-controlled
 Cameroon Tribune also now carries summaries of these foreign
 articles on Cameroon.
 Informal political discussion appeared more open in 1984 than
 in recent years, and the threat of surveillance and detention
 for the expression of political views diminished. Government
 restrictions on university lecture content and publications
 continue to decrease, but the Government continues to react
 firmly to any signs of student protest. In August, security
 forces rounded up a large number of students (probably several
 hundred) at the University of Yaounde. Most were quickly
 released, but about 10 were accused of accepting money from
 Ahidjo supporters to distribute anti-government tracts, and
 held for several weeks.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association, while guaranteed in the
 Constitution, are restricted in practice and in law. The
 Cameroonian Penal Code prohibits public meetings,
 demonstrations, or processions without prior government
 approval, and organizations must register with the Government.
 The sole union, the National Union of Cameroon Workers,
 operates within the framework of the official party, the
 Cameroon National Union, and top union leddership is chosen by
 the Government. The labor union does not play a major role in
 Cameroon's political life, although it has a membership of
 approximately 450,000 workers in a working population of more
 than three million. It pursues individual worker grievances
 and seeks improvements in government programs for worker safety
 and training.
 The union participates in a government-regulated negotiation
 process with employers, but strikes are illegal. Political
 activity by the trade union, outside of actions designed to
 protect economic and other interests, is prohibited. The union
 cannot have contact with foreign trade union organizations
 without government authorization. Cameroon is a member of the
 
 
 54
 CAMEROON
 International Labor Organization, and union members comprise
 part of the Cameroonian delegation to its meetings. The union
 is also a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Cameroon is comprised roughly of 20 percent Muslims, 30 percent
 Christians, and the rest animists. Freedom of religion is
 guaranteed in the Constitution and is generally respected.
 Officials of the Government and party are drawn from members of
 all denominations. Missionaries have played a major role in
 the development of Cameroon since the 19th century. However,
 members of religious groups such as Jehovah's Witnesses, who do
 not acknowledge the supremacy of the state, have been arrested
 for failure to comply with laws requiring registration of all
 organizations including religious groups. Acts of witchcraft,
 magic, or divination liable to disrupt public order or
 tranquility or to harm person or property are outlawed with
 penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted by
 law. In practice, however, police frequently stop travelers
 for a check of identification, tax receipts, or voting cards.
 The increased use of roadblocks by police, gendarmes, and the
 military since the coup attempt sometimes leads to incidents of
 petty harassment or detention. Exit visas are required to
 leave the country and sometimes are available only after long
 bureaucratic delays. In some cases, these delays may represent
 attempts by the Government to discourage or even prevent
 departure. The Government has also been known to refuse
 issuance of a passport, or to confiscate a passport already
 issued, in order to prevent someone from traveling abroad.
 Cameroonians leaving the country must deposit sums sufficient
 to buy a return air ticket for repatriation should they become
 stranded abroad. There are no restrictions on the right of
 voluntary repatriation. Women must obtain the permission of
 their husbands or fathers to leave the country.
 Over the years, Cameroon has served as a safehaven for hundreds
 of thousands of displaced persons from neighboring countries as
 well as from countries as far away as South Africa. Chadians
 who have fled to Cameroon currently number between 15,000 and
 25,000; displaced persons from South Africa, Zaire, and Angola
 are also currently residing in Cameroon.
 Many of the displaced persons now in Cameroon entered the
 country illegally, and are not registered officially as
 refugees. In some instances, they are living and working with
 members of the same tribe in Cameroon; in other instances,
 entire villages have moved across the border from Chad into
 Cameroon. If they are employed, and pay into the official
 benefit system, they are eligible for the same social and
 government benefits as Cameroonian citizens. There have been
 some reports of exploitation of Chadians who have entered
 Cameroon illegally by business representatives who pay them
 less than the going wage. Those displaced Chadians legally in
 Cameroon are sent to the Poli refugee camp, where they receive
 medical care and services comparable to those received by
 Cameroonians. The Chadians at Poli have established farms;
 there have been no reports of discrimination. A number of
 
 
 55
 CAMEROON
 other displaced persons, including Namibians, are in Cameroon
 as students. There is a reliable report that in mid-1982 the
 Cameroonian Government arrested a total of five asylum seekers
 from nearby African countries and held them in administrative
 detention as Isubversives.' According to the same report, one
 detainee was released in 1983 and the others in 1984, and no
 others are being held.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cameroon continues to be a one-party state ruled by the
 President, with a minimal role played by the electorate.
 Following the resignation of former President Ahidjo on
 November 4, 1982, his constitutional successor, Prime Minister
 Paul Biya, took office as President. In September 1983 Biya
 was elected President of the party, following Ahidjo's
 resignation from that office. While the Constitution implies
 the legality of other political parties, in fact, only one
 party is permitted--the Cameroon National Union. A recent
 revision in the election law now permits in theory multiple
 candidates for the presidency. In the January 1984 elections
 President Biya ran unopposed and received 99.98 percent of the
 votes.
 Membership in the Cameroon National Union party is open to all
 religious and ethnic groups, but the party remains a centrally
 controlled organization. The party elite chooses the
 candidates for local offices as well as for the National
 Assembly. One candidate is chosen for each position by the
 party and submitted to the electorate. The electorate has not
 rejected a candidate chosen by the party since the Cameroon
 National Union was constituted the sole legal party in 1966.
 There was a minor modification of this policy during the 1983
 legislative elections when local party officials were given a
 larger role in the selection of nominees, and during 1984 there
 has been a gradual opening up of debate within the party, but
 the party elite still makes all major decisions.
 Two externally based dissident groups, the Union des
 Populations Camerounaises (Francophone) and the Cameroon Action
 Movement (Anglophone), periodically send letters or pamphlets
 into the country. The Government generally succeeds in seizing
 these documents when they arrive.
 Governors, prefects, and cabinet ministers in Cameroon are
 appointed by the President. The National Assembly plays no
 role in these appointments. Local officials, such as mayors
 and community councils, are elected, but the single candidate
 for each position is selected by the party elite. Voter
 participation is strongly encouraged by the Government.
 Although there is no law which requires individuals to vote,
 local police periodically stop motorists on election day to
 demand their voting cards, and those not possessing such cards
 on occasion have been detained temporarily or otherwise
 harassed.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Cameroonian Constitution affirms support for the freedoms
 guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
 United Nations Charter. Under President Biya the Government
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 5
 
 
 56
 CAMEROON
 has greatly increased the attention it pays to human rights
 issues, both internally as a part of Biya's program of
 "democratization' and in public statements at international
 forums such as the United Nations. On June 27, Cameroon
 acceded to the United Nations International Covenants on Civil
 and Political Rights, and on Economic, Social, and Cultural
 Rights. Cameroon hosted the fourth African seminar on
 international human rights in December 1983, and in February
 allowed observers from the Human Rights League, the Association
 of African Jurists, and Pax Romanus to attend the Ahidjo
 trial. After the April 6 coup attempt, government and private
 opinion in Cameroon held that the Government had gone to
 extraordinary lengths to protect the civil rights of the
 alleged coup plotters and to give them a fair trial.
 When Amnesty International sent a telex to President Biya
 alleging that Cameroon had conducted arbitrary arrests and
 torture, and up to 120 secret executions following the coup
 attempt, the Government responded with a public denial of the
 charges and strongly criticized Amnesty. In a later report
 released August 17, Amnesty International called upon the
 Government of Cameroon: to commute all court-imposed death
 sentences which had not yet been carried out; to release the
 names of all those convicted of offenses arising from the April
 6, 1984 coup attempt and the details of the charges against
 them; to make public details of the proceedings of the military
 tribunals used to hear cases against people detained after the
 coup attempt; to institute a right of appeal before an
 impartial tribunal for all prisoners convicted of offenses
 arising from the coup attempt; and to disclose the number of
 executions which had been carried out since April 6, 1984, with
 the names of the victims, together with the offenses for which
 they were convicted. The Government has not publicly replied
 to those requests. Freedom House lists Cameroon as 'not
 free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Cameroon has one of the strongest economies among African
 developing countries, recently averaging a seven percent growth
 rate due primarily to oil revenues and its relatively well
 balanced, market-oriented economy and prudent economic policy
 management,  Political events during 1984, including the
 Government's anti-corruption campaign, contributed to some
 commercial sector slowdown, and drought has affected
 agricultural production, but activity in both sectors has
 picked up more recently. The GNP per capita ($883.30 in 1982)
 is poorly distributed among the population. The rate of
 inflation is officially estimated at 15 percent, but is
 probably higher.
 Cameroon's population is approximately 9.5 million, and is
 growing at a rate of some 2.7 percent per year. Over 60
 percent of the people still live in rural areas, but the urban
 population is expanding by 8 percent a year.  In 1978, 15
 percent of the urban population and 40 percent of the rural
 population were estimated to live below the absolute poverty
 level. The rapid growth in urban population has produced an
 increased need for basic urban infrastructure, and also means
 that continuing productivity increases in food crop agriculture
 are necessary if Cameroon is to continue to produce the major
 part of its food requirements in rural areas. Many of those
 living below the poverty level are subsistence farmers.
 
 
 57
 CAMEROON
 The average Cameroonian has a life expectancy of 53 years.
 Nationally, the infant mortality rate is 136 per 1,000 live
 births. Chronic undernutrition affects 21 percent of the
 children under age five. Despite this figure, the ratio of
 calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements was 102 percent in 1981. Such
 practices as early weaning, as well as intestinal parasites and
 diarrhea, have contributed to infant and child malnutrition,
 despite the surplus of calories available. Malnutrition is
 more prevalent in rural areas. Based on a 1976 estimate, some
 26 percent of the population is estimated to have access to
 safe drinking water; the figure for urban dwellers is 35
 percent and for rural inhabitants 22 percent.
 The school enrollment rate for children between the ages of 6
 and 14 averages 88 percent in urban areas and 46 percent in
 rural areas, with female students underrepresented noticeably
 in the rural secondary schools. In 1981 at the primary school
 level there were slightly more boys than girls attending school
 (117 percent as compared with 97 percent between 6 and 11).
 Above 15 years of age, the number of boys attending school is
 practically double that of girls (29.8 percent of boys as
 compared with 14.6 percent of girls between the ages of 15 and
 24). In 1981, there was a primary school enrollment ratio of
 107 percent of those available to attend. The excess over 100
 percent is due to enrollment of students over the expected age
 of primary students. School attendance rates are one-third the
 national average in the Muslim north, where only 22 percent of
 the children attend school. The national adult literacy rate
 is estimated to be 14 percent.
 Girls are differentially underprivileged as regards access to
 school and subsequent performance. Girls from the southern
 part of the country, although disadvantaged at the level of
 secondary entrance when compared with boys from the same areas,
 have a considerable educational lead over both girls and boys
 from the eastern and northern provinces. In 1979, less than
 one-quarter of primary pupils in the northern provinces were
 girls as contrasted with 44-47 percent in the littoral,
 western, and center-south provinces, where the high levels of
 enrollment reflect the influence of the Christian religion and
 education since the late 19th century and the corresponding
 incorporation of those areas under colonialism.
 Women enjoy equal rights with men under the Constitution and
 are politically active in the party and labor union. The
 women's wing of the party has created social and educational
 programs aimed at encouraging the economic and social
 productivity of Cameroonian women. Women are represented in
 the modern sector, although not proportionately in the upper
 levels of administration and in the professions.
 There are currently five women in President Biya's cabinet, two
 ministers and three vice ministers. However, there are no
 women governors or prefects, both presidentially appointed
 positions. Women also hold positions as ambassador to Spain,
 and members of the National Assembly. As a result of the 1983
 legislative elections, the percentage of women in the National
 Assembly increased from 10 percent to 14 percent.
