 GREECE
 The Greek Constitution, which was developed and ratified
 following the collapse of the junta and Greece's return
 to democracy in 1974, reflects the spirit of and in-
 cludes many of the elements contained in the United
 Nations Declaration on Human Rights. The Constitution
 became effective on June 11, 1975. It provides for a
 parliamentary system with a Prime Minister as head of
 Government and a President who shares legislative power
 with the Parliament and executive power with the Govern-
 ment. The President is elected for a five-year term
 by the Parliament. The most recent parliamentary
 elections were held in November 1977.
 Greek law has a civil law framework with precedents
 from Roman law, as well as from modern French and Ger-
 man sources. The judicial system is independent of the
 executive branch of Government and the Parliament.

 2,   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Greek Government is committed to the fulfillment
 of the basic needs of its citizens for food, shelter,
 health care and education. Over the years, Governments
 have increasingly met this commitment as Greece devel-
 oped. Recently, a special effort through taxation and
 price restraints has been made to distribute income
 more equitably. Real wages to workers have risen by
 some forty percent since 1974. Primary education is
 free and compulsory, and the Government has sought also
 to make higher education, which is open to all citizens
 meeting academic entrance requirements, more relevant
 to economic development and more accessible by expansion
 of facilities.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of thought, speech, press, religion and assembly
 is guaranteed by the Constitution and the law and re-
 spected in practice. There are laws which guarantee to
 labor the rights to organize, to participate in collec-
 tive bargaining and to strike. Labor exercises these
 rights. Women are free to participate fully in economic
 life and increasing numbers are holding prominent posi-
 tions in all sectors of commercial life.
 While ethnically and religiously almost totally homoge-
 hous, Greece does have several small minorities, in-
 cluding Jews, Muslims and non-Orthodox Christians. The
 law forbidding discriminatory practices against minori-
 ties is respected, In 1977, the Government removed
 provisions of the military service law which were
 especially onerous to Jehovah's Witnesses. The various
 
 
 minority groups have participated in the increasing
 prosperity of Greece and enjoy full political rights,
 Occasional concern is expressed by members of minority
 groups relating to bureaucratic difficulties in dealing
 with the lower levels of Greek state organizations
 about such matters as driving licenses and land trans-
 fers, There is no evidence these difficulties have
 their origins in an organized pattern of practices or
 that they reflect an official policy of discrimination.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is no impediment to freedom of movement within the
 country, to travel abroad, or to emigration. The Con-
 stitution and the law prohibit any such impediment.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Full political rights are enjoyed by all citizens with-
 out regard to race, sex, religion or political persua-
 sion. Political parties may organize freely and take
 an active part in political life. At present, there
 are seven political parties or coalitions of smaller
 parties with a wide range of political ideologies in
 Parliament. Women and minority groups participate
 freely in these parties and there are now ten women and
 three Muslims in the Parliament.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 To the best of the Department of State's knowledge, the
 Government of Greece has not objected to visits and
 investigations of human rights conditions by Amnesty
 International (which has a chapter in Greece) and
 others. We know of no requests for such investigations
 in 1978.
