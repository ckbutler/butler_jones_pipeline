 INDIA
 India, the world's largest democracy, is a.secular republic
 with a multiparty political structure based on Indian
 political traditions and-aspects of the British parliamentary
 system. Free elections are held regularly at natibnal and
 state levels. The last national elections in 1989 resulted in
 a minority National Front Government supported by rightwing
 and leftwing parties. The government, which had been formed
 by V.P. Singh and the Janata Dal party, fell in October. It
 was replaced constitutionally in November by another minority
 Government led by Janata Dal dissident Chandra Shekhar as
 Prime Minister and supported by Rajiv Gandhi's Congress (I)
 Party. On the state level, President's Rule (direct rule from
 New Delhi) remained in force in the state of Punjab and was
 imposed- in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in July after the
 statutory expiration of Governor's Rule, an analagous regime.
 President's Rule was imposed for 1 week in October in the
 state of Karnataka. 'On. November 28, President's Rule was
 imposed in the state of Assam and was still in effect at the
 end of the year.
 The 25 states have the primary role in maintaining law and
 order, but both in law and practice the central Government is
 responsible for protecting the fundamental rights guaranteed
 under the Constitution. The internal security apparatus
 combines national 'and state-controlled paramilitary and police
 forces. The Union Ministry for Home Affairs controls the
 nationwide Indian Police Force, the paramilitary forces, and
 the intelligence bureaus. Over the four decades since India's
 independence, control of law and order operations has moved
 increasingly under the Home Ministry. This tendency stems in
 part from the rapid growth of the intelligence bureaus, which
 function with little reference to the state governments, and
 in part from the increased use of paramilitary forces against
 armed insurrectionists in disturbed areas. These forces are
 -deployed in Kashmir, the Punjab, and the northeastern states.
 Both the paramilitary and the police forces have been
 responsible for significant human rights abuses. The very
 thinly stretched paramilitary, which is often poorly trained
 and equipped ta deal with crowd control and public
 disturbances, has frequently resorted quickly to deadly force
 when faced with large crowds. Ultimately, abuses by the
 paramilitary and police are questions of the effectiveness of
 civilian oversight and the extent of the Government's ability
 to vigorously prosecute offenders.
 India's-mixed economy puts agriculture, most nonfinancial
 services, consumer goods manufacturing, and some heavy
 industry in private hands. The .states or..the central
 Government own and run banking and insurance, air and rail
 transport, public utilities, and key heavy industries. The
 population of 850 million is growing at over 2 percent
 annually;-about 40 .percent of the urban and 51 percent of the
 rural population live below the poverty level as defined by
 the World Bank.
 India is a functioning democracy with strong and legally
 sanctioned safeguards for individuals, a vigorous free press,
 an independent judiciary, and active civil liberties
 organizations. Nonetheless, significant areas of human rights
 abuse remain, many of them generated.by severe social tensions
 related to violent ethnic, caste, communal, and secessionist
 politics and the authorities' reactions thereto. The severity
 of abuses varies from state to state. In 1990 problem areas

 In Punjab,. despite government efforts to bring a political
 solution to the intractable problems of ethnic strife, violent
 activity by militants demanding a separate Sikh state, and
 lawlessness, the number of deaths escalated to 4,987 for the
 year. Exact numbers killed by either side cannot be
 determined. Press statistics showed the breakdown of deaths
 to be: 3,261 civilians, 467 security force members, 1,194
 militants, and 65 persons the Government claims crossed into
 India from Pakistan to perpetrate terrorist acts in Punjab.
 Among those killed were the General Secretary of the All-India.
 Sikh Students Federation, who was murdered by rivals in
 January,. and a former Finance Minister of Punjab, who was
 murdered by Sikh. militants in Chandigarh.
 Sikhqorganizations continue to complain about the Government's
 failure to prosecute those responsible for the deaths of over
 3,000 Sikhs after Indira Gandhi's assassination in 1984. On
 June 1, the Home Ministry announced that the Government would
 expedite the disposition of 118 cases out of 225 pending
 before the courts. Of the 107 cases tried, 11 ended in
 convicti6ns, of which 10 were for minor offenses. Six persons
 convicted of murder in the lth case remain at large while
 appealing their sentences of life imprisonment. Critics
 charge that the principal instigators of the riots are
 protected from prosecution by their high political visibility,
 and that none of those arrested were major figures in the mass
 killing of Sikhs.

 INDIA
 In Bihar, official reports indicated that 35 persons died in
 violent clashes among rival political groups and between these
 groups and the police during the February state assembly
 -elections. Press estimates put the figure at 75 to 80. The
 Bhagalpur Commission, appointed to probe the killing of at
 least 982 people during a communal massacre in that Bihar
 village before the 1989 parliamentary elections, has failed to
 proceed with its investigation. Press reports indicate that
 245 police and civil service personnel who were to have been
 transferred following complaints by survivors of the massacre
 in fact have not been moved.
 In Assam, where ethnic and communal tension continues to
 fester, the United Tribal Nationalists Liberation Front
 (UTNLF) called in September for a judicial inquiry into the
 massacre of 29 tribal people at Borkajuh, claiming that the
 killings were planned by nontribal criminal elements in
 connivance with local police. The United Liberation Front of
 Assam (ULFA) claimed responsibility for several deaths,
 including the death of a local police superintendent, in its
 campaign for an independent Assam. Violence also broke out
 between Bodo tribals and nontribal Assamese as they encroached
 on tribal lands. During the year, Bodo-related
 violence--including train derailments and explosions on buses
 and strong .police countermeasures--was responsible for at
 least 75 deaths. On November 28, President's Rule was imposed
 in Assam, where the ruling Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) government
 had lost control of the law and order situation and the ULFA
 was carrying out terrorist and extortion activities.without
 impediment. By mid-December, the army claimed its sweep
 operation to uproot ULFA strongholds had resulted in the
 arrest of over 800 ULFA members as well as the deaths of 2
 soldiers and 3 terrorists; press reports put the death toll at
 8. During the sweep,-the army reported finding a mass grave
 of at least 16 corpses, some blindfolded or with their hands
 tied behind their backs. A government claim attributing these
 deaths to the ULFA remained unverified. The army denied press
 reports on accusations of torture and rape by soldiers during
 the sweep, but the governor ordered a magisterial inquiry,
 which was still under way at year's end.
 Major political parties, especially in West Bengal and
 Tripura, charged that a number of killings of their followers
 were politically motivated. In West Bengal the Bharatiya
 Janata Party (SJPY alleged that 50 of its workers were
 murdered between March and September by rival political
 organizations of the left. At least 15 persons were killed in
 communal clashes in West Bengal in October following the
 arrest in Bihar of BJP President L.K. Advani. The Tripura
 Chief Minister named a one-man judicial commission to
 investigate the deaths of 16 to 20 persons killed in June and
 July during an election there.
 In Andhra Pradesh, human rights groups accused the police of
 killing 11 Naxalites (a loosely applied term for several
 extremist leftist militant groups) in custody and attributing
 the deaths to "police encounters." On October 9, a group of
 Naxalites set fire to a passenger train near Hyderabad,
 killing 47 and injuring many others.
 In November, dozens of Hindu zealots were killed by police
 wheA they attempted to lay the foundation of a Hindu temple on
 a disputed site now occupied by a mosque in Ayodhya, Uttar
 Pradesh. Hindu-Muslim violence spread to most of the northern
 "Hindi Belt" states as well as Gujarat and the city of
 
 
 1428
 INDIA
 Hyderabad, causing widespread imposition of curfews and
 approximately 700 deaths by mid-December.
 In Jammu-and Kashmir state, the political situation
 deteriorated further as militant'groups seeking Kashmiri
 independence engaged in political assassinations of government
 and police officials, members of rival factions, and alleged
 police informers. The Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant Islamic
 separatist organization, claimed responsibility for the
 kidnaping and killing of Mir Mustafa, a former member of the
 Jammu and Kashmir legislature who had been an intermediary
 between the Government and militants during negotiations in
 1989. In April militants murdered three public officials,
 including the Vice Chancellor of Srinagar University, and
 reportedly assassinated.the Mirwaiz Moulvi Farooq, a revered
 cleric, on May 21. On July 5, all of Kashmir and part of
 Jammu were-declared "disturbed areas" under a new act of
 Parliament-the Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act of
 1990. The Act gave sweeping powers to relatively low-ranking
 security petsonnel, including authority to shoot to kill
 suspected lawbreakers or disturbers of the peace and to
 destroy structures suspected of harboring militants or arms.
 (See also Section 1.g.)
 b. Disappearance
 Indian law provides safeguards against disappearance by
 requiring an arrested person to be brought before a magistrate
 within 24 hours of arrest. These safeguards are'not always
 applied in practice; moreover, they do not apply to persons
 arrested under national security laws. The right to judicial
 determination of the legality of the detention may be sought
 from the higher courts to redress unlawful detention, but
 these rights are often unavailable to families of poor or
 uneducated victims. Reports of disappearance in Punjab and
 elsewhere are extremely difficult to verify.
 The People's Tribunal for Human Rights, in a sample survey
 documented dozens of cases of young men, arbitrarily detained
 and held incommunicado in Punjab, who have not been located by
 -their relatives, despite persistent attempts.to establish
 their whereabouts.
 A July report by the Committee for Initiative on Kashmir
 states many younger men who were picked up by the security
 forces in Kashmir failed to return." Local attorneys claim
 security forces routinely evade or ignore court orders to
 provide information on people who have disappeared. Militant
 groups in Kashmir also engaged in kidnaping government and
 police officials.as well as members of rival factions.
 The U.N. Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary
 Disappearance received further affidavits in 1990 to
 substantiate earlier charges that the state armed constabulary
 was implicated in the disappearance of at least 33 unarmed
 civilians thoughout India.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and cruel treatment or punishment are prohibited by
 law, and confessions or -information extracted by force may not
 be admitted in court. Significantly, however, under Section
 15 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act
 (TADA), a confession made to a police officer is admissible in
 evidence, provided the police have "reason to believe that it
 is being made voluntarily." The frequent press accounts of
 
 
 1429
 INDIA
 police brutality in obtaining confessions from detainees under
 this law have fueled widespread criticism of police excesses.
 Indian press and human rights groups continued to document
 allegations of torture and abuse of detainees by police in
 many Indian states. In theory, citizens may lodge a complaint
 for assault, wrongful confinement, and death in custody but in
 many places, including Delhi, prosecution of policemen
 requires the permission of the police hierarchy. In the case
 of a death in police custody, magistrates are empowered by
 sections of the Criminal Procedure Code to hold inquiries;
 however, such inquiries may be conducted by an executive, not
 a judicial, magistrate, and the results of these inquiries are
 generally not made available, except to say departmental
 action was initiated against the concerned police officials if
 deemed necessary.
 Numerous Indian human.rights groups have detailed cases of
 torture during interrogation by security forces in Kashmir,
 including beatings, burning with cigarettes, suspension by the
 feet, and electric shocks. Under the special powers given to
 the security forces in Kashmir (see Section l.d.), they are
 not liable for prosecution for their actions in civil courts,
 leaving victims no legal forum for the redress of grievances
 other than courts-martial. Army and security force
 authorities reportedly have, in some cases, court-martialed or
 disciplined members found guilty of torture, but the results
 of these actions generally have not been made public and
 cannot be confirmed.
 Press reports detailed many cases of prison abuse in W[est
 Bengal. These included at least two cases of detainee deaths
 as well as torture and the widespread mistreatment of women
 prisoners. Early in the year, at least 10 mentally ill women
 who had not been charged with any crime died in Calcutta's
 Presidency jail. According to press reports, funds for food
 and medicine were misappropriated by jail authorities,
 resulting in malnutrition among the inmates. There were
 additional allegations of sexual abuse of inmates at the
 prison. The Calcutta High Court in 1999 sentenced two police
 officers ta prison for terms of 2 to 7 years and'a third
 officer for 1 to 3 years for causing the death of a prisoner
 in 198G.
 In the northeast, the police and paramilitary were accused of
 torturing suspected radicals in Assam. In Manipur, court
 hearings before a sessions judge were under way regarding
 allegations of widespread torture and reprisal killings by
 members of the Assam Rifles in northeast Manipur during the
 summer of 1987. An AI report released in October gives a
 detailed account of 11 men who were allegedly tortured and
 subsequently executed by the Assam Rifles during this period.
 Scheduled castes and tribes remain particularly vulnerable to
 police violence. There have been numerous allegations of the
 mass rape of female members of the scheduled castes and tribes
 by the police. On February 18, in the village of Pararia,
 Bihar, about three dozen police allegedly beat and raped
 villagers. No arrests were made, but 14 policemen were
 suspended for complicity in the assaults. On May 10-11, Assam
 police reportedly gang-raped 37 women, including minors, in
 three Bodo villages in the Barpeta district. The Guwahati
 High Court ordered compensation of approximately $1,400 (about
 
 
 1430
 INDIA
 3 1times the per capita gross fiational product) to be paid to
 eack ofethe victims and-ordered a magisterial inquiry into the
 matter.
 In mid-October, a Canadian woman traveling in Kashmir was
 allegedly gang-raped by security forces in Srinagar after
 being arrested and questioned. Two members of the National
 Security Guards were arrested in the case and, after legal
 maneuvering by the accused to have the trial moved out of
 Kashmir,, a:ourt-martial was set to begin at'year's end.
 Press reports -about prison conditions include charges of
 sexual-abuse of prisoners, and the use of prisoners by prison
 official's for domestic labor. Women constitute 2 to 6 percent
 9f the-total prison population, according to the 1987 Justice
 Krishna Iyer report, which also noted that cells are seldom
 segregated. In any case, it was only after a female inmate
 had beenoraped-in custody that she could be transferred to a
 cell staffed by Women, the report continued. At least 20,000
 children and youngsters under 18 years bld are reported to be
 in jail, comprising nearly one-eighth of the prison
 population. Although Parliament passed the Children's Law in
 1960 to safeguardyoung prisoners against abuse and
 exploitation, most states have not followed suit-with their
 own laws to implement it; consequently, nearly 40 percent of
 the 380 districts in India are without a children's law. The
 Supreme Court has criticized the states for not providing
 separate'facilities for children in jails and for not
 constructing reformatory institutions.
 Three classes of Indian prison facilities exist. Class "C"
 cells are the worst. They often have dirt floors, no
 furnishings, poor quality food, are overcrowded, and the use
 of handcuffs and fetters is common. Prisoners in these cells
 reportedly suffer the most abuse, such as beatings and being
 forced to-kneel for long periods. Prisoners are designated
 class "C," not based on the nature or seveiity of the crimes
 involved, but on their standing in society--those who cannot
 prove they are either college graduates or income taxpayers
 when they come before the magistrate are class "C." Class "B"
 cells are for college graduates and taxpayers, again  '
 regardless of the'crimes involved. Crowding is less of a
 problem in "B" cells and the food and treatment of prisoners
 are reportedly better than in class "C." Class "A" cells are
 for "prominent persons," as designated by the Government.
 Prisoners are accorded private rooms, visits, and adequate
 food, which can be supplemenmted by their families. In fact,
 very few prisons actually maintain class "A" cells; class "A"
 prisoners are usually held in government quest houses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires that an arrested person be informed
 of the grounds for arrest, given the right to be represented
 by counsel, and produced before a magistrate within 24 hours
 of arrest. At this initial appearance, the accused must
 either be remanded for further investigation or released.
 These provisions have been upheld by the Supreme Court and are
 generally respected in states and areas not experiencing an
 internal security problem or insurgency.
 Despite the legal safeguards, there were credible reports of
 widespread arbitrary arrest or detention. 'In Kashmir, where
 armed militants demand independence for the state, a
 widespread breakdown of the legal system occurred. Local
 
 
 1431
 
 INDIA
 courts barely functioned, and there were no trials or
 convictions of alleged terrorists even though some militants
 had been in detention for over a year. Critics allege that
 prior to July, when Kashmir came under disturbed areas
 legislation, hundreds and perhaps thousands of suspects were
 detained without due process, sometimes for months. Members
 of the Kashmir Bar Association claimed at midyear that between
 11,000 and 15,000 Kashmiris had been so detained. By
 mid-October, according to this group, the High Court in
 Srinagar had failed to address over 3,000 writs of habeas
 corpus which demanded that the Government produce in court
 particular persons allegedly held in custody. The movement of
 the judicial process is further slowed by fear of reprisals
 against those involved in terrorist-related cases. Judges are
 reportedly reluctant to sit, ahd witnesses often do not
 appear, at such trials.
 The judicial authorities in Punjab failed to bring to trial a
 number of alleged terrorists who had beencharged, as well as
 some police offenders. In March, a Haryana High Court judge
 ordered the release of three young men held in detention for
 months by the Central Reserve Police Force in Amritsar,
 Punjab, without reporting their detention to the judicial
 authorities. The High Court warrant officer was unable to get
 the judicial orders enforced, and the youths were removed to
 another unknown location.
 The Constitution permits the enactment of preventive detention
 laws in the event of threats to public welfare and national
 security. Such laws provide for limits on the length of
 detention (up to 2 years) and for judical review of such
 detention. Several laws of this type remain in effect.
 The National Security Act (NSA) permits detention of security
 risks; police anywhere in India (except Kashmir) may charge
 suspects under NSA provisions. To be released from detention
 under this law, a court must determine that all grounds for
 detention are invalid. NSA detainees are permitted visits by
 family members and lawyers. Under NSA's strong special and
 preventive detention provisions, a person may be detained for
 up to 1 year without charge or trial (2 years in Punjab) on
 loosely defined security grounds, but must be brought before a
 Defense Ministry Advisory Board within 7 days of arrest. At
 this time the detainee may be released on the basis of
 "insufficient grounds." According to government statistics,
 427 people were detained under the provisions of the NSA in
 the first 6 months of 1990. Human rights groups claim,
 however, that no accurate record is, kept of the many people
 held without charges on nonsecurity grounds, so they have no
 way of making accurate estimates of the ndmber of persons in
 detention.
 The TADA, tbough enacted to fight terrorism in Punjab, is
 applicable in all states except Jammu and Kashmir, which falls
 under the Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act of July 1990.
 Fourteen of 25 state governments currently have invoked TADA.
 In designated areas, pursuant to the TADA, incommunicado
 detention is permitted. The Act permits maximum detention of
 2 years, but it provides the right of review and access to
 legal counsel. The Home Minister announced that between the
 Act's institution in 1987 and March 1989, 7,969 persons had
 been arrested under the TADA in Punjab. Since TADA was
 appried to Gujarat in 1987, 4,491 people had been arrested
 under the Act through June 1989. In its 1990 report, Amnesty
 International (AI) stated that several thousand political
 
 
 1432
 
 INDIA
 prisoners were held without charge or trial in India under
 antiterrorist or preventive detention laws. TADA remained in
 force at the end of the year.
 The upper house of Parliament voted on April 5 to repeal the
 59th amendment to the Constitution, following the December
 1989 vote to repeal by the lower house. The amendment had
 annulled the constitutional guarantees to life and liberty
 during an emergency, and permitted President's Rule in any
 state for up to 3 years without parliamentary approval.
 Before its repeal, the amendment had only been invoked in
 Punjab.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 India's legal procedures generally assure a fair trial, but
 the process can be drawn out and inaccessible to the poor.
 Defendants have the right to choose counsel from an Indian bar
 that is fully independent of the Government. The Indian bar
 has a record of vigorously protesting infringements of human
 rights. Effective appeal channels exist at all levels of the
 judicial system.
 The Indian Criminal Procedure Code provides for an open trial
 in most cases but under certain circumstances it allows
 significant exceptions, including in proceedings involving
 official'secrets, trials in which statements prejudicial to
 the safety of the State might be made, or under provisions of
 national security legislation such as TADA. Sentences must,
 however, be announced in public.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive branch. Judges
 are selected by the Law Ministry following consultations with
 the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Islamic religious law
 governs some noncriminal matters concerning Muslims, including
 divorce. The Government's declared policy is not to interfere
 in the personal laws of the minority communities, with the
 effect that discriminatory personal laws, often against women,
 are upheld.
 The Terrorist Affected Areas (Special Courts) Act of
 Parliament (TAAA) permits the establishment of special courts
 sitting in camera and allows the identity of witnesses
 testifying before a special court to be kept secret. Under an
 unusual provision of the TAAA, a defendant charged with
 "waging war" carries the burden of proving his or her
 innocence. Civil rights groups charge that these special
 rules are contrary to the presumption of innocence customary
 in Indian law.
 In October human rights activists called on West Bengal
 authorities to release 26 Naxalite political prisoners who
 they claimed had been held without trial in West Bengal jails,
 often without medical attention, for up to 9 years. The West
 Bengal Minister for Information and Culture denied that there
 were any political prisoners in West Bengal, and stated that
 all these "so-called political prisoners" had criminal
 records. It was not possible to verify this statement.
 
 
 1433
 
 INDIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Indian law, warrants are normally required for searches
 and seizures. In a criminal investigation, police may conduct
 searches without a warrant if obtaining one would cause undue
 delay, but they must justify such searches in writing to a
 member of the senior executive police administration. Under
 the disturbed areas legislation in Punjab and Jammu and
 Kashmir, the authorities continue to have special powers to
 search and arrest without a warrant and to shoot to kill
 suspected lawbreakers or disturbers of the peace.
 Surveillance of communications, including tapping of
 telephones and intercepting personal mail, is authorized under
 the Indian Telegraph Act "on the occurrence of any public
 emergency or in the interest of the public safety or
 tranquility." The Postal (Amendment) bill empowers the
 Government to censor mail in certain circumstances, such as in
 a public emergency. These powers have been used by every
 state government, targeted against specific individuals.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 In 1990 the human rights situation deteriorated markedly in
 the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir, India's only
 Muslim-majority state. Most of the Muslim population in the
 -Kashmir Valley sympathized with the demands of armed
 militants-some of whom had crossed the de facto border from
 Pakistan--for Kashmiri self-determination. Tens of thousands
 of Indian Army and-paramilitary moved into the Valley to
 restore law and order. The Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed'Areas
 Act, which was adopted on July 5, significantly strengthened
 the hand of the security forces in using force against persons
 suspected of terrorist activities. A compilation of press
 statistics of deaths in Kashmir from January to the end of
 December showed 2,293 killed, including 1,214 civilians, 890
 militants, and 189 security force members.
 Security forces in some instances used excessive force in
 confronting mass demonstrations and in retaliating against
 armed militants. For example, in the early months of 1990,
 paramilitary and army forces, when faced with mass
 demonstrations in the Kashmir Valley, fired into crowds on
 several occasions. At least 40 people were killed on the
 night of January 20-21 in Srinagar, when the paramilitary
 opened fire on a procession protesting the large-scale house
 searches and arrests. At least 30 people were killed by
 security forces the following night when they fired into
 crowds defying the curfew. On March 1, army troops allegedly
 opened fire on demonstrators at three different locations in
 Srinagar, killing and injuring an unknown number. Initial
 press reports gave the number as 30. The army, which
 initially justified the killings on grounds of self-defense,
 was ordered by the Government to file charges against the
 military personnel involved. Although the Government
 maintained that disciplinary action has been taken against
 some security personnel responsible for excesses, it has not
 provided any specific details.
 In May the Governor of Kashmir was relieved of office after
 security forces fired on the funeral procession of Mirwaiz
 Moulvi Farooq, killing at least 47 people. Government
 officials maintained someone in the crowd fired at the
 
 
 1434
 
 INDIA
 security forces, a charge denied by Kashmiris who were
 present. Subsequently, the Government disclosed that
 (unspecified) disciplinary action was taken against those
 responsible for the police firing. A Border Security Force
 (BSF) unit on August 6 killed 10 civilians in the Halwa
 district of Srinagar in response to an earlier militant ambush
 against the BSF; and an army unit allegedly killed 25
 civilians, including elderly men and teenagers, in Pazipura
 village; Kupwara district, on August 10, following a militant
 attack in the area. Members of the BSF, in retaliation for an
 earlier militant ambush of a BSF patrol, reportedly killed at
 least 20 people and burned more, than 400 homes and businesses
 in Handwara on October 1. The Government initially denied the'
 BSF's responsibility in the occurrence but subsequently
 promised an official inquiry. At year's end, the progress of
 that inquiry was not known.
 In October several hundred homes and businesses burned to the
 ground, in fires in Srinagar and other areas of the Kashmir
 Valley. Official sources claimed some of the blazes resulted
 from hand grenades thrown.by militants. Residents and other
 eyewitnesses, however, accused security foices of dousing the
 homes with gunpowder and gasoline and setting them ablaze.
 Jammu and Kashmir Governor Saxena later acknowledged the
 possible involvement of security forces in fire'incidents at
 Magam, Anantnag, and Sopore and indicated that investigations
 were under way.
 Most central security forces in Kashmir are non-Muslims; the
 state police in Kashmir--mostly Muslim--has been increasingly
 relegated to the sidelines because of suspicion of its
 loyalties. In October Kashmiri militants increasingly
 targeted high-ranking police officials for assassination (see
 Section l.a.). They also directly attacked security forces in
 ambushes throughout the year.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and expression are protected by the Constitution,
 and newspapers vigorously reflect a variety of public, social,
 and economic beliefs. Several major national publications
 regularly publish investigative reports and allegations of
 government.wrongdoing, and the press as a whole champions
 human rights causes and criticizes perceived government
 lapses. The Government controls the allocation of newsprint,
 however, as well as the placement of government and public
 sector advertisements, and has been accused of using these
 means to exert influence over the press. National television
 and radio, which are government monopolies, are frequently
 accused of manipulating the news to the benefit of the
 Government. On September 6, Parliament adopted a bill
 creating the Broadcasting Corporation of India, designed to
 grant autonomy to the electronic media. The Corporation is to
 be managed by a 15-member board, answerable to a 22-member
 parliamentary oversight committtee. Sections of the bill were
 praised by some commentators as taking strides towards
 granting greater independence to the electronic media. The
 bill was a parliamentary compromise, however, which still
 leaves the Government considerable leverage on the media's
 management. The Minister of State for Information and
 Broadcasting announced in late November that- the Ministry
 would not be able to meet the April 1, 1991, deadline for the
 
 
 1435
 
 INDIA
 transfer of radio and television to the new Corporation. No
 new deadline was set.
 Under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), the Government may
 restrict publication of sensitive security stories, but this
 is sometimes interpreted quite broadly to suppress criticism
 of government policies. For example, activists protesting the
 Narmada Valley Project, a series of proposed dams to develop
 hydroelectric power, allege the Government arrested them on
 charges of spying under the OSA. The Singh Government was
 reportedly working on amending the Act to make it less
 restrictive, thereby fulfilling an electoral pledge to insure
 the citizen's right to information, but no action had been
 taken before his government fell in October.
 Actions by both security forces and militants in Jammu and
 Kashmir were widely perceived as threatening press freedom in
 the troubled state. On February 13, Lasa Koul, director of
 the government television station in Srinagar, was
 assassinated by Kashmiri terrorists. In addition, there were
 numerous reports both of militant pressure on Indian
 journalists to slant their reporting against the Government
 and of events staged by the militants to influence media
 coverage.
 In January state- and central government officials actively
 discouraged foreign correspondents from reporting from
 Kashmir, and several foreign media representatives were asked
 to leave Srinagar. All foreign based journalists were kept
 out of Kashmir until mid-April, after which time they were
 allowed to return.
 In Punjab as well as Kashmir, there were reports of
 journalists being harassed and intimidated by terrorists,
 local leaders, and special interest groups. Terrorists in
 Punjab killed newspaper vendors and, in at least one case,
 threatened news agencies and newspaper personnel if they
 refused demands to print militant propaganda. On December 6,
 the station director of All India Radio in Chandigarh was
 murdered by Sikh terrorists, apparently in retribution for not
 following a 6-page "code of conduct" laid down by the
 terrorists to govern journalistic coverage of their
 activities. Following the killing, government radio and
 television stations in Chandigarh bowed to terrorist demands
 and stopped all Hindi-language broadcasts.
 Films are reviewed by the Censorship Board before being
 licensed for distribution. The Board deletes material deemed
 offensive to either public morals or religious or communal
 sentiment. Private sector video news magazine producers are
 also required to clear their products with government
 censors. This has resulted in numerous delays in the release
 and editing of a number of stories on controversial issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right of peaceful assembly and
 the right to form associations. These rights are respected.
 Government authorities sometimes require permits and
 notification prior to holding parades and demonstrations. At
 times of civil tension, local governments may ban public
 assemblies and impose a curfew. Ordinarily, local governments
 respect the right to protest peacefully, including such
 traditional Indian forms of protest as "gherao," in which an
 
 
 1436
 
 INDIA
 official or his office is surrounded by protestors who allow
 no movement, and sitdowns blocking public thoroughfares.
 Srinagar and much of the -Kashmir Valley were under a near
 continuous night curfew throughout 1990. In addition,
 government authorities routinely imposed day curfews on
 communities experiencing violent disturbances. In the spring,
 Srinagar underwent a 24-hour curfew for nearly 2 weeks, during
 which time people were not allowed on the streets, even to
 attend religious services.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 India is a secular state in which all faiths enjoy freedom of
 worship. Government policy does not favor any religious
 group. Nevertheless, tensions over religious differences
 continue to be a social problem and pose challenges to the
 secular nature of the Indian polity.
 There is no national law to bar proselytizing by Indian
 Christians, but the Government limits the number of foreign
 missionaries, and laws in some states discourage them from
 openly proselytizing. The sharp rise of conversions among
 tribals of the northeast state of Arunachal Pradesh has
 created some social and religious tensions; as a consequence,
 state officials have refused to issue permits for foreign
 Christian missionaries to enter the state.
 Indian religious organizations may maintain communications
 with coreligionists abroad. Financial contributions from
 abroad are subject to scrutiny and licensing by the Ministry
 of Home Affairs.
 Despite acts in various states to remove obstructions to the
 exercise of religious freedom, Harijans ("scheduled castes" or
 "untouchables") are still prevented from entering Hindu
 temples in some areas.
 The Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Ordinance
 makes it an offense to use any religious site for political
 purposes or to use temples for harboring persons accused or
 convicted of any crime. While specifically designed to deal
 with Sikh places of worship in the Punjab, the Ordinance
 technically applies to all religious sites. In general, the
 Government has been careful to avoid placing restrictions on
 Sikh religious practices or on the management of Sikh places
 of worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Indian citizens enjoy full freedom of movement within the
 country, except in certain border areas where, for security
 reasons, special permits are required. Foreign travel and
 emigration are without political restrictions. Millions of
 people of Indian origin live abroad. Foreigners (including
 diplomats) must obtain special permission to visit Assam as
 well as other sensitive border areas in the northeast.
 India admitted millions of refugees and displaced persons at
 the time of partition in 1947 and granted them citizenship,
 integrating them fully into Indian society. Subsequent
 migration to India has largely been the result of upheavals in
 nearby countries, and some of the refugees in these migrations
 have not, been granted citizenship or been-fully integrated.
 
 
 1437
 
 INDIA
 In some cases, both the refugees and their hosts consider
 their stay temporary, although it may be for an indefinite
 period. Among those groups admitted as refugees during the
 year were Sri Lankans, Afghans, and Iranians. The most recent
 influx of refugees into India has been Tamils fleeing the
 escalation of hostilities between Sri Lankan government forces
 and rebel Tamil groups in the northeastern part of Sri Lanka.
 Over 120,000 Tamil refugees arrived in Tamil Nadu between June
 and September, joining the approximately 80,000 already in the
 state. The state government, using central government
 resources, provided shelter and subsidized food to these
 refugees.
 India continues to provide humanitarian assistance and
 protection to the large and vigorous communities of Tibetan
 refugees in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and elsewhere in
 India, who may number over 100,000.
 There have been continuing reports, which are difficult to
 verify, that the Government, after initially offering
 sanctuary to Burmese students fleeing the political turmoil
 there in 1988, may have subsequently deported some of the
 refugees. Many have returned voluntarily.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 India has a democratic, parliamentary system of government
 with members elected under full adult suffrage; the voting age
 is 18. Multiparty elections are held regularly at state and
 national levels. A Parliament sits for not more than 5 years
 unless dissolved earlier for new elections, except under
 constitutionally defined emergency situations. National
 elections were last held in 1989. The V.P. Singh Government
 lost a parliamentary vote of confidence in November 1990 and
 was replaced in an orderly, constitutional manner by a
 Government headed by Chandra Shekhar. State governments
 (headed by an appointed governor) are also elected at regular
 intervals except in states under President's Rule. Although
 the central Government has indicated its desire to replace
 President's Rule with elected state governments, law and order
 problems in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir remain obstacles to
 the holding of state assembly elections.
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the President may declare
 President's Rule or a state of emergency in any state in the
 event of war, external oppression, internal disruption, or
 collapse of the constitutional machinery. Under President's
 Rule, the central Government, through Parliament, the
 President and the appointed governor, directly administer the
 state, bypassing the elected state government. President's
 Rule is for 6 months and must give way to new elections, but
 can be extended by Parliament in increments of 6 months.
 President's Rule in Punjab was first instituted on May 11,
 1987 and has been extended every 6 months since then. On
 October 4, 1990, Parliament extended President's Rule in the
 Punjab for an additional 6 months. The Government promised to
 create a situation conducive to fair assembly elections during
 that time, though the extension set no target date for such
 elections. Under the Jammu and Kashmir state constitution,
 Governor's Rule can be declared for a period not longer than 6
 months without elections. This was imposed in the state on
 January 19 by then-Governor Jagmohan after the resignation of
 the Congress (I)-National Conference coalition government.
 
 
 1438
 INDIA
 Jammu and Kashmir was brought under President's Rule when the
 statutory limit for Governor's Rule ended on July 19. Both
 effectively meant rule from New Delhi. President's Rule was
 imposed in Assam on November 28 and was still in effect at the
 end of the year.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The central Government, while tolerant of dissent within
 India, is sensitive to international allegations of human
 rights violations. All of India, including Kashmir and
 Punjab; is open to investigation by Indian civil liberties
 groups, and neither of those states is closed to individual
 foreign visitors. Al was given permission to visit India
 privately for a dialog with the Government on general issues
 in early July, but that permission did not include
 authorization for an investigative team from AI to visit
 Kashmir and Punjab. As of the end of the year, no visit had
 taken-place or been scheduled even though AI had repeatedly
 asked representatives of the Indian Government to arrange it.
 Congress (I) leader Rajiv Gandhi urged a Congress (1) youth
 conference in July physically to prevent an AI team from
 entering the'country, claiming it would be an intrusion into
 India's internal affairs.
 Independent 'Indian human rights organizations are active and
 vocal. They include Committees for Initiative on Kashmir and
 on Punjab, the Peoples' Union for Democratic Rights, Citizens
 for Democracy, and the Indian People's Human Rights
 Commission, all of which send out teams to study specific
 allegations of human rights abuses and publish reports on
 their findings, which are often highly critical of government
 authorities. Television journalists have visited the Kashmir
 Valley and have produced documentaries critical of the
 handling of the situation. These documentaries have been
 shown on government-controlled television.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The traditional caste system as well as differences of race,
 religion, and language severely divide Indian society in spite
 of laws designed to prevent discrimination. The year saw an
 increase in violence based on these differences. For example,
 scores died as a result of protests by members of higher
 castes against the Singh government's decision to expand
 government job quotas for certain "backward" castes. In
 addition, longstanding Hindu-Moslem tensions erupted into
 violence as communal'passions were inflamed by the
 temple/mosque dispute at Ayodhya, leaving hundreds dead. The
 toll from-this violence was increased by the failure of state
 and local police forces to remain neutral during such
 disturbances and to provide full and equal protection for all
 persons.
 Despite several provisions in the Constitution promising
 equality before the law and prohibiting discrimination on the
 basis of gender, legally sanctioned gender discrimination is
 manifested in the family, marriage, and inheritance laws of
 several of India's religious communities. In recent years,
 changes have been made in personal, criminal,' and labor laws
 governing women, including the Dowry Prohibition Act, the
 Equal Remuneration Act, the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act,
 
 
 1439
 INDIA
 and the Sati (widow burning) (Prevention) Act, and the media
 have reported more extensively on the treatment of women.
 Nonetheless, as evidenced by increasing numbers of court cases
 brought by women's rights groups, deeply rooted traditions,
 often tied to religious or social practice, continue to
 contribute to uneven enforcement of these laws, particularly
 in the countryside. Existing laws relating to asset and land
 ownership give women little control over land use, retention,
 or sale. None of the personal laws, except Hindu family law,
 makes distinctions between ancestral and self-acquired
 property in the matter of inheritance. The Hindu Succession
 Act provides equal inheritance rights for Hindu women,
 although in practice married daughters are seldom given a
 share in parental property. Islamic personal law, while
 recognizing the right to inheritance of both sons and
 daughters, specifies that a daughter's share should be only
 one-half of a son's. Under the tribal land system, notably in
 Bihar, tribal women do not have the right to own land; the
 practice of putting women to death there as "witches" is
 closely linked to the denial of property rights. Between
 April and June, at least 21 women were murdered by mobs after
 being branded as witches in the Singhbhum district of Bihar.
 Female bondage, forced prostitution, and child marriage remain
 common in parts of Indian society. Child prostitution is
 rampant in the larger urban areas, particularly in Bombay and
 Delhi. In Bombay alone, there are approximately 100,000
 prostitutes, many of them minors held in bondage at brothels.
 Sex-determination tests (amniocentesisY are widely used,
 resulting in a disproportionate number of abortions of female
 fetuses. Coupled with a marked disparity between mortality
 rates.of male versus female infants in the 0-5 age group, this
 has resulted in the unusually low ratio in the Indian
 population of 933 females per 1,000 males (the ratio varies
 considerably among states). Parents often give priority in
 both health care and nutrition to male infants over females.
 Women's rights groups point out that the burden of providing
 an adequate dowry for girls is one factor in making female
 births less desirable to the parents.
 According to an Indian government study, which is borne out by
 press reporting, violence against women--including molestation,
 rape (including while in police custody), kidnaping, and wife
 murder ("dowry deaths")--has shown an upward trend in the past
 decade. Whether this is due to more reporting, a higher
 incidence, or a combination of both is unknown. The claim
 that "dowry deaths" (usually by burning) of young married
 women result from their inability to meet property demands by
 their husband's families has been challenged by women's rights
 groups who contend that insufficient dowry is often used as an
 excuse for societally condoned violence against married
 women. Dowry crimes are a complex issue involving attitudes
 of parents toward daughters, the social and economic status of
 women, laws that do not adequately stipulate investigation and
 enforcement procedures, and the failure of police to enforce
 existing laws. There are no accurate statistics on the number
 of dowry deaths per year as much domestic violence is
 unreported or is not registered by the police. Women's groups
 contend that, at best, there has been no decrease in the
 numbers in recent years, despite the strengthening of the
 Dowry Prohibition Act. By law, every unnatural death of a
 woman in the first 7 years of marriage must be investigated by
 the police and a magistrate. However, a member of the Indian
 police on the Union Public Service Commission stated in March
 that about 95 percent of registered cases of dowry death end
 
 
 1440
 INDIA
 in acquittal as corrupt police and medical officers tamper
 with crucial evidence.
 About-150 women's organizations in India are active in working
 for social justice and economic advancement of women and in
 linking women's problems to larger social concerns.
 The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of
 Atrocities) Act of 1989 adds to the existing protective
 legislation by specifying a new range of offenses and
 providing stiffer sanctions with special courts. It has not,
 however, checked atrocities committed against these groups.
 The Minister of Labor announced in May that there had been a
 total of 14,366 cases of atrocities against scheduled castes
 and 3,533 against scheduled tribes in 1989. A total of 1,756
 cases of atrocities against scheduled castes and 108 against
 scheduled tribes had been registered as of the end of March.
 There were no convictions under the 1989 Act, although the
 Government Minorities Commission notes that many cases are
 pending.
 In August Prime Minister Singh announced the government would
 implement the Mandal Commission recommendation that an
 additional quota of 27 percent of jobs in the government and
 public sector should be reserved for specific groups not
 included in the 22.5 percent of jobs already reserved for
 scheduled castes and tribes. In several states, the system of
 reservations for disadvantaged groups is manipulated for
 political gain by local party leaders, with the connivance and
 even open support of the administration and the police. A
 wave of violent protests against the quotas ensued,
 particularly from students and their parents in the urban
 areas of the populous Hindi belt, fearful'of losing job
 opportunities. During the protests, students and other
 demonstrators burned buses, looted stores, and attacked
 private vehicles. A number of young people committed suicide
 by poisoning and setting fire to themselves in protest. A
 court injunction stayed implementation of the recommendation
 extending job quotas, pending a decision on the
 constitutionality of the Prime Minister's order.
 Notwithstanding legal provisions for their welfare and
 protection, tribal people are sometimes uprooted from their
 forest homes to make way for various, development projects,
 e.g., dam building, or following flooding, and are not
 provided with fully compensatory recovery assistance.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right of association as
 defined by the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 Workers are guaranteed the right to form and join unions of
 their own choosing without prior authorization, including in
 export processing zones, and several trade union
 confederations exist. Trade unions have the legally protected
 right to strike, but in at least two of the export processing
 zones (EPZs) the right is restricted. Unions represent less
 than 25 percent of the industrial work force. It is estimated
 that over 70 percent of the Indian work force is employed in
 the agricultural sector, which, while traditionally nonunion,
 has recently experienced organizing efforts by trade unions.
 Most trade unions have some form of ties to a political party,
 national or local. Trade unions do make a point of preserving
 their formal independence from political partifI and have on
 
 
 1441
 INDIA
 occasion differed from their respective political allies on
 labor-related issues.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade union
 organizations. For example, the Indian National Trade Union
 Congress (INTUC) is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the All India
 Trade Union Congress (AITUC) is affiliated with the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU).
 Workers enjoy the right to strike in principle but, under the
 Essential Services Maintenance Act, the Government may ban
 strikes and require conciliation or arbitration in specified
 essential industries. Legal mpchanisms exist for challenging
 the assertion that a given dispute falls within the scope of
 this Act. There were approximately 1,020 industrial disputes
 listed in India in 1989 (the latest figures available), most
 of them minor and of short duration, involving both strikes
 and lockouts.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize (including protection against antiunion
 discrimination) and to bargain collectively has existed in
 Indian law for decades. Trade unions carry out these
 activities independently and without Government or, in
 general, employer attempts to interfere. Police and judicial
 authorities are generally quick to protect peaceful union
 activities. In addition to the availability of normal civil
 and criminal courts, a system of specialized labor courts
 exists to hear and adjudicate labor-related complaints.
 Collective bargaining is the normal means of setting wages and
 settling disputes, and-trade unions are usually vigorous in
 defending worker interests in this process. Where collective
 bargaining fails to establish locally equitable wage levels,
 the Government may set up tripartite boards, including trade
 union representation, to determine them. Export processing
 zones (EPZ's) exist at several locations in India but are not
 particularly active at the present time. Physical access to
 the EPZ's is ordinarily limited to those that work in them,
 and union organizers are not exempt from these limitations.
 While workers in EPZ's have the legal right to organize and
 bargain collectively, trade union activity is rare. Women
 workers, who are more difficult to organize, constitute the
 bulk of the work force in the EPZ's.
 Four people were killed and 29 injured in Nagpur on August 3
 when police opened fire on a group of workers and their
 supporters demonstrating against the management of Nagpur
 Alloys. Human rights activists charged that the police were
 acting on behalf of management as a strike-breaking rather
 than as a law enforcement force. Results of a judicial
 inquiry into the event ordered by the state government were
 still pending at year's end.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by the Constitution, and
 legislation passed in 1976 specifically bans the practice of
 "bonded labor." A Supreme Court decision has defined "forced
 labor" as work at less than the minimum wage (minimum wages
 are usually set by the states, not the central Government).
 Under this unique definition, "forced labor" is widespread
 throughout India, particularly in rural areas. "Bonded
 labor," the result of a private contractual relationship
 
 
 1442
 INDIA
 whereby a worker incurs or inherits debts to a contractor and
 then must work off the debt, plus extensive interest, is
 illegal, with violations punishable by imprisonment for up to
 3 years. Despite the penalties and active government
 opposition to the practice, it occurs among significant
 numbers of agricultural and construction workers. Individual
 state labor departments are responsible for enforcing laws
 against forced and bonded labor, but they are not considered
 very effective.
 The Gbvernment estimates that, based on reports from the
 states as of March 31, 1990, there were 245,636 bonded workers
 in the country, of whom 218,028 had been "rehabilitated" by
 government authorities. The Gandhi Peace Foundation, however,
 estimates the number at 10 times the government figure.
 Private social organizations, such as the Council for
 Advancement of Peoples' Action and Rural Technology, and
 Action for Welfare and Awakening Rural Environments, and some
 trade unions are active in identifying cases of bondage and
 pursuing them with relevant officials, usually at the state
 level. Even with better coordination and greatly increased
 resources to overcome the complicated jurisdictional division
 between the state governments and the central Government, the
 eradication of bonded labor is proceeding slowly.
 '-d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 It has been estimated that one-quarter of the world's child
 labor force is in India, where poverty and the lack of
 compulsory education make it an especially serious problem.
 According to a Labor Ministry survey, 1 out 4 Indian children
 between the ages of 5 and 15 is working. Government
 statistics put the total at 17.5 million in 1985. Other
 figures put it as high as 44 million.
 In 1986 legislation passed both houses of Parliament to ban
 the employment of children under 14 in hazardous occupations
 and regulate their employment in others. In 1989, 500 .new
 child welfare projects were inaugurated, including health and
 nutritional programs. A small Child Labor Division within the
 Labor Ministry has been created. Nevertheless, progress has
 been slow. Some employers of child labor have been openly
 defiant about continuation of the practice and resisted
 attempts by the Labor Ministry at enforcement. As in the case
 of bonded labor, the central Government often points to the
 division of jurisdiction between the state governments and the
 central Government in dealing with the practices and urges
 private organizations (including the unions) to do more.
 Although almost all child labor abuses occur in sectors
 outside the traditional reach of labor organizations, trade
 unions have recently become more active in this field, often
 concentrating on "consciousness-raising" among women workers
 who work alongside their.children. Despite all these efforts,
 enforcement of existing law appears inadequate to cope with
 the dimensions of the problem. The central Government's
 fiscal 1990 budget allots only $2.2 million for all child
 welfare programs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Factories Act establishes an 8-hour workday, a 48-hour
 .workweek, and various standards for working conditions. These
 standards are generally enforced and accepted (indeed,
 improved upon by various enlightened employers and aggressive
 unions) in the modern industrial sectors but are less often
 
 
 1443
 INDIA
 observed in older, smaller, and less economically robust
 industries. State governments are responsible for the
 enforcement of the Factories Act. However, the large number
 of industries covered by a small cadre of factory inspectors
 makes for ineffective enforcement.
 Occupational safety and health measures also vary widely,
 although this is an area in which both government and trade
 unions have become active. Safety conditions tend to be
 better in the EPZs. Governmental resources devoted to
 inspection and enforcement of standards are generally
 recognized to be inadequate. Several international
 organizations and foreign government agencies, including the
 U.S. Agency for International Development, are working with
 the Government on various occupational safety and health
 projects. State governments have not yet developed a large
 enough inspection force to enforce standards effectively,
 however.
 While the basic minimum wage varies according to the state and
 sector of industry, most "organized" workers receive much more
 then the minimum wage, especially when legislatively mandated
 bonuses and other benefits are included. In the "unorganized
 sector," each-state sets separate minimum wages for
 agricultural workers, which are not well enforced. The
 prescribed minimum wage rate in the unorganized sector for New
 Delhi is about $44 per month for unskilled workers. Daily
 wage rates for construction workers range from $1.90 for
 unskilled to $2.20 for skilled workers. The minimum wage is
 considered adequate only for the most minimal standard of
 living.
 According to a government-sponsored report by the National
 Commission on Self-Employed Women (Shramshakti), most rural
 women are employed az agricultural labor in the unorganized
 sector where they are vulnerable to exploitation. Overall, 94
 percent of Indian women work in the unorganized sector, which
 is not adequately controlled by labor laws. In spite of a
 statutory minimum wage fixed in each state, contractors set
 their own lower wage when employing women. This is so, even
 though one-third of all households are solely supported by
 women, while in another third they make half of the financial
 contribution. The report points out that even those women
 covered by labor laws are not adequately protected because the
 laws are unevenly enforced.
 
 
 1444
