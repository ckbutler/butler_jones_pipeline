 MOROCCO*
 Morocco is a constitutional monarchy whose King effectively
 dominates the country by means of his wide-ranging
 governmental.powers and his traditional role as spiritual
 leader of the country's'predominantly Muslim population, The
 King appoints and dismisses the Prime Minister and cabinet
 members, promulgates laws, presides over the Council of
 Ministers, may dissolve the nation's single legislative body
 (theHouse Qf Representatives), and may exercise powers by
 decree. The King's messages to the House of Aepresentatives
 and thenation are not open to'debate. Bills may be
 introduced in' the House'of Representatives only with the
 concurrence of the King'sPrime Minister.
 The King often expresses his desire to strengthen democracy,
 and some democratic practices'and institutions in Morocco are
 in place.  The Constitution provides for a pluralistic
 political-system and a parliamentary form of government, and
 stipulates..the freedoms of movement, expression, and
 association, among others. Eight political parties are
 represented in the House of Representatives, and most publish
 newspapers reflecting House debate and containing a range of'
 views on the economy, social issues and the conduct of
 government,albeit i'.xrelatively restrained terms. While
 significanb restrictions exist, the political system remains
 open to gradual change.
 The security apparatus is composed of several overlapping
 police arldoparamilitdiy organizations, operating withih a
 framework of aggal prbviions- designed to maintain public
 order. All of. the organizations are under the"King'sultimate
 control,, though-niany are administered orf a dayot'd-day bais by
 the Interior Minister: In recent years; especfally after the
 riotse f 1981-82 and 1984, Interior and Surete Nationale
 officials have been pl'aced in adiffnistr4tive posts in other
 ministries, such aS the Ministry of Rell~ious Affairs, to
 assure a pervasive Interior Ministry pkbsence. '        -
 Private investment and private property predominate in the
 economy. The Government has plans to privatize public sector
 enterprises and has taken several initial steps toward that
 end. Morocco is rapidly undergoing urbanization; over 50
 percent of the population now lives in cities and towns.
 Unemployment and underemployment probably total 25 percent of
 the work force, and new job creation is not keeping pace with
 demographic growth. New entrants to the labor force probably
 number about 250,000 annually, and the majority are unlikely
 to find full-time employment.
 There were no major outbreaks of political unrest in 1987 such
 as occurred in January 1984. Nor were there major political
 trials as in 1986. Nevertheless, during the period from
 December 1986 to February 1987 there was a series of
 demonstrations, walkouts, and disturbances by university and
 lycee students in Meknes, Fez, Tetouan, Al Hoceima, and other
 locations. The Moroccan media reported that students were
 arrested and beaten by the police. There were also allegations
 that several students were killed by police during
 demonstrations in Meknes and in the North. Student grievances
 centered on practical issues--criteria for academic

 advancement, the presence on campus of "vigils" (i.e., police
 employed by the Ministry of Interior); inadequate food,
 lodging, or transportation, and the insufficiency of state
 stipends to students.
 There are continuing reports of police brutality, including
 torture, and of cruel treatment and substandard conditions
 within prisons. There are almost daily reports of hunger
 strikes, petitions,-and other forms of protest on the part of
 both prisoners and their.families. Although the-Government
 asserts that all prisoners are common criminals, it is widely
 held that some Moroccans are in prison and in exile because of
 their political beliefs alone.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In 1987 there were no known instances of political killing.
 None of the death sentences for Moroccans convicted of
 involvement in Islamic fundamentalist activities in 1985.or
 1984 was carried out, although they continue to be held in
 prison.
 b,. Disappearance
 Given'the-' requent'-Moroccan practice of holding prisoners for
 long periods of pretrial detention without notification of
 families or attorneys, it is difficult to arrive at an exact
 number of those who may have permanently--rather than
 temporarily--disappeared. In a -1985 report, the New York-based
 Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights indicated that up to 500
 persons may have disappeared over the last decade. Although
 that number cannot be confirmed, persons in-several categories
 appear to have disappeared during that time. These include
 military prisoners accused of involvement in the 1971 and 1972
 coup attempts;,.those arrested near the war zone in the Western
 Sahara; and other political activists, including a number of
 students and teachers.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 -Treatment or Punishment
 Reports of abuses by. the Moroqcan'police,.and prison
 authorit~es,,many-of which are based on letters sent to-the
 press by prisoners and their families, .continued in 1987. �
 Reported abuses include .torture; inadequate, prison food, �
 sanitation, and medical care; and deprivation of mail, reading
 material, and family visits. There have also been reports
 that prison officials have harassed prisoners' families
 visiting the prison. Responses by prisoners reportedly
 include hunger strikes as well as.letters and petitions of
 protest. Several suicides were reported in 1947,among
 nonpolitical prisoners.        --
 Most prisoners are allowed familyvisits once a week and on
 religious holidays, and family members are permitted to bring-
 food to supplement the prison diet. However, prisoners
 convicted of involvement-in the 1971 and 1972 coup attempts
 continue to be held. in degrading conditions, in windowless,
 dirty cells in extreme temperatures, with inadequate food and
 without family visitation rights or the right to respond to

 mail received. A' number of Mordccan detaineegi including many
 considered informally' to be."political prisoners," are allowed
 to receive Moroccan newspapers, have access to radio and
 television, and pursue studies while in prison,-though there
 were complaints that the latter privilege was in some cases
 denied- "
 In September the Minister of Justice issued astateient,'ir

 that -strdng 'discipl'inary measures under "driminal law' had 13een

 MOROCCO
 noted that it had written to the authorities about allegations
 of torture in the case of five students arrested in October
 1986 and sentenced to between 2 and 6 months' imprisonment for
 public order offenses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, betention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution requires that a detainee be brought before a
 judge within 48 hours of detention and informed of'the charges
 against him. The police can request a 48-hour extension of
 that period. This legal Tequirement is, however, widely
 abused, and detainees are often held for up to several weeks
 or longer before being brought before a judge. Most persons
 are arrested in public view, but police sometimes refuse to
 identify themselves, and warrants are not always used.
 Arrests are frequently made only on the basis of suspicion.
 Moroccan law requires that a lawyer be present after the
 initial presentation of the detainee before the review court,
 but no such requirement exists for the prior period of police
 custody. Morocco does not have an extensive system of bail,
 although defendants are sometimes released on their own
 recognizance. Moroccan law does not have a specific provision
 for habeas corpus or its equivalent. Under a separate code of
 military justice; military personnel have been detained in
 past years without warrants or announcement of trial. No such
 incidents were confirmed in 1987.
 There have been allegations that prisoners have been held
 incommunicado for extended periods. At .the same time, family
 or friends have learned, usually through their own efforts, of
 the detainees' general location. In this regard, the Moroccan
 press in August and September reported a "campaign of arrests"
 over the summer involving some 20 Morocqan students, teachers,
 and officials. (other sources described them either as
 Islamic conservatives or students belonging to the Leftist
 National Union of Moroccan Students--UNEM--and estimated that
 the actual number of those arrested over the summer greatly
 exceeded those reported). In October the press reported an
 unspecified number of arrests of UNEM university students in
 Oujda. .In all cases, press reports indicated that the
 Government had given no explanation for these arrests.
 In its 1987 Report, AI expressed its concern about allegations
 of prolonged incommunicado detention and continued detention
 after expiry 9f sentence.
 There are no known inst-ances of political activists sentenced
 by the judicial process to exile. There were, however,
 allegations in 1987 that Moroccan security forces had ordered
 citizens to leave Morocco or face criminal charges. Some
 activists prefer to remain abroad rather than risk arrest on
 their return to Morocc6. According to some reports, the
 Government'refused to issue passports to enable large numbers
 of exiles to return. When it appeared that liberation hero
 and former leftist leader Mohamed Basri was slated to receive
 permission, in the form of an amnesty, to return to Morocco in
 the summer of 1987 after 20 years of exile, Moroccan political
 parties publicly appealed to the King to extend the same
 permission to other Moroccans living in exile.
 While prisoners are regularly used on work crews, forced labor
 is not used as a means of political coercion, as a sanction
 against free expression, or as a means of discrimination.
 
 
 1248
 
 MOROCCO
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Moroccan judicial system is generally considered fair and
 independent of political control, except in cases involving
 challenges to royal authority or state policy. Cases are
 brought before an initial review court, which can call for a
 hearing. The detainee is informed of charges and questioned
 by the judge-to decide if they have merit. If not, or if the
 infiaction is minor, the judge can release the detainee .or
 imPose a light seitence. If a lengthy investigation is
 required, the'judge can release detainees on their own
 recognizance. In cases involving serious crimes, courts
 generally move quickly to bring cases to trial. If convicted
 by the court df first instance, a defendant has the right of
 appeal. The 1985 Lawyers' Committee Report and some lawyers
 charge that' tese criteria are not always met in political
 cases. 'They claimi that trial transgressions in such cases
 include: 'iio notification of charges, intimidati0n of defense
 lawyers, and ignoring defense argumients. However, capable and
 committed attoineys do accept the defense of detainees in
 political cases and provide an active defense..
 Although most. ases are handled by 'civilian/secular courts
 based in part on French legal tradition, Morocco has a
 parallel jfidicjal system using Islamic legalfprinciples to
 deal with marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance
 for Muslim Moroccans. Western legal practices are not
 applicable.in the Islamic courts; Koranic principles govern -
 the-.limited .finds of cases heard. There were no specific
 chaiges:6f  dicial cc6irupjtion in 1987, though general charges
 of'corruptioiqinboth the judicial and administrative branches
 conbipud. to'b h head.
 Although the Government has stated that there are no political
 prisoners, most 6bsdivers estimate that there still remain
 some 200 prisoners held for political activities dating as far
 back-asothe early .170's and sentenced to long terms up to
 life Imprisonment.'.
 In addition, there are approximately 125 Moroccans convicted
 of Islamic fundamentalist activities,*.although some sources
 insist that the number held-could b& as many as several
 hundred. Human rights groups inEurope assert that nearly
 1,600. persons were tried and sentenced following the riots in
 January 1984. Many have been released after completing their
 terms, but estimates of those still in prison range in the
 hundreds. In early 1986, the Government released 15 to 20
 long-term leftist prisoners, and in December it released four
 former~members of the'banned Marxist party Ila-Al Amam.
 Accbiding-to the-government press, these four had addressed-a
 letter to the King rec6gnizing what they called their past '
 errors. The majority of such prisoners, however, apparently
 prefer to remain in prison rather than seek release by
 renouncing their views.
 * Arbitrary Interference' with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondencq                 v     E   yH       o
 Arbitrary government interference in the pr-Pvate lives of
 citizens is relatively infrequent. The Constitution states
 that.the~home is inviolable and that np. search or
 investigation may take placq without'a judicial warrant.
 However; this is not always observed in practice,,and-there
 were allegations of illegal searches of the home'in 1987. It
 is widely accepted that the Government selectively monitors
 
 
 1249
 MOROCCO
 certain individuals, including their telephones and mail. At
 times of heightened agitation in the past, the authorities are
 alleged to have searched homes and offices without warrants.
 The Government does not generally interfere with the private
 beliefs of the individual. There is no forced membership in
 political organizations. The Government, concerned about the
 spread of what it considers radical religious beliefs, is
 active and vigilant in administering the nation's mosques, but
 there are no reported instances of interference 'iith parents'
 teaching of religious beliefs to their children.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech, including
 freedom of the press, except for criticism of the monarchy and
 Islam. In the opinion of some observers, foreign policy is
 also a subject not open to free debate. King Hassan has made
 it clear that any challenge to Morocco's claim to the Western
 Sahara is also off-limits as a subject for public debate. In
 April and July meetings with the press, King Hassan asserted
 that those who denied that the Western Sahara was Moroccan
 directly challenged his responsibility to maintain the
 territorial integrity of Morocco and had to be imprisoned for
 their own safety in order to protect them from other Moroccans.
 There is, however, some criticism of the Government and
 Moroccan officials and limited discussion of political and
 socioeconomic issues. Several daily publications actively
 report on human rights issues. Nevertheless, investigative
 reporting is severely limited, and journalists are under
 government pressure to conform to government policy. In 1987
 there were reports that a Moroccan journalist had asked for
 political asylum abroad.
 In 1987 the Government seized editions of newspapefs, both
 foreign and domestic, carrying material which it was thought
 would inflame public opinion. Publication of the Communist
 daily Al Bayane was halted from October 1986 through
 mid-January 1987 for indirect criticism of the palace. The
 authorities banned a book on women's issues, "The Political
 Harem," by a Moroccan author, after it had been distributed in
 book stores. Officials have frequently seized banned
 publications entering the country from abroad through the
 mail. Some cultural activities, including those of theatrical
 associations, have also been banned.
 The Arabic language daily Al Anbaa as well as the Moroccan
 press agency Maghreb Arab Press are government owned. Many
 newspapers and journals are privately owned, although they all
 are influenced by the Government, receivd some government
 subsidies, and reflect official views to varying degrees.
 Some are controlled by political parties or private groups.
 Television and radio are government owned, and the views
 expressed are the Government's.
 There is a measure of academic freedom. Strictures against
 scholarly investigation of the monarchy and Islam exist, but
 there is in fact limited research and publishing on Islam and
 Islamic fundamentalism. Several students reportedly were
 killed during protests against government academic policies.
 
 
 1250
 MOROCCO
 b. FrjedQm of Peaceful Assembly'and Association
 There are cQnstitutional guarantees of peaceful assembly and
 association. However, groups seen as threatening the
 political qtability of the regime, such as declared radical
 Islamicfx!pdamentalist organizations, are outlawed. Private
 associati os are permitted, after registering with the
 Government, and prof.essional, business, religious, and
 cultA!rq aspociations are active. Permits are required for
 publi-c mept~ings, but if the requesting group is a legally
 registered association, permission in normally--though not
 always--granted.
 There are three major trade union federations: the Union
 Maroaine du Travail (UMT); the Confederation Democratique du
 Travail (CDT); and the Union Generale des Travailleurs
 Marocains (UGTM). Each has a democratically elected
 leadership.. TheUMT is-politically independent. The CDT is
 affiliated, with the Socialist Party, and the UGTM with the
 NationalisAt- Isttqlal Party. Of the total work force of 7.5
 million, perhaps J million are unionized, mainly in the
 industrial,_ *qmmercial, and public sectors. The Moroccan
 federationso re members of regional-labor organizations and
 maintain cQntac-s with the international trade secretariats.
 The OMT, CDT,. and UGTM regularly participate in annual
 conferences..of the International Labor-Organization (ILO).
 Morocco's Constitution and laws provide for the right of
 association for jaboxr unions, recognize the right to bargain
 collectively,_ andl call for the settlement of disputes without
 outside-,ikterference. These guarantees are widely observed in
 the modern sector- of .the economy but are less well observed,
 and sometimes totally ignored, in the informal and underground
 economy. The right to. strike is guaranteed by Article 14 of
 the Copstitutipn, but- P detailed law defining this right has
 never been enacted. During strikes and work protests, workers
 are sometimes arrested and prosecuted under criminal statutes
 that outlaw picketingand damage to employers' property. Laws
 also proh,tbit strikes in sectors deemed to affect national
 security., legislation governilngsettlementof labor disputes
 was enacted some.years agogbut the mandated procedures, which
 are lengthy and complicated as well as in conflict with later
 constitutional guarantees of the right to strike, are
 customarily ignored as disputes are handled by the Government
 on an ad hoc.basis. Labor tribunals hear individual cases,
 while collective disputes are generally handled within the
 Ministry of Labor. Elected worker delegates, rather than
 union representatives, act as workers' bargaining agents with
 employers.
 Although small-scale strikes continued in 1987, the labor
 climate wa' enerally calm. There were no major strikes or
 protests. Moroccan trade unions allege that workers are
 frequently dismissed or suspended for union activity and that
 employers often do not respect laws governing workers' rights.
 Unionist s also complein of interference by the police and .
 Ministry of Interior officials in labor disputes. The UMT has
 several complaints pending with the ILO on these and other
 allege infractions of ILO Conventions on Freedom of
 Association pad Collective Bargaining. Employers are subject
 to fines--and in serious~cases even imprisonment--for labor
 law violations. Ministry of Labor inspectors are charged with
 investigating.complaints and monitoring compliance with the
 law. Labor unions contend that existing legislaEion is not
 adequately enforced.
 
 
 1251
 MOROCCO
 The Constitution also guarantees the representation of workers
 in Parliament. There are 10 seats reserved for worker
 representatives in the current 306-member Parliament. In the
 1984 elections, the UJMT.elected 5 members, the CDT 3, and the
 UGTM 2.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is over 99 percent Muslim, and Islam is the
 official religion. The King bears the title "Commander of The
 Faithful" and is the religious as well as secular leader of
 the Moroccan population.
 The Constitution provides guarantees for freedom of worship.
 Proselytizing is forbidden. While conversion to another faith
 from Islam is not banned in the civil code, the Islamic faith
 and engrained popular attitudes strongly discourage it.
 There are two non-Islamic religions with organized communities
 in Morocco: Judaism and Christianity. There are up to 10,000
 Jews, living mainly in Casablanca and several other major
 cities. The Jewish community operates schools and social
 institutions as well as a number of synagogues. Publications
 in Hebrew are permitted, and rabbis serving the Jewish
 community are trained in Morocco. Moroccan Jews serve in
 leading positions in the business community. The President of
 the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court is Jewish, as
 is one parliamentary deputy. King Hassan meets from time to
 time with delegations of Jews of Moroccan origin, most
 recently in London in 1987.
 There are also institutional links between the Government and
 the Roman Catholic Church. In a 1983 letter to the Pope, King
 Hassan pledged to guarantee the Catholic Church's right to
 conduct both religious and charitable work, and that pledge is
 adhered-to in practice. The letter also formally recognized
 the work of the Catholic clergy, who come exclusively from
 abroad, to minister to some 100,000 foreign residents with
 parishes in most cities. In 1985 the Pope visited Morocco at
 the invitation of King Hassan, at which time he met with
 Morocco's Islamic leaders and delivered an address to 80,000
 Muslim youths. As a result of the Pope's visit, a resident
 apostolic nunciature was established in June 1986.
 There were no substantiated arrests in the small Baha-i
 community in 1987, although there were reports of
 administrative harassment of community members, including the
 continuation of the 1983 ban on the holding of religious
 meetings and the sealing off in 1986 of the Baha'i cemetery in
 Rabat. The Supreme Court rejected the appeals of the nine
 Casablanca Baha'is convicted in 1985 of proselytizing. The
 nine, who had already served their 10-month jail sentences,
 were nevertheless seeking to overturn their convictions, clear
 their-names, and eliminate other serious consequences of the
 convictions, including possible 5-year banishment from their
 Casablanca homes for the four non-Moroccan defendants, and
 loss of employment opportunities for the five Moroccans.
 The King and other religious leaders continue to actively
 oppose "radical" religious beliefs, and large numbers of
 Muslim fundamentalists have been imprisoned. Interior
 Ministry officials monitor what is taught in the mosques and
 report deviations from Orthodox Islam.
 
 
 1252
 MOROCCO
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco. As
 the administering authority in the Western Sahara, the
 Moroccan Government restricts movement in areas of the
 territory which are militarily contested. There were no
 reported cases of restrictions on foreign travel for political
 reasons in 1987, although some persons who have been
 imprisoned for political reasons in the past have had
 difficulty obtaining a passport. For the ordinary citizen,
 obtaining a passport often takes several months, though there
 are no formal restrictions on emigration. A woman is obliged
 to have the permission of her father, or, if she is married,
 her- husband,,to ob-tain a passport. A divorced woman must
 receive her father's permission for a passport and, if she has
 custody of children, she must have the children's father's
 permission for the children's passports.
 There are no known instances of the Government depriving any
 citizen of Moroccan nationality. Moroccan law considers any
 person who acquires Moroccan nationality to be a citizen for
 life, Morocco specifically encourages voluntary repatriation
 for Jewish ommunity members who have emigrated from Morocco.
 It also encourages the returnof Saharans who have opposed
 Morocco in the Western Sahara conflict. Returning former
 Polisario members deemed to pose no security threat have been
 reintegrated into Moroccan life.
 Morocco adheres to the 1951 Refugee Convention.  It currently
 has some 500 refugees, mainly from African countries and
 Easterm Europe. Most of the Eastern European refugees came to
 Morocco in the,1940's and 1950's. For a grant of refugee
 status, the Government requires that the applicant be able to
 care'for.his own needs,.
 Sectionr3- Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Chahge-Their-Government
 The Constitution may not be amended without the approval of
 the King who, as a practical matter, would be unlikely to
 approve removal of the monarchy. Moroccan citizens, though
 enjoying a wide latitude to elect members of Parliament, are
 not ultimately in a position to replace their system of
 constitutional monarchy. Executive power is vested in the
 King and carried out by a government whose members are
 designated by him and serve at his pleasure. In filling those
 cabinet posts whose occupants are to have political party
 affiliations (at present 16 of 30 ministers are affiliated
 with political parties), the King gives some consideration to
 the proportional strength of the parties in the House.
 The parliament passes the annual budget and other items of
 legislation. However, many measures of importance~are
 promulgated asgovernment decrees or by royal proclamation. A
 frequent 'complaint of opposition politicians is that the
 Government, which must approve the introduction of legislative
 bills into the Parliament, does not give that body sufficient
 work, both in terms of the volume of the legislation referred
 to it and of the importance of the legislation. Parliamentary
 absenteeism is high. While government-legislative proposals
 are rarely rejected outright, the Parliament is sometimes able
 to modify the bills it passes. Politicallpressure on occasion
 has persuaded the Government to delay or withdraw legislation.
 
 
 1253
 MOROCCO
 More than a dozen political parties, representing a spectrum
 of political philosophies from far left to conservative,
 competed in the municipal elections of 1983 and the 1984
 Parliamentary elections. Some of the results were challenged,
 and there were widespread accusations, which persist today, of
 government tampering, both in terms of the selection of the
 candidates and in the tallying of the results. In a number of
 cases, these challenges were upheld in court. On April 17,
 1986, partial elections for 5 Parliamentary and 92 Municipal
 Council seats were held to choose replacements.
 The palace is capable of engineering changes in party
 leadership for the purpose of ensuring political docility. A
 case in point is the Berber-based Mouvement Populaire, which
 last October, at palace direction, held an Extraordinary
 Congress which removed the founder and Secretary General.
 Since then this individual and his family have been the object
 of official harassment and constant surveillance by police
 authorities.
 The Constitution provides that "men and women enjoy equal
 political rights." Women occupy responsible government
 positions, including at the ministerial staff level. Women's
 role in political life remains restricted, however. No woman
 holds a seat in the 306-member Parliament, although women have
 run in Parliamentary elections. Of 15,000 city council
 members in Morocco, only 17 are women. Women serve on the
 executive committees of several of the major political parties
 and-on the Saharan Consultative Council, a body created in
 1981 to advise the King on Western Saharan issues.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of'Human Rights
 In recent years, Morocco has not refused any formal
 international or nongovernmental investigation of human
 rights, though the Government is sensitive to such
 investigations and cooperation may be slow.
 The Government has been slow to respond to Embassy inquiries
 into alleged human rights cases, following up on interest
 expressed by members of the U.S. Congress, human rights
 organizations, and private U.S. citizens. Nearly all of the
 Embassy's requests for information in 1987 remain unanswered.
 There are two major human rights associations: the Moroccan
 Association of Human Rights (AMDH) and the Moroccan League for
 the Defense of Human Rights (LDDH). The LDDH is affiliated
 with Istiqlal (a Centrist and Nationalist political party)
 while the AMDH, an organization which has been active in 1987,
 is associated with left-of-center political parties. Although
 permitted, human rights groups are occasionally subject to
 police surveillance and harassment. In Deceiaber the
 Association of Moroccan Lawyers held a colloquium in Oujda on
 human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution reaffirms the legal equality of all
 Moroccans. In the professions, women have made great progress
 i-n law, medicine, and teaching. Progress in professional
 fields has not always been matched-in the society at large.
 There are areas where traditional standards prevail,
