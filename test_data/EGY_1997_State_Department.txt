 EGYPT
 According to its Constitution, Egypt is a social democracy in which Islam is the
 state religion. However, the National Democratic Party (NDP), which has governed
 since its establishment in 1978, has used its entrenched position to dominate na-
 tional politics, and it maintains an overriding majority in the popularly elected Peo-
 pe's Assembly and the partially elected Shura (Consultative) Council. President
 Hosni Mubarak was reelected unopposed to a third 6-year term by the People's As-
 
 
 1425
 sembly in 1993. The Cabinet and the country's 26 governors are appointed by the
 President and may be dismissed by him at his discretion. The judiciary is independ-
 ent.
 There are several security services in the Ministry of Interior, two of which are
 primarily involved in combating terrorism: The State Security Investigations Sector
 SSIS), which conducts investigations and interro ates detainees; and the Central
 Security Force (CSF), which enforces curfews andbans on public demonstrations,
 and conducts paramilitary operations against terrorists. The use of violence by secu-
 rity forces in the campaign against suspected terrorists appeared more limited than
 in 1996. The security forces committed numerous serious human rights abuses.
 Egypt is in transition from a government-controlled economy to a free market sys-
 tem. The Government continued its privatization program, although key sectors of
 the economy remain under government control. Agriculture remains the largest em-
 ployer and is almost entirely in private hands. The tourism sector generated the
 largest amount of foreign currency, although earnings fell off sharply after terrorists
 massacred 58 foreign tourists in Luxor in November. Petroleum exports and remit-
 tances from approximately 2 million Egyptians working abroad are the two other
 principal sources of foreign currency. In the past 7 years, the Government has en-
 acted significant economic reforms, which have reduced the budget deficit, stabilized
 the exchange rate, reduced inflation and interest rates significantly, and built up
 substantial reserves. The success of the reform efforts has resulted in an increase
 in annual economic growth rates to 5 percent for fiscal year 1996-97. The per capita
 gross domestic product (GDP) is about $1,000 per year. Official statistics place 34.4
 percent of wage earners in the agricultural sector, and knowledgeable observers es-
 timate that perhaps 3 to 5 percent of those engage in subsistence farming. The an-
 nual population increase is 2.1 percent. Adult literacy rates are 63 percent for males
 and 34 percent for females.
 The Government continued to commit numerous serious human rights abuses, al-
 though its record improved somewhat over the previous year. The ruling NDP domi-
 nates the political scene to such an extent that citizens do not have a meaningful
 ability to change their government. The Emergency Law, which has been in effect
 since 1981, was renewed on February 23 for another 3 years and continues to re-
 strict many basic rights. The security forces and terrorist groups continued to en-
 gage in violent exchanges. In fighting the terrorists, the security forces continued
 to mistreat and torture prisoners, arbitrarily arrest and detain persons, hold detain-
 ees in prolonged pretrial detention, and occasionally engage in mass arrests. In ac-
 tions unrelated to the antiterrorist campaign, local police abused criminal suspects.
 Prison conditions are poor. During the year, the Government arrested and detained
 hundreds of individuals for opposition to the implementation of the Agrarian Reform
 Law, which ended artificially low rents for farmland. The activities that provoked
 government action ranged from possession of documents about the Agrarian Reform
 Law to attacks on government-owned property. In civil unrest related to the imple-
 mentation of the new law, an estimated 28 persons were killed in ensuing clashes.
 The Government took disciplinary action against police officers accused of abusing
 detainees, but it did not pursue most cases or seek adequate punishments.
 The use of military courts to try civilians continued to infringe on a defendant's
 right to a fair trial before an independent judiciary. The Government used the
 Emergency Law to infringe on citizens' privacy rights. Although citizens generally
 express themselves freely, the Government continued to place some restrictions on
 freedom of the press. State prosecutors brought libel charges in civilian courts
 against several journalists for criticizing corruption and abuse of authority among
 government officials and their families. The Government restricts freedom of assem-
 bly and association. Although the Government does not legally recognize local
 human rights groups, these groups are allowed to operate openly. The Government
 places limits on the freedom of religion.
 Women and Christians face discrimination based on tradition and some aspects
 of the law. Violence against women is a problem. Terrorist violence against Chris-
 tians is a problem. The Child Labor Law approved in 1996 increased protections for
 children, but child labor remains widespread despite the Government's efforts to
 eradicate it. Abuse by employers continues, and the Government does not enforce
 the law effectively. The 1996 government decree banning the practice of female geni-
 tal mutilation (FGM) was challenged in the courts on the grounds that the ban was
 unconstitutional. The Government ban was upheld by the Supreme Administrative
 Court on December 28. The Government limits worker rights.
 Terrorist groups committed numerous serious abuses. Terrorist groups seeking to
 overthrow the Government and establish a purportedly Islamic state continued their
 attacks on police, Coptic Christians, and tourists. Terrorist groups were responsible
 for the majority of the 155 civilian and police deaths. Major actions included a ter-
 
 
 1426
 rorist attack in February on youths who were attending a church meeting in Abu
 Qurqas in upper (southern) Egypt; 13 persons were killed and 5 wounded. In March
 terrorists attacked a village in upper Egypt, and fired on a passing train, killing
 14 persons and wounding 21 others. In September a politically-motivated gunman
 killed 9 tourists and 1 Egyptian in Cairo. In October terrorists killed 11 police and
 security officials, binding their hands and feet prior to shooting them. In November
 6 terrorists attacked foreign tourists at Hatshepsut's temple in Luxor, killing 58
 tourists, 2 police, and 2 Egyptian civilians before being killed themselves when sur-
 rounded by police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Etrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings; however, extrajudicial killings may have occurred in certain antiterrorist
 operations.
 There were no total figures for deaths in custody from government or human
 rights sources by year's end. The press reported 3 deaths under suspicious cir-
 cumstances in police custody. According to these reports, Mahmoud Abdel Hamid
 Abu Al Ela'a died in February following his detention at Boulaq Al Dakrour police
 station in Giza; Bekheet Abdel Rahman Salem died in March at Fayoum prison; and
 Kamel Mohammed Zayed died in March at Wadi Natroun prison. Human rights
 groups are investigating the deaths to determine whether they involved medical
 negligence. In October the Human Rights Center for the Assistance of Prisoners is-
 sued a report describing the deaths of seven prisoners detained in Al-Wadi Al-Jadid
 prison between 1994 and 1996. Other human rights groups continue to investigate
 outstanding cases, including 13 prison deaths related to medical negligence (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.).
 In antiterrorist campaigns, security forces killed 41 suspected terrorists; there
 were no reports of excessive use of lethal force. No suspects died while attempting
 to escape arrest. There were no reports of killings of relatives of suspected extrem-
 ists by security forces in apparent vendettas.
 The case against a policeman charged with torture and use of excessive force in
 the 1994 death of a detainee remained pending (see Section 1.c.).
 In civil unrest related to the implementation of the Agrarian Reform Law, an esti-
 mated 28 persons were killed in ensuing clashes (see Section 1.d.).
 Terrorist groups were responsible for the majority of the deaths in civil unrest.
 They killed 155 persons, compared with 132 in 1996. This total included 41 police
 and security officers and 114 civilians (which includes foreign tourists).
 On March 13, a group of armed terrorists emerged from the sugar cane fields near
 the village of Bahgoura and indiscriminately fired on the residents, killing 13 per-
 sons and wounding 15 others. Nine of the dead were Coptic Christians. Apparently
 while fleeing the Bahgoura massacre, the group fired bursts of automatic fire at the
 Luxor-Cairo train, killing one female passenger and wounding six other passengers
 slightly. On September 18, two men attacked and killed nine German tourists and
 their Egyptian driver outsides Cairo's Egyptian Museum. On October 13, terrorists
 in the province of A1-Minya setup a roadblock, stopped vehicles in a search for secu-
 rity officers, and captured and killed 11 policemen and one government employee.
 One civilian was wounded in these shootings. On October 29, a military court sen-
 tenced to death the two perpetrators of the September 18 attack. In addition, six
 other defendants were sentenced to prison terms varying in length from 1 to 10
 years for supplying a weapon and ammunitions. One other defendant was acquitted.
 On November 17, six terrorists attacked foreign tourists at the site of Hatshepsut's
 temple in Luxor. They killed 58 tourists, 2 Egyptian civilians, and 2 policemen be-
 fore they were killed by police.
 Terrorist attacks directed specifically against Christians continued, resulting in
 the death of at least 23 persons, including a group of 13 people in Abu Qurqas in
 February. Terrorist entered a church during a youth prayer meeting, shot and killed
 some participants, and attacked other villagers later. Thirteen persons were killed
 and 5 wounded. Terrorists also attacked churches and other properties owned by
 Christians.
 In September a military court sentenced defendants charged with killing a senior
 state security officer in 1995 (see Section 1.e.).
 In January four Muslim militants were convicted on charges relating to attacks
 in 1993 and 1994. One of the four, Ali Mohammed Farahat, was convicted for gre-
 nade attacks on two Cairo movie theaters that a police guard killed and wounded
 six civilians, and for an attack on a tourist bus that wounded eight Austrians and
 
 
 1427
 eight Egyptians. All four were convicted of plotting to kill senior state officials and
 tourists. The four were sentenced to death; the sentence was carried out in October.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The Human Rights Center for the Assistance of Prisoners issued a report describ-
 ing the cases of 11 individuals who disappeared during the period between 1992 and
 1996. The Egypt Organization of Human Rights (EOHR) continues to investigate
 eight other disappearances. The Government has not responded to queries from
 human rights monitors regarding these outstanding cases.
 The case of Marwa Al Sayeed Metwalli Hafez, who was reported to have dis-
 appeared in 1995, was resolved. She had eloped and been out of contact with her
 family.
 There were credible reports that former Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur Kikhiya,
 who disappeared from Cairo in 1993, had been kidnaped by Libyan agents, taken
 to Libya, and executed there in early 1994. Possible involvement by Egyptian gov-
 ernment officials remains under investigation.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the infliction of "physical or moral harm" upon persons
 who have been arrested or detained. However, abuse and torture of detainees by po-
 lice, security personnel, and prison guards is common.
 Under the Penal Code, torture of a defendant or orders to torture are felonies
 unishable by temporary hard labor or 3 to 10 years' imprisonment. If the defendant
 ies, the crime is one of intentional murder punishable by a life sentence at hard
 labor. Arrest without due cause, threatening death, or using physical torture is pun-
 ishable by temporary hard labor. The use of cruelty against people by relying on
 one's position is punishable by imprisonment of no more than 1 year or a fine of
 no more than $65. Victims may bring a criminal or civil action for compensation
 against the responsible government agency. There is no statute of limitations in
 such cases.
 Despite these legal safeguards, there were numerous credible reports, including
 statements by government officials, that security forces mistreated and tortured citi-
 zens. Reports of mistreatment and torture at police stations remain frequent.
 In an interview published in April, the Minister of Interior stated that he had
 placed 128 police officers "on reserve," a step that precedes dismissal, for abuses in-
 volving excessive use of force. He also stated that 12 police officers had been re-
 ferred to criminal courts and 44 to disciplinary courts for crimes of torture. He said
 that "many" officers had been convicted of torture and are serving prison sentences.
 The EOHRreported that three police officers and six policemen accused of torture
 in 1993 were acquitted in June.
 While the Government has investigated torture complaints in criminal cases and
 punished some offending officers, the punishments are not in line with the serious-
 ness of the offense. However, government officials have stated that administrative
 punishments can be severe enough to prevent further career advancement, and that
 some police officers have opted to face criminal charges instead. The Government
 has said that it will not disclose further details of individual cases of police abuse
 for fear of harming the morale of law       enforcement officers involved in
 counterterrorism operations.
 Human rights groups believe that the SSIS continues its practices. Torture takes
 place in SSIS offices, including its headquarters in Cairo, and at Central Security
 Force camps. Torture victims usually are taken to an SSIS office where they are
 handcuffed, blindfolded, and questioned about their associations, religious beliefs,
 and political views. Torture is used to extract information, coerce the victims to end
 their antigovernment activities, and deter others from such activities.
 Egyptian human rights groups and victims reported a number of torture methods.
 Detainees are frequently stripped; hung by their wrists with their feet touching the
 floor or forced to stand for prolonged periods; doused with hot or cold water; beaten;
 forced to stand outdoors in cold weather; and subjected to electrical shocks. Some
 victims, including female detainees, report they have been threatened with rape.
 While the law requires security authorities to keep written records of detained
 citizens, human rights groups report that such records often are not available, not
 found, or the police deny any knowledge of the detainee when they inquire about
 specific cases, effectively blocking the investigation of torture complaints.
 The EOHR issued a report in March presenting 57 cases of torture of "ordinary
 citizens" in police stations. The report states that torture is also used against the
 relatives of detainees. The Center for Human Rights Legal Aid (CHRLA) reported
 that five political activists-Hamdeen Sabahy, Mohammed Abdu, Mohammed As-
 sayed Sulayman, Mohammed Bayyoumi, and Hamdy Heikal-were tortured in June
 at the prison known as the "Scorpion," part of the Tora prison complex. The men
 were arrested for nonviolent opposition to the Agrarian Reform Bill (see Section
 
 
 1428
 1.d.). The CHRLA also reported the torture of Khaled Hagag Sayeed in May at Al
 Wayli police station in Cairo after he was arrested for suspected car theft.
 Security forces used tear gas and physical force to break up a strike in June at
 Zagazig University (see Section 6.a.). Two cases of torture from previous years, the
 1994 charge of torture by a policeman in the case of Fateh Al-Bab Abdel Moneim,
 and the 1995 charge of torture by police in the case of Famal El-Shazly, remain
 under investigation.
 Prison conditions remain poor. Government authorities reported the renovation or
 construction of 14 prisons during the past 4 years. Nonetheless, human rights
 groups report that overcrowding and unhealthy conditions continue. Cells reportedly
 are poorly ventilated, food is inadequate in quantity and nutritional value, and med-
 ical services were not always available. The use of torture and mistreatment contin-
 ues to be common, and relatives of prisoners and their lawyers are often unable to
 obtain access to prisons for visits. The Human Rights Center for the Assistance of
 Prisoners issued a report in October on conditions in the Al-Wadi A-Jadid prison,
 including 61 case studies of prisoners who are suffering from inhuman conditions,
 including inadequate medical treatment. Health conditions in the Al-Wadi Al-Jadid
 prison and in the maximum security prison, the "Scorpion," part of the Toraprison
 complex, reportedly included widespread tuberculosis among the inmates. Human
 rights goups are investigating 13 prison deaths related to medical negligence.
 On July 15, an administrative court issued a ruling canceling a decree by the
 Minister of Interior that prohibits visits of both family and lawyers to the Fayoum
 and Tora prisons. The Interior Minister is contesting this judgment. Since 1994
 there have been six court orders directing the Interior Ministiy to open thesepris-
 ons for visits. Human rights groups report, however, that visits have been re used
 at several prisons. At others, restrictions have been placed on visits to prisoners in-
 carcerated for political or terrorist crimes, limiting the number of visits allowed each
 prisoner, and the total number of visitors allowed in the prison at any one time.
 In principle, human rights monitors are allowed to visit prisoners in their capacity
 as legal counsel, but in practice they often face considerable bureaucratic obstacles
 that prevent them from meeting with prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-As part of the Government's antiterrorist
 cam paign, security forces have conducted mass arrests and detained hundreds of in-
 dividuals without charge after specific terrorist incidents. While terrorist groups
 stated that more than 1,000 persons were arrested, there are no confirmed reports
 of such claims. Under the provisions of the Emergency Law, which has been in ef-
 fect since 1981, the police may obtain an arrest warrant from the Ministry of Inte-
 rior upon showing that an individual poses a danger to security and public order.
 This procedure nullifies the constitutional requirement of obtaining a warrant from
 a judge or prosecutor upon showing that an individual has likely committed a spe-
 ciIc crime.
 The Emergency Law allows authorities to detain an individual without charge.
 After 30 days, a detainee has the right to demand a court hearing to challenge the
 legality of the detention order and may resubmit his motion for a hearing at 1-
 month intervals thereafter. There is no maximum limit to the length of detention
 if the judge continues to uphold the legality of the detention order, or if the detainee
 fails to exercise his right to a hearing.
 In addition to the Emergency Law, the Penal Code also gives the State wide de-
 tention powers. Under the Penal Code, prosecutors must bring charges within 48
 hours or release the suspect. However, they may detain a suspect for a maximum
 of 6 months, pending investigation. Arrests under the Penal Code occur openly and
 with warrants issued by a district prosecutor or judge. There is a system of bail.
 The Penal Code contains several provisions to combat extremist violence. These pro-
 visions broadly define terrorism to include the acts of "spreading panic" and "ob-
 structing the work of authorities."
 During the year the Government arrested and detained hundreds of people under
 the Penal Code for opposition to implementation of the Agrarian Reform Bill. One
 local human rights group claimed that up to 1,000 persons had been arrested. Ac-
 tivities by the detainees included photocopying statements opposing the law, distrib-
 uting leaflets opposing the law, meeting to discuss concerns about the law, and ef-
 forts to collect signatures and to organize demonstrations opposing the law. Some
 detainees were involved in demonstrations that included attacks on government-
 owned proerty. The majority of detainees were released after a short period of de-
 tention. However, some 200 individuals remained in detention at year's end. Dr.
 Ahmed Al Ahwany, a professor of nuclear energy at Cairo University, was detained
 on April 24 for possessing papers opposing the law. He was released on May 21
 after payin  a fme of $58.82 (200 Egtian pounds.) Five opponents-Hamdeen
 Sabahy, Mohammed Abdu, Mohammed Assayed Sulayman, Mohammed Bayyoumi,
 
 
 1429
 and Hamdy Heikal-were detained for 3 months at the Tora prison complex without
 trial and then released 1 week prior to the bill's implementation on October 6. They
 were charged with possessing documents that opposed the law and thereby encour-
 aged unrest.
 In January state security forces arrested some 80 young people devoted to heavy
 metal rock music and its trappings; all were released without charge in about 2
 weeks (see Section 2.a.). Human rights groups reported that hundreds, and accord-
 ing to one report, thousands, of people detained under the Emergency Law have
 been incarcerated for several years without charge. The courts have ordered the re-
 lease of several of these detainees, but prison officials have reportedly ignored the
 orders. Frequently, the Ministry of Interior reissues detention orders, sending de-
 tainees back to prison.
 On August 9, security forces and police in Alexandria arrested 33 alleged mem-
 bers of the Muslim Brotherhood (an Islamist opposition organization). The charges
 included organizing a training camp for instruction on how to infiltrate the student
 body of Alexandria-University, possessing illegal leaflets, and membership in an ille-
 gal organization. More than half were later released while the remainder are still
 in detention. On September 23, security forces and police in Alexandria arrested 60
 alleged members of the Muslim Brotherhood and released them 2 days later.
 Neither the Government nor human rights groups were able to provide firm fig-
 ures for the total prison population. One human rights group cited a government
 figure of 12,000 registered and serving sentences, but provided a rough estimate of
 32,000 for the total prison population, including those being held pending sentenc-
 in he Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The judiciary is independent; however, cases in-
 volving national security or terrorism may be handled by military or Emergency
 State Security courts, where constitutional protections may not be observed. The
 Constitution provides for the independence and immunity of judges and forbids in-
 terference by other authorities in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Presi-
 dent appoints all judges upon recommendation of the Higher Judicial Council, a con-
 stitutional body composed of senior judges, and chaired by the President of the
 Court of Cassation. The Council regulates judicial promotions and transfers. In the
 last few years, the Government has added lectures on human rights and other social
 issues to its training courses for prosecutors and judges.
 There are three levels of regular criminal courts: primary courts, appeals courts,
 and the Court of Cassation, the final stage of criminal appeal. The judicial system
 is based on the Napoleonic tradition; hence there are no juries. Misdemeanors that
 are punishable by imprisonment are heard at the first level by one judge; at the
 second level by three judges. Felonies that are punishable by imprisonment or exe-
 cution are heard in criminal court by three judges. Contestations of rulings are
 heard by the Court of Cassation. A lawyer is appointed at the court's expense if the
 defendant does not have one. The appointment of lawyers is based on a roster cho-
 sen by the Bar Association; however, expenses are incurred by the State. Any denial
 of this right is cause for contestation of the ruling. However, detainees in certain
 high security prisons alleged that they were denied access to counsel or that such
 access was delayed until trial, thus denying counsel the time to prepare an adequate
 defense.
 Defense lawyers generally agree that the regular judiciary respects the rights of
 the accused and exercises its independence. In the past, criminal court judges have
 dismissed cases where confessions were obtained by coercion. However, while the ju-
 diciary generally is credited with conducting fair trials, under the Emergency Law,
 cases involving terrorism and national security may be tried in military or State Se-
 curity Emergency courts, in which the accused do not receive all the constitutional
 protections of the civilian judicial system.
 In the past, human rights groups and defense lawyers have claimed that the Gov-
 ernment intimidated lawyers representing terrorist suspects by detaining and ques-
 tioning them on the activities of their clients. There were no such reports during
 the year.
 In 1992, following a rise in extremist violence, the Government began trying cases
 of persons accused of terrorism and membership in terrorist groups before military
 tribunals. In 1993 the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled that the President may
 invoke the Emergency Law to refer any crime to a military court. This use of mili-
 tary and State Security Emergency court under the Emergency Law has deprived
 hundreds of civilian defendants of their constitutional right to be tried by an ordi-
 nary judge.
 The Government defends the use of military courts as necessary in terrorism
 cases, maintaining that trials in the civilian courts are protracted and that civilian
 
 
 1430
 udges and their families are vulnerable to terrorist threats. Some civilian judges
 ave confirmed their fear of trying high visibility terrorism cases because of possible
 reprisal. The Government claims that civilian defendants receive fair trials in the
 m ilitary courts and enjoy the same rights as defendants in civilian courts.
 However, the military courts do not ensure civilian defendants due process before
 an independent tribunal. While military judges are lawyers, they are also military
 officers appointed by the Minister of Defense and subject to military discipline. They
 are not as independent or as qualified as civilian judges in applying the civilian
 Penal Code. There is no appellate process for verdicts issued by military courts; in-
 stead, verdicts are subject to a review by other military judges and confirmed by
 the President, who in practice usually delegates the review function to a senior mili-
 tary officer. Defense attorneys have complained that they have not been given suffi-
 cient time to prepare defenses and that judges tend to rush cases with many defend-
 ants.
 During the year, the Government referred 280 civilian defendants to the military
 courts in 6 separate cases. In January, 19 defendants accused of the 1994 bombing
 of the Magda theater were brought to trial before a military court. The court acquit-
 ted 2, sentenced 4 to death, and sentenced 13 to prison terms of various lengths
 (see Section L.a.). In July a military court sentenced Ramzy Al Muwafy to 31 years'
 imprisonment for belongingto a terrorist group, for having links with terrorist
 groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan, for forging documents, and for providing ter-
 rorist groups in Egypt with information that assisted them in perpetrating their ter-
 rorist activities. In September a military court handed down sentences in the case
 of 98 defendants accused of bombing 9 banks and killing a senior state security offi-
 cer in 1995. The court acquitted 25 and sentenced 4 to death, 8 to life imprisonment,
 and 60 to hard labor or prison terms of various lengths. The court dropped charges
 against one defendant who died during the trial.
 On October 15, a military court handed down sentences in the case involving 84
 defendants accused in 1995 of planning to revive the activities of the "Jihad" terror-
 ist group, including plans to bomb tourist areas. The court acquitted 31 persons and
 sentenced 3 to death, 2 to life imprisonment, and 51 to prison terms varying in
 length from 2 to 15 years. In October a military court sentenced eight defendants
 and acquitted one in connection with the September 18 attack on German tourists
 (see Section l.a.).
 The State Security Emergency Courts share jurisdiction with military court over
 crimes affecting national security. The President appoints judges to these courts
 from the civilian judiciary upon the recommendation of the Minister of Justice and,
 if he chooses to appoint military judges, the Minister of Defense. Sentences are sub-
 ject to confirmation by the President but cannot be appealed. The President may
 alter or annul a decision of a State Security Emergency Court, including a decision
 to release a defendant.
 During the year, 8 cases were referred to State Security Emergency Courts involv-
 ing 123 defendants charged with terrorist acts.
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of political prisoners, but observers
 estimate that the total may be in the thousands.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution, homes, correspondence, telephone calls, and other means of com-
 munication "shall have their own sanctity, and their secrecy shall be guaranteed."
 Police must obtain warrants before undertaking searches and wiretaps. Courts have
 dismissed cases in which warrants were issued without sufficient cause. Police offi-
 cers who conduct searches without proper warrants are subject to criminal pen-
 alties, although these are seldom imposed.
 However, the Emergency Law has abridged the constitutional prvisions regard-
 ing the right to privacy. The Emergency Law empowers the Government to place
 wiretaps, intercept mail, and search persons or places without warrants. Security
 agencies frequently place political activists, suspected subversives, journalists, for-
 eigners, and writers under surveillance, screen their correspondence (especially
 international mail), search them and their homes, and confiscate personal property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Seech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 a nd the press. However, the Government continued to place some limitations on
 these rights. Citizens openly speak their views on a wide range of political and so-
 cimal issues, including vigorous criticism of the Government.
 The Government owns stock in the three largest daily newspapers, and the Presi-
 dent appoints their editors-in-chief. However, although these newspapers generally
 follow the government line, they frequently criticize government policies. The Gov-
 ernment also enjoys a monopoly on the printing and distribution of newspapers, in-
 
 
 1431
 cluding the opposition parties' papers. The Government has been known to use its
 monopolistic control of newsprint to limit the output of opposition publications.
 Opposition political parties publish their own newspapers but receive a subsidy
 from the Government and, in some cases, subsidies from foreign interests as well
 Most are weeklies, with the exception of the daily Al Wafd, the daily Al-Ahrar, and
 Al-Shaab, the semiweekly of the Islamist-oriented Socialist Labor Party. All have
 small circulations. Opposition newspapers frequently publish criticism of the Gov-
 ernment, inspiring rejoinders from the g vernment-owned press. They also give
 greater prominence to human rights abuses than the state-run newspapers. All
 party newspapers are required by law to reflect the platform of their party.
 The Press Law, the Publications Law, and the Penal Code govern press issues.
 The laws stipulate fines or imprisonment for criticism of the President, members of
 the Government, and foreign heads of state. The Constitution restricts ownership
 of newspapers to public or private legal entities, corporate bodies, and political par-
 ties. However, there are numerous restrictions on legal entities that wish to estab-
 lish their own newspapers. Following implementation of the Press Law in 1996, the
 Government issued licenses for four new newspapers. Newspapers published outside
 Egypt can be distributed with government permission.
 Libel laws provide protection against malicious rumor-mongering and unsubstan-
 tiated reporting. Financial penalties increased substantially in 1996 when relevant
 provisions of the Penal Code were revised. However, the judicial process remains
 long and costly, creating a bar to realistic legal recourse for those wrongly defamed.
 In recent years, opposition party newspapers have, within limits, published articles
 critical of the President and foreign heads of state without being charged or har-
 assed. Most libel cases are brought by the Government, usually involving rumors
 or charges of corruption against members of the families of government officials. On
 several occasions in 1996, the public prosecutor interrogated editors and journalists
 for publishing allegations of official misconduct and corruption. In one instance the
 Government confiscated an issue of the newspaper, Sawt Al Umma which contained
 an article critical of the Information Minister.
 In 1996 the People's Assembly approved a revised Press Law, following criticism
 of a more restrictive revision that had been approved in 1995. In related action, the
 People's Assembly also revised certain articles in the Penal Code pertaining to libel
 and slander. In addition, in February the Supreme Constitutional Court declared
 unconstitutional Article 195 of the Penal Code under which an editor-in-chief could
 have been considered criminally responsible for libel contained in any portion of the
 newspaper. The Court ruled that the correct standard of responsibility should be
 "negligence." This lesser standard was subsequently applied by the courts in sepa-
 rate cases.
 During the year, family members of senior government officials sued for libel in
 two high-profile cases. In July an appeals court upheld an earlier conviction of
 Magdy Ahmad Hussein, editor of the Islamic fundamentalist newspaper, Al Shaab,
 for libeing Ala'a Afi, a son of Interior Minister Hassan Alfi. This conviction in-
 volved a 3-year sentence and a fine of $4,411.76 (15,000 Egyptian pounds). Hussein
 has appealed to the Court of Cassation. Separately, other members of the Alfi family
 also sued Hussein and fellow Al Shaab journalist Mohammed Hillal for libel. In Jan-
 uary a misdemeanor court combined the cases and sentenced the two men to a sus-
 pended sentence of 1 year. Hussein and Hillal are appealing this ruling.
 On September 13, a misdemeanor court convicted six journalists from the London-
 based newspaper Al-Sharq al-Awsat for libel of President Mubarak's sons, Gamal
 and Alaa. On December 10, an appellate court judge dismissed this judgment after
 Mubarak's sons dropped the charges following an out-of-court settlement in which
 the newspaper agreed to reopen its Cairo office and rehire its Egyptian employees.
 Government officials also filed suit against 16 journalists in 6 cases during the
 year.
 On occasion, based on authority granted to him by law, the public prosecutor may
 issue a temporary ban on the publication of news pertaining to cases involving na-
 tional security and order so as to protect the confidentiality of the cases. During the
 year, the public prosecutor banned publication of news in at least four instances,
 including reporting on the Interior Minister's libel suit against Al Shaab editor Hus-
 sein and the September 18 attack on tourists visiting the Egyptian museum. The
 length of the ban is based on the length of time required for the prosecution to pre-
 pare its case.
 Various ministries are legally authorized to ban or confiscate books and other
 works of art, upon obtaining a court order. The Islamic Research Center at Al Azhar
 University has legal authority to censor, but not to confiscate, all publications deal-
 ing with the Koran and Islamic scriptural texts. In recent years the Center has
 passed judgment on the suitability of nonreligious books and artistic productions.
 
 
 1432
 In January 1995, an administrative court ruled that the sole authority to prohibit
 publication or distribution of books and other works of art resides with the Ministry
 of Culture. This decision voided a 1994 advisory opinion by a judiciary council that
 had expanded AI-Azhars censorship authority to include visual and audio artistic
 works. The same year, President Mubarak stated that the Government would not
 allow confiscation of books from the market without a court order, a position sup-
 ported by the then-Grand Mufti, who is now the Grand Imam of Al Azhar.
 There were no court-ordered, confiscations during the year. However, one book
 written by Islamist thinker Sayyed Al Qinmy was seized by police on August 16
 without a court order, after officials at the Islamic Research Center at Al Azhar
 ruled that it should be banned for violating religious laws and norms. On September
 15, a court ruled in favor of lifting the confiscation and releasing all copies of the
 book, The God of Time."
 On May 25, an apals court upheld a previous decision by a lower court to sen-
 tence author Ala'a amed to 1 year in prison and a fine of $58.82 (200 Egyptian
 pounds) for the pornographic content of his book, "The Bed." Hamed appealed-to the
 Court of Cassation; on August 3, an appeals court suspended implementation of his
 sentence and released him from jail pending a final ruling.
 The Ministry of Interior regularly confiscates leaflets and other works by Muslim
 fundamentalists. It also has the authority, which it exercises sporadically, to stop
 specific issues of foreign-published newspapers from entering the country on the
 grounds of protecting publc order. The Ministry of Defense may ban wors about
 sensitive security issues.
 The Council of Ministers may order the banning of works that it deems offensive
 to public morals, detrimental to religion, or likely to cause a breach of the peace.
 Plays and films must pass Ministry of Culture censorship tests as scripts and as
 final productions. Many plays and films, highy critical of the Government and its
 policies, are not censored. The Ministry or Culture also censors foreign films for
 viewing in theaters, but it is more lenient when the same films are released in video
 cassette format. Government censors ensure that foreign films made in Egypt por-
 tray Egypt in a favorable light. Censors review scripts before filming, are present
 durng filmg, and have the right to review the flm before it is sent out of Egypt.
 On August 3, a court dismissed all lawsuits filed against the film, "The Emi-
 grant," ending a 2-year legal battle. Still pending before an appeals court is the case
 against the film, "Birds of Darknes.s. The plaintiffs charge that it is insulting to
 lawyers. Two related cases against the movie were dropped during the year. On
 March 21, a court rejected an attempt to ban the distribution of the film, "Sleeping
 in Honey." A group of lawyers filed suit against film director Youssef Chahine on
 May 21, charging him with neglecting to obtain the approval of Al Azhar's Islamic
 Research Center prior to distribution of his film, "Destiny." On May 19, an appeals
 court acquitted two actors formerly convicted of pornography for their work in the
 film, "Father of Gold," and augmented the fine assessed against the producer to
 $1,470.59 (5,000 Egyptian pounds).
 The Ministry of Information owns and operates all domestic television produc-
 tions. In the past, it has censored artistic works that criticized the Government or
 dealt with social problems from a nongovernmental perspective. The Ministry also
 censored 10 articles of the English-language weekly The Middle East Times during
 the year. Some of the articles had contained allegations of human rights violations.
 The Government also expelled the weekly's publisher, Thomas Cromwell, but cited
 reasons unrelated to his position as a journalist for the action. Moderate Muslims
 and secularist writers continue to find themselves under legal attack by Islamic ex-
 tremists. Cairo University professor Nasr Abu Zeid and his wife continue to live
 abroad following the 1996 Court of Cassation ruling that affirmed lower court judg-
 ments that Abu Zeid is an apostate because of his controversial interpretation of
 Koranic teachings. In May a member of the Al Azhar's Islamic Research Center pub-
 licly attacked the writings of Dr. Hassan Hanafy, a professor of philosophy at Cairo
 University; however, the Center took no action against Hanafy. The courts have also
 ruled against Islamic extremists. On June 29, a misdemeanor court dismissed a libel
 suit brought against the magazine Rose Al Yussef for alleged violations of Islamic
 norms, and awarded the magazine $5,882.35 (20,000 Egyptian pounds) as com-
 pensation. On August 30, a misdemeanor court dismissed the $500 million suit
 against the Cable News Network (CNN); the plaintiffs had accused CNN of defam-
 ing Egypt's reputation in the network's 1994 news report depicting the performance
 of female genital mutilation (FGM) on an Egyptian girl.
 In January state security forces carried out raids in which they arrested some 80
 middle and upper-class young people, mostly private school and university students,
 devoted to heavy metalrock music and its trappings. According to rumors, they
 were involved in Satan worship, marijuana use, and animal sacrifices. Forty-four of
 
 
 1433
 those picked up were remanded to custody, but all were released without charge
 after about 2 weeks.
 The Government does not directly restrict academic freedom at universities. How-
 ever, some university professors claim that the Government tightened its control
 over universities in 1994 in a law authorizing university presidents to appoint the
 deans of the various faculties. Under the previous law, faculty deans were elected
 by their peers. The Government has justified the measure as a means to combat
 Islamist influence on campus.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government continues to
 maintain substantial restrictions on freedom of assembly. Under a 1923 law, citi-
 zens must obtain approval from the Ministry of Interior before holding public meet-
 ings, rallies, and protest marches. The Interior Ministry selectively obstructs meet-
 ings scheduled to be held on private property, including university campuses. Ac-
 cording to human rights groups, the Government canceled or disrupted more than
 40 meetings during the year, most of which were related to opposition to the Agrar-
 ian Reform Law.
 The Government continues to maintain substantial restrictions on freedom of as-
 sociation. Under law 32 of 1964, the Ministry of Social Affairs has extensive author-
 ity over associations and private foundations, including the right to license and dis-
 solve them, confiscate their properties, appoint members to their boards, and inter-
 cede in other administrative matters. Licenses may be revoked if such organizations
 engage in political or religious activities. The law authorizes the Ministry to "merge
 two or more associations to achieve a similar function," a provision that may be
 used to merge an undesirable organization out of existence.
 Since 1985 the Government has refused to license the Egyptian Organization for
 Human Rights (EOHR) and the Arab Organization for Human Rights (AOHR) on
 grounds that they are political organizations. Nevertheless, both continue to operate
 openly (see Section 4). Under 1993 legislation on professional syndicates, an associa-
 tion must elect its governing board by at least 50 percent of its general membership.
 Failing a quorum, a second election must be held in which at least 30 percent of
 the membership votes for the board. If such a quorum is impossible, the judiciary
 may appoint a caretaker board until new elections can be set. The law was adopted
 to prevent well-organized minorities, specifically Islamists, from capturing or retain-
 ing the leadership of professional syncates. Members of these syndicates have re-
 ported that Islamists have used such irregular electoral techniques as physically
 blocking polling places and limiting or changing the location of polling sites.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of belief and the
 practice of religious rites. However, the Government places clear restrictions on this
 right. Most Egyptians are Muslim, but at least 10 per cent of the population, 6 mil-
 lion people, be ong to the Coptic Orthodox Church. There are other small Christian
 denominations, as well as a Jewish community numbering fewer than 50 persons.
 For the most part, members of the non-Muslim minority worship without harass-
 ment and maintain links with coreligionists abroad. Under the Constitution, Islam
 is the official state religion and primary source of legislation. Accordingly, religious
 practices that conflict with Islamic law are prohibited. However, in most matters of
 family law, Christians are subject to church law. While neither the Constitution nor
 the Civil and Penal Codes prohibit proselytizing, Christians have been arrested on
 charges of violating Article 98f of the Penal Code, which prohibits citizens from ridi-
 culing or insulting heavenly religions or inciting sectarian strife. There were no re-
 ports of such arrests during the year. Some Christians have complained that the
 Government and security forces are lax in protecting Christian lives and property
 (see Section 5). There are no legal restrictions on the conversion of non-Muslims to
 Islam. However, Muslims may face legal problems if they convert to another faith.
 Authorities have charged a few Muslim converts to Christianity under Article 98f
 of the Penal Code. In other cases, authorities have charged converts with violating
 laws prohibiting the falsification of documents. In such instances, Muslim converts
 to Christianity, who fear government harassment if they seek an official modifica-
 tion, have themselves altered their identification cards and other official identity
 documents to reflect their new religious affiliation. There were no confirmed reports
 of individuals detained or charged during the year under these laws. In January
 human rights activist Mamdouh Nakhlah filed suit seeking removal of the religious
 affiliation category from identification cards (see below).
 An 1856 Ottoman Decree still in force requires non-Muslims to obtain what is
 now a presidential decree to build or repair a place of worship. In addition, Interior
 Ministry regulations issued in 1934 specify a set of 10 conditions that the Govern-
 ment must consider prior to issuance of a presidential decree permitting construc-
 tion or renovation of a church. These conditions include the location of the proposed
 site, the religious composition of the surrounding community, and the proximity of
 
 
 1434
 other churches. Although President iMubarak has approved all requests for permits
 presented to him (reportedly a total of 230 during his 16-year tenure), Christians
 maintain that the Interior Ministry delays, in some instances indefinitely, submis-
 sion to the President of their requests. -hey also maintain that security forces have
 blocked them from utilizing permits that have been issued. In January 1996, human
 rights activist Mamdouh Nakhla filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of
 the Ottoman Decree and the Interior Ministry regulations. The case remains before
 the court.
 As a result of these restrictions, some communities use private buildings and
 apartments for religious services. During the 1990's, the Government increased the
 number of building permits issued to Christian communities to an average of more
 than 20 per year, compared with the average of 5 permits issued annually in the
 1980's. However, in 1997 the Government issued only 3 permits for the construction
 of new churches and another 3 for repairs and reconstruction. Construction and ren-
 ovation approved by previously issued permits continued throughout the year.
 In 1994 the Alexandria government closed two buildings near the city that had
 been used by evangelical Christians since 1990 for church activities. The Govern-
 ment claimed that the church lacked a building permit. Lawyers for the church ar-
 gued that the closures violated previous court rulings upholding the right to conduct
 religious services in private buildings without priorgovernment approval. They also
 pointed out that the closed buildings were located in an area where unlicensed
 uildings are common. On September 1, an administrative court in Alexandria
 upheld the Government's decision to close the buildings, stating that the construc-
 tion of the buildings without permits violated the building code. The court did not
 address the issue of freedom of worship in its decision. The plaintiffs are appealing
 this decision.
 The Government continued its efforts to extend legal controls to all mosques,
 which by law must be licensed. The Government appoints and pays the salaries of
 the imams officiating in mosques, and proposes themes for and monitors sermons.
 Of the countrs approximately 70,000 mosques, nearly half remain unlicensed and
 operate outside the control of government authorities. In an effort to combat Islamic
 extremists, the Government announced its intention to bring 10,000 unauthorized
 mosques under its control during the year.
 d.Freedomof Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens and foreigners are free to travel within Egypt except in certain
 mlitary areas. Males who have not completed compulsory military service may not
 travel abroad or emigrate, although this restriction can be deferred or bypassed. Un-
 married women under the age of 21 must have permission from their fathers to ob-
 tain passports and travel; married women require the same per-mission from their
 husbands. Citizens who leave the country have the right to return.
 The Constitution forbids the deportation of citizens and aliens granted political
 asylum. Egypt grants first asylum for humanitarian reasons or in the event of inter-
 nal turmoil in neighboring countries. Asylum seekers generally are screened by rep-
 resntatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNWCR),
 whose recommendations regarding settlement are forwarded to the Ministries of In-
 terior and Foreign Affairs for final determination. Refugees accepted by the Govern-
 ment are permitted to live and work but cannot acquire Egyptian citizenship, with
 rare exceptions. During the year, the Government accepted more than 6,000 refu-
 gees, including more than 3,000 Somalis and more than 1,500 Sudanese, for tem-
 porary resettlement. Although there is no pattern of abuse of refugees, the Govern-
 ment temporarily detained some refugees (wvho had earlier been accorded protection
 status) during random security sweeps. Following intervention by the UNHCR, the
 refugees were released.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) dominates the 454-seat People's As-
 sembly, the Shura Council, local governments, the mass media, labor, the large pub-
 lic sector, and the licensing of new political parties, newspapers, and private organi-
 zations to such an extent that, as a practical matter, citizens do not have a mean-
 inul ability to change their government.
 In 1993 President Hosni Mubarak was elected unopposed to a third 6-year term
 by the People's Assembly. In October of that year, his reelection was approved by
 96 percent of the voters in a national referendum. Under the Constitution, the elec-
 torate is not presented with a choice among competing presidential candidates. Two
 opposition parties urged the public to boycott the referendum, and two other parties
 urged the public to vote against the President. The other opposition parties en-
 dorsed the President's candidacy.
 
 
 1435
 More than 100 losing candidates in the fall 1995 legislative elections filed com-
 plaints in the administrative courts, alleging ballot-rigging and other irregularities.
 The courts agreed with most of these claims. Although the judiciary has the author-
 ity to determine whether or not irregularities took place, it does not have the au-
 thority to remove an elected member of the Assembly, a right that the Assembly
 claims solely for itself, citing the concept of parliamentary sovereignty. The Assem-
 bly has not called for any new by-elections in response to the court's judgment, nor
 is it expected to do so.
 The Assembly debates government proposals, and members exercise their author-
 ity to call cabinet ministers to explain policy. The executive initiates almost all leg-
 islation. Nevertheless, the Assembly maintains the authority to challenge or re-
 strain the executive in the areas of economic and social policy, but it may not modify
 the budget except with the Government's approval. The Assembly exercises limited
 influence in the areas of security and foreign policy, and there is little oversight of
 the Interior Ministry's use of emergency law powers. Many executive branch initia-
 tives and policies are carried out by regulation through ministerial decree without
 legislative oversight. The military budget is prepared by the executive and not de-
 bated publicly. Roll-call votes in the Assembly are rare. Votes are generally reported
 in aggregate terms of yeas and nays, and thus constituents have no independent
 method of checking a member's voting record.
 There are 13 recognized opposition parties. The law empowers the Government
 to bring felony charges against those who form a party without a license. New par-
 ties must be approved by the Parties Committee, a semiofficial body including a
 substantial majority of members from the ruling NDP and some members from
 among the independents and opposition parties. Decisions of the Parties Committee
 may be appealed to the civil courts. No new parties sought approval during the
 year. Sixteen parties whose applications have been previously denied are contesting
 the decisions.
 According to the law, which prohibits political parties based on religion, the Mus-
 lim Brotherhood is an illegal political organization. Muslim Brothers are publicly
 known and openly speak their views, but are subject to government pressure (see
 Section 1.d.). Some have served in the Assembly as independents or as members of
 other recognized parties.
 In the April elections to local councils, which range in size from the smallest gov-
 ernment administrative unit to the governorate level, the NDP won more than 95
 percent of the seats. Prior to the actual voting, the NDP had gained more than 50
 percent of the seats by default. Some opposition parties boycotted the elections,
 which were characterized by a low turnout. Local council elections are held every
 4 years.
 Women and minorities are underrepresented in government and politics. The Con-
 stitution reserves 10 assembly seats for presidential appointees, which the President
 traditionally has used to assure representation for Coptic Christians and women.
 Five women and no Copts were elected in 1995; of the 10 presidential appointments,
 6 were Copts and 4 were women. The ruling NDP nominated no Coptic candidates
 in the 1995 parliamentary elections. Two women and 2 Copts serve among the 32
 ministers in the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government refuses to license local human rights groups as private entities
 under Law 32 of 1964 (see Section 2.b.). Since 1986 the Government has refused
 to license the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights on grounds that it is a polit-
 ical organization and duplicates the activities of an existing, although moribund,
 human rights group (see Section 2.b.). The EOHR has appealed the denial in the
 courts, and continues to conduct activities openly, pending a final judicial deter-
 mination of its status.
 The Arab Organization for Human Rights, EOHR's parent organization, has a
 longstanding request for registration as a foreign organization with the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs. The Ministry has not approved the request thus far, stating that
 the issue is dependent on the outcome of efforts within the League of Arab States
 to establish a human rights body.
 Despite their nonrecognition, the EOHR and other groups sometimes enjoy the co-
 operation of government officials. The Government allows EOHR field workers to
 visit prisons in their capacity as legal counsel, to call on some government officials,
 and to receive funding from foreign human rights organizations. Many local and
 international human rights activists have concluded, however, that government re-
 strictions on the activities of NGO's have significantly inhibited reporting on human
 rights abuses.
 
 
 1436
 There were no reports during the year that the Government banned meetings of
 human rights groups, although the Government on occasion makes the holding of
 such meetings difficult. For example, some human rights organizations have found
 requests for conference space turned down for "security reasons" or reservations
 later canceled for "maintenance reasons." Other human rights organizations, such
 as the Center for Human Rights Legal Aid, are registered with the Government as
 corporations under commercial or civil law, thus avoiding the obstacles posed by
 Law 32 (see Section 2.b.).
 In 1995 the Ministry of Justice issued a nonbinding advisory ruling stating that
 such organizations properly should be considered nongovernmental organizations as
 defined by Law 32 and regstered accordingly, or face punitive action. However, the
 Government did not close down any group during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality of the sexes and equal treatment of non-
 Muslims, but aspects of the law and many traditional practices discriminate against
 women and Christians.
 Women.-Family violence against women occurs and is reflected in press accounts
 of specific incidents. According to recent statistics, one of every three women who
 have ever been married has been beaten at least once during marriage. Among
 those who have been beaten, less than half have ever sought help. In general, neigh-
 bors and extended family members intervene to limit incidents of domestic violence.
 Abuse within the family is rarely discussed publicly, due to the value attached to
 privacy in this traditional society. Several NGO's have begun offering counseling,
 legal aid, and other services to women who are victims of domestic violence. Rape
 is known to occur, but reliable statistics are not available. When "honor killings"
 (a man murdering a female relative for her perceived lack of chastity) occur, per-
 petrators generally receive lighter punishments than those convicted in other cases
 of murder. The law provides for equality of the sexes, but aspects of the law and
 many traditional practices discriminate against women. By law, unmarried women
 under the age of 21 must have permission from their fathers to obtain passports
 and travel; married women of any age require the same permission from their hus-
 bands (see Section 2.d.). Only males can confer citizenship. In rare cases, this means
 that children born to Egyptian mothers and stateless fathers are themselves state-
 less. A woman's testimony is equal to that of a man's in Egyptian courts.
 Laws affecting marriage and personal status generally correspond to an individ-
 ual's religion, which is Islam for most citizens. A 1979 liberalization of the Family
 Status Law strengthening a Muslim woman's rights to divorce and child custody
 was repealed in 1985 after it was found unconstitutional for conflicting with Islamic
 law. A new marriage contract for Muslim women was proposed in 1995 to replace
 the current one drafted in 1931. It stipulates premarital negotiations on a wide vari-
 ety of issues, including the woman's right to work, study and travel abroad, and di-
 vorce settlements. Government approval is still pending.
 Under Islamic law, non-Muslim males must convert to Islam to marry Muslim
 women, but non-Muslim women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim fe-
 male heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian wid-
 ows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her par-
 ents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits
 all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs face strong social pressure to provide
 for all family members who need assistance. However, this assistance is not always
 provided.
 Women have employment opportunities in government, medicine, law, academia,
 the arts, and, to a lesser degree, in business. According to government figures,
 women constitute 17 percent of private business owners, and occupy 25 percent of
 the managerial positions in the four major national banks. Social pressure against
 women pursuing a career is strong, and some women's rights advocates say that a
 resurgent Islamic fundamentalist trend limits further gains. Women's rights advo-
 cates also point to other discriminatory traditional or cultural attitudes and prac-
 tices such as female genital mutilation and the traditional male relative's role in
 enforcing chastity and chaste sexual conduct.
 A number of active women's rights groups work in diverse areas, including re-
 forming the Personal Status Code, educating women on their legal rights, combating
 FGM, and rewriting the marriage contract.
 Children.-The Government remains committed to the protection *of children's
 welfare within the limits of its budgetary resources. Many of the resources for chil-
 dren's welfare are provided by international donors, especially in the field of child
 
 
 1437
 immunization. Child labor is widespread, despite the Government's commitment to
 eradicate it (see Section 6.d.).
 The Government provides public education, which is compulsory for the first 9
 academic years (typically until the age of 15). In education the Government treats
 boys and girls equally at all levels of education.
 The Government enacted a new Child Law in 1996. The law provides for more
 privileges, protection, and care for children in general. Six of the law's 144 articles
 set advantageous rules for working children (see Section 6.d.). Other previsions in-
 clude: Employers are to set up or contract with a child care center if they employ
 more than 100 women; the right of rehabilitation for disabled children; defendants
 between the ages of 16 and 18 may not be sentenced to capital punishment, hard
 labor for life, or temporary hard labor; and defendants under the age of 15 may not
 be placed in preventive custody, although the prosecution may order that they be
 lodged in an 'observation house" and be summoned upon request.
 The Government remains committed to eradicating the practice of female genital
 mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health experts as damaging
 to both physical and psychological health. Despite strong government and commu-
 nity efforts to eradicate FGM, government and private sources agree that it is com-
 mon. Traditional and family pressures remain strong; a recent study places the per-
 centage of Egyptian women who have undergone FGM at 97 percent. FGM is gen-
 erally performed on girls between the ages of 7 and 10, with equal prevalence
 among Muslims and Coptic Christians.
 The 1996 decree by the Minister of Health and Population Planning banning the
 practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) was challenged in the courts on the
 grounds that the ban was unconstitutional. On December 28, the Supreme Adminis-
 trative Court, the court of last resort in this matter, upheld the Government's ban.
 The Government also supports a range of efforts to educate the public. A discussion
 of FGM and its dangers has been added to the curriculum of the school system. The
 Government broadcasts television programs condemning the practice. The Minister
 of Awqaf (religious endowments) and the Minister of Health met with 6,500 new
 imams (Muslim preachers) on August 25 and advised them that FGM is a bad habit
 unrelated to Islam. Senior religious leaders also support efforts to stop the practice.
 The Sheikh of Al Azhar, the most senior Islamic figure in the country, and the lead-
 er of the Coptic Christian community, Pope Shenouda, have stated repeatedly that
 FGM is not required by religious doctrine. A number of NGO's also work actively
 to educate the public about the health hazards of the practice.
 In December a provincial court in Qalyub found Dr. Rabie Ibrahim Mahgoub
 guilty of "immense medical negligence" in the death of a 14-year-old girl on whom
 he performed FGM in April. The court sentenced Mahgoub to 1 year on jail and a
 $150 (510 Egyptian pounds) fine for causing her death.
 People With Disabilities.-There are approximately 5.7 million disabled persons,
 of whom 1.5 million are severely disabled. The Government makes serious efforts
 to address their rights. It works closely with United Nations agencies and other
 international aid donors to design job-training programs for the disabled. The Gov-
 ernment also seeks to increase the public's awareness of the capabilities of the dis-
 abled in television programming, the print media, and in educational material in
 public schools.
 By law, all businesses must designate 5 percent of their jobs for the disabled, who
 are exempt from normal literacy requirements. Although there is no legislation
 mandating access to public accommodations and transportation, the disabled may
 ride government-owned mass transit buses without charge, are given priority in ob-
 taining telephones, and receive reductions on customs duties for private vehicles.
 Religious Minorities.-The Constitution provides that all citizens are equal before
 the law and prohibits discrimination based on religion. For the most part these con-
 stitutional protections are upheld by the Government. However, discrimination
 against Christians still exists.
 The approximately 6 million Cop tic Christians are the objects of occasional violent
 assaults by Muslim extremists. During the year, extremists were responsible for
 killing at least 23 Egyptian Christians, most in the Minya and Assiyut govenorates,
 where about 30 to 40 percent of the inhabitants are Christian (see Section L.a.). Acts
 of violence also were reported against churches and Coptic-owned businesses; some
 carried out by extremists, but others committed by ordinary citizens. Rumors of
 church repairs or building without permits occasionally resulted in anti-Christian
 rioting by citizens. In one incident in the delta village of Greis, local newspapers
 reported that two members of the Muslim Brotherhood claimed that a priest was
 building a monastery without government permission. This false rumor, repeated at
 evening prayer, incited local residents to set fire to the house on June 18.
 
 
 1438
 
 Some Christians have complained that the Government is lax in protecting Chris-
 tian lives and property. Security forces arrest extremists who perpetrate violence
 against Christians, but some members of the Christian community do not believe
 that the Government is sufficiently vigorous in its efforts to prevent attacks. They
 also maintain that the Government does little to correct nonviolent forms of dis-
 crimination, including its own.
 In general, security forces responded rapidly to attacks against Christians during
 the year. The Government also thoroughly investigated the incidents, filing charges
 as appropriate. Following the deadly attack on church youths in Abu Qurqas in Feb-
 mary, the Minister of Awqaf and senior Islamic figures traveled to the site to con-
 denn the action and to express condolences.
 There were reports of forced conversions of Coptic children to Islam, but even
 human rights groups find it extremely difficult to determine the actual degree of
 compulsion used, as most cases involve a Coptic girl converting to Islam to marry
 a Muslim boy. According to the Government, the girl in such cases must meet with
 her family, with her priest, and with the head of her church before she is allowed
 to convert. However, there are credible reports of government harassment of Chris-
 tian families attempting to regain custody of their daughters, and of the failure of
 the authorities to uphold the law that states that a marriage of a girl under the
 age of 16 is prohibited and between the ages of 16 and 21 is illegal without the ap-
 proval and presence of her guardian.
 Government discriminatory practices include: Suspected statistical underrepresen-
 tation of the size of the Christian population; anti-Christian discrimination in edu-
 cation; failure to admit Christians into schools of Arabic studies to become Arabic
 teachers as the curriculum involves study of the Koran; job discrimination in the
 public sector-the police, the armed forces, and other government agencies; reported
 discrimination against Christians in staff appointments at universities; and their
 under representation in government. There are no Coptic governors and no Copts
 in the upper ranks of the military or police. There were no anti-Christian television
 programs during the year.
 In November more than 100 leading Egyptians, including university professors,
 members of the People's Assembly and Shura Council, journalists, artists, and NGO
 activists, signed a public statement that acknowledged discrimination against Chris-
 tians. This "Declaration to the Nation" ran in Al-Shaab, an opposition newspaper
 often critical of the Government, which is published by the minority Labor Party.
 The statement, which A1-Shaab ran for free with 50 signatures on November 7, and
 again with an additional 50 signatures on November 21, acknowledged that Chris-
 tians suffer from discrimination, but it stated that the Egyptian people and authori-
 ties had to resolve these problems within an "Egyptian framework." The statement
 also rejected foreign criticism and interference in this area.
 Anti-Semitism in the Egyptian press is found primarily, but not exclusively, in the
 nonofficial press of the opposition parties. The Government has condemned anti-
 Semitism and advised journalists and cartoonists to avoid anti-Semitism. There
 have been no anti-Semitic incidents in recent years directed at the tiny Jewish com-
 munity.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may join trade unions but are not required
 to do so. A union local, or workers' committee, may be formed if 50 employees ex-
 press a desire to organize. Most union members, about 27 per cent of the labor force,
 are employed by state-owned enterprises. The law stipulates that "high administra-
 tive" officials in government and the public sector may not join unions.
 There are 23 trade unions, all required to belong to the Egyptian Trade Union
 Federation (ETUF), the sole legally recognized labor federation. The International
 Labor Organization's Committee of Experts repeatedly has emphasized that a law
 requiring all trade unions to belong to a single federation infringes on the freedom
 of association. The Government has shown no sign that it intends to accept the es-
 tablishment of more than one federation. The ETUF leadership asserts that it ac-
 tively promotes worker interests and that there is no need for another federation.
 ETUF officials have close relations with the NDP, and some are members of the
 People's Assembly or the Shura Council. They speak vigorously on behalf of worker
 concerns, but public confrontations between the ETUF and the Government are
 rare. Disputes are more often resolved by consensus behind closed doors.
 The labor laws do not adequately provide statutory authorization for the rights
 to strike and to engage in collective bargaining. Even though the right to strike is
 not provided, strikes occur. The Government considers strikes a form of public dis-
 turbance and hence illegal.

 A limited number of strikes took place in the public sector during the year, mainly
 over wage and dismissal questions. Local security forces used tear gas and physical
 force on June 18 to break up a strike involving hundreds of employees at Zagazig
 University, located 50 miles east of Cairo. One employee was reportedly seriously
 harmed by exposure to tear gas, but the person recovered.
 Some unions within the ETUF are affiliated with international trade union orga-
 nizations. Others are in the process of becoming affiliated.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under the law, unions may
 negotiate work contracts with public sector enterprises if the latter agree to such
 negotiations, but unions otherwise lack collective bargaining power in the state sec-
 tor. Under current circumstances, collective bargaining does not exist in any mean-
 ingful sense because the Government sets wages, benefits, and job classifications by
 law.
 Firms in the private sector generally do not adhere to such government-mandated
 standards. Although they are required to observe some government practices, such
 as the minimum wage, social security insurance, and official holidays, they often do
 not adhere to government practice in non-binding matters, including award of the
 annual Labor Day bonus.
 Labor law and practice are the same in the export processing zones (EPZ's) as in
 the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Article 13 of the Constitution pro-
 hibits forced labor. However, the Criminal Code authorizes sentences of hard labor
 for some crimes. Although the law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded
 labor by children, such practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.d.).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Under the
 Child Law approved in 1996 (see Section 5), the minimum age for employment is
 14 in nonagricultural work. Provincial governors, with the approval of the Minister
 of Agriculture, can authorize seasonal work for children between the ages of 12 and
 14, provided that duties are not hazardous and do not interfere with schooling.
 Preemployment training for children under the age of 12 is prohibited. It is prohib-
 ited for children to work for more than 6 hours a day, including one or more breaks
 totaling at least 1 hour. Children are not to work overtime, during their weekly day
 off, between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m., or more than 4 hours continuously. Education is
 compulsory for the first 9 academic years (typically until the age of 15). Ministry
 of Health figures indicate that 2 million children between the ages of 6 and 15 are
 employed. A 1989 study estimated that perhaps 720,000 children work on farms.
 However, children also work as apprentices in repair and craft shops, in heavier in-
 dustries such as brick making and textiles, and as workers in leather and carpet
 making factories. While local trade unions report that the Ministry of Labor ade-
 quately enforces the labor laws in state-owned enterprises, enforcement in the pri-
 vate sector, especially in family-owned enterprises, is lax. Many of these children
 are abused and overworked by their employers, and the restrictions in the new
 Child Law have not improved their condition due to lax enforcement on the part
 of the Government. Although the law does not specifically prohibit forced and bond-
 ed labor by children, such practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c).
 Two accidents involving child agricultural workers during the year highlighted
 the problem of enforcement. On September 21, 29 children were drowned and 56
 were injured when a truck crashed into a canal in Kfar Sheikh. More than 100 chil-
 dren, ranging in age from 5 to 15, were being transported in the truck to pick cot-
 ton. On October 1, six children were drowned in a similar truck accident in
 Dakhaliya. Ranging in age from 5 to 15, they too were harvesting cotton.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-For government and public-sector employees,
 the minimum wage is approximately $28 (about 95 Egyptian pounds) a month for
 a 6-day, 42-hour workweek. Base pay is supplemented by a complex system of fringe
 benefits and bonuses that may double or triple a worker's take-home pay. The aver-
 age worker and family could not survive on a workers base pay at the minimum
 wage rate. The minimum wage is also legally binding on the private sector, and
 larger private companies generally observe the requirement and pay bonuses as
 well. Smaller firms do not always pay the minimum wage or bonuses.
 The Ministry of Labor sets worker health and safety standards, which also apply
 in the export processing zones, but enforcement and inspection are uneven. The law
 prohibits employers from maintaining hazardous working conditions, and workers
 have the right to remove themselves from hazardous conditions without risking loss
 of employment.
