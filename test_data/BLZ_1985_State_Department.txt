 BELIZE
 Belize has a parliamentary form of government with a
 competitive political party system and regular local and
 national elections. A Constitution formulated at the time of
 independence in 1981 prescribes the framework of government.
 The People's United Party (PUP) dominated the movement for
 self-government and independence which began in the early
 1950's, and controlled the national government from the time of
 internal self-government in 1964 until the first
 post-independence national elections on December 14, 1984. On
 that date, the United Democratic Party (UDP) defeated the PUP,
 winning 54 percent of the popular vote and capturing 21 of the
 28 seats in the House of Representatives. The election was
 peaceful, open and honest. The UDP currently also controls
 seven of the eight municipal councils in Belize, including the
 Belize City Council.
 The security apparatus consists of the Belize National Police
 and the Belize Defense Force (BDF). The National Police
 comprises approximately 600 men and women and has the principal
 responsibility for law enforcement and maintenance of order.
 The BDF consists of 800 active personnel and reservists;
 although internal security is not its principal mission, it
 occasionally assists in police activities.
 The Government favors free enterprise and has made
 encouragement of the private sector the basis of its strategy
 for achieving economic growth. The Government encourages new
 investment, both domestic and foreign. To provide a sound
 foundation for development, the Government has taken steps to
 strengthen public finances pursuant to a December 1984
 International Monetary Fund (IMF) standby agreement. Largely
 because of depressed markets for sugar, the nation's largest
 source of private employment and of foreign exchange economic
 growth has been slow in recent years. Belize's gross exports
 are increasing, though still below 1981 levels.
 Constitutional protections for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual are upheld by an independent
 judiciary and an equitable justice system. A free press and
 competitive electoral politics also serve to protect civil and
 political rights. There were no cases of political violence
 during 1985, and the country's overall human right record
 remained good.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Unlawful or arbitrary deprivation of life and politically
 motiviated killings were not reported in Belize during 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in Belize during 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment is prohibited by the Constitution and does not
 occur. Sentences for most crimes are generally lenient
 
 
 426
 BELIZE
 compared to sentences imposed for similar crimes elsewhere in
 the region. Prisons continue to be seriously crowded and badly
 antiquated; however, prisoners are adequately fed and have
 comparatively generous social and recreational privileges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary imprisonment and
 guarantees the right of habeas corpus. A person is entitled,
 within 48 hours of arrest, to be informed of the reason for the
 detention and to be brought before a court within 72 hours.
 Release on bail is allowed for all but the most serious
 criminal offenses. These procedural safeguards are routinely
 observed.
 Forced labor is forbidden by the Constitution and is not
 practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution specifically guarantees due process and the
 rights of accused persons: presumption of innocence,
 protection against self incrimination, right to counsel, and
 public trial. Trial by jury is mandatory in criminal cases,
 except for those minor offenses decided by Magistrate's
 Courts. Protection for the integrity of the person in law
 corresponds the actual practice of the courts. The judiciary
 is independent of the executive and is regarded as an effective
 guarantor of an equitable judicial system. Its major
 shortcoming is insufficient trained personnel at all levels,
 resulting from the inability of the Government to provide
 adequate funding. There are no political prisoners in Belize.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the protection of family life,
 personal property, the privacy of the home, and recognition of
 human dignity. No violations of these guarantees have been
 reported during the past year.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are assured under the Constitution
 and are respected in practice. The Government controls
 Belize's only radio station, but a wide range of political
 opinion is presented in the country's press. The opposition
 and independent newspapers are frequently critical of the
 Government. There are fourteen privately owned and operated
 television stations in Belize. Belize is in the process of
 developing a regulatory framework for broadcasting. Following
 enactment of a broacasting law in 1983, a six-member Belize
 Broacasting Authority was appointed, and has begun the process
 of licensing existing stations. A controversy arose in May
 1985 when the authority ruled that a television program
 produced by the opposition PUP could not be aired on the
 grounds that political broadcasts could be approved only in the
 context of upcoming elections. The issue was taken to the
 Supreme Court, which ruled that the relevant provision of the
 broadcasting regulation was unconstitutional. The Government
 has appealed this ruling, and the case is now before the Court
 of Appeals.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly and
 association and the right to form and belong to trade unions
 are respected in practice. Permits are required to hold public
 meetings but are rarely denied.
 There are eight independent labor unions representing
 approximately fifteen percent of the Labor Force. The National
 Trade Union Congress of Belize is affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions through
 membership in the Caribbean Congress of Labor. Belizean unions
 engage in the full range of union activities. The unions have
 the right to collective bargaining, and labor disputes
 unresolved by bargaining are normally settled through
 arbitration; the Labor Commissioner or Joint Labor-Management
 panels serve as mediators. Workers have the right to strike.
 While there are varying degrees of cooperation with the
 political parties, no union is controlled by a political
 party. The Government accepts the principle of tripartite
 representation to the International Labor Organization (ILO),
 but has been constrained from full participation in ILO
 activities by lack of funds.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. More than fifteen Christian
 denominations and the few non-Christian groups all worship
 freely. Most of Belize's primary and secondary schools are
 operated by churches. Church leaders have long had close ties
 to the political establishment, and churches play an active
 role in the tasks of social and national development.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Belize or on
 foreign travel and emigration. Emigration is principally
 motivated by economic reasons and not by political or human
 rights considerations, and emigrants frequently return for
 family visits. Aliens convicted of crimes, particularly drug
 offenses or entry into Belize without proper documentation, are
 usually deported. Several thousand aliens from nearby Central
 American countries have arrived in Belize since 1980, often
 entering illegally and residing in the country without permits.
 Various steps have been taken to deal with this influx. A
 settlement project utilizing funds from the UN High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and lands provided by the
 Belizean Government is providing farmsteads for 86 Salvadoran
 families. A program to register undocumented aliens was
 carried out in 1984. An undetermined number of aliens have
 since legalized their status; however, it is likely that many
 more remain illegally at the risk of arrest and fines. There
 is no evidence that displaced persons have been compelled to
 return to their country of origin. A UNHCR-supported office of
 refugee affairs is a part of the home affairs ministry.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 With the general election of December 1984 and the municipal
 elections in March 1985, Belize experienced a peaceful transfer
 of national governmental power from the PUP to the UDP.
 Although the ruling party's parliamentary majority gives it
 
 
 428
 BELIZE
 broad freedom to decide government policy, its exercise of
 political power is limited by public opinion, a free press, an
 independent judiciary, and genuinely competitive electoral
 politics. Broadly based political participation is represented
 in both major parties. A third party, the Belize Popular
 Party, was formed in early 1985 by PUP members disatisfied with
 that party's policy subsequent to its electoral defeat. In
 addition, there is a small Christian Democratic Party whose
 activities are centered in the Dangriga-Stann Creek Area.
 Another small local party, the Toledo Progressive Party in
 Punta Gorda, did not field candidates in the above-mentioned
 elections. Participation in local and national elections is
 traditionally high in Belize; 74 percent of the electorate
 voted in the 1984 General Election.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international entities have asked to investigate the human
 rights situation in Belize. A private human rights council and
 a branch of Amnesty International exist in Belize. Given the
 favorable human rights environment, the activities of these two
 organizations have been very limited. Amnesty International's
 1985 report did not mention Belize. Freedom House rates Belize
 "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Belize was 165,000 in 1985. The rate of
 population growth is estimated to be 2.2 percent; however,
 accurate estimates are hard to make due to sizeable immigration
 from surrounding countries and emigration from Belize to the
 United States. According to 1982 World Bank figures, per
 capita gross national product was $1083.
 Because of depressed sugar markets, economic activity has been
 slow. Real income remained basically unchanged or possibly
 decreased marginally from 1982. Unemployment was estimated at
 14.2 percent in late 1984, but along with underemployment has
 probably risen with the recent closing of one of the country's
 two sugar mills.
 The adult literacy rate is 91.2 percent and 80 percent of the
 population has access to safe water (both figures are 1970
 World Bank estimates). The ratio of caloric supply available
 for consumption to nutritional requirements was 115 percent in
 1977. The health care system is not able to provide basic
 health care for all Belizeans. Life expectancy at birth is
 over 66 years, while the infant mortality rate is 53.5 per
 thousand live births. Public education, while not compulsory,
 is available for all children between the ages of 6 and 14.
 Minimum ages for employment of children have been established
 at 14 years for work in retail establishments and at 17 years
 for any work near hazardous machinery. Minimum wages have been
 established for many occupations, and there are occupational
 safety regulations, although a shortage of resources makes it
 difficult for the Government to enforce them.
 While there is no official policy of discrimination against
 women in Belize, they are faced with discrimination which is
 rooted in cultural, social, and economic structures. The
 Government, however, seeks the participation of women in the
 
 
 429
 BELIZE
 nation's political parties, private voluntary organizations,
 and churches. They are prominent in local and national
 government and well represented in the professions. The
 Governor General, who represents Queen Elizabeth II in her
 capacity as Belizean Head of State, is a woman, as is the
 President of the Senate. Women hold officer and enlisted
 positions in the police and the BDF.
