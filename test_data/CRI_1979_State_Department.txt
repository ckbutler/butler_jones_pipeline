 COSTA RICA
 
 Strong democratic traditions have served to give Costa
 Rica an outstanding human rights record. Human rights
 and democracy are guiding principles of the country's domes-
 tic and foreign policy. Costa Rica is actively involved
 in international human rights issues. It took the initiative
 in calling for the establishment of the Inter-American
 Human Rights Court installed formally in San Jose during
 September 1979. Costa Rica also continues to press for
 the creation of the post of High Commissioner for Human
 Rights at the United Nations.
 Costa Rica is a democratic republic, with the Government
 divided into three branches: Executive, Legislative and
 Judicial. The independent-Supreme Electoral Tribunal,
 whose main role is to assure the integrity of the. election
 process, is often considered a "fourth branch" of Government.
 While the President is the undisputed head of the Government,
 he does not exercise control over the other branches.
 Costa Rican political life corresponds to the Constitut-
 ional model both in practice and in spirit. Government
 transitions have taken place smoothly after elections. .
 During the last thirty years the party not in power has
 won every quadrennial election, with the exception of 1974.
 In 1978 the Liberation Party, which had governed the country
 for eight years under two presidents, was turned out in
 favor of an opposition coalition.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Costa Rican constitutional guarantees against use of
 torture are respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Guarantees against such violations are respected in practice.
 The Costa Rican Government has recognized that the condition
 of most of the country's prisons is poor. An $11.7 million,
 four-year program of prison construction and improvements,
 designed to bring the system to an acceptable level is
 underway.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Constitutional guarantees against arbitrary arrest or impriso-
 nment are respected in practice. Under Costa Rican law
 there is a requirement that arraignment take place-within
 24 hours. If this is not- done, a writ of habeas corpus
 can be filed. This writ is a Constitutional guarantee.
 There are no political prisoners in Costa Rica.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Constitutional guarantees of fair public trial are respected
 in practice. Defendants have the right to choose their
 
 (287)
 
 
 288
 own counsel and access is unimpeded. The judiciary
 is independent. There are no military courts.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbitrary
 invasion of the home.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Government has been conscientious in its efforts
 to reduce both rural and urban poverty by providing
 social services and generating employment. Examples
 of government actions in this regard are assistance
 to small labor-intensive industries, construction of
 low-cost housing for the poorest urban population, and
 development of the welfare system. In the health field,
 family planning services have been integrated into the
 general health care programs. Rural development activi-
 ties, cooperatives and food and nutrition programs have
 been extended to the rural areas. Medical services
 through the National Social Security System reach a
 large and expanding segment of the population (about
 78 percent). Costa Rica has an excellent educational
 system. Over the past three years an average of 25
 percent of the national budget has been allocated to
 education and Costa Ricans have long been proud of the
 fact that they spend much more for education than for
 defense.
 Although the income tax system is progressive in principle,
 the largest portion of government revenues results from
 trade and consumption taxes which fall most heavily
 on low income groups. Income distribution, though still
 somewhat skewed, is becoming more equitable. Corruption
 is generally believed to be minimal.
 The Costa Rican economy is fundamentally oriented toward
 free enterprise capitalism though the Government operates
 several industries, such as electric power production
 and distribution and telecommunications. Private ownership
 of property is protected.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech, religion
 and assembly are respected in practice. The press is
 completely free and presents divergent views.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Domestic and foreign travel and emigration are unhindered.
 In addition, Costa Rica provides asylum for many people
 of varying political persuasions, including more than
 
 
 289
 one hundred former political prisoners from Cuba released
 in 1979.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process is provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice.
 Elections are free, highly competitive and open. No
 parties are outlawed. Registry of parties and of voters
 is impartially controlled by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal,
 which operates free from interference by any individual
 or institution, including the Government in power.
 A measure of the genuine and lively political process
 in Costa Rica is tha as early as mid-1979, both the
 governing UNIDAD coalition and the major opposition
 party were deeply and publicly engaged in preparations
 for the February 1982 presidential and legislative elections.
 The Constitution provides for equal job and incomb rights
 for women. They are employed in prominent positions
 in the Government, including the Cabinet and Legislative
 Assembly. However, tradition has, in many cases, inhibited
 equal access to jobs and equal wages for the same work.
 This problem is diminishing with time and as the need
 for more trained workers grows.
 Labor unions'are free to organize, strike, bargain
 collectively and lobby. The democratic labor union
 movement, however, is relatively weak, considering the
 progressive nature of most other Costa Rican social
 institutions. There is currently an intensive effort,
 on the part of the Government and the political parties,
 to develop more efficient mechanisms to foster labor
 democracy. Changes may include a reform of the 36-year-
 old Labor Code, which many believe requires modernization
 such as the inclusion of more specific ground rules
 for collective bargaining procedures.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Costa Rica has been a strong and consistent champion
 of human rights in international fora and has extended
 a standing invitation to the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission to visit whenever it wishes. Costa Rican
 Governments regularly invite observers from the OAS
 and other institutions -to witness thenquadrennial electoral
 "civic festival," of which the Costa Ricans are justifiably
 proud. Costa Rica is the only country in the Hemisphere
 which has thus far accepted the automatic jurisdiction
 of the Inter-American Human Rights Court, and was among
 the first to ratify the American Convention on Human
 Rights.
