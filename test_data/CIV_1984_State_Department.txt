 IVORY COAST
 Ivory Coast, which attained independence from France in 1960,
 is a paternalistic civilian one-party state. Power is
 concentrated in the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, whose
 long-time leader is President Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
 Although the formation of other parties is theoretically
 guaranteed by the Constitution, in practice no other party
 is allowed. More open discussion of government policies has
 been permitted in the four years since the country's first
 competitive elections for local party, municipal, and
 legislative positions in 1980.
 Ivory Coast has had considerable economic development since
 independence; however, poverty still prevails in much of the
 country. The Ivorian economy is market-oriented and open to
 foreign investment. Until recently steady economic growth had
 permitted appreciable annual improvement in the standard of
 living throughout the country and contributed to widespread
 support for the policies of the Government. However, over the
 last three years, Ivory Coast has been squeezed by a heavy
 debt burden and low prices for its export products on world
 markets. The austerity measures which government has
 introduced to offset this reduced income have been widely, but
 not completely, accepted. The President advocates 'dialogue'
 in settling disputes, generally seeking to involve dissenters
 in the operation of the Ivorian system rather than isolate or
 imprison them.
 In late 1983, the President lifted the ban on the secondary
 school teachers' union which had resulted from an unauthorized
 strike earlier in the year. An official investigation into
 corruption in the government housing program prompted by the
 teachers' strike resulted in the trial and conviction of a
 number of government officials. There are no political
 prisoners in Ivory Coast, and there has never been an execution
 of political opponents. There is no history of violent action
 against specific ethnic or religious minorities, although
 riots directed at foreign Africans have occurred in the past.
 Detainees, especially foreign Africans, are routinely treated
 roughly by the Surete Nationale and the Gendarmerie upon
 arrest.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have never been reports of politically-motivated killing
 by either the Government or by opposition groups in Ivory
 Coast.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abduction or disappearance of
 individuals by forces with official sanction.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Ivorian penal code prohibits the use of violence by
 official means without justification. The code does not,
 however, specifically mention or prohibit torture nor does it
 
 
 157
 IVORY COAST
 define what constitutes 'legitimate justification' or the
 level of violence officials may use. There were no reports of
 torture during 1984. Systematically cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment of individuals or prison inmates is not
 thought to occur routinely, but foreign Africans are treated
 more roughly by police than are Ivorian detainees. Since the
 beginning of a government-sponsored anti-crime campaign in
 1983, some detainees, primarily foreign Africans, were
 reportedly denied adequate food and drink, beaten by police
 and forced to do menial labor. Prisoners are allowed visits
 from attorneys of their choice and from family members, who
 must provide food to supplement the sparse prison diet.
 Prisons are crowded and conditions poor. Sanitation and
 medical facilities are limited. There is no evidence of
 discriminatory treatment of prisoners on the basis of sex,
 ethnicity, race, or type of crime, once they are committed to
 prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Ivorian Constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit
 arbitrary arrest or imprisonment. People are not detained,
 punished, or tried for expression of views critical of or
 different from those of the Government; but the Government has
 occasionally detained a few individuals it believes to be
 security threats. It also takes firm non-violent measures
 against acts it considers threats to internal security. The
 Government has used the threat of forced conscription to
 discourage student involvement in anti-government activities.
 It has arrested student demonstrators, most recently in 1982.
 Under the Ivorian penal code, a public prosecutor can detain a
 suspect for up to 48 hours without bringing charges. During
 the anti-crime campaign of 1983, several thousand individuals
 were detained under this provision for identity checks, and
 many were apparently held beyond the legal maximum. The
 identity checks continued during 1984 but on a smaller scale.
 The code dictates that further detention be ordered by a
 magistrate who can authorize periods up to four months but
 must provide the Minister of Justice a monthly written
 explanation of why detention should be continued.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Ivorian law establishes the right to a fair public trial.
 This provision is generally respected in urban centers. In
 rural areas justice is often administered at the village level
 through traditional institutions. The judiciary is
 independent of the executive and military. Defendants have
 the right to legal counsel, and the judicial system provides
 for court-appointed attorneys for indigent defendants. In
 practice, however, such attorneys are not readily available.
 The court of appeals hears appeals of verdicts of civilian
 courts. Civilians are not tried by military courts. There is
 no structure of appeals courts within the military justice
 system. Persons convicted by a military tribunal occasionally
 request the Supreme Court to set aside the tribunal's verdict
 and order a retrial. There are no known political prisoners
 in Ivory Coast.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 With few exceptions, all Ivorian citizens are considered to be
 
 
 158
 IVORY COAST
 members of the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast. Party
 regulations call for active participation in party activities
 and payment of dues; however, these regulations are not
 strictly enforced. Ivorians who choose not to participate do
 not suffer retaliation. It is not known what percentage of
 the population actively participates in the party. The code
 of penal procedures specifies that a police official or
 investigation magistrate may conduct searches of homes without
 a warrant if he has reason to believe there is evidence
 concerning a crime on the premises. The official must have
 the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized in the
 search. He is required to have witnesses to the search, which
 may not take place between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 4:00
 a.m. Legal safeguards against arbitrary searches are
 generally respected in the modern parts of cities. In
 less-developed urban sectors and in rural areas, legal
 safeguards are sometimes ignored. There were no reports of
 forced entry or other violations of the home during 1984.
 Monitoring of correspondence and telephone conversations is
 not widely practiced.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Despite Ivory Coast's established one-party state, there is a
 large measure of freedom of speech. Critics of the Government
 feel free to express themselves in informal situations, among
 Ivorians and foreigners alike, without fear of reprisal.
 Limits--such as cancellation of gatherings--are occasionally
 placed on the expression of controversial views in public
 forums. As a result of 1982 student disorders, only
 apolitical gatherings are now permitted on campus, but
 students still speak freely about politics in informal
 situations.
 The country's one daily newspaper is owned by private
 interests, but its editorial opinion follows the policies of
 the country's single political party. The one weekly news
 magazine is controlled by the party. The Ministry of
 Information operates a wire service, radio, and television.
 Government policy assigns the media a positive role in
 promoting national unity and development. It allows criticism
 of failures of policy execution but not of policies
 themselves. Investigative journalism of government policies
 and administration is not permitted, but other types of
 investigative reporting are allowed. In January 1984, the
 Government banned a publication entitled 'Islam and Ivory
 Coast.' It identified the author as an Ivorian student.
 Although not officially banned, a book published in 1983
 entitled 'Ivory Coast: For a Democratic Alternative" by a
 dissident Ivorian professor is not publicly available in the
 country. In September 1984, the leadership of the party
 issued an official statement denouncing an anti-government
 tract circulating in Abidjan. A certain segment of Ivorian
 society does not feel free to express openly its views.
 Foreign publications are readily available, but occasional
 issues which are particularly critical of the Ivorian
 Government, the party, or the President are seized.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is generally respected in Ivory Coast
 except when the Government perceives a significant and
 
 
 159
 IVORY COAST
 immediate danger to public order. In such cases, it prohibits
 meetings and arrests persons disregarding its orders. The
 majority of unions are organized and directed by a
 government-sponsored union confederation, the General Union of
 Ivory Coast Workers (UGTCI), the leader of which occupies a
 senior position in the party hierarchy. Membership is
 encouraged but not mandatory. The UGTCI is a relatively
 passive coordination mechanism rather than an active campaigner
 for workers' rights. The right to strike exists in theory,
 but in practice legal strikes are rarely authorized. The 1983
 secondary teachers' strike was broken by a presidential decree
 ordering teachers back to the classrooms and threatening them
 with prison sentences and fines for non-compliance. Generally
 the Government negotiates with strikers and resolves at least
 some of their economic grievances. There have been no reports
 that professional groups have experienced persecution or
 harassment. The Government, however, attempts to bring such
 groups under its wing or that of the party so as to exercise
 control over their activities. Unions, trade associations and
 professional bodies are permitted to maintain relations with
 recognized international professional bodies in their fields.
 The UGTCI is a member of the continent-wide Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity (OATUU).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no known impediments to religious expression in
 Ivory Coast. There is no dominant religion, and no particular
 faith is favored for advancement. The open practice of
 religion is permitted, and there are no restrictions on
 religious ceremonies or teaching.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Ivorian Government exercises minimal control over domestic
 travel. Ivorians can freely travel abroad and emigrate
 without discrimination. Internal road blocks for identity
 checks are common. Ivorians have the right of voluntary
 repatriation. There are no known cases of revocation of
 citizenship. Ivory Coast's refugee and asylum practices are
 liberal. The country has resettled or granted safehaven to
 Angolans, Eritreans, Guineans, Liberians, Indo-Chinese,
 Voltans, and Ghanaians. While in Ivory Coast, they receive
 one-year renewable resident visas for their first five years
 in the country, after which they may apply for permanent
 resident status. Ivory Coast does not take any significant
 responsibility for the economic and social welfare of refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political participation in Ivory Coast is limited to the
 Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, which is headed by President
 Houphouet-Boigny. Although the Constitution provides for
 multiple political parties, the country is in practice a
 one-party state. No opposition groups exist openly, and their
 formation is discouraged. Within the party, the President
 operates through a 9-member executive committee, a 30-member
 political bureau, and a 100-member steering committee.
 Political power is concentrated in the President's hands and
 most important decisions are made by the President himself.
 Within this strictly observed one-party system, the Ivorian
 Government has encouraged recently more open participation in
 
 
 160
 IVORY COAST
 the political process. In the 1980 legislative, municipal,
 and local party elections, any citizen could present himself
 as a candidate, and approximately 650 individuals ran for
 election to the National Assembly. The party played no role
 in choosing candidates or administering the elections.
 Intense competition took place in all three elections in which
 all citizens were eligible to vote. About 50 percent of top
 local party officials were voted out of office, and only 27
 incumbent deputies were re-elected to the 147-member National
 Assembly. As a result of this process, current National
 Assembly members work more vigorously in their constituents'
 interest than their predecessors did, and debate within that
 body is more vigorous and well publicized than was the case
 before 1980.
 Public criticism of basic government policies or of the party
 and the President rarely occurs, although abuses of the
 execution of policy--as in corruption cases--are publicized.
 The party-controlled press often reproaches individuals who
 criticize policy, although private criticism is common and
 tolerated.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been cooperative toward inquiries into its
 human rights situation. Ivory Coast has a chapter of Amnesty
 International. The last inquiry occurred in 1981 and
 concerned a published report by Amnesty International in Paris
 that the Government had drafted striking television employees
 into the army as a form of extrajudicial punishment. The
 Government at first maintained that these men were simply
 doing their duty as conscripts. Later, the men appeared in
 uniform on national television and were told they were being
 returned to civilian life. Amnesty International did not
 include an entry on the Ivory Coast in its 1984 Report.
 Freedom House terms Ivory Coast 'partly free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Ivory Coast's population has reached 9.6 million (1984) with
 an average annual growth rate of 4 percent (1960-82) and per
 capita gross national product (GNP) estimated at $953 (1982).
 The population includes at least two million foreign Africans,
 perhaps as many as 100,000 Lebanese and 37,000 French, and a
 small number of other Europeans, North Americans, and Asians.
 A great disparity exists between the standard of living of
 expatriates and the African elites on one hand, and the urban
 poor and villagers on the other. Nonetheless, there is a
 sizeable, growing urban Ivorian middle class, and living
 conditions in the villages have improved markedly and steadily
 during Ivory Coast's 24 years as an independent state. Most
 villages have wells, and at least three years of primary
 education are offered in all but the smallest villages. The
 country has constructed an excellent nationwide network of
 paved highways and nearly all Ivorians have access to
 motorized transportation.
 Life expectancy at birth is 48.15 years (1984). The country's
 infant mortality rate is 119 per 1,000 live births (1984), and
 its adult literacy rate is 35 percent (1980). Nineteen percent
 of the population (1976) has access to safe drinking water, and
 
 
 161
 IVORY COAST
 the ratio of calorie supply available for consumption relative
 to nutritional requirement was 108.01 in 1977. Ivory Coast
 has a substantial degree of food self-sufficiency. While
 perhaps 50 percent of the rice, 75 percent of red meat, and
 100 percent of the wheat is imported, ample supplies of
 traditional starches, vegetables, fish, and other proteins are
 available and affordable. Although malnutrition sometimes
 occurs, it is largely due to nutritional ignorance and/or
 distribution problems rather than an overall lack of food.
 Three years of recession and negative GNP growth, coupled with
 government austerity measures (e.g. civil service salary
 freezes and reduced perquisites), have substantially reduced
 both purchasing power and the Government's ability to provide
 services that Ivorians had come to expect. Education absorbs
 some 30-40 percent of the operating budget and is generally
 available to all children, Ivorian and foreign, boys and
 girls. The primary school enrollment, as a percentage of
 children of primary school age, was 74 percent in 1979.
 Health, by contrast, absorbs only seven percent of the
 operating budget and is less widely distributed than
 educational services.
 Better-paying government and private sector jobs seem to be
 concentrated among the minority Muslim (25 percent) and
 Christian (15 percent) populations, a phenomenon more related
 to urbanization and access to education than to a systematic
 pattern of discrimination. On the other hand, the government's
 policy of Ivorianization requires that all positions be offered
 to Ivorians before foreigners; this keeps foreign Africans from
 most wage and salary jobs in the modern sector. Individuals
 have property rights and these tend to be protected, at least
 in urban areas. In rural areas land tenure and possibly other
 property rights are often dictated by tribal custom.
 Although males clearly play the preponderant role overall,
 some Ivorian traditional societies accord women considerable
 political and economic power. In rural areas tribal customs
 dictate the division of tasks and these sometimes fall heavily
 on women. Female circumcision continues to be practiced among
 elements of the Ivorian population, although it is rare in
 urban populations. Official party policy is to encourage full
 participation by women in social, economic, and political life.
 The Government has a Ministry of Women's Affairs (without a
 minister for nearly a year) for this purpose. Women remain
 very lightly represented at the higher levels of government
 and the party.
