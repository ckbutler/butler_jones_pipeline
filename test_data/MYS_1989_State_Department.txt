 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia has a parliamentary system of -government based on
 free elections contested by several parties, almost all of
 which are racially based. Malaysia is a multiethnic society,
 with Malays comprising a little more than half of the
 population, and the remainder consisting of Chinese (about 33
 percent), Indians (about 10 percent), and several other
 minorities. The ruling National Front (composed of three
 major and several minor parties) has won a two-thirds or
 better majority in the federal Parliament in all general
 elections since 1957, but opposition parties are active and
 vocal participants in the political system, and they
 occasionally control governments at the state level. Malaysia
 is a federation of 13 states, with state governments retaining
 power over several important areas, including land use and
 religion.
 From the late 1940's until recently, the defense forces were
 directed primarily at containing a major Communist insurgency
 that began in 1948 and peaked in the 1950's. The Government
 states that because of the insurgency that still smolders in a
 few border areas, the intercommunal rioting in which several
 hundred persons died following the 1969 national elections,
 and the country's serious drug problem, classified by the
 Government as a threat to national security, internal security
 remains a concern. The Government cites all three factors as
 justification for laws allowing preventive detention, but
 human rights groups charge that they are primarily used to
 stifle dissent.
 A strong free market economy, abundant natural resources, and
 a relatively small population have helped Malaysia become one
 of the most prosperous of the developing countries.
 Detention without trial and restrictions on judicial review of
 detentions, as well as restrictions on freedom of association,
 and on freedom of the press, are the primary human rights
 concerns in Malaysia. In late 1987, the detention without
 trial of 106 persons under the Internal Security Act (ISA)
 became a major focus of attention. By June 1989, all those
 detainees had been released and restrictions on their
 movements and activities rescinded. Amendments to the ISA
 enacted by Parliament that same month, however, further
 restrict the judiciary's power to review detentions under the
 ISA, the Dangerous Drugs Act, and the Emergency Ordinance.
 Restrictions on the independence of the Malaysian judiciary
 remain a key area of concern. Many legal and other observers
 see evidence that when hearing cases with political
 ramifications, the courts are increasingly reluctant to take
 positions which could be seen by the executive branch as
 challenging executive authority.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings by the Government or by any other political
 organization.
 
 
 909
 MALAYSIA
 b. Disappearance
 There was no evidence of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention attributable to the Government or to
 nongovernmental or opposition forces. There have been reports
 that, in a number of cases, security authorities waited days
 after a detention before informing the detainee's family.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatmnent or Punishment
 Allegations of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are rare, although several Malaysian citizens who
 were detained by the GoVernment in October 1987 claim that
 they were mistreated by security authorities, especially
 during the initial stage of their detention. Their
 allegations included charges of sleep deprivation, threats and
 verbal abuse, and, in at least one case, beating. After their
 release frbm ISA detention, some former detainees stated that
 while"there xas no torture as such, treatment of detainees by
 the authorities varied, with some receiving harsher treatment
 than others.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government can detain suspects without benefit of judicial'
 review udder three laws: .the 1960 Internal Security Act
 (ISA), the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance of 1969, and
 the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1985.
 The 1960 ISA, patterned after legislation instituted by the
 British c61cQhial administration during the Communist
 insurgendy of the 1950's, is aimed at controlling internal
 subversion. It empowers the pdlice to hold for up to 60 days
 any person who may act "in a manner prejudicial to the
 security of. Malaysia." Further detention (in renewable 2-year
 segments) mustbe agthorized by the Minister of Home Affairs.
 The Minister must inform detainees of thecharges against them
 and give them the opportunity to protest those charges to an
 advisory board. The advisory board reviews each case at least
 every 6 monthz. Advisory board decisions and recommendations
 are not, however, binding on the Minister, are never
 publicized, and are often not shown to the detainee. A number
 of the ISA detainees have refused to participate in the review
 process under these circumstances.
 The Malaysian Government does not publish statistics or make
 regular public statements on ISA detentions. Authoritative
 information on the number of detainees is not available. In
 March 1989, however, the Deputy Home Affairs Minister told
 Parliament that 70 persons were under ISA detention at that
 time. Prior to the ISA detentions of October 1987, the number -
 of long-term ISA detainees had dropped from nearly 500 in 1981
 to about 25. In October and November 1987, however, Malaysian
 authorities, citing a danger of serious racial strife,
 detained dnother 106 persons, including government and
 opposition fiembers of'Pdrliament, social'critics, academics,
 environmentalists, and religious activists. However, none
 were charged in court for any unlawful-activity. By June
 1989, all of these detainees had been released and
 restrictions on their movements rescinded. In 1988 the
 Government detained 11 Malaysians from Sarawak under the ISA;
 all were released by July 1989. Twenty-three from two
 northern states also were arrested in 1988 under the ISA as
 arson suspects. A spokesman for the opposition Islamic Party
 
 
 910
 MALAYSIA
 of Malaysia announced that several of those arrested were
 members of that party. The spokesman said the party would
 investigate to determine whether the arrests were political,
 without specifying when the determination would be made.
 Human rights observers claim that the detentions were
 unwarranted because the defendants could have been arrested
 and tried under criminal statutes proscribing arson.
 In March 1988 the High Court ordered the release of a
 prominent lawyer and opposition leader detained under the ISA,
 on the grounds that his arrest was unlawful. Eight hours
 after his release he was rearrested under a new ISA detention
 order. In July 1988 and June 1989, Parliament amended the ISA
 to place additional limitations on judicial review of
 detentions. The 1988 amendments validate detention orders
 regardless of textual inaccuracies in place or fact, while the
 1989 legislation restricts judicial review of government
 detention orders to procedural matters only. The Government
 defended the amendments by stating that court decisions should
 not be permitted to replace executive decisionmaking in
 national security matters. Opposition leaders and the Bar
 Council publicly protested the 1989 ISA amendments as a
 negation of the rule of law.
 The Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance of 1969 stemmed
 from that year's intercommunal riots. The State of Emergency
 declared at that time has not been rescinded, although
 Parliament regained its legislative power in 1971. The
 Emergency Ordinance gives the Government the power to detain
 anyone "in the interests of the public safety or the defense
 of Malaysia." .As under the ISA, detainees must be informed of
 the charges against them, and they can appeal to an advisory
 board. Since 1985 the Emergency Ordinance bas been used in
 some serious criminal cases not related to narcotics.
 The Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) Act of 1985
 was enacted by Parliament to give the Government specific
 power to detain suspected drug traffickers. Suspects can be
 held under this law for successive 2-year periods with
 periodic review by an advisory board. Unlike the ISA and
 Emergency Ordinance, in the case of the Dangerous Drugs Act
 the opinion of the advisory board is binding on the Minister.
 As of June 1989, there were about 1,200 drug suspects in
 detention under this statute. As with the other two security
 statutes, the Dangerous Drugs Act was amended in 1988 to
 validate detention orders with certain defects and, in 1989,
 to prohibit legal challenges to detention orders. Legal
 observers have voiced the same strong concerns about these
 amendments.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial is seriously restricted in
 security-related matters where the ISA is invoked. Ordinary
 civil and criminal cases, and some security-related cases, are
 tried under a fair and open judicial system derived from
 British jurisprudence. Charges must be levied against a
 defendant within 24 hours of arrest, and police must decide
 within 14 days whether to bring the case to court. Defendants
 have the right to counsel, and lawyers are able to represent
 clients without penalty to themselves. Bail is available, and
 strict rules of evidence apply in court. Defendants may
 appeal lower court decisions to the federal courts and, in
 
 
 911
 MALAYSIA
 criminal cases, may also appeal for clemency to the King or
 local state rulers, as appropriate.
 Persons arrested.and'charged for firearms violations are
 normally charged under'provisions of the Internal Security Act
 which carry a mandatory death sentence upon conviction. Other
 security-related crimes, whether or not capital crimes, can be
 tried under special procedures contained- in the Essential
 (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975. The accused is allowed
 counsel but sometimes does not receive a statement of the
 evidence prior to the trial which is by a single judge without
 a jury; and witnesses may be examined in the absence of the
 accused. Admissible evidence includes hearsay and secondary
 evidence, testiimony of children and spouses,
 self-icriminaEing statements to police, and information from
 seized records or communications. If the accused is found
 guilty, the judge must impose the maximum penalty. According
 to local legal sources, these special trial provisions are
 rarely, if ever, used.
 The Malaysian judiciary has traditionally been regarded by the
 public and the legal community as committed to the rule of
 law. .The judicial system has exhibited over the years an
 unusual degree of independence, not hesitating to rule against
 the Govermept in criminal 6ivil, or occasionally even major
 cases with political ramifications. An example of the latter
 was the HighCourt ruling in yebruary 1988 that the dominant
 party in the Government coalftiori was illegally constituted.
 However, ini1988 Pgrliament amended'the Malaysian Constitution
 to delete the clause vesting judicial power in the courts and
 substitute a claiise stating that the jurisdiction and power of
 the courts are "conferred by or under Federal law." Although
 the practical ramifications of this amendment remain unclear,
 some members of the legal community charge that it strips the
 judiciary of its constitutional basis of authority, making it
 wholly dependent upon specific legislation passed by
 Parliameft.
 In another development in 1988 affecting the judiciary, the
 Lord President of the Supreme Court was dismissed by the King
 on August 8 following the recommendation of a tribunal which
 heard the Government's charges against him. The charges
 included bias and prejudice in speeches critical of the
 Government and writing a letter to Malaysia's King raising
 objections to the Prime Minister's criticism of -the judiciary,
 thereby creating misunderstanding between the Prime Minister
 and the hereditary rulers. Five Supreme Court Justices were
 suspended for their actions related to the case. A second
 tribunal appointed by the King ordered the immediate
 reinstatement of three of the Justices in October 1988, while
 the other two were dismissed from office.- Most nongovernment
 observers believe the purpose of the dismissals was
 specifically to strengthen the Prime Minister's control of the
 judiciary.
 The case against-the previous Lord President continued to have
 ramificat ons in 1989. In March 1989, the Malaysian Bar
 Council filed a contempt of court motion against the current
 Lord President for his actions related to the dismissal of the
 previous Lord President. In April the Supreme Court rejected
 the Bar Council's contempt motion, and then in June agreed to
 consider a counter motion filed against the Bar Council
 Secretary by the 4ttorney General. The Government's contempt
 motion has not yet been heard. The Supreme Court's handling
 
 
 912
 MALAYSIA
 of the Bar Council's motion is cited by legal observers as
 evidence that the 1988 confrontation between the judiciary and
 the executive branches is causing reluctance by the courts to
 take positions in politically sensitive cases challenging the
 Government.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are, generally, protected by law. Under the
 security legislation described above, however, the police may
 enter and search without-warrant the homes of persons
 suspected of threatening national security and confiscate
 evidence. Under this provision, police have searched homes
 and offices, seized books and papers, and taken people into
 custody without a warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Despite constitutional provisions for freedom of speech and
 press, there are some important limitations. For example, the
 Constitution provides that freedom of speech can be restricted
 by legislation "in the interest of security... (or) public
 order." Thus the Sedition Act Amendments of 1970 prohibit
 public comment on "sensitive" issues such as citizenship
 rights for non-Malays and the special position of Malays in
 society. Since 1970, however, the Government has brought only
 a few cases under the Sedition Act, and in the most recent
 incident in 1986 the defendant, the President of the Bar
 Council, was acquitted.
 Press freedom is subject to important limitations under the
 Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984, under which
 domestic and foreign publications must apply annually to the
 Government for a permit. In December 1987, Parliament amended
 this Act to make the publication of "malicious news" a
 punishable offense, to expand the Government's power to ban
 publications, and to prohibit court challenges to suspension
 or revocation of publication permits. An additional
 inhibiting factor is that the Government or the business arms
 of the leading political parties in the ruling coalition own
 almost all the major newspapers as well as all the radio and
 television stations.
 At the time of the ISA detentions in October 1987, the
 Government revoked the publication permits of three
 newspapers. Although all three newspapers resumed publication
 in March 1988, the revocations and the legislative amendments
 described above have resulted in significant self-censorship
 by journalists and editors of the daily newspapers.
 Nevertheless, opposition parties, social action groups, and a
 number of private publications regularly provide detailed
 coverage of opposition political activities and print
 viewpoints strongly critical of the ruling coalition and its
 policies. A wide range of information is available to the
 Malaysian public in newspapers and magazines published in all
 of the country's four major languages, and major international
 and regional news publications circulate freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the tights of freedom of
 peaceful assembly and association, but there are significant
 
 
 913
 MALAYSIA
 restrictions. Those rights can be limited in the interest of
 security and public order, and the 1967 Police Act requires
 police permits for all public assemblies. In the aftermath of
 the intercommunal riots in 1969, the Government banned
 political rallies altogether. While the ban on political
 rallies has not been formally rescinded, both Government and
 opposition parties have been able to hold what they refer to
 as "discussion sessions" for electioneering during political
 campaigns. In the eight national and state special elections
 since August 1988, government and opposition candidates
 campaigned openly and with minimal police interference despite
 the existence of the Police Act and other restrictions; there
 were no public complaints concerning the enforcement of the
 Police Act. Some opposition politicians complained privately,
 howeirer, that police issuanze of permits for campaign events
 has not been as timely as they would have liked.
 Other statutes limit the right of association, such as the
 Societies Act of 1966, under which the Government can refuse
 registration to organizations which comment unfavorably on
 political or public issues. The threat of deregistration
 under the Societies Act tends to inhibit political activism by
 public or special interest organizations, but it does not
 suppress such activity entirely. Another law affecting
 freedom of association is the Universities and University
 Colleges Act, which mandates government approval for student
 associations and .prohibits such associations from engaging in
 political activity. In November 1988, police arrested 11
 persons in Lake Garden Park who were participating in a
 peaceful candlelight protest against the detentions that took
 place in late 1987. Charged with illegal assembly under the
 Police Act, the charges were later dropped.
 For a discussion. of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The official religion of Malaysia is Islam, and ethnic Malays
 are legally bound in some civil matters, e.g., family
 relations and diet, by Islamic religious laws administered by
 state authorities. An Islamic religious establishment is
 supported with government funds, and it is official policy to
 "infuse Islamic values" into the administration of Malaysia.
 However, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion,
 and the Government has refused to accede to pressures for the
 imposition of Islamic religious law beyond the Muslim
 community. Religious minorities, which include large Hindu,
 Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian communities, practice their
 faith with minimal interference by the Government.
 There are persistent allegations, however, that some state
 governments are slow in approving building permits for
 non-Muslim places of worship. The Government has limited the'
 circulation of a popular translation of the Bible in Bahasa
 Malaysia, and some states restrict the use of Christian terms
 in Bahasa Malaysia. Conversion to religions other than Islam
 is permitted but not encouraged; proselytizing of Muslims is,
 and has long been, proscribed by law'in some states and
 strongly discouraged in other parts of the country.
 Government attitudes on religious questions were evident in
 the October 1987 ISA detentions when several Muslim and
 Christian teachers and activists were detained.
 
 
 914
 MALAYSIA
 In a development affecting the right of parents to teach
 religion to their children, the state of Selangor passed a
 bill in August 1989 which allows minors to convert to Islam
 without parental approval. Although this legislation has yet
 to be implemented and could be overturned at a later date, its
 passage in the Selangor State Assembly has caused some
 consternation among Malaysia's non-Muslim minorities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not generally restrict the right of
 individuals to travel within the country and live and work
 where they please, but it did place significant restrictions
 on the movement and activities of some ISA detainees after
 their release from detention. The restrictions on all former
 October 1987 ISA detainees were rescinded by June 1989. There
 are also no government restrictions on emigration. Since
 there are no known Malaysian refugees in other countries,
 there is no problem of repatriation. There have been some
 cases of Malaysian citizens being denied passports on security
 grounds, but Malaysians are generally free to travel abroad.
 There are restrictions on travel by Malaysians to Israel,
 South Africa, Cuba, China, Vietnam, and North Korea.
 Malaysia has provided first asylum to more than 250,000
 Vietnamese refugees since 1975. It has cooperated closely
 with international organizations and resettlement countries in
 facilitating the eventual movement of the refugees to third
 countries.
 In June 1989, Malaysia chaired the second International
 Conference on Indochinese Refugees (ICIR). At the Conference,
 the resettlement countries and the countries of first asylum
 agreed to institute a comprehensive plan of action for
 granting asylum and resettlement to Indochinese asylum
 seekers. Boat people arriving in Malaysia after March 14,
 1989 would be screened; only those determined to be genuine
 refugees would be eligible for first asylum and resettlement.
 Malaysia began to screen boat people on August 28. No
 determinations regarding refugee status had been made as of
 mid-November.
 The yearly arrival rate for Vietnamese boat people to Malaysia
 remained high in comparison to the mid-80's: about 17,000
 arrived during the year ending September 30, 1989.
 Resettlement did not keep pace with arrivals, and the camp
 population grew to 21,000, resulting in severe overcrowding at
 the principal camp of Pulau Bidong and concerns among relief
 workers for the asylum seekers' health. Domestic opposition
 to the Vietnamese presence prevented the expansion of camp
 facilities. The Government did not follow through on its 1988
 announcement that it would close Pulau Bidong within the year.
 Despite the commitments which it made at the ICIR, the
 Government began intermittently to deny first asylum to boat
 people beginning in late May, claiming it could not accept new
 boat arrivals indefinitely without some assurance all would
 eventually be removed from Malaysia. According to the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a total of
 2,470 persons had been pushed off through the end of October
 1989. In most cases the Malaysians repaired and reprovisioned
 the boats before returning them to sea. All such boats
 reaching Indonesia have been permitted to land. Nevertheless,
 one death reportedly occurred when a boat being towed to sea
 
 
 915
 MALAXSIA
 overturned, and four persons (including a pregnant woman) died
 of dehydration as a consequence of being pushed off.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Malaysia's parliamentary system is based on the British model.
 The Prime Minister and Cabinet are responsible to Parliament,
 from which they are drawn. National parliamentary elections,
 which the Constitution requires at least every 5 years, have
 been held regularly since independence in 1957 and have
 included opposition candidates actively contesting
 parliamentary seats. In addition, there are regular state and-
 local multiparty elections. Most observers consider Malaysian
 elec ions to be generally free and fair, with votes cast
 secretly and recorded accurately. Opposition candidates won
 several hotly contested byelections in August 1988 and June
 1989. Nevertheless, in several byelections in the last year,
 there were-allegations that government supporters attempted to
 intimidate voters.
 Through the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), Malays
 dominate the ruling National Front coalition of ethnic-based
 parties which has controlled Parliament since independence.
 Non-Malays fill a number of cabinet posts. In August 1986,
 the National Front won 148 of the 177 seats in the House of
 Representatives. Although the opposition regularly criticizes
 government policies within and outside Parliament, "government
 views generally prevail. Since 1957 there has been a peaceful
 transfer of power in the office of Prime Minister three times.
 Opposition parties, such as the Islamic Party of Malaysia
 (PAS), have occasionally gained control of state governments.
 Non-Malay parties have also controlled state governments; for
 example, the ruling party in the important state of Penang is
 largely Chinese-based, and in Sabah a predominantly Christian
 party is currently in power.
 A new Malay political party called Semangat 46 (Spirit of 46)
 was registered in July 1989. This party is dominated by
 former UMNO leaders who challenged prime Minister Mahathir for
 the UMNO leadership in 1987 and lost. There has also been
 some movement toward an opposition coalition led by Semangat
 46 to challenge the ruling coalition in the next general
 election which must be held before October 1991. The new
 party and the informal coalition have actively campaigned in a
 series of .national and state byelections since August 1988,
 winning twice and losing the other six times.
 Eleven Members of Parliament, 10 from opposition parties and 1
 from the government coalition, were included among the persons
 detained in October and November 1987. After their release,
 all'regained their parliamentary seats and party leadership
 positions. Opposition leader and former detainee Lim Kit
 Siang-continues to criticize government policy and has also
 directly'challenged the Government in parliamentary sessions
 since his release.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government rejects criticism of its human rights record by
 international human rights organizations and foreign
 governments. Prime Minister Mahathir, in a speech at the
 
 
 916
 MALAYSIA
 Non-Aligned Movement summit in September 1989, stated that
 developing countries cannot practice the Western liberal
 "brand of democracy and human rights" to the detriment of
 meeting basic human needs, such as food, shelter, and
 schools. Malaysian officials criticize local groups for
 "collaborating" with international human rights organizations
 in their studies of the human rights situation. Nevertheless,
 representatives of international human rights organizations
 have visited and traveled in Malaysia and have been able to
 meet with some relevant government officials. In 1989
 representatives of the Committee on Human Rights of the New
 York City bar met with the Attorney General and other
 government officials. In 1988 the Government permitted
 delegations from the International Committee of the Red Cross
 and the Human Rights Commission of the International
 Parliamentary Union to meet with ISA detainees as well as with
 government officials. Foreign government officials have met
 in Malaysia with their Malaysian counterparts to discuss human
 rights.
 In August 1989, a group of prominent Malaysians, including two
 former prime ministers, applied to the Registrar of Societies
 to establish a national human rights society. The Registrar
 had not by year's end ruled on the application, although in
 December 1988 the Deputy Prime Minister announced that the
 Government would not object. In addition, a number of
 organizations, including the Bar Council and various public
 interest groups, devote some time to human rights activities.
 The Government tolerates their activities but rarely responds
 to their inquiries or occasional press statements. The
 Government has not acceded to any of the international
 covenants on human rights, generally maintaining that such
 issues are internal matters.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Government implements on an extensive scale programs
 designed to boost the economic position of the ethnic Malay
 majority which remains poorer, on average, than other
 Malaysians despite its political dominance. These Government
 programs and policies limit, in varying degrees, opportunities
 for non-Malays in higher education, government employment,
 business permits and licenses, and ownership of new homesteads.
 The question of the rights of indigenous peoples in Malaysia
 received increasing attention in 1989. The focus of this
 attention has been the impact of logging on the indigenous
 peoples in the East Malaysian state of Sarawak. Between
 November 1988 and January 1989, 128 members of the
 semi-nomadic Penan group in Sarawak were arrested and charged
 with illegally blockading logging roads and bridges. Another
 117 Penans were arrested under the State Forestry Ordinance in
 September for similarly blockading logging roads. While the
 Penan demonstrators have not yet been brought to trial, the
 prosecution dropped similar charges against another indigenous
 group--42 Kayans--in April.
 There are no laws or regulations restricting the political and
 economic rights of women. The position of women in society is
 conditioned by the cultural and religious traditions of the
 country's major ethnic groups. With a general resurgence of
 Islamic piety among Malays, many Malay women have in recent
 years tended toward close conformity with Koranic stipulations
 on women's roles. Women's groups are active both within the
 
 
 912
 MALAYSIA
 governmental and private sectors. Two important umbrella
 organizations for women's rights are the National Advisory
 Council for the Integration of Women in Development in the
 Prime Minister's Department and the National Council of
 Women's Organizations.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, has resulted
 in a number of steps to deal with the problem. According to
 government statistics, reported domestic violence cases
 increased from 279 in 1982 to 900 in 1988. There are
 currently no specific laws on domestic violence. Cases of
 wife beating or child abuse are tried under normal assault
 provisions of the Criminal Code, which carry penalties of 3
 months to I year in prison and/or fines up to $750. A women's
 aid oiganization runs shelteri for battered wives, and several
 women's groups led a succesful effort in April to toughen the
 laws against rape, mandating jail sentences of at least 5
 years (maximum of 20 years) and allowing the imposition of
 fines and/or whipping. Women's rights organizations also
 began promoting new legislation to curb domestic violence
 against women and children; an interagency group coordinated
 by the Welfare ministry was formed to draft the legislation.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Trade Unions Act of 1959 and the Industrial Relations Act
 of'1967 govern the right of workers to engage in trade union
 activity. Unions may organize workplaces, bargain
 collectively with an employer, form federations, and join
 international organizations. The Industrial Relations Act
 specifically prohibits any person from interfering with,
 restraining, or coercing a worker in the exercise of the right
 to form or participate in the lawful activities of a trade
 union.
 The Trade Unions Act, which is administered by the Director
 General of Trade Unions (formerly the Registrar of Trade
 Unions), sets rules for the organization of unions, their
 recognition at the workplace, the content of their
 constitutionsr election of their officers, and their financial
 reporting requirements. The Act's definition of a trade union
 restricts it to representing workers in a "particular trade,
 occupation, or industry or within any similar trades,
 occupations, or industries," contrary to guidelines of the
 Committee on Freedom of Association of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO).
 The Director General of Trade Unions may refuse to register a
 trade union on a variety of grounds. He also has the power,
 under certain circumstances, to withdraw the registration of a
 trade union. A trade union for which registration has been
 refused, withdrawn or canceled is considered an unlawful
 associatign.
 Malaysia's electronic components industry, dominated by
 American and Japanese firms, has been the focus of
 unsuccessful union organizing efforts since the late 1970's.
 The Government has used its various powers to prevent the
 formation of a union in the industry other than strictly "in
 house" unions. In August 1989, the Director General of Trade
 Unions refused to register the National Electronics Workers
 Union on the grounds that it did not meet the definition of a
 "trade union" in the Trade Unions Act because its members work
 
 
 918
 MALAYSIA
 in the electrical and electronics industries, which the Labor
 Minister has determined are different industries. Union
 leaders have stated that they seek to represent only workers
 in the elctronics industry. The Government has been
 repeatedly criticized by the ILO for continued failure to
 comply with ILO Convention 98 (right to organize and to
 bargain collectively).
 Some critics of the Government's policy toward labor unions,
 notably the American Federation of Labor and Congress of
 Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and Asia Watch, believe the
 arrest of V. David under the ISA in the government crackdown
 late in 1987 (see Section l.d. above) demonstrated labor
 leaders' vulnerability to government pressures, which, critics
 assert, inhibit their carrying out legitimate trade union
 activities. Mr. David has declared publicly that questioning
 during his detention related only peripherally to his role in
 the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC) and the Transport
 Workers' Union (TWU). He continues as MTUC Secretary General,
 campaigned successfully for reelection to that position in
 December 1988, and has been allowed to travel abroad to trade
 union meetings.
 Federations of trade unions may cover only a single trade or
 industry or similar trades or industries. The only labor
 federations currently registered are one for public servants,
 one for teachers, and one for state-based textile and garment
 workers' unions. The MTUC, the main labor body, is registered
 as a society under the Societies Act (rather than the Trade
 Unions Act). Previous MTUC efforts to register as a trade
 union federation under the Trade Unions Act were turned down
 because of its broad membership. In November 1988, however,
 Parliament approved legislation granting the MTUC the status
 and rights enjoyed by Malaysian trade unions, although it
 remains a society.
 As of December 1988, there were 392 individual unions in
 Malaysia with over 616,626 members (10.4 percent of total
 employment).
 Unions are independent both of the Government and of the
 political parties. While unions are not permitted to engage
 in political activity, individual trade union leaders have
 served in Parliament (V. David, the MTUC Secretary General, is
 currently a Member of Parliament for -an opposition party) and
 individual-union members belong to political -parties.
 Malaysian trade unions are free to associate with the
 appropriate international trade secretariats, and a number of
 Malaysian labor leaders play major roles in international
 labor affairs. The MTUC is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of-Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The Secretary
 General of the National Union of Plantation Workers is
 President of the ICFTU, and the qMTUC Secretary General has
 actively participated in the ILO governing body.
 While strikes are legal and do occasionally occur, critics
 claim that this right in practice is severely restricted. The
 Industrial Relations Act of 1967 requires the parties to
 notify the Ministry of Labor that a dispute exists before any
 industrial action may be taken. If government conciliation
 fails to achieve a settlement, the Minister has the power to
 refer the dispute to the Industrial Court, which effectively
 becomes compulsory arbitration. A strike is prohibited while
 the dispute is before the Industrial Court, and an award made
 by the Industrial Court cannot be appealed. Industrial Court

 MALAYSIA-
 awards are. the exceptior rather than the rule, however,
 representing only about 18.5 percent of all collective
 agreements referred to the Industrial Court in 1988. The
 remaining agreements were reached through bargaining-between
 management and labor.
 b. 'The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collectiy.e bargaining is the noxm in Malaysian industries
 where workers are organized. Malaysia's system of
 conciliation and arbitration seeks-to promote negotiation and
 settlement of fssues without strikes.
 In a complaint to the ILO, the MTUC alleged that the 1980
 amendments contain prohibitive and oppressive antiunion
 provisions which erode the basic rights of workers, restrict
 union activities, and result in government and employer
 interference in the internal administration of unions. In
 1983 the ILO urged the Malaysian Government to amend these
 laws further to bring them into conformity with the ILO
 Convention on the right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. Djespite~subsequent amendmentsc the MTUC still
 .believes, the labor law to be.deficient by ILO Atandards. Many
 union leaders also believe that creation of the Industrial
 Court to handle industrial disputes further weakened their
 collective bargaining rights.
 Labor standards in free trade zones are the same as those in
 the nest of MaLaysia. Workers at many companies-located in
 the fee.t:de zones are. unionized, .especially in the textile
 -and-electvrical products plants.  Enterprises granted "pioneer"
 .status-4whether or-not located in a free .trade zone) are
 -protected from -nion,.demands. for terms of employment exceeding
 those specified, in the Employment Act of 1955 during the
 * period of their-pioneer status (normally 5 years). The
 restr iction does not apply towages or benefits not covered by
 the Employment Act (see Section 6.e. below).
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Malaysia is a party to ILO Convention 105 prohibiting forced
 orcompulsory labor and it.has effective legal sanctions
 against such abuses. The aLO has criticized Malaysia for
 xequiring prisoners and LSA-detainees.to work. Malaysia
 defends the .practice as part of.its prisoner rehabilitation
 program.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of.children is covered by the Children and Young
 Persons (Employment) Act of 1966, which stipulates that no
 child under the age of 14 may be engaged in.any employment
 . except light work in a family enterprise, in. public
 entertainment,-work;performed for the Government in a school
 or.training instituti-on, or employment as an approved
 apprentite. It is illegal for children to work more than 6
 hours per day, more than 6 days -per week,- or at night. The
 law is effectively enforced through periodic inspections by
 the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Malaysian wages are relatively high for its level of
 industrialization and higher-than in all neighboring countries
 except Singapore. The Employment Act of 1955 sets working
 
 
 920
 MALAYSIA
 hours not to exceed 8 hours per day or 44 hours per week
 (5 1/2 days), sets overtime rates for hours in excess of
 those, and mandates public holidays, annual leave, sick leave,
 and maternity allowances for workers. Most such provisions
 are at least on a par with standards in industrialized
 countries. Minimum standards of occupational health and
 safety are set by law and enforced by a unit of the Ministry
 of Labor. Severance benefits are provided under the
 Employment (Termination and Lay-off Benefits) Regulations of
 1980. The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) Ordinance of 1951
 requires employers and employees to contribute to a fully
 funded retirement program. Some 90 percent of workers are
 covered by either the EPF or the Government's own pension plan
 for public servants. The Workmen's Compensation Act of 1952,
 and the Social Security Act provide disability and workman's
 compensation benefits.
 There is no national minimum wage legislation, but certain
 classes of workers are covered by minimum wage laws: retail
 clerks, hotel and restaurant employees, cinema workers, and a
 few others, totaling approximately 140,000 workers. By local
 standards, and taking into account various worker benefits
 received by most workers, Malaysian wages provide a decent
 standard of living for workers and their families. The
 effective minimum wage for unskilled labor in the urban areas
 is about $90 per month. Plantation work is increasingly being
 done by contract workers, including numerous illegal
 immigrants from Indonesia, in part due to a shortage of
 Malaysians interested in such work. Working conditions for
 contract workers often are significantly below those of direct
 hire plantation workers, many of whom belong to the National
 Union of Plantation Workers. Additionally, many of the
 immigrant workers, particularly the illegal ones, may not have
 access to Malaysia's system of labor adjudication. In 1989
 the Malaysian Government, at least in part to prevent the
 exploitation of these workers, moved to legalize large numbers
 of illegal immigrant workers, granting 290,000 work passes to
 Indonesian plantation workers in August.
