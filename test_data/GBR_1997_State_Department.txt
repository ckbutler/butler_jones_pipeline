 UNITED KINGDOM
 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is a longstand-
 ing constitutional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary government. A lower
 legislative chamber (the House of Commons), the center of parliamentary power, is
 elected in periodic multipart  elections. An upper chamber (the House of Lords),
 with power to revise and delay implementation of laws, is made up of hereditary
 and life peers -and senior clergy of the established Church of England. There is an
 independent judiciary, but Parliament may overrule its decisions.
 Throughout the United Kingdom, police forces are responsive to, and under the
 effective control of, civilian officials. Since 1996 the intelligence agency MI-5 has
 had the authority to act in support of other law enforcement agencies in the preven-
 tion and detection of serious domestic crime. In some areas of Northern Ireland, be-
 cause of the continuing threat of terrorist and other violence, army units operated
 to reinforce the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Although the security forces gen-
 erally respect human rights and the rule of law, some members of the police com-
 mitted human rights abuses.
 The United Kingdom has a highly developed, diversified, market-based economy
 that provides most residents with a high standard of living. Certain geographic
 areas, particularly older industrial areas including Northern Ireland, suffer from
 higher than average unemployment rates. In addition, unemployment tends to be
 higher among some demographic groups, such as youth and racial minorities. The
 Government provides comprehensive social welfare services, including a national
 
 
 1375
 health system, housing and family benefits, and heavily subsidized higher edu-
 cation.
 The Government respected the human rights of its citizens but there were prob-
 lems in some areas. Police occasionally abused detainees. In September the Council
 of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture began an investigation into
 mounting complaints over the Government's failure to prosecute or discipline offi-
 cers implicated in death-in-custody and prisoner mistreatment cases.
 After a series of mediation efforts by the Northern Ireland Secretary and others
 failed to effect a compromise, the decision of the RUC chief constable to permit the
 Protestant Orange Order to parade through a predominantly Catholic nationalist
 area of Drumcree on July 6 led to serious and widespread public disturbances
 throughout Northern Ireland. The chief constable justified his decision as necessary
 on public order and safety grounds, but Irish nationalists argued that the RUC,
 which they accuse of consistently favoring loyalists over nationalists, bowed to mob
 rule. Potentially more serious violence was averted the following week when, in a
 conciliatory move, the Orange Order voluntarily canceled or rerouted four of the
 most contentious parades. Unlike the previous year, the violence triggered by the
 standoff at Drumcree did not lead to loss of life.
 The July 20 restoration of a cease-fire by the Irish republican Army (IRA) ended
 a 17-month terrorism campaign and led to the openingof inclusive political talks
 in September. Following the cease-fire there was a marked decrease-although not
 a total cessation-of sectarian violence. The IRA denied responsibility for the Sep-
 tember 16 detonation of a 400-pound bomb in County Armagh's Markethill area that
 resulted in extensive property damage, although no loss of life. It is widely believed
 that a splinter republican group was responsible for the blast. The loya ist cease-
 fire has generally held since 1994, although there were several killings and other
 terrorist acts carried out by loyalist paramilitary groups. In light of the continuing
 cease-fires, about 300 army troops were withdrawn from Northern Ireland to their
 bases in England, and army patrols in Belfast were substantially reduced as troops
 remained in barracks. Renewed sectarian violence late in the year led the Northern
 Ireland authorities to request that patrolling resume in more vulnerable neighbor-
 hoods.
 In an October 1 speech, the Northern Ireland Secretary announced the Govern-
 ment's intention to begin significant reform of the RUC, eliminate indefinite intern-
 ment without trial (which, although unused for several years, is nevertheless deeply
 disliked by nationalists), narrow the scope of cases sent to "Diplock" (juryless)
 courts, and replace the Emergency Provisions Act and Prevention of Terrorism Act
 with one all-embracing act aimed at building confidence in public institutions. Legis-
 lation to do so was introduced later in the year and continued to work its way
 through Parliament.
 The Government continued to take steps to combat violence against women. Soci-
 etal discrimination against nonwhite minorities and the traveler community is a
 problem, as is child abuse. In August the Government extended race-discrimination
 protection to Northern Ireland through the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order
 1997.
 Police believe that paramilitary groupa in Northern Ireland were responsible for
 22 deaths, 251 shootings, and 78 bom in   during the year. Both republican and
 loyalist paramilitary groups continued to engage in vigilante "punishment" attacks,
 although there was a decrease in the number of such incidents even before the July
 cease-fire. There were at least six instances of arson committed in the spring and
 one in December against Catholic churches and at least one against a Protestant
 church. An April attack against a Mormon church was considered an act of vandal-
 ism unrelated to Protestant-Catholic animosity.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by the Government, but the deaths of persons in custody both in 1997 and
 in previous years raised questions about whether police and prison officers used im-
 proper restraining techniques or excessive force against criminal suspects. InSep-
 tember the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture launched
 an investigation into complaints of death in custody and police abuse of prisoners,
 including the disproportionally high numbers of incidents involving minority pris-
 oners.
 In June a jury found that "lack of care" contributed to the death of Peter Austin,
 a 30-year-old black prisoner who committed suicide while in custody in a London
 prison. Despite the fact that Austin attempted to cut his wrists with a plastic uten-
 
 
 1376
 sil at the Chiswick police station, smeared his cell with excrement, and claimed to
 hear voices, he-was not put-under special observation. In the -spring, a hung jury
 failed to reach a -verdict in the case of the police officer charged with the 1996 mur-
 der of David Ewen. Ewen had been shot when, cornered by police vehicles, he failed
 to -get out of the car or respond to a verbal warning. A retrial is expected. There
 have beenino further developments in the case of IRA suspect Dairmud ONeill, who
 was killed in   1996 when police raided his London       apartment during a
 counterterrorism operation. Human rights groups charge that O'Neill, who was sub-
 sequently found to be unarmed, was denied needed immediate medical treatment
 .-by police. In July the high-court questioned the Crown Prosecution Service's (CPS)
 1995 decision not to prosecute officers connected with the deaths of Nigerian Shiji
 Lapite and, Irishman Richard O'Brien, both of whom died in 1994 while in police
 custody. In February the police service had adopted the recommendation of the Po-
 lice Complaints Authority that two- officers should be charged- with neglect of duty
 in the O'Brien- case, but said that a- criminal, prosecution was not justified in
 Lapites's case.
 - In'July the High Court also found the 1995 CPS decision not to prosecute officers
 involved in the- 1982 abuse of British citizen Derek -Treadaway to be "flawed and
 perverse." The officers had used plastic bags to-suffocate Treadaway to-zunconscious-
 ness. In 1994 Treadaway received 50,000 British pounds in civil damages from the
 West Midlands Police. In August the CPS agreed to, again, review the Treadaway,
 Lapite, and O'Brien cases.
 In September a London court began a hearing into the 1996- death in custody of
 Ghanaian Ibrahima Sy, after -a July announcement by the CPS that there was in-
 sufficient evidence to prosecute police officers. Sey died after being sprayed by CS
 gas at the Illford police station. In March the family of Brian Douglas, an Afro-Car-
 ibbean man won the right to challenge an inquest jury's decision that his 1995
 .death was due to "msadventure." Douglas suffered a fractured skull after a con-
 frontation with two batonequipped police officers.
 No inquest has been held into the 1996 death of Jim'McDonnell in Northern Ire-
 land's Maghberry prison. Fellow' prisoners charge that McDonnell was beaten by
 prison Atffr.ctber police office Patrick Hodgson, charged with murder for fa-
 tally wounding an unarmed suspected car thief in 1995, was found not guilty of
 murder or manslaughter by a'unanimous verdict by a London court.
 During the year, there -were 79- confirmed prisoner suicides (or self-inflicted
 deaths, which is the term preferred by the nongovernmental organization [NGO],
 The Prison Reform Trust) not attributable to official mistreatment, versus 82 such
 suicides in 1996.
 During 1996 disturbances in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, .an armored person-
 nel career ran over Dermot McShane; who had taken refuge -behind a board fence
 during street fghting. The army claimed that the death was accidental. By year's
 ' end, there had been a deision by the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether
 criminal proceedings against the driverwould be instituted, nor has there been an
 inquest into McShane's death. The case is being considered by the United Nations
 Special Rapporteur on Summary and Arbitrary Executions and the European Com-
 mission of Human Rights.
 New evidence fromiballistics experts, eyewitnesses, and radio transmission record-
 ings appears to cast doubt on the -findings of the initial inquiry into the 1972
 "Bloody Sunday" events (where 14 unarmed civil rights demonstrators in Derry
 were killed by British soldiers, but for which no member of the security forces has
 been held accountable). By year's end, the Government had made no decision as to
 whether to reopen the inquiry but continued to study a detailed dossier about the
 tragedy presented to it by the Irish Government.
 Killings by both republican and loyalist groups continued in 1997. On February
 12, Stephen Restorick, a soldier serving in South Armagh was killed by an IRA
 sniper. On May 8, Catholic Robert Hamill died of injuries he received on April 26
 when he was savagely kicked and beaten by a loyalist mob in Portadown. Six per-
 sons were charged with his killing, but charges were subsequently dropped against
 five due to insufficient evidence. One awaits trial. Police officers sitting nearby in
 an RUC vehicle during the attack did not come to Hamill's aid, saying that they
 neither saw nor heard the incident. Following criticism by the Hamill family and
 others of the RUC and its internal investigation of the officers' conduct, the case
 was referred to the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, and a complaint
 was lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights. On May 9, two gun-
 men shot and killed constable Darren Bradshaw, age 24, as he sat drinking with
 friends in a bar in central Belfast. The INLA claimed responsibility. On May 12,
 a 61-year-old Catholic man, Sean Brown, was shot in the head outside a sports com-
 plex where he coached Gaelic'football in County Antrim. Police believe that Brown
 
 
 1377
 was killed by renegade loyalist gunmen from the loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), a
 splinter loyalist group that does not recognize the cease-fire, in retaliation for the
 May 9 murder of Darren Bradshaw.
 On June 1, 41-year-old RUC constable Greg Taylor was kicked to death by a loyal-
 ist mob outside a bar in County Antrim. The mob was reportedly angry about the
 police ban on a recent loyalist parade in the Antrim village of Dunloy (see Section
 2.d.). On June 11, Robert "Basher" Bates, a former member of the notorious Protes-
 tant "Shankill butchers" gang, was shot and killed in Belfast. It is believed that
 Bates was killed by a loyalist in retaliation for Bates's killing of the loyalist's father
 some 20 years earlier. The IRA'S North Armagh brigade claimed responsibility for
 the close-range shooting deaths on June 16 of David Johnston and John Graham,
 two RUC officers on foot patrol in Lurgan, near Portadown.
 Loyalists have been blamed for the March 14 killing of 44-year-old Catholic John
 Slane, who was shot as he prepared food for his twins in the kitchen of his West
 Belfast home. loyalist sources later claimed that the Ulster Defense Association
 (UDA) was responsible for the killing, but maintained that it had been a case of
 mistaken identity. On July 15, 18-year-old Catholic Bernadette Martin was shot in
 the head while she was sleeping in the home of her Protestant boyfriend. Although
 denied by the organization, it is widely believed that the killing was committed by
 the LVF. The LVF was also thought to be responsible for the killing of Gerry Devlin,
 a 36-year-old Catholic man who was shot in North Belfast on December 5.
 Jailed loyalist terrorist leader Billy Wright was shot five times at close range by
 three Irish National Liberation Army gunmen at the top security Maze prison on
 December 27. Wright was the leader of the LVF loyalist terrorist organization. Riots
 followed that evening when loyalist gangs in Portadown and other towns hijacked
 and burned cars and attacked police with Molotov cocktails. In retaliation for
 Wright's killing, three men opened fire in front of the Glengannon Hotel on Decem-
 ber 28, killing 45-year-old former IRA terrorist and convicted murderer (released in
 1994) Seamus Dillon. Three others, including a 14-year-old boy, were wounded. The
 LVF claimed responsibility for the attack, as well as a subsequent new year's eve
 attack on a North Belfast bar which fatally wounded 31-year-old Catholic Eddie
 Treanor. In October, during what police believe was a power struggle among loyalist
 paramilitary factions, a car bomb attributed to one of the factions killed a 20-year-
 old man named Greer, who was also believed to be a loyalist paramilitary member.
 The 1989 killing of Patrick Finucane, counsel to many IRA suspects, remains an
 open case. In February 1996, prison authorities freed Brian Nelson, a former Loyal-
 ist paramilitary member and agent for British military intelligence who had served
 less than half of a 10-year sentence for his role in five murder conspiracies unre-
 lated to Finucane. Finucane's widow, alleging that Nelson assisted in targeting
 Finucane, is pursuing a civil suit against both Nelson and the Ministry of Defense
 (MOD) for damages resulting from her husband's wrongful death, alleging that the
 MOD and Nelson were negligent in the "gathering, recording and keeping safe" of
 material concerning her husband. The MOD denied the claim. The unresolved sta-
 tus of the Finucane case (interpreted by a number of human rights organizations
 as evidence of collusion between government officials and loyalist paramilitary
 groups), remains a contentious issue between Nationalist groups and the Govern-
 ment. The United Nation's (U.N.) Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Law-
 yers and Judges, who visited the UK in October to investigate the Finucane case,
 had not released his report by year's end.
 Coroners do not have the power to compel those suspected of involvement in
 extrajudicial killing to testify at inquests, and the relatives of the deceased receive
 no advance disclosure of evidence. In Northern Ireland, coroners are permitted to
 inquire only into "how"-that is "by what means"--the deceased died, rather than
 into the broad circumstances of death. Human rights groups argue that this narrow
 definition shields wrongdoers, including soldiers and police officers, and unneces-
 sarily keeps family members from learning the truth of the circumstances surround-
 ing their relative's death.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 An investigation into at least 14 terrorist-perpetrated disappearances dating back
 to 1972, continued, although there is no longer a dedicated investigative team. Since
 April 1996 nine individuals have been arrested and interviewed in connection with
 the disappearances, although by year's end no criminal charges had been filed. The
 victims, typically members of the security forces, suspected informers, or petty
 criminals, have not been found.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law forbids torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. However,
 police occasionally abused detainees. Confessions obtained by abusive treatment are
 not admissible in court, and judges can exclude even voluntary confessions. Detain-
 
 
 1378
 ees who claim ph sical mistreatment have the right to an immediate medical exam-
 ination. Such a claim must be examined by a trial judge. Corporal punishment re-
 mains on the statute books in several of -the Caribbean dependent territories, al-
 though it is rarely practiced.
 The NGO Inquest -reports that police abuse of detainees in their custody, while
 not widespread, is a matter of concern. Inquest states that injuries and illnesses re-
 sult more often from neglect or misdiagnosis than from overt physical attack, al-
 though there have been incidents of police brutality (see Section L.a.). The NGO
 Prison Reform Trust agrees that while there have been detainees who have suffered
 police abuse, the problem is not widespread. In 1996, however, a UN committee
 noted that no police brutality appeared to disproportionally affect members of mi-
 nority ethnic groups (see section L.a and 5).
 The Independent Commission for Police Complaints, established by the Govern-
 ment, supervises police investigations of complaints in Northern Ireland filed
 against the police, or referred to the Commission by the RUC Chief Constable, the
 Police Authority, or the Northern Ireland Secretary of State. It automatically super-
 vises cases involving death or serious injury, and can direct the Chief Constable to
 bring charges against police officers. The Commission reported that in 1997 it re-
 .ceived 3,108 new complaints, up from 2,540 in 1996. Of the 2,699 cases processed
 (some pending from-previous years), investigations led to informal disciplinary ac-
 tion in 109 cases and to formal charges in 7 cases involving nine police officers.
 Local human rights groups continue to complain that the Commission is not truly
 autonomous in that it has no independent investigatory abilities and must rely on
 supervising police investigations into the complaints.The Hayes Report, commis-
 sioned by the Government and released on January 23, recommended the establish-
 ment of an independent police ombudsman who would be responsible to Parliament
 and have-the power to both initiate and conduct investigations, and to recommend
 critina prosecution. In December the Government published a draft bill generally
 to that effect.
 In 1993 the Northern Ireland Secretary named an Independent Assessor of Mili-
 tary Complaints to deal. with procedures regarding-romplaints of abuses committed
 by the army; the Independent Assessor also lacks independent investigative powers.
 His fourth report, released in March, noted that despite the end of the IRA cease-
 fire in February 1996, there were only 24 formal, non-criminal complaints in 1996
 (compared with 19 during the cease-fire in 1995) and 264 informal complaints. He
 also reported that delays in processing complaints had been reduced, and that only
 one case took more than 8 weeks to resolve.
 In 1992 the Government appointed a senior barrister as independent Commis-
 sioner for Holding Centers in Northern Ireland, with the authority to make irregu-
 lar, unannounced visits to any holding center, observe interrogations, and interview
 detainees. There were 126 visits to 'the 3 holding centers in 1996 (latest figures).
 'In March the Commissioner and his deputy reported that 16 complaints of physical
 - assault during detention-(in-a detainee- population of 583) were received in 1996.
 The report also suggested that, an ombudsman, similar to that recommended in the
 Hayes report, would also be appropriate-for holding centers.- It criticized the fact
 that silent video recording of interrogations (which legal counsel is generally not
 permitted to attend) had not yet been implemented. On October 1, the Northern Ire-
 land Secretary announced that-new legislation would, however, make audio record-
 ings of interrogations compulsory. At year's end, legislation to implement compul-
 sory audio recording was working its way through Parliament.
 Accusations continued that security- forces in Northern Ireland harass citizens,
 particularly young people, in rural and urban working-class communities and other
 areas where support for terrorists is considered strong. Colin Duffy, who was pre-
 viously convicted and later acquitted on appeal for the 1996- murder of a former sol-
 dier, was arrested hy the RUC in June for the'murder that month of two police offi-
 -cers in Lurgan. Duffy was released in October for lack of evidence and claims he
 has been repeatedly harassed by the police since then. The Government strongly de-
 nies that such harassment behavior is widespread or officially tolerated, nationalists
 argue that the RUC acts more aggressively to quell republican disturbances than
 to subdue loyalist lawbreakers. On October 1, the Northern Ireland Secretary an-
 nounced government plans to initiate substantial reform of the RUC, including
 structural and training changes. Parliament debated RUC reform in December.
 Police in Northern Ireland continued to use plastic bullets, particularly in connec-
 tion with violence that erupted during the summer marching season (see Section
 2.d.). According to RUC reports, 2,510 plastic bullets were fired during the first 2
 weeks of July, compared with 6,600 during the same period the previous year. On
 June 10, Parliament was informed that a significant proportion of the plastic bullets
 supplied to the RUC in 1994 and still in use in 1997 were defective, traveling at
 
 
 1379
 velocities that exceeded the upper recommended limit. All rounds had been with-
 drawn by April 25; nearly 9,000 rounds had been fired since the defective bullets
 were issued. According to RUC rules, plastic bullets should be aimed at the lower
 half of the body; serious head and upper body injuries nevertheless have resulted
 from plastic bullet use. In July 14-year-old Gary Lawler was hit in the head by a
 plastic bullet and remained comatose for several days; Brendan Morris suffered a
 shattered cheekbone and broken nose; and 13-year-old Marie Walsh was shot in the
 mouth. In 1996 there were a total of 73 confirmed plastic bullet-related injuries. In
 1997 the Independent Commission for Police Complaints received 30 complaints re-
 garding plastic bullets.
 Plastic bullet use, confined to Northern Ireland, has been. severely criticized by
 human rights monitors, although the European Court of Human Rights ruled in
 1984 that using them to quell serious riots in Northern Ireland did not contravene
 the European Convention on Human Rights. The U.N. Committee Against Torture,
 the European Parliament, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, and other NGO's have
 called for a ban on their use. The Government has said that alternatives have been
 considered but that most options have been found to be either more dangerous or
 inaccurate. In January the Inspectorate of Constabulary in Northern Ireland rec-
 ommended a drastic reduction in the use of plastic bullets to control disturbances.
 In September the Government announced a nationwide policy review concerning
 their use.
 Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards, although
 overcrowding worsened in 1997. As of September, half the prisons in England, Scot-
 land, and Wales were officially deemed by the Prison Service to be overcrowded. In
 December the Home Office pronounced a pilot program for electronically tagging se-
 lected offenders a success. Designed to reduce prison crowding, offenders are re-
 quired to remain in place, usually at home, as their whereabouts are electronically
 monitored. The Government, which hopes that the program will reduce the prison
 population by 5 percent, plans to extend the pilot program to additional counties in
 1998.
 Both human rights groups and the Independent Commissioner for Holding Cen-
 ters have repeatedly recommended the closing of the Castlereagh Detention Center,
 which remains open despite persistent complaints of police impropriety in the inter-
 rogation process.
 Human rights groups have been particularly critical of s cial security units
 (SSU's) used to hold those deemed to pose an exceptional riskof escape. SSU in-
 mates are not told how long they will be held in SSU's, nor are they involved in
 annual reviews of their detentions or informed when such a review is taking place.
 Citing small group isolation, the lack of adequate exercise, work, educational oppor-
 tunities, and natural daylight, as well as strict enforcement of noncontact visits
 through a glass barrier, NGO's have condemned SSU imprisonment as violating
 international standards. A 1996 government inquiry conducted by Sir Donald Ach-
 eson concluded that prolonged incarceration in SU's could lead to mental illness.
 In August, following reinstatement of the IRA cease-fire, the Government trans-
 ferred all paramilitary prisoners out of SSU's, closing one of the three facilities that
 had been in use. By year's end, 6 prisoners, none of them paramilitaries, remained
 in SSU's, down from 27 in January:
 Roisin McAliskey, a pregnant prisoner arrested in November, 1996, and awaiting
 extradition to Germany on terrorism charges, was held in isolation in an SSU until
 May 23. Categorized as a high-risk prisoner, McAliskey initially had difficulty re-
 ceiving appropriate prenatal care. After repeated representations on her behalf by
 human rights groups, prison officials subsequently ensured that she had regular at-
 tention for her medical conditions. On May 26, she gave birth; on June 3, she and
 her child were transferred to a secure mother-baby unit in another hospital. In the
 fall, a magistrate ruled that McAliskey was eligible for extradition to Germany. At
 year's end the Home Secretary was still considering whether to sign the extradition
 order.
 In October the Ministry of Defense confirmed that at least 23 cases brought
 against the Government by servicemen and women claiming physical and sexual as-
 sault during initiation, were then pending in the High Court. More than 70 military
 men and women have brought suit altogether, alleging beatings (including one re-
 cruit who required facial reconstruction), racially-motivated assault (including one
 man of color who was scrubbed with steel brushes then sprinkled with bleach), and
 other brutalities. Chief of Staff Brig. Robert Gordon announced new policies to
 eliminate such incidents, including better education, tougher investigations, and
 stricter discipline. An appeals process for victims of racial or sexual harassment was
 also promised.
 
 
 1380
 
 In 1995 ratification by the Republic of Ireland of the European Convention on the
 Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners allowed the transfers of convicted terrorists from
 British to Irish custody. In 1997 four prisoners were transferred from English jails
 to jails in Northern Ireland, and further transfers were in process at year's end.
 Human rights NGO's charge that the transfer process is too slow.
 There are no separate prison facilities for young female prisoners; 15- to 18-year-
 old girls share dormitories and cells with adult women. In some prisons, girls are
 locked in their cells with adult offenders for as much as 17 hours a day. In Risley
 young females are housed in the psychiatric wing with seriously disturbed prisoners,
 as itis considered the safest place for them in the prison. In August the High Court
 found the automatic placement of young female offenders in adult women's jails
 pending needs assessment and final placement decisions to be unlawful.
 New, less restrictive instructions regarding shackling were introduced following a
 prison service inquiry into a January incident when prisoner Geoffrey Thomas was
 shackled to his bed until 3 hours before he died of stomach cancer.
 Before the reinstatement of the cease-fire on July 20, the IRA and other Repub-
 lican paramilitary groups continued violent-campaigns targeting buildings and eco-
 nomic activities, as well as military, police,-and civilians. While the 1994 loyalist
 cease-fire generally.-held, -numerous violent incidents were.traced to them as well.
 On January 28, Provisional IRA terrorists launched two rockets at a joint army/
 RUG patrol in West Belfast.-Although a number- of 4pedestrians suffered cuts from
 flying glass, no one waa seriously injured. A-grou calling itself the Armagh -Free-
 dom Fighters, who claim nof to be associated with the  Aor any other republican
 organization, admitted responsibility for the March 2 gasoline bomb attack on a
 housing executive office. On March 13, a policeman and a soldier were seriously in-
 Sured in an explosion as they patrolled the nationalist Short Strand enclave in East
 elfast. Four other soldiers were- slightly injured in the blast. Earlier that day, an
 improvised grenade was thrown at an army Land over as it patrolled the National-
 ist Ardoyne area of North Belfast. On -April 10, polic officr Alic Collins was seri-
 ously injured -when-she was shot in the-back while on duty manning a courthouse
 sentry.box in -ondonderry.-The IRA admitted responsibility._On April 12, a loyalist
 gang- attacked a- block of (Catholic flats, forcing eight families to flee their homes.
 10-month-old baby:narrowly-escaped injury when a  brick -was hurled through a
 -- window-in the predominantly Protestant-T rigeFs Bay-area of Belfast during the at-
 tack. Police blamed loyalists for an .attemptedcar bombing in Belfast on June 21.
 The driver and another occupant suffered minor injuries.
 In March and April, prior to the May 1 general elections, the IRA combined a se-
 ries of real bomb scares and hoaxes to disrupt the transportation and utilities infra-
 structures in the Birmingham, Leeds, Doncaster, and London areas. On April 18,
 bombs were detonated at Leeds and Doncaster, while police defused bombs in Stoke-
 on-Trent. There were no reports of injuries.
 On March 19, a British army bomb disposal unit defused two mark 16 horizontal
 . mortars in county Fermanagh. In April numerous bomb scares and hoaxes led to
 the cancellation and subsequent rescheduling of the Grand National, the UK's most
 prestigious horse racing event. On May 31,_ the IRA left a van containing 1,000
 * pounds of. explosives in- the West Belfast housing estate of Poleglass. The IRA
 -claimed it hadmade the bomb safe-before abandoning it, a claim disputed by police.
 On July 19, the IRA declared a cease-fire, effective July 20. At the end of August,
 the Secretary-of State for Northern Ireland announced her finding that the cease-
 fire was being observed,. allowing Sinn Fein, the political party closely identified
 with the IRA, entry into-negotiations on Northern Ireland's political future. On Sep-
 tember 16, a 400.pound bomb exploded in the County Armagh town of Markethill,
 causing extensive damage, but no serious injuries. The IRA denied responsibility for
 the attack, which is thought to have been carried out by the Continuity IRA, a hard-
 line splinter group. Isolated splinter gup incidents, including murder and bomb-
 ings, accelerated after the fatal Republican attack on jailed Loyalist paramilitery
 terrorist Billy Wright on December 27 (see Section 1.a.)
 Both loyalist ann republican terrorists in Northern Ireland have carried out "pun-
 ishment" attacks, although total numbers have shown a marked decrease since
 1996, and particularly since the July cease-fire. The attackers beat their victims
 - with iron pipes, baseball bats, sledgehammers, and spiked clubs, dropped concrete
 blocks on exposed limbs, and shot victims in the knees. In 1997 the RUC recorded
 72 loyalist punishment assaults and an additional 48 loyalist punishment shootings-
 kneecappings. This was down from 130 and 21, respectively, in 1996. republica sta-
 tistics included 78 punishment assaults and 24 shootings/kneecappings, versus 172
 and 3 in 1996. The RUC attributed no attacks to Direct Action Against Drugs
 (DADD), a cover name for the IRA. In February David Templeton was attacked by
 three masked men, believed to be loyalists, who beat him savagely with nail-spiked

 wooden clubs. He died in March. The loyalists often, but not exclusively, target
 members of their terrorist cells who have broken ranks, while the republicans more
 frequently extend their vigilante activities to the broader Catholic community, pun-'
 ishng "anti-social activities" such as drug dealing.
 On December 16, three IRA terrorists who planned an extensive bombing cam-
 paign in 1996 were sentenced to 17, 20, and 25 years for conspiracy to cause explo-
 sions and possessing explosives with intent. The men were arrested in police raids
 that also resulted in the death of Dairmud ONeill (see section 1.a)
 The Government permits human rights monitors to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The authorities can and often do make
 arrests or detain suspects without judicial warrants, especially in Northern Ireland,
 when they believe that they have reasonable cause to suspect wrongdoing. The
 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994 allows police officers to stop and
 search vehicles and pedestrians if a police officer of at least superintendent rank
 (or a chief inspector if no superintendent is available) "reasonably believes" it is ex-
 pedient to do so to prevent acts of violence. The authorization is limited to a 24-
 hour period, but is renewable under certain circumstances.
 The 1991 Northern Ireland Emergency Provisions Act (EPA) permits a soldier on
 duty, a member of the Royal Irish Regiment, or a police officer to arrest and detain
 for up to 4 hours "a person who he has reasonable grounds to suspect is committing
 or has committed or is about to commit any offense.
 The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act (PTA) allows the police
 to arrest without a warrant anywhere in the UK persons they have reason to sus-
 pect of being involved in terrorism. The authorities may detain such persons (even
 those under age 18) for up to 48 hours without legal representation or judicial re-
 view. Suspects may be interrogated dunng this time, and confessions obtained may
 be used in subsequent court proceedings. Under the 1989 PTA, detainees are grant-
 ed the right to have lawyers present during interrogation in England or Wales, but
 not in Northern Ireland. Detention without charge may be extended up to a further
 5 days on the authority of the Home Secretary or, in Northern Ireland, the Sec-
 retary of State for Northern Ireland.
 The PTA is the most reviewed piece of legislation in the United Kingdom. It ex-
 pires every 2 years and, due to the changing security situation, is amended or al-
 tered to account for those changes. Critics charge that the annual review is super-
 ficial. Extensive PTA detention powers were held in breach of the European Conven-
 tion on Human Rights, which led to a derogation by the Government in 1988.
 On October 1, the Northern Ireland Secretary announced that the Government in-
 tended to eliminate indefinite internment without trial, and to introduce major
 changes to both the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Emergency Provisions Act,
 including in reasing the number of terrorist acts to be tried through the jury sys-
 tem, and intrducing audio recording of suspected terrorist interrogations in holding
 centers.
 In England, Scotland, and Wales suspects arrested without warrants must be re-
 leased within 24 hours (or 86 hours if a serious offense is involved) unless brought
 before a magistrates' court. The court ma  authorize extension of detention by 36
 hours, and on further application by another 24 hours, versus the 48-hour scheme
 extant in Northern Ireland (see Section 1.e).
 Defendants awaiting trial have a statutory right to bail unless there is a risk that
 they would abscond, commit an offense, interfere with witnesses or otherwise ob-
 struct the course of justice, or unless they were on bail when the alleged offense
 was committed. Defendants who are remanded in custody are protected by statutory
 custody time limits, which restrict the period for which they can be held while
 awaiting trial to a maximum of 182 days, unless the court grants an extension. At
 year's end, a total of 25,648 defendants were awaiting trial, 24 percent of them in
 custody. Of those in custody, 86 percent had been awaiting trial for less than 24
 weeks, while 3 percent (193) had been waiting onger than 48 weeks. These statis-
 tics are comparable to 1996 statistics. Crown Court statistics show that the average
 waiting time for trial there continued to fall (see page 16.) As of July 30, the Home
 Secretary announced that existing time limits would be enforced more strictly, and
 that new, more limited, time frames would be imposed.
 The law gives administrative detention power to immigration officers. There is no
 time limit for such detention and no right to have it reviewed by a court, although
 recommendations for revised legislation are currently under government review. At
 any given time, 750 to 800 asylum seekers are detained, either in regular prisons,
 specially built detention centers, or occasionally in police cells. The average period
 of detention is about 152 days, although some asylum seekers have been detained
 for more than 2 years. Unme those accused of criminal offenses, asylum seekers
 are given no written statement about why they were detained, although the practice
 
 
 1382
 is to provide them updates on the status of their claims and the time required for
 their adjudication. Asylum seekers do not have an automatic right to apply for bail,
 and bail application, which can be made to immigration appellate authorities, re-
 quires a relatively high level of surety. The Home Office states that detention is au-
 thorized only where there are good grounds to anticipate noncompliance with the
 terms of temporary admission and that the practice does not affect more than ap-
 proximately 1.5 percent of asylum seekers at any given time.
 Under the 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act, most asylum seekers are not eligi-
 ble for means-tested welfare benefits while their applications are under consider-
 ation. Those from countries declared to be "in upheaval" are eligible but must apply
 on arrival to receive benefits. In January and February, a well-publicized hunger
 strike among asylum seekers in Kent protesting government treatment caused sig-
 nificant criticism of the detention policy. On July 30, a High Court judge found "ir-
 rational" a government ban on employment for asylum seekers who are awaiting the
 results of appeals from decisions denyng them refugee status. Asylum seeker
 Raghbir Singh Johal, who was detained for 20 monthsby the Government for na-
 tional security reasons, was released in late 1996.
 The Government does not practice exile (see also Section 2.d.). Newspaper articles
 indicate that terrorist organizations continued to threaten individuals and families
 to compel them to leave Northern Ireland. The RUC reported that 46 families of
 police officers, ex-police officers, or their relatives were forced to move from their
 homes due to terrorist threats.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent and provides citizens
 with a generally fair and efficient judicial process.
 The UK has several levels of courts. The vast majority of criminal cases are heard
 by magistrates courts, which are managed by locally based committees. Their deci-
 sions may be appealed to the Crown Court, which also hears criminal cases requir-
 ing a jury trial, or to the High Court. Crown Court convictions may be appealed to
 the Court of Appeal, which in turn may refer cases involving points of law to the
 House of Lords. The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (which consists of
 senior judges and is functionally distinct from the legislative arm) is the final court
 of appeal. On March 31, the new Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) began
 operating as an additional appellate body to investigate suspected miscarriages of
 justice in England, Northern Ireland, and WalesjIt considers cases after the judicial
 appeals process has been exhausted and where there is significant new evidence
 that casts doubt on the conviction. In Scotland similar appeals may be made to the
 Scottish Office.
 The law provides for a fair trial, and the authorities respect and enforce the law.
 Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence, the right to question witnesses
 against them, and the right to appeal to successively higher courts.
 Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994, judges have the power
 to instruct juries that they may draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's re-
 fusal to answer questions during interrogation or trial, although no conviction can
 be based solely on such an inference. Human rights groups and the U.N. Human
 Rights Committee have sharply criticized this provision, which they consider an ab-
 rogation of the right against self-incrimination. A similar provision is in effect in
 Northern Ireland.
 Indigent defendants have the right to free counsel of their choice, with some ex-
 ceptions. Criminal proceedings must be held in public except those in juvenile court
 and those involving public decency or security. In a trial under the Official Secrets
 Act, the judge may order the court closed, but the sentencing must be public.
 In Northern Ireland, special emergency" restrictions affect due process. Under
 the Northern Ireland Emergency Provisions Act of 1991 (EPA), trials for certain ter-
 rorist-related offenses are automatically tried in "Diplock courts" without a jury un-
 less they are specifically "scheduled out" to ordinary jury courts. If judges decide to
 convict, they must justify the decision in a document that becomes part of the court
 record. An appellate court may overturn the decision on either factual or legal
 grounds. Through August (latest available statistics), 88 persons stood trial in
 Diplock courts. Of these, 74 pled guilty; of the 14 who stood trial, 10 were convicted
 and 4 were acquitted. The Diplock courts, which the Government asserts are nec-
 essary to prevent terrorists from intimidating juries and suborning justice, have
 been widely criticized by human rights groups, as well as various U.N. committees.
 On October 1, the Northern Ireland Secretary announced the Government's inten-
 tion to narrow the scope of cases considered by Diplock courts.
 The EPA does not exclude the use of uncorroborated confessions, which in North-
 ern Ireland may, and have been, used as the sole basis for conviction. Additionally,
 the EPA permits police to prevent any suspected terrorist from contacting legal
 counsel for up to 48 hours after arrest under certain circumstances, and on the re-
 
 
 1383
 quest of a police officer with the minimum rank of superintendent. After a detainee
 as asked to see a lawyer and has done so, this enod is renewable in subsequent
 48-hour periods until the detainee is charged or released. Human rights groups have
 criticized these provisions, arguing that a detainee is most likely to need counsel
 in the first few hours; lack of counsel during that time makes false or coerced con-
 fessions and detainee abuse more likely. According to the RUC, in 1996 detainees
 made 518 requests under the EPA for access to a lawyer, 13 of which were delayed.
 Through September 1997, 33 of 424 such requests were delayed. At year's end the
 Government was considering how to implement the European Court of Human
 Rights' "Murray" ruling, which found the 48-hour rule incompatible with the Euro-
 pean Convention on Human Rights. The Government has not yet adopted the Con-
 vention, but legislation to do so has begun working its way through in Parliament.
 The Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act of 1996 reduced defense lawyers'
 access to potential evidence held by the prosecution, including information as to how
 the evidence was collected. According to the Committee on the Administration of
 Justice, this practice may be contrary to U.N. guidelines on the role of prosecutors.
 Human rights groups have expressed concern about intimidation of defense law-
 yers in Northern Ireland. Attorney Rosemary Nelson reported that within a 4-week
 period in early 1997, 12 clients who had been held at the Gough Barracks Detention
 Center had heard RUC officers stating that she was going to be killed, presumably
 by loyalists. Similar threats continued through October. Nelson has lodged a corn-
 plaint agalnat the RUC, which remained under investigation at year's end.
 On June 20, Patrick Kane was released from prison after serving 9 years for the
 murder of two army corporals in Northern Ireland. A Court of Appeal ruled Kane's
 conviction "unsafe" (that is, it overturned his conviction) because of Kane's limited
 intelligence and anxious nature.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-War-
 rants are normally required for a police search of private premises. However, under
 the 1991 EPA, members of the armed forces or police in Northern Ireland may enter
 and search "any premises for the purpose of arresting a person for an an-eatable
 offense, but only if he or she has reasonable grounds for believin that the person
 being sought is on the premises." The requirement for "reasonable" grounds has
 been broady interpretedby the Northenm Ireland courts.
 Primarily due to fear of intercommunal violence, many Protestant and Catholic
 families in Northern Ireland continued to move away from mixed or border neigh-
 borhoods.
 In Northern Ireland, paramilitary groups have attacked and threatened to attack
 the homes and families of police and pelitcians (see Sections l.a. and 1.c.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.--Strongly held common-law tradition, an inde-
 pendent press, and a democratic political system combine to secure freedom of
 speech and of the press. Viewpoints critical of the Government are well represented.
 The print media are dominated by a handful of national daily newspapers, all pri-
 vately owned and independent (although often generally aligned witha poelitical
 party). About half the electronic media are run by the British Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion (BBC), which is funded by the Government but enjoys complete editorial inde-
 pendence. The remainder are run by corporations under renewable government li-
 cense.
 Human rights organizations and journalists continued to criticize the 1981 Con-
 tempt of Court Act, which allows courts to order a journalist to disclose a source
 if this is deemed to be in the interests of justice." In 1996 the European Court of
 Human Rights found that the Government had violated the right to free expression
 when journalist William Goodwin and his publishers were heldein ontempt of court
 for refusing to disclose the identity of a source of confidential corporate information
 that, if published, might have caused financial harm to a company. In July a British-
 court refused to apply the Goodwin precedent, compelling "Marketing Week" maga-
 zine to disclose how it learned of the Camelot organization's plans for pay increases
 5 days before the public announcement. Marketing Week appealed the decision in
 July. Because of cases such as "Camelot," journalists have criticized the Contempt
 of Court Act for failing to provide the safeguards intended for them and their con-
 fidential sources.
 The doctrine of public interest immunity (P) allows government ministers to pre-
 vent certain information from being disclosed during litigation, on the grounds that
 such revelation would be contrary to the public interest. Human rights groups have
 criticized the doctrine and accused the Government of using it to protect govern-
 ment officials. Additionally, the Official Secrets Act, another law cited by journalists
 
 
 1384
 as unduly restrictive, prohibits, the defense that the information is already in the
 public domain or that its publication is in the public interest.
 In December, the government published a White Paper (a proposed policy paper
 drafted in preparation for legislation) detailing a comprehensive new Freedom of In-
 formation Act. The proposed Act would allow public access to most official informa-
 tion, require public organizations to regularly publicize raw data and facts, and im-
 prove individual access tpersonal information. Hailed by some in government as
 a fundamental philosophical change, the plan has been praised by the Campaign for
 Freedom of Information, which was reportedly pleased by the extent of the proposed
 reform. A draft bill is expected in Spring 1998.
 Academic freedom is respeted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembl and Association.-The law provides for the right
 of peaceful assembly and association, but the right is routinely limited where it
 would impose a cost on public convenience. The annual "marching season" in North-
 ern Ireland posed special problems for the Government as it tried to protect this
 right in practice. During several weeks in the summer, some 100,000 members of
 the Orange Order and similar Protestant organizations stage traditional parades to
 celebrate their history and cultural identity. While few of the 3,100 parades held
 each year are contentious, about 40 that celebrate Protestant "triumphs" in histori-
 cal battles or are routed through Catholic neighborhoods give rise to tensions. Simi-
 lar organizations in the Nationalist community also march during the summer, al-
 though the smaller scale of those parades has presented law enforcement authorities
 with fewer difficulties.
 In early summer the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, working with both
 Protestant and Catholic groups and a new Parades Commission (a five-member ap-
 pointed body designed to facilitate mediation of contentious parades, which, al-
 though seen as a positive innovation, as of yet has no authority to compel action),
 attempted to effect a compromise on some of the most contentious marches. After
 this effort failed, the RUC Chief Constable, citing the need to minimize the possibil-
 ity of serious violence including loss of life, decided to permit the July 6 march along
 the Garvaghy road in the Drumcree area of Portadown. Protests were widespread
 as Nationalists denounced the decision as a concession to mob rule. In order to se-
 cure access to a particularly contentious stretch of the road, a massive police pres-
 ence cleared and secured the route in a predawn operation, and kept residents, pri-
 marily Catholics, behind a thick cordon of armored vehicles and riot ear-clad offi-
 cers. A brief but intense clash broke out between police and several dozen protest-
 ers. Fourteen persons were injured in the skirmish, some by plastic bullets. There
 was criticism of police tactics as overly aggressive and directed primarily against
 Catholics; at the same time, there was evidence that some of the violence was or-
 chestrated by republican groups.
 Several days of serious rioting ensued across Northern Ireland, which included car
 and train burnings and paramilitary attacks on the security forces, including a rock-
 et attack on an RUC vehicle and the shooting of a female officer. In the atmosphere
 of increased tension and violence, the Orange Order voluntarily canceled or rerouted
 four particularly contentious parades, a decision that averted the danger of contin-
 ued civil unrest.
 A serious riot occurred in Londonderry on December 13 when republicans pro-
 tested a unionist march through the center of the city by throwing some 1,000 Molo-
 tov cocktails. Police responded by firing 169 plastic bullets, No life-threatening inju-
 ries were reported.
 Under the PTA, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may proscribe any
 organization that "appears . . . to be concerned in, or in promoting or encouraging
 terrorism occurring in the United Kingdom and connected with the affairs of North-
 ern Ireland." Membership in proscribed loyalist and republican paramilitary groups
 is punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment. In June the Secretary of State pro-
 scribed two groups, the loyalist Volunteer Force a breakaway group of the Ulster
 Volunteer Force, which refuses to accept the loyalist cease-fire, and the Continuity
 Army Council IRA, a republican group that has opposed calls for an IRA cease-fire.
 The Council has claimed responsibility for attacks on the police and army and is
 suspected in a number of other sectarian attacks in Northern Ireland, including a
 carbomb attack in Markethill in September. The LVF is believed to be responsible
 for a number of bombings and sectarian killings, including the killing of Sean
 Brown in Bellaghy in May, and Seamus Dillon and Eddie Treanor in December (see
 Section L.a.). The LVF also threatened heavy bombing in the Republic of Ireland if
 the Orange Order March in Portadown was banned.
 Supporting proscribed paramilitary groups is also an imprisonable offense, as is
 wearing clothing that arouses 'reasonable suspicion" that the wearer belongs to or
 supports proscribed organizations. Human rights activists, while acknowledging the
 
 
 1385
 deterrent effects of proscription powers, argue for the repeal of this law because it
 violates the fundamental right of freedom of association and an individual's right
 to express personal opinions and beliefs.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Government policy and general practice ensure freedom
 of religion for traditional and nontraditional worshipers. Despite the existence of
 state religions (the Anglican Church of England an the Presbyterian Church of
 Scotland), members of all faiths and denominations enjoy freedom of worship. Dis-
 crimination on religious or political grounds is specifically outlawed in Northern Ire-
 land, although not currently in the rest of the country. Those who believe that their
 freedom to worship has been abrogated have the right to appeal to the European
 Court of Human Rights for relief. Although not enfored, blasphemy with respect
 to Christian beliefs is still technically illegal.-Several religious organizations, in as-
 sociation with the Commission for Racial Equality, are attempting to either abolish
 the rule or expand it to protect all faiths.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country and in foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. However, the Home Secretary may exclude
 from Great Britain anyone believed linked with terrorism in Northern Ireland, ex-
 cept anyone born in Great Britain or resident there for 3 years. The Grounds for
 exclusion need not be revealed. As of September 30, 13 persons (versus 22 in 1996)
 are subject to exclusion orders. Several Members of Parliament, human rights
 groups, and the media have-objected to exclusion orders. On October 30 the Home
 ecretary revoked all of the exclusion orders as part of the peace process confidence-
 -building measures.
 -The Government cooperates closely with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) and other, humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. First
 asylum is -provided under a temporary protection process started in 1992. All appli-
 cants are screened by the UNHCR. As of June 30, the-Government accepted 15,910
 applications for first asylum, a 22 per cent decrease over 1996. Under the first asy-
 lum program, successful applicants are given 6 months' "leave to enter the country"
 on arrival.-They can then apply for an automatic 3:2 year extension of their stay,
 and may apply for refugee status at any time. Such applications are considered in
 .accordance with the criteria set out in the 1951 UN refugee convention. Some asy-
 lum seekers are detained while the Government reviews their cases (see Section
 1.d.).
 Of decisions taken on asylum applications in 1997, 11 percent were to recognize
 the applicant as a refugee and grant asylum, and 9 percent were granted "excep-
 tional leave to remain," although the applicants were refused asylum.
 The Government began a review of asylum and detention policies, which was not
 complete by year's end.
 In April the press reported that after being denied asylum, Maurad Amara was
 killed within 2 weeks of his deportation to Algeria. After public criticism, the Gov-
 ernment froze further deportations to Algeria, pending a review of the situation
 there. Shortly thereafter, it was discovered that Amara was alive and well. Never-
 theless, violent events in Algeria over the summer months prompted another freeze
 on Algerian deportations.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change theirgovernment and freely exercise that right.
 The Government is formed on the basis of a majority of seats in the House of Com-
 mons, which are contested in elections held at intervals not longer than 5 years.
 Participation in the political process is open to all persons and parties. All citizens
 18 years of age and older may vote. As in the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has
 city and district councils, but with fewer powers. England and Wales also have
 county councils. On September 11, in Scotland, 74percent of those voting, (there was
 a 60percent turnout) voted in favor of creating a separate Scottish Parliament which
 is to assume responsibility for local matters such as health, education, and economic
 development. The Parliament will also have limited taxation powers. The Scottish
 National Party, which holds 6 seats in the UK Parliament, advocates complete inde-
 pendence for Scotland. Wales narrowly passed a similar devolution measure on Sep-
 tember 18, but the new Welsh assembly is not to have tax-raising powers. Despite
 periodic attempts, there has been no devolved government in Northern Ireland since
 1972 because of the situation there and the lack of progress in political negotiations.
 British dependent territories have small populations (about 160,000 persons in
 total), with appointed governors or administrators assisted by executive councils
 (usually appointed) and legislative assemblies or councils (partly elected). In the
 summer, there was a call by residents in several dependent territories, particularly
 
 
 1386
 Anguilla, to explore increased autonomy to deal with domestic issues, although
 there is no strong agitation for independence. The Government has committed to co-
 operating in these efforts, including promising a comprehensive dependent territory
 policy review due in early 1998.
 Women and minorities face no legal constraints on voting or holding office. Fol-
 lowing the May elections, women constitute 18 percent of the membership of the
 lower legislative chamber and nearly 8 percent of the upper chamber (up from 10
 and 5 percent respectively). Seventeen members of minority ethnic groups serve in
 Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights issues and cases. Gov-
 ernment officials are cooperative and responsive to their views. In 1973 the Govern-
 ment established a Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights (SACHR) to
 monitor human rights in Northern Ireland but has adopted few of its security-relat-
 ed recommendations.
 A number of international nongovernmental human rights organizations, includ-
 ing Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, and Article 19, are
 based in the UK. The Government cooperates fully with international inquiries into
 alleged violations of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Race Relations Act of 1976 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color,
 nationality, or national or ethnic origin, and outlaws incitement to racial hatred. In
 August the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order extended these protections to
 Northern Ireland. Human rights groups claim that the travelers, a white, nomadic
 indigenous population (estimated to number some 1,000 persons) that comprises the
 second largest minority ethnic group in Northern Ireland, and a significant minority
 in the rest of the UK, experience marginalization, educational discrimination, and
 police and societal harassment geater than that of the settled population. U.N.
 committees on both the Rights of the Child and the Elimination of Racial Discrimi-
 nation have expressed similar concerns.
 Discrimination on the grounds of religious or political opinion is specifically un-
 lawful in Northern Ireland but not in Great Britain. Discrimination on the basis of
 religion is only illegal in Great Britain when its effect is to discriminate against a
 member of a minority ethnic group. The Government respects and enforces all anti-
 discrimination laws, which concentrate on employment and the supply of goods and
 services.
 Women.-Statistical and other evidence indicates that most victims of societal vio-
 lence are women. Domestic violence currently constitutes 43 per cent of reported
 violent crimes against women and accounts for almost 17 percent of all reported vio-
 lent crimes. As promised, the Government introduced the Protection from Harass-
 ment Act of 1997 in March, which calls for prison sentences of up to 5 years for
 convicted stalkers.
 The law provides for injunctive relief, personal protection orders, and protective
 exclusion orders (similar to restraining orders) for women who are victims of vio-
 lence. The Government provides shelters, counseling, and other assistance for vic-
 tims of battery or rape and offers free legal aid to battered women who are economi-
 cally reliant upon their abusers. The Government actively prosecutes perpetrators
 of domestic violence. Section 33 of the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
 abolished the requirement that judges warn juries that a victim's testimony alone
 should not be adequate for a rape conviction. The Act also made sexual and other
 intentional harassment a criminal offense. In September a court ordered the first
 civil damages award of about $24,000 (14,000 British pounds) to a victim of marital
 rape.
 The law also provides for equal opportunity between the sexes, but women experi-
 ence some discrimination in practice. The 1975 Sex Discrimination Act, as amended
 in 1986, prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination in training, education,
 housing, and provision of goods and services, as well as in employment. Women
 have equal rights regarding property and divorce. According to the Government's
 Equal Opportunities ommission (which supports persons who bring discrimination
 cases before industrial tribunals and courts, and produces guidelines on good prac-
 tice for employers), there has been significant progress towards equal opportunity
 for women since the Commission was established in 1975. However, according to the
 Equal Opportunities Commission women still earn approximately 20 per cent less
 
 
 1387
 than their male counterparts in comparable positions, a number that has changed
 little in recent years. A government minister cochairs the Women's National Com-
 mission, a forum for women's organizations that presents women's views to the gov-
 ernment.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. The government provides free, compulsory education up to age 16, and then
 to the age of 18 if the student so desires. While there is no societal pattern of abuse
 directed against children, indications are, despite the lack of reliable data, that child
 abuse is nevertheless a problem. Throughout the year a tribunal continued hearings
 into allegations of systematic abuse of more than 650 children by staff at various
 public and private children's homes in Wales. Findings are expected in January
 1998. Under the PTA, police can- arrest and detain minors for up to 7 days. "
 Various laws covering England and Wales stipulate that children have the right
 to apply for court orders, to give or withhold consent for medical treatment (for
 those capable of making an informed decision), to make complaints to the relevant
 local authority, to have their ethnic, linguistic, and religious background considered
 in decisions affecting them, to have reasonable contact; with their families (usually
 applied-in a circumstance -where- there has been abuse), and in general to be con-
 sulted regarding their desires.
 People With ,isabilities.-The 1995-Disability Discrimination Act outlaws dis-
 crimination against, disabled persons in the'provision-of access. to public facilities by
 employers of more than 20 workers, service-providers (a part from those providing
 - education or running transport vehicles), and anyone seling- or. renting property.
 The 1993 Education Act imposes specific duties on local education authorities to
 make provision for the special educational needs of 'disabled children. Disabled
 rights groups continued to complain that the Government had declined to create an
 enforcement body for the Discrimination Act.
 Rights Now, a consortiun- of aver 50 independent-organizations campaigning for
 laws to end discrimination on the grounds of disability, reported that employers
 were 6 times more likely, to turn down a disabled person for.a job -interview than
 a nondisabled applicant with the -same qualifications. Rights-Now alsn reported that
 there are currently 400,00- to 450,000, people needing wheelchair-accessible homes,
 -but that only 80,000 such homes-are available. Although wheelchair accessibility at
 voting-sites improved since the 1992- elections' when 88-per, cent of the polling sta-
 tions were inaccessible -to physically disabled voters, 81 -per cent of the 1997 sites
 posed two or more access problems.(e.g., no wheelchair ramps,-or-voting booths that
 were too high) for wheelchair-bound voters.
 Access to buildings generally improved but remains inadequate. Many buildings
 and train stations are so old t at they do not- have elevators, although government
 -regulations require that all new-buildings meet the access requirements of all per-
 sons with impaired mobility. In 1992the Government promulgated.similar regula-
 tions for sensory-impaired persons, and.current regulations require that all taxis be
 wheelchair accessible by the year 2000.
 Religious Minorities.-Despite government efforts and the lowering of the overall
 unemployment rate in Northern Ireland in December to 7.8 per cent, the unemploy-
 ment rate for Catholic men in Northern Ireland remained twice that for Protestant
 men. ,The Fair Employment <Northern Ireland) Act of 1989, as amended, aims to
 end- even unintentional or indirect discrimination in the workplace, and a fair em-
 ployment tribunal adjudicates complaints. All public-sector employers and all pri-
 vate firms with over 10 workers must report annually to the Fair Employment Com-
 mission on the religious -composition of their work force, and. must review their em-
 ployment practices at -least once every 3.years. Noncompliance canbring criminal
 penalties and. loss of government- contracts. Victims of employment discrimination
 may sue for damages. While critics of the Act have asserted that its targets and
 timetables are too imprecise, most leaders of the Catholic community have praised
 it as a positive step.-In-'June the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights
 (SACHR) completed its review of the adequacy of the fair employment legislation
 and government policy in this area and made a significant nuiber of recommenda-
 tions to make them. more effective. At year's end the Government was continuing
 its review of these recommendations.
 There have been improvements in fair housing, education, and provision of goods
 and services, although, other than in Northern Ireland,, there.is no legislation to
 prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion.
 While active recruitment of Catholics by the Northern Ireland civil service has
 produced rough proportionality in overall numbers, the service acknowledges that
 Catholics remain significantly underrepresented in its senior grades. Service-wide
 employment cutbacks have thus far hampered efforts to overcome this imbalance.

 Government efforts to increase recruitment of Catholics into the police force (cur-
 rently 92 percent Protestant) and related security jobs in Nothern Ireland have been
 hampered by IRA killings and death threats as well as widespread antipathy in the
 Catholic community to the security forces. Prom 1994 to 1996, 76 Catholic officers
 were hired by the regular RUC, but the percentage of Catholics on the force re-
 mained virtually unchanged.
 At least six arson attacks were committed in Northern Ireland against Catholic
 churches and at least one against a Protestant church. Loyalists broke into a Catho-
 lic Church in Northern Ireland in December, breaking windows and various other
 articles, a not unusual practice, according to the priest there. A spring attack
 against a Mormon church was deemed an act of vandalism rather than a sectarian
 offense.
 According to the Institute for Jewish Policy research, the number of anti-Semitic
 incidents in Britain declined in 1996 (latest figures) for the third consecutive year.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Despite legal prohibitions against race dis-
 crimination, persons of African, South Asian, or traveler origin face occasional acts
 of societal violence and some discrimination. According to Human Rights Watch,
 from 1989 to 1996, the number of reported racial incidents rose from 4,383 to 12,199
 (a racial incident was defined as "any incident in which it appears to the reporting
 or investigating office that the complaint involves an element of racial motivation,
 or any incident that includes an allegation of social motivation made by any person,
 whether the victim or a third party"). Incitement to racial hatred is a criminal of-
 fense punishable by a maximum of 2 years' imprisonment. The Government strictly
 enforces the laws and regulations in this area. In October the Home Secretary an-
 nounced the Governments intention to add up to 2 years' additional prison time for
 those convicted of racially-motivated crimes. By year's end, the proposed legislation
 was moving through the Parliamentary process.
 A government-appointed but independent Commission for Racial Equality (CRE)
 provides guidelines on good practice, supports persons taking court action under the
 R   Relations Act of 1976, and may initiate its own court action. After investigat-
 ing a complaint, the CRE may issue a notice requiring that the discrimination be
 stoppd. The CRE monitors the response to such a notice for 5 years.
 An inqueat jury decided in February that black teenager Stephen Lawrence had
 been nawfully killed" by five white youths in an unprovoked, racially-motivated
 attack. There have been several unsuccessful attempts to convict the perpetrators.
 A public hearing into Lawrence's death is scheduled for early 1998.
 In March the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ex-
 pressed concern at the Government's delay in passing race relations legislation for
 Northern Ireland and highlighted apparent deficiencies in the proposed legislation.
 (Discrimination based on race is prohibited in the rest of the UK.) In August the
 Government passed the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997, which for
 the first time gives specific legal protection to minority ethnic gioups there, includ-
 ingthe traveler community.
 In September the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture met with
 lawyers and prison officials. The Committee investigated, among other issues, the
 disproportionate numbers of detalned or incarcerated minorities dying or injured
 while in police custody (see Section l.a.). In 1996 the U.N. Committee on the Elimi-
 nation of Racial Discrimination had noted with serious concern that among the vic-
 tims of death in custody were a disproportionate number of members of minority
 groups; that :police brutality appeared to affect members of minority groups dis-
 proportionately; that allegations of police brutality and harassment were reportedly
 not vigorously investigated; and that perpetrators, once guilt was established, were
 not punished appropriately.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form and join unions, and
 the Government respects this right in practice. Unions participate freely in inter-
 national organizations, and are free of government control. Like employers' associa-
 tions, they must have their accounts certified by the Government. Senior union offi-
 cers must be elected by secret ballot. Additionally, the law mandates secret ballots
 before a strike call, prohibits unions from disciplining members who reject a legal
 strike call,n  allows members to lodge complaints against their union with a gov-
 ernment-appointed commissioner.
 No specific statutory "right to strike" exists, and voluntary cessation of work may
 be considered a breach of contract. A system of legal immunities from prosecution
 for unions engaged in lawful industrial action was narrowed by acts of Parliament
 in the 1980's. These acts exclude secondary strikes and actions judged to have politi-
 cal motives; unions encouraging such strikes are subject to fines and seizure of their
 
 
 1389
 assets. The legislation also tightly restricts the ability of unions to act against sub-
 sidiaries of prume employers with which they are in dispute when the subsidiaries
 are.not party ta the dispute~and are the employers of record.
 In 1993 the Council-of Europe (COE)-deterrnined that British labor law violated
 the European Social Charter'by .permitting'anemployer to. dismiss all employees
 who take part in a strike- and then, after 3 months, to rehire them selectively. The
 Council requested that the British Government notify it of the measures to be taken
 to remedy this defect. The- new Government is- in- the process of reexamining this
 question, with proposals.to be published in early 1998 in a White Paper entitled
 "Fairness at Work."
 It is illegal to deny employment on the groundg that the applicant is not a union
 member. The Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act of 1993 set new pro-
 cedural requirements for union strikes, dues collection, and membership rules. It
 also made it possible for private citizens, when deprived of goods or services due
 to strike action, to seek damages and to obtain assistance in this effort from the
 government. The Trade Unions Congress (TUC) in 1993 lodged complaints with the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) on various provisions of the 1993 Act (see
 Section 6.b.). In 1995 the House of Lords upheld a provision of the Employment Pro-
 tection Act of 1978, as amended by the Employment Act of 1988, allowing employers
 to offer workers financial inducements to give-mp union-representation. In 1996 the
 Committee of-Experts of the ILO found -this law to be in substantial violation of
 Convention 98 on the right to organize and bargain- collectively and asked the UK
 to amend its legislation. The new Government is in the process of examining this
 recommendation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Employers have no legal obli-
 gation to bargain with workers' representatives. However, the new Government
 pledged to pass a law requiring such bargaining in work places where there is a
 majority of worker support. While labor-management contracts are not enforceable
 in the courts, collective bargaining is longstanding and widespread, covering about
 40 percent of the work force.
 Workers who -believe themselves to be victims of antiunion discrimination may
 seek redress through industrial tribunals. Remedies available include payment of
 indemnities and reinstatement.
 Contrary to ILO Convention 98, UK employers or others may lawfully circulate
 blacklists of union members seeking employment. In 1993 the ILO concluded that
 the Government was obliged to protect union members from such discrimination. At
 year's end, the Government was considering its response to this finding.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding that performed by children, is prohibited and is not practiced, although the
 ILO has raised questions about the situation in privatized prisons.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.--School at-
 tendance until age 16 is compulsory. Children under age 16 are not permitted to
 work in an industrial enterprise except as part of an educational course. Forced and
 bonded child labor is prohibited, and the Government effectively enforces this prohi-
 bition.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-No legislated minimum wage exists, but the
 new Government pledged. to institute one in early 1998. Nor does any legislation
 limit daily or weekly working hours, but new laws to bring the UK into compliance
 with the European Union's 48-hour workweek directive were expected by year's end.
 The Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 stipulates that the health and safety
 of employees not be placed at risk. A Health -and Safety Commission effectively en-
 forces regulations on these matters and may initiate criminal proceedings in appro-
 priate cases. Workers' representatives actively monitor enforcement of the Act.
 orkers can remove themselves from hazardous conditions without risking loss of
 employment, as provided in the European Union framework directive on safety and
 health.
