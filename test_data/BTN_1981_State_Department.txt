 BHUTAN*
 Bhutan is a Buddhist kingdom of some 18,000 square
 miles, bordering India and China, with a population of
 around one million. During the rule (1952-72) of King
 Jigme Dorji*Wangchuck, Bhutan began to emerge from
 centuries of medieval seclusion and progressed towards a
 more representative political system. Although the King
 retained strong executive powers, he created several
 important institutions such as the national assembly
 (1953), the :royal advisory council (1965) and the
 council of ministers (1968) to provide broader
 participation in the government. Serfdom was abolished,
 land reform introduced, codification of laws begun, and
 the judiciary separated from the executive. The present
 monarch, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, has continued Bhutan's
 social and political evolution. Bhutan maintains
 diplomatic relations only with India and Bangladesh.
 Bhutan is a sovereign and independent nation, but under
 a 1949 treaty Bhutan has.agreed to be guided in the
 conduct of its foreign affairs by India.
 There has been little change in the human rights
 situation in Bhutan since 1980.
 1.     Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 b. Cruel,.Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 c. Disappearances
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Bhutan has no written constitution and justice is
 administered under traditional law, which is in the
 process of codification and revision. While Bhutan's
 legal system does not provide for juries or the right to
 be represented by legal counsel, trials are generally
 expeditious and public; qualified observers judge that
 *Bhutan does not maintain diplomatic relations with the
 United States, and American officials rarely travel
 there. Information on Bhutanese practices in connection
 with human rights matters is therefore neither readily
 available nor complete.

 they conform to the local population's concept of
 impartiality and justice. Approximately 25 percent of
 Bhutan's population is of Nepalese origin. In ethnic
 Nepali areas, traditional Hindu law is administered,
 while Buddhist norms obtain in other regions of
 Bhutan.There is no evidence of resort to cruel, inhuman
 or degrading punishment or treatment. Bhutanese
 society, largely agrarian and traditional, is peaceful
 and enjoys a very low crime rate. Punishment for most
 crimes ranges from fines to imprisonment. The death
 penalty has been abolished. There is no special or
 preventive detention in Bhutan, and arrests can be made
 only under legal authority. (Representatives of the
 Dalai Lama have in the past alleged that some members of
 the Tibetan exile community in Bhutan have been
 subjected to arbitrary arrest and torture. No
 disinterested sources have verified this allegation.)
 2.    Respect for Civil and Political Rights,
 Including:
 a.    Freedom of speech and assembly
 The only publications in Bhutan are a weekly and a
 monthly government journal. India has agreed to assist
 Bhutan in constructing a radio transmitter for a
 national radio station. Indian and other foreign
 newspapers and publications are allowed free access.
 Although Buddhism is the state religion, members of
 other faiths, mainly Hindus of Nepali origin, enjoy
 freedom of worship. Criticism of the king, an
 hereditary monarch, is permitted in the national
 assembly, but civil and political liberties are not
 guaranteed in a written constitution.
 b.    Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Bhutan for Bhutanese
 citizens and no bar on emigration or foreign travel.
 However, permanent residence for Nepalis and Indians in
 Bhutan (except those in governmment service) is
 restricted to the southern hill region. Bhutan
 traditionally has welcomed refugees and exiles from
 other countries in the region.
 Some 4,000 Tibetan refugees sought refuge in Bhutan
 after 1959,, joining approximately 2,000 Tibetans already
 in the country. Because it perceived threats to
 national security resulting from the Tibetan refugees'
 lack of allegiance to Bhutan, the Bhutanese Government
 required in 1979-80 that the Tibetans either accept
 Bhutanese citizenship or face expulsion. When India and
 other countries initially refused to accept the
 Tibetans, Bhutan's policy raised the possibility of
 forcible repatriation. However, no such repatriation
 took place. In 1979, there were approximately 3,000
 Tibetan refugees who did not wish to accept Bhutanese
 citizenship. The government of Bhutan assured the
 Tibetans who accept citizenship that they would always
 be free to return to their homeland whenever they so
 ohoose.

 C.    Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 There are no political parties in Bhutan and their
 formation appears to be discouraged. The 150-member
 national assembly is made up of 100 members elected on a
 limited franchise (heads of family in Hindu areas,
 village headmen in Buddhist regions), 10 elected by
 organization of lamas (Buddhist leaders), 2 elected
 by the business community, and the remainder appointed
 by the king. Though the king's executive powers
 predominate in government, the assembly enacts laws,
 approves senior appointments, and advises the king on
 matters of national importance. It also provides a
 forum for ventilating grievances and rectifying cases of
 maladministration. The king cannot veto legislation
 passed by the national assembly, although he can refer
 bills back to it for further consideration. Local
 administration is carried out by centrally appointed
 government officials, villages, however, have the
 traditional right to elect their own headmen, who form
 the lowest rung of the administrative hierarchy.
 3.    Government Attitudes and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental
 Investigations of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 As far as is known, no international agency or group has
 either sought or been denied entry into Bhutan to
 investigate alleged violations of human rights. No
 non-governmental human rights groups are known to exist
 in Bhutan.
 4.    Economic and Social Circumstances
 The vast majority of Bhutan's population is illiterate,
 rural, and follows traditional agricultural and pastoral
 pursuits in a largely non- monetized economy. Virtually
 all families own enough land to feed and clothe
 themselves adequately by local standards. While poverty
 exists in remote areas, the destitution sometimes found
 in other parts of the sub-continent is absent in
 Bhutan. The government has set land taxes low enough
 not to burden even small land-holders. It has abolished
 the traditional and substantial payment in kind by local
 populaces to monastic organizations  Under successive
 five-year development plans begun in 1961, Bhutan has
 improved its agriculture, roads and freight ropeways,
 communications, education and health.
 Although comprehensive economic and social statistics do
 not exist, world Bank and AID figures do give some
 indication of Bhutan's development over the last 20
 years. Bhutan is one of the world's least developed
 nations, with an annual per capita income in the 1970's
 of only 80 dollars. Life expectancy at birth has risen
 from 36 years (in 1960) to 44 years (in 1979). During
 those same years, infant mortality rate (1-4 years) for
 Bhutanese children has dropped from 30 to 27 per 1000
 live births. Estimated net population growth has risen
 from 2 to 2.1 percent. Smallpox has been eradicated,
 and programs launched to control malaria, tuberculosis,

 leprosy and goiter. Bhutan receives some financial and
 technical assistance through the United Nations
 Development Program and the Colombo Plan. The number of
 schools and of pupils has risen sharply in recent
 years. Primary education is free, and higher level
 students often receive free board and lodging. Adjusted
 primary school enrollment (1978) shows a four-fold
 increase over 1960. However, only 12 percent of the
 children attend primary school, and boys outnumber girls
 by two to one.
 There are few social and economic indicators available
 to serve as a statistical basis for the status of
 females in Bhutanese society. Under Bhutanese law, no
 distinction is made between the status of men and
 women. The general impression given by the literature
 on Bhutan suggests that the society and economy is
 relatively egalitarian for a traditional society.
