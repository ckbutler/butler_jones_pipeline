 GUATEMALA
 Guatemala remained under a de facto military Government in
 1983. On August 8, military officers ousted General Efrain
 Rios Montt, who had become President in March 1982, and General
 Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, Minister of Defense, was
 designated Chief of State.
 Serious human rights problems continued in Guatemala in 1983,
 but there were improvements in some important areas. Most
 importantly, reports of violence and political deaths,
 especially in the countryside, continued but registered a
 significant drop compared to levels in 1982. Also, in March
 the Rios Montt Government announced a 60-day amnesty for the
 guerrillas. The Rios Montt Government, however, maintained
 some restrictions on civil and political liberties, including
 freedoms of the press and association, and continued to operate
 the controversial special courts which had been established to
 try individuals charged with crimes against the state or public
 order.
 After the new Government of General Mejia assumed power on
 August 8, it ended the state of emergency, under which
 political and civil liberties had been restricted, abolished
 the special courts, announced a 90-day amnesty on August 11,
 and then extended it in November for 60 more days. However,
 incidents of politically related disappearances increased
 somewhat after August, although they remain well below the
 1980-1982 period.
 The Rios Montt Government revised the law governing political
 parties and established a Supreme Electoral Tribunal to
 supervise Constituent Assembly elections in 1984 and subsequent
 national elections. Under the new law, 37 groups have formed
 committees which have begun pursuing the required procedures to
 register themselves formally as political parties on the ballot
 for the Constituent Assembly elections. The date for these
 elections was announced by Rios Montt as July 1, 1984, and was
 reconfirmed by General Mejia. A draft electoral law was issued
 in December 1983. The Mejia Government has also announced that
 it will hold national elections and transfer power to an
 elected civilian government in 1985 after the Constituent
 Assembly drafts a new constitution.
 Both military governments in power during the year cooperated
 with human rights investigators.
 Guatemala continued to suffer from a guerrilla conflict in
 which four distinct Marxist-Leninist guerrilla groups sought to
 overthrow the Government. Nevertheless, the Government made
 significant gains in reestablishing control over extensive
 areas where the guerrillas had been previously entrenched. For
 much of the year guerrillas were concentrated in the western
 highlands. The Government countered them in part by providing
 to rural Indian communities the alternative of limited amounts
 of food and shelter, along with work and security, rather than
 violent warfare, which association with the guerrilla groups
 entailed.
 The military also established a Civil Defense patrol system
 that totaled an estimated 700,000 members and was still
 expanding in late 1983. This self-defense force assumed much
 of the burden for making local communities secure against
 attack, while at the same time patrolling to search for and
 (577)
 
 
 578
 engage guerrillas. The patrols themselves became targets of
 the guerrillas. Although service in Civil Defense patrols is
 voluntary, members were frequently pressured into joining. UN
 Special Rapporteur Lord Colville said in his November 1983
 report that "where recruitment was needed and a man was
 reluctant, he was more likely to be shamed into joining by his
 community than compelled." There have been credible reports of
 incidents in which the patrols abused their authority and
 participated in illegal killings. However, Lord Colville
 concluded that these patrols generally functioned properly.
 One Agency for International Development (AID) contract
 employee, two employees of the Ministry of Education, and the
 mother of one of the latter were killed following their
 detention by security forces in February. The Government
 failed to provide an accounting of these killings that was
 fully consistent with well-known facts.
 Besides continuing their military operations in rural areas,
 the guerrillas also returned to urban terrorism in 1983. In
 September, for example, they exploded a powerful bomb in
 Guatemala City along a major thoroughfare, destroying a
 telephone facility. Overall, guerrilla activities have
 increased since the August 8 change in government.
 Guatemala is primarily an agricultural country. Commercial and
 peasant agriculture together comprise the leading economic
 sector in terms of output, employment, and foreign exchange
 earnings. While the country has experienced substantial
 economic growth during the past 30 years, this growth has
 accentuated the contrast between the modern sector and the
 largely Indian rural population, which has experienced
 relatively little economic progress. Between these two groups
 there has existed traditional animosity which has resulted in
 violence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Approximately 1,600 persons are believed to have been killed
 for political reasons in 1983, less than half the number of
 persons estimated to have been killed for these reasons in
 1982. Of this total, approximately 500 were civilians while
 the other 1,100 were military and guerrilla casualties. Most
 of the deaths attributable to the Government were guerrillas
 killed by security forces in combat. It is not clear who was
 responsible for each of the estimated 500 civilian deaths,
 although some were persons clandestinely arrested and then
 killed by Guatemalan security forces. A few others were
 persons killed by members of the Civil Defense forces who
 charged that the victims were guerrilla supporters. Some of
 the civilian deaths were attributable to the guerrillas.
 Reports of massacres and other atrocities continued. However,
 there was a dramatic decline in reports of violence and
 political deaths in the countryside, in sharp contrast to 1982
 when there were many allegations of abuses against Guatemala's
 Indian population, some of which were confirmed. Most of the
 
 
 579
 alleged incidents reported in 1983 occurred in isolated areas
 of the western highlands where Guatemalan Government forces
 continued to engage hostile guerrillas. Some reported
 incidents were investigated at the site and determined to have
 been exaggerated or false.
 UN Special Rapporteur Lord Colville in his report said that
 some stories of massacres were "intentionally selective" and
 called one report a "total fabrication." He cited the
 widespread allegations that a massacre took place in the
 village of Parraxtut in Quiche on December 22, 1982. An onsite
 investigation by reliable foreign observers determined that no
 massacre had taken place. Lord Colville also concluded that
 the Civil Defense patrols generally functioned correctly and
 denied that there was a government genocide campaign directed
 at the Indian population.
 There was another report in 1983 of the slaughter by the
 Guatemalan military of 100 peasants in Xoraxaj, Quiche. The
 first report of this alleged massacre was published by a
 Canadian human rights group. Later, a proguerrilla publication
 printed the same story. An onsite investigation by diplomatic
 officials proved the story to be false; no massacre had taken
 place. Indeed, the villagers stated that their major problem
 was roving guerrilla bands.
 Nevertheless, Government security forces, including the Army,
 were responsible for an unspecified number of arbitrary deaths
 and disappearances in 1983. One notable case resulted from the
 detention of Patricio Ortiz Maldonado, a Guatemalan employee of
 an American company holding an AID contract for work with the
 Ministry of Education. He, two employees of the Ministry of
 Education, and the mother of one of the employees were detained
 on February 9 by a military patrol and, according to a press
 communique issued by the Ministry of Defense on March 8, were
 killed by rifle fire while attempting to escape down a river
 bank. The circumstances concerning this incident have never
 been clarified, and the explanations offered by the Government
 have been contradictory and not fully consistent with other
 aspects of the known record.
 Three other apparently politically related killings in November
 received considerable attention. On October 7, Maria Julieta
 Esperanza Sanchez Castillo, a Ministry of Education employee,
 and her adult daughter, Piedad Esperanza Barrios Sanchez, were
 abducted by unidentified armed men. Jose Felipe Ralac Xiloj,
 an anthropologist/linguist working on a project to improve
 bilingual primary education, disappeared on or about October 18
 together with his wife, Celia Chet de Ralac.  On November 11
 the bodies of Sanchez Castillo and Ralac were found in a
 burned-out automobile and that of Barrios Sanchez next to the
 car. 'The whereabouts of Celia Chet de Ralac is unknown.
 Although the Guatemalan Government has maintained that the
 three persons died in an automobile accident after a trip to
 Mexico, there are major discrepancies in this explanation which
 raise serious questions as to the possible involvement of
 members of the Guatemalan security forces in these deaths.
 There were four self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninist guerrilla
 groups operating in Guatemala during 1983 dedicated to the
 violent overthrow of the government. These groups are the
 Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms, the Guerrilla
 
 
 580
 Army of the Poor, the Rebel Armed Forces, and the Guatemalan
 Communist Party. The four groups are nominally under an
 umbrella command, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union.
 Many of the victims of the guerrilla violence were members of
 the Government security forces, but the guerrillas continued
 killing municipal workers, farm owners and managers, and other
 civilians. In September in several towns in the department of
 Quiche, guerrilla ambushes of military vehicles killed civilian
 bystanders. In May, villagers near the Mexican border in Agua
 Zarca, Huehuetanango, fought off a band of guerrillas; four
 villagers were killed. Villagers near Xeabaj, Quiche, also
 reported in April that guerrillas had killed 13 people in and
 around the small farms near their village.
 Killings were also committed by some of the 700,000 members of
 the Civil Defense patrols, sometimes in clashes between
 neighboring patrols or between Civil Defense members and
 civilians over land disputes and personal vendettas. In one
 case, a Civil Defense patrol killed 25 men between May and
 August near Chichicastenango, El Quiche, allegedly because the
 victims had had connections with the guerrillas. There were
 also reported incidents where military personnel turned over
 guerrillas or suspected guerrillas to Civil Defense patrols for
 summary punishment.
 There is no evidence that the Government has punished members
 of the security forces for arbitrary killings. However, it has
 tried to increase awareness of human rights among the military.
 The military academy, for instance, has integrated human rights
 concerns into its curriculum.
 Often it is not clear who was responsible for some of the deaths
 that occurred in 1983. The guerrillas and the army on occasion
 used the same weapons, tactics, and uniforms in an effort to
 place blame on the other. Bodies also frequently appeared with
 no evidence of who was responsible for the murders or whether
 there were any political motives.
 b. Disappearances
 During the year more than 300 people disappeared. The majority
 of them have not reappeared and are presumed dead.
 After the Government of Rios Montt assumed power in March 1982,
 it disbanded several groups which had reportedly been
 responsible for disappearances during the previous regime of
 General Lucas Garcia. After General Mejia came to power in
 August 1983, there was an initial increase in the number of
 disappearances, but this trend reversed itself at the end of
 the year. These kidnappings were carried out by Guatemalan
 security forces, the guerrillas, private gangs demanding
 ransom, or narcotics traffickers. The security forces have for
 a long time taken suspects for questioning about subversive
 activities, while officially denying that they have done so.
 They have usually also denied knowledge of the whereabouts of
 the disappeared persons when family or friends inquired about
 them. People sometimes have disappeared either temporarily or
 permanently after business, family, or neighborhood rivals
 accused them of being subversives. In some instances, suspects
 have reappeared after they convinced their abductors that they
 had no connections with the guerrillas.
 
 
 581
 Many of the most notable disappearances occurred at the
 National University of San-Carlos. University officials
 charged that 45 persons disappeared between September 1982 and
 the overthrow of President Rios Montt in August 1983. Eight of
 these subsequently reappeared. The fate of the rest is
 unknown. University leaders charged that at least eight more
 victims disappeared after the August change in government.
 Some of these disappearances were widely attributed to
 Government security forces acting against suspected leftist
 sympathizers or their supporters.
 In 1983, the guerrillas abducted prominent businessmen, farmers
 and farm managers, a newspaper publisher, and the sisters of
 former President Rios Montt and of current Chief of State
 Mejia. One of the businessmen was killed by his captors,
 purportedly members of the outlawed Guatemalan Communist Party,
 after security forces discovered the house where he was being
 held. Another young businessman was killed by his captors in
 August after his ransom was not paid immediately.
 In August 1983, the Acting Archbishop of Guatemala announced
 that Spanish priest Carlos Perez Alonso had been captured,
 killed, and buried in 1981. This announcement was intended to
 end speculation that the Spanish priest was still alive. The
 Church conducted its own investigation and said that Perez
 Alonso had been "another victim of the 1979-81 period during
 which 12 priests, including foreigners, were killed."
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although Guatemalan civil and criminal codes expressly prohibit
 physical or mental torture, torture continues. The Guatemalan
 press has reported the discovery of bodies showing evidence of
 such treatment. In only a few-cases has the identity of the
 perpetrators been established, but it appears that torture is
 employed by many groups, including Guatemalan security forces.
 The Statute of Government, which guarantees individual rights,
 provides for the punishment of public officials or employees
 who engage in torture. Under the Government of General Rios
 Montt (March 1982-August 1983), military orders were issued
 that officers would be prosecuted if they practiced or condoned
 torture or degrading punishment. No one was ever prosecuted,
 however.
 There are also reliable reports that guerrilla groups resorted
 to torture and harsh treatment to prevent peasants from
 cooperating with the Government.
 The main prison, Granja Pavon, near Guatemala City was designed
 .to house 700 prisoners but currently contains about 2,100. In
 October prisoners went on hunger strikes, complaining mainly
 about the lack of decent food and overcrowding. There was no
 policy of physical punishment-of prisoners at Pavon or the
 other prisons. The treatment individual prisoners receive is
 based on their behavior, the crimes of which they were
 convicted, and whether they have money to buy extra food and
 incidentals.
 
 
 582
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 During 1983 the security forces were responsible for the
 arbitrary arrest of a number of persons for alleged involvement
 with leftist forces.
 The Statute of Government provides protection against arbitrary
 arrest or detention and provides that a person can only be
 detained on the basis of a warrant issued by a judge. During
 most of 1983, however, these rights were suspended in security
 cases under the provisions of a state of siege and later of a
 state of emergency. After General Mejia came to power in
 August, he lifted the state of emergency, abolished the special
 courts, and reinstated due process of law. Nevertheless,
 security forces continued to detain suspected subversives
 without warrants and to hold them for interrogation.
 e. Denial of fair public trial
 Guatemala's civil court system is headed and administered by
 the country's Supreme Court of nine members. Since the March
 1982 coup, the present justices of the Supreme Court have been
 named by the head of state. In general practice, however, the
 independence of the civil judiciary has been respected.
 Persons arrested have the right to legal counsel at all
 hearings, and lawyers are provided by the state if defendants
 cannot afford them. In practice, however, since the over-
 whelming majority of the country's lawyers reside in or near
 the capital city, it is difficult to retain legal counsel in
 the countryside.
 Defendants in some cases may be released after posting bail.
 Magistrates are charged with determining the guilt or innocence
 of the accused and, in addition to hearing from government
 prosecutors and private parties, may undertake their own
 investigations toward this end.
 The system of special courts established in July 1982 was
 abolished on September 1, 1983. Since proceedings in these
 courts were secret, there was widespread concern about the
 possible absence of due process. The courts were established
 principally because the Government believed that judges and
 their families were frequently threatened, thereby making it
 difficult to hold fair public trials for subversives or
 prominent criminals.
 In March 1983 eleven persons were executed by the Rios Montt
 regime after being convicted by the special courts. The Inter-
 American Human Rights Commission denounced the executions, as
 did many Guatemalan lawyers who were troubled by the apparent
 absence of due process.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the state of siege imposed in July 1982 was lifted in
 March 1983, a state of emergency was decreed in June. Under
 this decree the Government could restrict movement within the
 country, examine correspondence and private documents, and
 enter private residences without search warrants. Chief of
 State General Mejia lifted the state of emergency in August.
 
 
 583
 Government roadblocks were set up periodically along highways
 to check documents of travelers and carry out vehicle searches
 for kidnapped persons. Security forces have searched
 neighborhoods and entered homes without warrants looking for
 guerrilla safehouses or arms caches. Mail was randomly opened
 and examined even after the state of emergency was lifted.
 There is no organized system of Government neighborhood
 informers. Guerrilla groups killed a number of persons,
 however, whom they accused of being government informers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Under the Mejia Government, freedom of press and speech was not
 abridged by legal restrictions, and criticism of the Government
 did occur. The press was free to report on events and
 editorialize, although in practice a certain measure of
 self-restraint and self-censorship did limit the exercise of
 this freedom. Under the state of siege (June 1982 to March
 1983) and subsequently under the state of emergency (June 1983
 to August 1983), the Government enjoined the media from
 reporting on political news or guerrilla activities and from
 commenting on domestic politics.
 Despite the restrictions during the Rios Montt Government,
 criticism of the Government was expressed and opposition views
 were published. Since General Mejia assumed power, the media
 has regularly published opposition views and has focused on the
 need for guarantees for freedom of the press. The media,
 however, has generally refrained from editorial criticism of
 government policies.
 There was some violence against journalists during the year.
 Prensa Libre publisher Pedro Julio Garcia was kidnaped by the
 Guatemalan Communist Party on October 8. The kidnapers
 demanded the publication in the Guatemalan media of a party
 manifesto as one of the conditions for his release. The
 manifesto's publication on October 13 was in violation,
 however, of a 1963 law prohibiting the publication of
 subversive materials. To avoid a confrontation with the press,
 the Government repealed some articles of the law. Garcia was
 freed on October 22 after the kidnapers' demands had been met.
 Morales Mull, owner of Radio Fraternidad, a station in
 Quezaltenango, his son, and an employee, were murdered in May
 1983. Morales Mull, a Christian Democrat, had refused several
 times to broadcast propaganda materials of both the extreme
 left and right.
 The Guatemalan Government operates one television station and
 two radio stations. There are four privately owned television
 stations in the country and two independent television news
 programs which buy space on two of these stations. The
 privately owned radio stations also carry some independent news
 programs. In addition, six major daily newspapers are published
 in the capital, and the Government also publishes a daily which
 contains news items and official announcements and decrees.
 There are three major private universities and a fourth small
 one, in addition to the National San Carlos University.
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 38
 
 
 584
 San Carlos, with a student body of over 40,000, is autonomous.
 Persons associated with the University of San Carlos continued
 to be victims of disappearances and killings in 1983.
 There is no censorship of either local or foreign books.
 b. Freedom pf Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Statute of Government, issued in April 1982, restored the
 rights of petition, assembly, and political association.
 However, under the state of siege, in effect from July 1982 to
 March 1983, the rights of peaceful assembly and association
 were banned. The Government also had the authority to suspend
 the functioning of any group whose actions were deemed contrary
 to public order and security. The state of emergency declared
 in June 1983 again prohibited the publication of "politically-
 related news, manifestos, or declarations." It also suspended
 various provisions of the Statute including those dealing with
 freedom of travel, trade union activity, political activity,
 habeas corpus, and the right to petition the government.
 General Mejia lifted the state of emergency in August 1983,
 thus reinstating the freedoms which had previously been
 restored in the April 1982 Statute of Government.
 Officially, no political parties operated legally in Guatemala
 in 1983, but 37 groups have registered and begun meeting the
 requirements of the electoral law. With the ending of the
 state of emergency, restrictions on political activity were
 also removed. Political activity in areas of continuing
 guerrilla operations was considered by the groups to be
 dangerous, however.
 Only 10 to 15 percent of the Guatemalan labor force has ever
 been organized. According to government statistics compiled in
 May 1983, 645 unions were legally inscribed, but only 327 were
 active. The remainder were inactive because of the repression
 against left-wing unions by the Lucas Garcia Government prior
 to 1982 and also because of the declining economy.
 Trade union organizations run the gamut from the communist
 Autonomous Labor Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA) to the
 democratic Confederation of Trade Union Unity of Guatemala
 (CUSG) organized in May 1983 and legalized in November. The
 Confederation is composed of 11 federations (urban and rural)
 with 275 locals and approximately 100,000 members.
 In a September 22 press communique, FASGUA asserted that the
 disappearance and murder of two of its leaders in December 1982
 illustrated that the Guatemalan government did not permit
 "freedom of association." Four trade union leaders connected
 with extreme leftist unions have disappeared since December
 1982. Some of these disappearances have been brought to the
 attention of international labor organizations and are
 currently under investigation.
 The Statute of Government recognizes the right to strike in
 conformance with the labor code but only after negotiations and
 conciliation procedures have failed. These procedures make it
 difficult for a legal strike ever to take place. Moreover, the
 Government restricted normal trade union activities under the
 state of siege and the state of emergency. During that time,
 however, a decree law permitted the executive boards of legally
 
 
 585
 inscribed unions to remain in office and to negotiate collective
 bargaining agreements with employers.
 Trade unions and professional associations are free to maintain
 relations with international bodies. Guatemalan trade union
 confederations have been affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World
 Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), as well as with the Latin
 American Labor Confederation and the regional organizations of
 the ICFTU and WFTU.
 There are numerous professional and trade associations in
 Guatemala. Trade associations representing agro-industry,
 commerce, and industry have great political influence. There
 were no reports in 1983 of intimidation or persecution of any
 professional groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Statute of Government recognizes the individual's right to
 freedom of conscience and to the free exercise of religion.
 These rights are respected in practice. The Statute of
 Government also grants legal recognition to all denominations.
 At least 75 percent of the population adhere to the Roman
 Catholic faith. Many Indians. however, practice a religion
 which combines Roman Catholic tenets with elements of the
 traditional Mayan religion. Evangelical churches have grown
 rapidly, especially among Indians, and their followers number
 about 20 percent of the population. In addition, there is a
 small Jewish community.
 On November 7 unknown assailants murdered a Franciscan priest,
 Father Augusto Rafael Ramirez Monasterio, the first time a
 priest had been killed since the Lucas regime was overthrown in
 1982. Although some officials of the Catholic Church condemned
 the Government as responsible for the crime, no evidence came
 to light to substantiate this belief, and the Government denied
 involvement. There were no reliable reports that any clergy
 have been threatened since the death of Father Ramirez.
 However, on December 12, a Catholic seminarian was shot and
 killed by a Civil Defense patrol in Huehuetenango when he
 failed to heed a warning to stop. In late December an American
 priest in the Peten area was briefly detained by the Army,
 questioned, and released unharmed into the custody of the
 Church. In addition, on December 18 two evangelical pastors
 were kidnaped in the Peten area after preaching to a youth
 convention held in an area of intense guerrilla activity. They
 have not been heard from since, and no evidence has come to
 light regarding the identity of the perpetrators.
 Rios Montt was Guatemala's first evangelical president, and
 some of his closest advisors were also evangelicals. In 1983
 many leaders in the Roman Catholic Church began to complain
 that Protestants received preferential treatment from the Rios
 Montt Government. There were also allegations that many rural
 residents were being pressured to join, or to identify with,
 Protestant churches in their area as proof that they opposed
 the guerrillas. One of the principal reasons the military gave
 for its August 1983 coup was that "a religious, fanatical, and
 aggressive group, taking advantage of the positions of power
 held by its highest members, has used and abused the means of
 
 
 586
 government for its own benefit, ignoring the essential principle
 of separation of church and state." Evangelicals denied this.
 In testimony before the Inter-American Human Rights Commission,
 Roman Catholic officials charged that, under Rios Montt,
 immigration officials had blocked visas and work permits for
 Catholic religious workers from abrbad. In addition, Roman
 Catholic Church authorities said that under Rios Montt the army
 had burned, or appropriated and occupied, many of its churches
 --especially in El Quiche. Roman Catholic bishops also
 complained that many military commanders in the areas of
 fighting had granted permits for religious gatherings to
 Protestant evangelists but not to Roman Catholic missionaries.
 After the August 8 change in government, there were some
 Protestant complaints of harrassment by the authorities.
 Evangelicals charged that immigration officials were now
 blocking the entry of foreigners from their churches. Some
 Protestant churches claimed that their ministers and followers
 had been subject to intimidation by the National Police.
 Subsequently, the National Police declared that instructions
 had been sent to police chiefs throughout Guatemala ordering
 them not to interfere with any leaders of evangelical sects.
 While religious tensions between Roman Catholics and
 evangelicals increased in 1983, there does not appear to have
 been a deliberate pattern of discrimination against the Roman
 Catholic Church by the Rios Montt Government or against the
 evangelicals by the Mejia Government. Foreign Roman Catholic
 clergy and religious workers continued their work and travels
 within the country under the Rios Montt Government, and foreign
 evangelical clergy remained in Guatemala and continued their
 missionary work after General Mejia came to power. Scattered
 petty acts by minor officials against both Roman Catholic and
 evangelical clergy under the two governments have not hindered
 the free exercise of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 After declining in 1982 and the first half of 1983, guerrilla
 activity increased after the August change of military leaders.
 As a consequence, travel was not totally safe in all parts of
 such departments as Huehuetenango, San Marcos, Quiche, Alta and
 Baja Verapaz, Solola, and Chimaltenango. Usually military
 patrols were the targets, but buses and cars were also stopped
 and the occupants robbed.
 There were no restrictions imposed by the Government on foreign
 travel.
 Guatemalan Indians from areas of conflict continued to move
 back and forth across the Mexican border. The United Nations
 High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has estimated that there
 are approximately 35,000 displaced persons in Mexican camps.
 Others have claimed that there are hundreds of thousands, while
 the Guatemalan Red Cross, whose representatives toured the
 camps in Mexico, has estimated that there were only about
 13,000. A much smaller number of displaced persons was in
 Honduras. The Guatemalan Government's policy was to encourage
 the voluntary return of all refugees and to assist in their
 resettlement in their villages of origin, to the extent that it
 
 
 587
 was safe to do so. The Government has publicly offered to
 cooperate with the UNHCR in effecting repatriation from Mexico.
 UN Special Rapporteur Lord Colville said in his November 1983
 report on Guatemala that he believed that there was continuing
 contact with Guatemalan guerrillas and Guatemalan refugees now
 living in Mexican camps near the border. There have also been
 some reports that Guatemalan troops have crossed the border to
 enter these camps.
 In May, a relief organization associated with the Catholic
 Church estimated that there were 300,000 displaced persons
 within Guatemala. Although estimates vary widely, the best
 estimates place the number of displaced persons between 300,000
 and 400,000.
 Some persons, including professionals and members of the
 clergy, who had lived in voluntary exile before the Rios Montt
 Government took office in 1982, returned to the country in
 1983. It was charged that one labor activist who returned
 subsequently disappeared. Normal immigration continued, and
 exiles from other Central American countries were granted
 asylum in Guatemala.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In 1983 Guatemala continued to be ruled by a de facto
 military-controlled government. General Rios Montt ruled with
 the support of the group of junior officers who had started the
 March 1982 coup. Following the August 1983 military coup,
 General Mejia assumed the title of Chief of State, rather than
 that of President, and retained his position as Minister of
 Defense. Both civilians and military officers occupy
 ministerial posts in the Government, but the real basis of
 power is the Military Commanders Council.
 One of the main reasons Rios Montt was ousted was that members
 of the military reportedly believed that he was not committed
 to a date for a return to constitutional government. Rios
 Montt had set July 1, 1984, as the date for a Constituent
 Assembly election, but had not announced a timetable for the
 steps leading to an elected government and had not provided the
 budget resources necessary to finance the process. His
 Government did, however, issue a new political parties law, and
 it permitted the resumption of political organizational
 activities.
 General Mejia announced to the political groups on assuming
 office that the Government would honor the previously agreed
 dates of July 1, 1984, for holding Constituent Assembly
 elections, and September 15, 1984, for installing the new
 body. His actions since then point toward the carrying out of
 this pledge. The Constituent Assembly will be charged with
 drafting a new constitution but will not be empowered to act as
 a legislature or elect a provisional president. The current de
 facto military regime will continue governing the country until
 an elected government takes office. The Mejia Government
 promised that national elections for President and Congress
 will take place in 1985, although the Constituent Assembly is
 to set the exact election schedule.
 
 
 588
 The election process will be administered by a Supreme Electoral
 Tribunal, established in March 1983. Over 600,000 Guatemalans
 out of an estimated voting population of 3 million had
 registered to vote by December.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Throughout the year the Government of Guatemala permitted human
 rights groups to visit Guatemala to investigate the human rights
 situation. Government officials facilitated these visits by
 meeting with the representatives and allowing them to tour
 Guatemala without hindrance.
 During 1983, such visitors included delegations from the
 Unitarian-Universalist Service Committee, the Anti-Defamation
 League of B'nai B'rith, the European Parliament, the National
 Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States, Lutheran
 bishops, the American Anthropoligical Association, and Americas
 Watch. In September, the Guatemalan Vice Minister of Foreign
 Relations traveled to Europe and met with a chapter of Amnesty
 International in Belgium.
 The Government facilitated the visits of the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission Special Rapporteur on Guatemala,
 Viscount Colville of Culross, in June and November 1983. Lord
 Colville met with both government officials and numerous private
 citizens and visited rural areas to prepare a report on the
 human rights situation in Guatemala.
 In this report, which was transmitted to the United Nations
 General Assembly in November, Lord Colville specifically cited
 the cooperation and assistance given him by the Guatemalan
 Government. Lord Colville asserted that some allegations of
 massacres were without any foundation and noted that efforts
 were made by the Guatemalan military to curb and correct
 abusive behavior. The report pointed out that the Guatemalan
 Government had introduced a "credible program" to improve
 civil, political, and human rights, and that the Mejia
 Government had "indicated an intention to continue on this
 path." The report concluded that "in 1983 there has been a
 marked improvement" in the human rights situation, while
 recognizing that "the fundamental right to life has
 unquestionably been violated, even since March 1982, in
 circumstances where confrontation in the civil war cannot
 provide an excuse." The Special Rapporteur's report
 recommended that the "international community look with
 benevolence" on the Government's plans and projects as they
 affect human rights and "recognize the signs of a sincere
 intention to fulfill them."
 In October 1983, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
 published the results of its September 1982 investigation in
 Guatemala. Its major conclusions were that the Government of
 Guatemala had done nothing to prosecute those responsible for
 illegal executions prior to March 23, 1982; that fewer lives
 were lost under Rios Montt than under previous governments; and
 that the special courts condemned 15 men to death for crimes
 that did not justify the imposition of capital punishment. The
 Commission also stated that the guerrillas were responsible for
 many acts of violence in rural areas and that government
 
 
 589
 security forces also shared responsibility for such incidents.
 The Commission said that habeas corpus was not respected by the
 Government and that arbitrary detentions continued to occur at
 the hands of security forces. The report charged the government
 with conducting a campaign of torture, not only of individuals
 detained arbitrarily, but also of peasants suspected of
 collaboration with the guerrillas in rural areas. The report
 also discussed the plight of the thousands of displaced persons
 who had fled Guatemala and those within the country.
 In 1982, the International Labor Organization (ILO) Conference
 Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations
 removed Guatemala from a special citation reserved for countries
 that fail to comply with a ratified convention, in this case,
 Convention 87 on "Freedom of Association." Guatemala had been
 so cited for a number of years. In 1983, the Committee noted
 that, while Guatemala continued to make progress in its
 compliance with ILO conventions on organized labor, the ILO
 still had reservations. It did note, however, that Guatemala
 had removed the prohibition on the reelection of trade union
 leaders.
 At present, the ILO is investigating three complaints against
 Guatemala, all concerning the recent disappearances of trade
 union leaders.
 Freedom House in its 1983 report described Guatemala as "not
 free". In its 1983 report Amnesty International expressed
 concern that in 1982 there were widespread extrajudicial
 executions, arrests often without warrants, disappearances, and
 torture. Amnesty International concluded that official
 security units, sometimes in plain clothes, were responsible
 for the vast majority of abuses.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 While a few Guatemalans enjoy a high standard of living, the
 majority of the population of 7.8 million (mid-1983) lives in
 rural areas where peasant agriculture, seasonal agricultural
 labor, and cottage industry provide little more than basic
 necessities. The economic growth under a free enterprise
 economic system that raised the Gross National Product per
 capita to $1,141 in 1981, combined with the rapid population
 growth rate of 3.1 percent in 1983, has increased the gap
 between the modern and traditional sectors of Guatemalan
 society. The contrast involves race, language, and culture, as
 well as income. Employment dropped sharply from 1981 to 1983,
 and official figures stated that unemployment and under-
 employment were above 40 percent in 1983.
 In 1977 the calorie supply available for consumption was 92.2
 percent of nutritional requirements. Health services and
 sanitation are generally poor in rural areas. Despite
 considerable public investment in potable water projects,
 medical centers, and clinics, many in rural areas still do not
 have access to these services. In 1976, 40 percent of the
 total population, but only 14 percent of those in rural areas,
 had access to safe drinking water. The infant mortality rate
 was 62 per 1,000 live births in 1983, and the life expectancy
 at birth was 58.9 years in 1981.
 
 
 590
 The adult literacy rate may have increased from the figure of
 46.1 percent in 1973, but primary school enrollment in 1980 was
 still only 69 percent. Literacy is a particularly great problem
 in Guatemala because half the population are Indians who learn
 Spanish as a second language. The Government has initiated a
 bilingual education program to address the educational needs of
 the Indian populace and to attack the literacy problem.
 For the most part, the Government has not interfered with the
 Indian culture. While population growth, economic development,
 and other pressures are causing a steady drift away from the
 traditional Indian society, the incorporation of the rural
 Indian population into the political, economic, and social
 mainstream of the modern sector remains a difficult and slow
 process. This situation is made more difficult by the
 longstanding, traditional animosities which separate the
 Indians and the Ladinos, who are at least partly of European
 descent.
 Guatemala is a Latin society in which most women play the
 traditional roles of mother, household manager, and income
 provider in rural areas. There is no discrimination against
 women by law although de facto discrimination is rooted in
 centuries of cultural practice.
 Only 14 percent of women in Guatemala are considered to be
 employed in non-traditional labor markets. The vast majority
 of these work in the service sector as maids, cooks, or laundry
 women. In general, women occupy the lowest paying unskilled
 jobs. According to a 1978 study, women earn an average of 44
 percent less than do men working in comparable positions.
 The majority of Guatemalan women live in rural areas where they
 engage in cottage industries such as textile weaving, sell
 handicrafts and agricultural produce, garden and raise animals,
 and do agricultural field work. Their dominance in the textile
 industry has led one woman to be chosen secretary general of
 the National Federation of Textile Workers.
 It is estimated that one quarter of the students enrolled in
 Guatemalan universities are women. They generally study
 psychology, law, teaching, or nursing and go on to careers as
 health workers, teachers, or office workers. The number of
 women occupying professional and managerial positions is very
 small.
 Some women university graduates have risen to high positions.
 General Mejia appointed Isabel Tejada de Putzeys as Minister of
 Education, making her Guatemala's first woman cabinet
 minister. A woman also serves in the dual role as a member of
 Guatemala's Supreme Court and as Dean of the Law Faculty at
 Francisco Marroquin University, and other women serve as judges
 of lower courts, principally in the area of family law. The
 Council of State, an appointed national consultative body
 created by former President Rios Montt and abolished by Chief
 of State Mejia, included representatives of Guatemalan women's
 organizations and of the Indian population.
 The participation of women in politics has been limited. In
 1976, for example, it is estimated that only 16 percent of the
 eligible women voted. In the last 35 years, only three women
 have been elected to the National Congress, and women have not
 played major roles in the country's political parties.
 In 1973 it was estimated that 55 percent of all women in the
 country were illiterate, but this figure was 78 percent in
 rural areas. Over half the female population of Guatemala has
 not been educated and 94 percent of the women residing in rural
 areas had less than three years of schooling in 1978.
