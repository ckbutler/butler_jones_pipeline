 Finland is a constitutional republic, a democratic state built
 upon the principle of the rule of law. Sovereign power in
 Fipland rests with the people es represented by their
 de elat(s assembled in Parliament. Supreme executive power is
 vested In the President. The Cabinet, consisting of the Prime
 tinister and 16 ministers and responsible to Parliament, works
 .with the President in governing the country. Judicial power
 is"eerdised by an independent judiciary consisting of the
 Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court.
 The security .apparatus is controlled by elected'officials and
 supiervised by the courts.
 Finland has a mixed economy.with state-owned, privately owned,
 and publicly owned companies. Citizens are free to pursue
 their- lie imate private'interests, hold private property, and
 engage in economic activity without government interference.
 During 989 there were no reported violations in Finland of
 fundamental human rights. National minorities and women enjoy
 the ame economic and political rights as all other citizens.
 Finland joined the Councfl of Europe in May, and this event
 brought to light certain deficiencies in Finnish human rights
 legislation. During the next 2 years, Finland hopes to enact
 human rights legislation to meet the standards' prevailing in
 6ther European countries and to ratify the European Convention
 on Human JZights without, reservations.
 RESPECT FOR HU!AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extiajudicial Killing
 Ki.1ling for political'notives did not occur.
 b. Disappearancd
 There were no reported cases of disappearances, abduction, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 "Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or puniahment is guaranteed by law and is respected
 in practice. By law, prisoners must be treated justly with
 respect for their human dignity and without distinction on the
 basis of race, sex, language, nationality, religious or
 poli~ical conviction, social position, wealth, or any other
 g*edunds.
 d.' Arbitrary ArreSt, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment or exile is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. A reform of
 ptetrial procedures took effect on January 1, 1989. The
 stated purpose of the reform was to achieve uniformity with
 the practice in other Western countries. The law shortens the
 detention period to 7 days and gives the accused access to a
 lawyer during that time. The accused must be given a court
 hearing within 8 days of notification of the arrest, if in a
 
 
 1104
 city, or within 30 days, if in rural areas. The State pays
 legal fees for the indigent defendant.
 Circumstances surrounding the arrest are subject to judicial
 review at the time the accused is brought to trial. The
 accused may apply to the same court for civil damages for loss
 of freedom in the event the accused is found to have been
 innocent of the crime charged and the arrest is deemed invalid.
 The institutions of habeas corpus and bail do not exist as
 such in Finland. While those accused of serious crimes must
 by law remain in custody, those charged with minor offenses
 may be released on personal recognizance at the court's
 discretion.
 Preventive detention is authorized only during a declared
 state of war for narrowly defined offenses, such as treason,
 mutiny, and arms trafficking. Supervisory personnel from the
 Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior as well
 as the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of Justice
 have authority to enter prisons and to order the release of
 prisoners held without charges. Exile has not been used as
 punishment in Finland and, by law, Finnish citizens may not be
 exiled.
 Legislation with regard to conscientious objectors to
 Finland's obligatory military service took effect in 1987 for
 a trial period of 5 years. While Jehovah's Witnesses are
 exempted from military service under the law, other Finnish
 citizens must serve in the military or become conscientious
 objectors. The law abolished the Investigative Board--a
 controversial entity which decided unilaterally the status of
 conscientious objectors--and lengthened the alternative
 civilian service for conscientious objectors to 16 months,
 twice the minimum length of military service. The passage of
 the law is reportedly a result of the Investigative Board's
 increased disposition to reject a growing number of
 applications for civilian service in recent years. Under the
 old law, those who refused unarmed service within the defense
 forces and were not granted alternative civilian
 service--including Jehovah's Witnesses--went to jail. A
 reduction of the period of alternative service is under
 current discussion in Finland.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Finnish citizens and aliens legally
 residing in Finland have the right to effective counsel. The
 law provides that charges must be clearly stated and that
 civilians may not be tried by military courts except in time
 of war. There are no separate "security" courts.   Local
 courts may decide to conduct a trial behind closed doors in
 juvenile, matrimonial, and guardianship cases, or when
 publicity would offend morality or endanger the national
 security of the State. In national security cases, the judge
 may withhold information from the public pertaining to charges
 against individuals, verdicts, and sentencing. Sanctions may
 be imposed if such information is made public. Provisional
 tribunals are constitutionally prohibited.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy and the sinctity of the home, including
 prohibition of eavesdropping and mail tampering, are
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. The security
 police are subject by law to judicial scrutiny.
 Section Z Respect for Civl Liberties, Including:
 a. Freeddm of Speeb   and Prers
 Law and practice, an effective judiciary, an independent
 pfesp, and a funCtioning democratic pblitical system assure
 freedom of speech and press: There have been no instances of
 abuse or legal decisions restricting freedom of the press.
 The-press occasionally exercises restraint in treating issues
 deemed to be potentially harmful to the national interest, but
 is under no compulsion from the Government to do so. Full
 academic freedom prevails.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of pdaceful assembly and association is guarantbed by
 the Constitution. However, only'Finnish citizens'may
 associate with a group whose aim is to influence political
 issues. oPublic 'demonstrations require prior permission from
 the police.
 The Government encourages voluntary organizations and
 subsidizes private groups formed to achieve a public purpose.
 They are permitted to maintain relations with other
 internationaIVgroups in both Communist and Western countries.
 Organizations with more than one-third foreign membership
 require government permission to operate in Finland.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor uxfdins, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Finland ha's two state religions: Lutheran and Eastern
 Orthodox. Taxes are collected by the Government from members
 to support churches belonging to these religions. All other
 religious groups enjoy untrestricted" freedom of worship.
 Approximately 89 percent of'+he population bblongs to the
 Lutheran Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Finns are free to-bravel within the Nordic countries--Finland,
 Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland--without passports and
 need not abply for exit visas for travel to other countries.
 Over 200,000 Finns have emigrated t-o Sweden'in the past two
 decades--primariI  to -seek employment--and over one-half of
 them have since returned. No restrictions are placed on
 emigration or repatriation.
 Debate on the criteria used by the Finnish Government in
 deciding to grant political asylum continued in 1989. The
 Government maintains that, "in accordance with the Geneva
 Agreement, Finland grants asylum to individuals arriving (in
 Finland) who have the characteristics of refugees as
 determined by the Agreement." The Ministry of the Interior
 
 
 1106
 EFINLANDI
 categorically denies that any agreement exists with the Soviet
 Union regarding repatriation of would-be Soviet refugees.
 Finland has not turned back any citizen of the Soviet Union or
 a Communist country who has asked for asylum, although in some
 incidents over the past few years persons who unwittingly
 crossed over into Finnish territory have been returned.
 Decisions on who is a legitimate refugee are made by the
 Minister of the Interior. In the case of an economic refugee
 who does not wish to return to his home country and is not
 accepted as a refugee in Finland, the Finnish Government
 permits the refugee to apply elsewhere. Even economic
 refugees will not be forced to return to Communist countries
 if they ask to go elsewhere and are accepted by a third
 country. Finland does not grant asylum to people wishing to
 escape economic hardship.
 Current law does not define the grounds on which the applicant
 for political asylum may be repatriated. Guidance is provided
 by the U.N. Convention (and Protocol) Relating to the Status
 of Refugees, of which Finland is a signatory. Legislation has
 been proposed which will state less ambiguously the grounds
 for repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Finland is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which all
 citizens over the age of 18 are free to elect their
 representatives from among multiple lists of candidates
 representing a wide spectrum of political ideologies. The
 Finnish people freely choose by direct election a 200-member
 unicameral Parliament every 4 years. At present, there are
 seven political parties and a group of Greens represented in
 Parliament. Four of the parties form a so called "Red-Blue"
 coalition, headed by a Conservative Prime Minister. A reform
 of the presidential elections to change them in the direction
 of a direct popular vote was applied for the first time in the
 1988 election. Two ballots were cast, one for the favored
 presidential candidate, the other for an elector in case none
 of the presidential candidates received an absolute majority
 of the votes cast. In the latter case, an electoral college
 of 301 electors would conduct the final vote. Presidential
 elections are held every 6 years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Finland has not been the subject of an international
 investigation of alleged human rights violations. Within
 Finland, several organizations monitor human rights
 performance, including the Finnish Red Cross, the
 government-sponsored Equality Council, and the Women's Rights
 Union. A Finnish Helsinki Watch Group was established in July
 1985 but was not very active during 1989. In conjunction with
 ,the Swedish-language University in Turku, a Human Rights
 -Institute was founded in the spring of 1985 with the stated
 purpose of conducting human rights research, performing
 studies, and distributing information on human rights.
 Finland participates actively in international human rights
 organizations.

 .Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Religion, Sex,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food) shelter, education,.and hbalth care are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or-politipal opinion.
 Although fewer than 20,000 aliens live in Finland, instances
 of violence have been recorded against resident Vietnamese
 refugees in Helsinki. The Government has strongly condemned
 these acts.and has asked the police to.make a more-determined
 effort to apprehend the perpetrators.
 Lapps constitute less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the
 Finnish population. They benefit from legal provisions
 protecting minority rights ano customary practices. There is
 no discrimination in practice.
 The government-established Council for Equality coordinates
 and sponsors legislation to meet the needs of women as
 workers, mothers, widows, and retirees, In 1985 Parliament
 passed two bills concerning the status of women. The first
 "-was a Comprehensive Equal Rights Bill which mandates equal
 treatment for women in the workplace. The second was a Family
 Name Bill which permitted women to retain their maiden names
 after marriage as their only surname. The law also made it
 possible for a man to take his wife's name. The Government's
 Equality Ombudsman monitors compliance with regulations
 against sexualbdiscrimination...Of the few cases reported in
 1989, the most significant concerned a complaint that a man
 was elected to an office for which a woman may have been more
 competent-.
 The first shelter for female victims of violence was opened 10
 years ago. During 1988, 1,193 women (of which 79.9 percent
 were. married) were treated in 10 shelters throughout Finland.
 The. shelters also treated 70 men and two minors under the age
 of *8.. Some critics suggest that the number of actual cases
 may be greater than those reported Prosecution of
 - perpetrators of intxafamily violence is low--except in cases
 of aggravated assault--because of the propensity of Finns not
 to file complaints against family members.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions are constitutionally guaranteed the right to
 organize, assemble peacefully, and strike--rights which are
 respected in practice. They enjoy a protected status and play
 an important role in political and economic life. A
 1-million-member blue-collar confederation, the Central
 Organization of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), dominates the
 trade union movement.
 Three other central organizations cover white-collar,
 professional, and technical employees. All trade unions are
 democratically organized and managed and are independent of
 the Government. Finnish trade unions engage freely in Nordic
 and international labor activities.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively exists in law
 and practice and is exercised extensively. There are no
 
 
 1108
 export processing zones in Finland. Finland is a highly
 organized society in which more than 80 percent of both
 workers and employers are members of trade unions and
 employers' collective bargaining associations. With very few
 exceptions, all collective agreements since 1968 have been
 based on incomes policy agreements between central employees'
 and employers, organizations and the State. The central
 agreement covers the general level of wage and salary
 increases, other terms of employment, and a "social policy
 package" which provides for vacation, holidays, sick pay,
 maternity and paternity leave, travel costs, taxes, rents,
 etc. Workers are protected against antiunion discrimination.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and it
 is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 While the minimum age for employment in Finland is 18, there
 are some paid training/apprenticeship programs starting at age
 16. There is compulsory education legislation in Finland, and
 child labor is not a problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislated minimum wage in Finland although all
 employers--including nonufionized employers--are required to
 pay the minimum wages agreed to in collective bargaining
 agreements in their industrial sector. Collective bargaining
 agreements provide minimum wages of about $9 per hour, which
 is adequate to ensure a family a decent living. The standard
 legal workweek must not exceed 40 hours in Finland.
 Extensive legislation protects the worker's health and safety
 and ensures reasonable working conditions. All aspects of
 Finnish labor law are effectively monitored and enforced by
 the Ministry of Labor. Compliance with labor legislation is
 effected through the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and
 the National Board of Labor Protection. Regional and local
 supervision is delegated to 11 labor protection districts,
 each employing several inspectors.
