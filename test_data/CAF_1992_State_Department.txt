CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 General Andre Dieudonne Kolingba took power in the Central African Republic
 (C.A.R.) in a bloodless 1981 coup. He has since exercised virtuall full poitic con-
 trl under the 1986 ConstitutioD, which prvides for the Central African Democratic
 Assembly party (RDC) to be the sole legal p arty. During 1992 the President contin-
 ued his attempt to control political reform by calling a Grand National Debate con-
 ference to draft a new constitution and by holding early presidential and legislative
 elections. Of the 19 new parties, 15 refused to participate in the Grand Debate, ad-
 vocating instead a national conference and a transitional democratic government.
 However, the opposition did participate in the October 25 elections, which resulted
 in a high turnout and an apparent rejection of Kolingba. The Government, acting
 through the Supreme Court, had the elections annulled on the basis of fraud, most
 of which appeared to have been sponsored hy the Government. President Kolingba
 continued to rule, laely by decree, under a controversial interpretation of the Con-
 stitution and named a new caretaker government headed by Prime Minister
 Timothee Malendoma, with 9 of 20 cabinet members drawn from opposition political
 groups. Presidential and leg lative elections were scheduled for Febay 1993.
 The Ministryr of Defensehas 4,000 military and 1,200 national gendarmerie per-
 sonnel under its control. These forces share internal security responsibilities with
 the civilian police force, which operates under the Ministry of Public Security. Presi-
 dent Koling a con tro a 1,200-man presidential security force led by 50 French ad-
 visers. The C.R.'s total military expenditures for 1989, the lastyear for which the
 U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were
 approximatel $18 million. There are no announced plans concerning future military
 expenditure oevels, but, given the lack of government revenues, it is likely that ex-
 penditures could decrease. The military and the police were responsible or human
 righs abuses in 1992 (see Section l.a. and i.e.).
 th CA.R. is a landlocke  ad sparsely populated country, and most of its inhab-
 itants practice subsistence agriclture. The principal agricultural exports are coffee,
 cotton, timber, and tobacco. Diamonds comprise the most important mineral export.
 Economic structural reforms begun in 1992 in cooperation with international donors
 have had little success because of unfavorable world economic trends and govern-
 ment corruption and mismanagement. Sweepingpublic strikes that lasted 8 months
 ended in December 1991, but sporadic strikes of varying size, protesting salary ar-
 rears and the slow pace of political liberalization, continued in 1992.
 Although the political dialog was extended in 1992 to opposition parties, the ef-
 forts of the Kolingba regime to control the democratic reform process resulted in a
 series of human rights abuses throughout the year, including arbitrary arrest and
 detention of political opponents and workers, interference in the judicial p rocess,
 and abridgements of freedoms of speech, assembly, and worker rights. The Govern-
 ment jailed for 6 to 8 months two political activists and a journalist for "insulting
 the President." Security forces killed one person and injured several others while
 breaking up a demonstration of opposition and labor union organizations on August
 1. The annulment of the October 25 presidential and legislative elections prevented
 the installation of a new government democratically elected by the Central African
 people, thus negating much of the promise of the previous year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Kiling.-On August 1, security forces killed
 opposition political activist Dr. Jean-Claude Conjugo-Batoma during a demonstra-
 tion pretesting the opening of the Grand National Debate. The opposition claimed
 he was personally targeted by his attackers because of an article and cartoon he
 published that were critical of President Kolingba. The Government stated that it
 had ordered a special inquest into the incident, but no report on the affair had been
 released by year's end.
 
 
 A government-promised inquest into the 1990 killing by security forces of Pierre
 Wanga, who had been arrested and accused of the murder of presidential advisor
 Bernard Kowada, was not carried out in 1992. In addition, as far as was known,
 no disciplinary action was taken against those responsible for the death or the beat-
 ings of three others associated with Wanga.
 Security forces reportedly shot to death two persons in the Western city of
 Berberati on October 25 during disturbances provoked by the sabotage of the elec-
 tions. The Government did not publicize this incident and released no public ac-
 counting of what occurred or who was responsible for the shooting.
 There were credible but unsubstantiated reports of summary execution of highway
 bandits in the north central and northwest parts of the country. The Government
 denied it had implemented or supported a policy of summarily executing bandits,
 claiming that a recently created ofice to combat banditry respects human rights
 norms. As in past years, at least two prisoners in Bangui held on charges of witch-
 craft were burned to death by an angry mob when authorities were unwilling or un-
 able to provide for their security.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of politically motivated dis-
 appearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code prohibits torture and specifies sanctions for those found guilty of
 physical abuse. Nevertheless, credible reports of routine police beatings of criminal
 and political suspects continued to surface. Clement Beibanga, an opposition party
 activist arrested for antiregime activity, was beaten by members of the Autonomous
 Armored Squadron, the President's personal military unit. No sanctions were meted
 out to those responsible.
 d. Arbitra  Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Central African law stipulates that per-
 sons detained in nonpolitical cases must be brought before a magistrate within 96
 hours. In practice this deadline is often not respected, in part due to inefficient judi-
 cial procedures. Political detainees may be held legally without charge for up to 2
 months. In the C.A.R. judicial system, bail does not exist, but sometimes persons
 are released on their own recognizance.
 In 1992 the Government held teachers, labor leaders, and opposition supporters
 for varying periods on charges of being a threat to state security. The authorities
 arrested four teachers for antigovernment political activity in the President's home
 region in April; they were subsequently released. The authorities also arrested brief-
 ly four opposition figures for participating in an Augst 1 demonstration against the
 Grand National Debate, including Aristide Sokambi, President of the Association for
 Democracy and Development. Similarly, on August 20 the Government detained
 briefly Clement Belibanga, an opposition party activist.
 Three Sudanese nationals, Hafiz Abdel Galfl, EL Rayh Ahmed and Mohammed
 Zein Hassan, have been held in Ngaragba Prison without charge or trial since
 March 1990, reportedly for refusing to pay a bribe to a local official, in spite of their
 attorneys' attempts to bring the case to trial.
 Because of government secrecy, the number of political detainees held at any one
 time was not known. It was believed that most political detainees had been released
 by the end of the year.
 Exile is not permitted by law and does not occur in practice. A number of political
 opponents have left the country to avoid government sanctions, but the Government
 has repeatedly stated that any person in self-exile for strictly political reasons, rath-
 er than criminal, may return without fear of persecution. Ange Patasse, who had
 been in self-exile since 1982 returned October 15 and participated in the elections
 as a presidential candidate. ihe best known remaining self-exiles are Rodolph Iddi-
 Lala, currently believed to be in Togo, and student leader Cyrus Sandy, presently
 in Cameroon.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary consists of regular and military
 courts, with the Supreme Court at the apex. In common criminal cases, the accused
 have the right to legal counsel, trials are public, and defendants have the right to
 be present at their trials. These safeguards are respected in practice except in those
 cases where the Government believes that a suspect threatens state security.
 The judiciary suffers from executive interference, institutional neglect, inefficient
 administration of the law, and a shortage of trained personnel and material re-
 sources. The authorities did not allow Mamadou Sal orWalidou Bachir legal coun-
 sel during their trials (see below). There are also often delays in political cases. For
 example, opposition leader Joseph Bendounga's appeal before the High Court of Jus-
 tice in September was apparently delayed a week to ensure that he would not be
 able to benefit from preelectoral media access for opposition political parties.
 The number of political prisoners, as distinguished from political detainees, held
 at the end of the year was not known. The Government released a number of noliti-
 
 
 cal prisoners during the year, including: Joseph Bendounga, who had served 5
 months of a 6 month sentence for insulting the President in an antiregime state-
 ment; Walidou Bachir, a Muslim who had-been sentenced to 8 months in jail for
 accusing the Government of summarily executing Central African Muslims for high.
 way banditry; and Ben Mamadou Sall, a Senegalese journalist who had been sen-
 tenced to 6 months in jail for writing articles accusing high-level officials of corrup-
 tion.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government rarely abused legal prohibitions on invasion of the home without a war-
 rant in civil and criminal cases. However, in suspected political and security cases,
 police are statutorily permitted to search private property without written author-
 ization and do so in practice. The Government maintains a close watch on citizens
 suspected of opposition activity, including by telephone monitoring. The RDC vigi-
 lance committees, which operated in 1991 to combat local crime, were not active in
 1992.
 Civil servants are not required to join the ruling RDC, but there were reportedly
 some pressures in 1992 to join the party for those holding or desiring high-level gov-
 ernment positions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The right of private citizens to speak publicly
 about political developments or to criticize the Government was less circumscribed
 than in the past, and opposition leaders commented on government policy at public
 rallies, in political broadsheets, and eventually on the government-controlled na-
 tional radio and television.
 The C.A.R.'s tiny media establishment-newspapers, radio, and television-are all
 government owned and controlled. During the year, journalists were physically
 threatened, and one was reportedly beaten because of his critical reMrtmg about
 the Government. For the most part, the media supported President Kolingha and
 the RDC and did not provide objective coverage of important national political devel-
 opments. In 1992 the media ignored or glossed over negotiations between the Gov-
 ernment and the opposition on democratization, opposition political rallies, the trial
 of Joseph Bendounga, labor strikes, and charges of corruption and abuse of power
 in high places.
 For much of the year, the Government did not give opposition parties access to
 the national media. After unsuccessful negotiations in July between the Government
 and the opposition, a government-dominated commission drafted a code granting ac-
 cess to the media by opposition parties. It declared that all parties should have
 equal access to the electronic media. From September 22 to 29, the authorities
 alloted representatives of opposition political parties 15 minutes of free radio and
 television air time to deliver unedited and uncensored commentary. In the 2-week
 campaign period before the elections, the political parties freely expressed their
 views on both radio and television, including views critical. of the Government. The
 opposition expressed satisfaction over increased access to the media but complained
 that it was temporary and limited in scope. And in fact, following the annulled elec-
 tions, the Ministry of Communications reinstated the Government's monopoly over
 news broadcasts.
 Opposition parties and groups published and distributed manifestos, policy state-
 ments, and analyses of events, usually in stenciled and photocopied form without
 government restriction.
 Academic freedom is limited. The Ministry of Higher Education expelled 14 politi-
 cally active student leaders from the university and teacher's college, reinstated
 them after the end of the strikes in February, then prevented several of them from
 taking the yearly examinations. The Ministry of Fundamental Education fired five
 teachers from their positions in the town of Bangassou for their labor and opposition
 party affiliations; however, the head of this Ministry later resigned, stating he had
 not been consulted before this occurred.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of assembly is con-
 stitutionally guaranteed but is restricted by regulations. The media access code re-
 quires the organizers of all demonstrations and public meetings to register with the
 vernment 48 hours before they occur. The Ministry of Public Security has refused
 to sanction several demonstrations, and police have broken up others. In July the
 police arrested three men and confiscated their loudspeaker-equipped car for pub-
 licizing an opposition political rally. Several opposition demonstrations were broken
 up by police, including the national prayer day demonstration on June 30. The com-
 portment of government security forces during the preelectoral period was profes-
 sional. They did not interfere with political campaign rallies and permitted can-
 didates and their supporters to circulate freely throughout the country.
 
 
 The Government used a 1961 law that requires all associations to register annu-
 ally as a way to influence the activities and policies of organizations that the Gov.
 ernment perceives as a threat to its interests. A 1991 law compelled all parties to
 register with the Ministry of Public Security in order to participate legally in the
 political process. Almost all parties successfully registered, including theRDC. How-
 ever, the Ministry refused to register a branch of the Movement for the Social Evo-
 lution of Black Africa (MESAN) headed by Joseph Potolot after an administrative
 court refused to rule in its favor.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-A variety of religious communities are active in the coun-
 try, including traditional African faiths, Christian denominations, and Muslims.
 Most religious orgnizations and missionary groups are free to proselytize and wor-
 ship. However, religious groups must register with the Government, and any group
 whose behavior is considered political in nature remains subject to sanctions.
 The Government's 1986 ban on the activities of the Jehovah's Witnesses commu-
 nity remained in effect on the grounds that this group's refusal to serve in the army
 or salute the flag constituted defiance of government authority. In practice, this
 meant that the Jehovah's Witnesses could not broadcast programs or announce-
 ments on radio or television. However, adherents to this faith continue to worship
 and proselytize, reportedly without interference. The Government rescinded the
 1989 ban on the activities of the Union of Evangelical Pentecostal churches.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-People were generally free to move within the country, but police and
 other officials sometimes harassed travelers unwilling or unable to pay bribes at
 checkpoints along major intercity roads and at major Bangui intersections. The Gov-
 ernment has taken no effective measures to end these practices. The Government
 recognizes the right of voluntary travel abroad and repatriation. Financial and edu-
 cational constraints, rather than government controls, restrict much foreign travel
 and emigration. There were no known cases of revocation of citizenship during the
 year.
 By the end of 1992, more than 17 000 Sudanese had fled civil strife in Sudan to
 seek safe haven in the remote southeastern corner of the CA.R. In collaboration
 with U.N. agencies and private relief groups, the CAR. National Commission for
 Refugees provided assistance to this group. The C.A.R. also continued to host 1,000
 Chadian refugees, who at year's end were no longer under the supervision of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees because they had become self-suffi-
 cient.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite constitutional guarantees, citizens were denied the right to change their
 government by democratic means in 1992. Multiparty elections held in October were
 annulled by action of the government-controlled Supreme Court on the basis of elec-
 toral fraud. The blatant fraud or electoral sabotage that did occur in a few districts
 appeared to have been sponsored by the Government as a pretext to annul a vote
 it was not sure of winning and subsequently lost. Observers generally agreed that
 the electoral process was free and fair in most areas they visited outside of Bangui
 and Berberati.
 In response to public pressure to democratize Central African politics, the Govern-
 ment convened a Grand National Debate in August with the stated aim of establish-
 ing democracy in an orderly fashion. Much of the opposition refused to participate
 in the Grand National Debate on the grounds that it was packed with government
 supporters and thus was incapable of creating a fully representative political system
 that did not favor the incumbent regime. Besides 15 of the 19 opposition parties,
 the labor unions and the Catholic Church refused to participate in the Debate. The
 opposition called repeatedly for a sovereign national conference that would produce
 a transitional government leading to a new constitution and democratic elections.
 In September the Government published an Electoral Code with provisions inhib-
 iting the ability of citizens to change their government. Among other things, the
 Code restricted the length of the campaign to 2 weeks, although the RDC had been
 campaigning for months; it also imposed large filing fees for legislative and presi-
 dential candidates. The new Electoral Code also changed the legislative constitu-
 encies, skewing proportional urban/rural representation for the National Assembly
 to dilute the influence of voters in Bangui, where the opposition enjoys its strongest
 support.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of citizens in the political
 process. In practice, women have generally not been appointed to high level ministe-
 rial positions in the Government.Of 102 ministers in Kolingba Governments during
 a 11-year period, only 3 have been women.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Central African Human Rights League (LCDH) is a nongovernmental organi-
 zation with multiple goals, including the publicizing of human rights violations in
 the CA.R. and pleading individual cases of human rights abuses before the courts.
 In 1992 the LCDH had some success in calling attention to official abuses (see Sec-
 tion L.a.). The authorities delayed but eventually renewed the LCDH's legal status
 under the 1961 registration law.
 The National Commission on Human Rights created by the National Assembly in
 1991 finally settled on its membership in May, after many of the first round nomi-
 nees refused to serve. The Commission has been largely inactive although it did
 participate in the Grand National Debate. It has not criticized the Government.
 In 1992 there were no known requests from, or visits to the CA.R by, representa-
 tives of international human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution mandates that all persons are equal before the law without re-
 gard to wealth, race, or religion. In practice, however, some minorities received un-
 equal treatment. The indigenous forest-dwelling Ba'aka, ommonly known as Pyg-
 mies, are subject to traditional forms of discrimination and exploitation which the
 Government has done little to correct. Pygmies are often hired by villagers to work
 for wages lower than those received by other groups. Muslims, particularly Mbororo
 (Peuhl) herders, claim to have been singled out for harassment in 1992, such as po-
 lie shakedownst due to popular resentment of their affluence. Muslims are
 underrepresentedi in senior executive posts in government.   .         _   .
 There are about 80 ethnic groups in the CA.R., and in the past President
 Kolingba has made statements about the desirability of an ethnic balance in his
 Cabinet. In practice, however, preference for high government and military positions
 has been given to members of his minority Yakoma ethnic group. In 1992 the per-
 centage of Yakomas in-the Cabinet remained disproportionately large. Yakomas also
 retained key financial and security positions, headed a number of state-owned enter-
 prises, dominated university administration, and constituted much of the inner cir-
 cle of presidential advisers.
 Although the Constitution affirms the equality of all citizens, women are not, in
 fact, treated as equal to men economically, socially, or politically. Gaps exist not
 only between men and women, but between urban and rural women as well. From
 60 to 70 percent of urban women go to primary school while only 10 to 20 percent
 of their rural counterparts do so. At the primary level, females and males have
 equal access to education, but a majority of females drop out at age 14 to 15 due
 to social pressure to marry and bear children. At the University of Bangui, the sole
 university in the C.R., only 20 percent of the students are female.
 Traditional socioeconomic patterns persist to a considerable degree. In rural com-
 munities, where farming is the chief livelihood, women continue traditional child-
 raising duties and perform most farming tasks while men seek hard-to-find salaried
 work. Women not engaged in traditional agricultural activities often work in com-
 merce as market vendors. Customs forbidding women and children to eat certain
 classes of food, including some meats, persist in some areas of the country.
 There are no precise data on the percentage of women in the labor force in the
 wage economy, but in cities many educated women find work outside the traditional
 patterns. Some hold clerical positions, and a small but growing number are estab-
 lishing private businesses or moving into the upper ranks of the Government.
 Women are in the police force and have been gendarmes since 1991.
 Polygamy is legal, although fewer women accept the practice than in the past. No
 legal limit exists on the number of wives a man can take, but a prospective husband
 must indicate at the time of the marriage contract whether he intends to take fur-
 ther wives. Women who are educated and financially independent tend to seek a
 monogamous relationship. Divorce is legal and may be initiated by either partner,
 but in practice many Central Africans never marry officially because men cannot
 afford the traditional bride payment.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs, but it is impossible to
 quantify its extent as data are lacking, and cases arc seldom officially reported. The
 Ministry of Justice hears very few cases of spouse abuse, although the issue does
 come up during divorce trials or in civil suits for damages. Some women reportedly
 tolerate abuse in order to retain a measure of financial security for themselves and
 their children. Neither the Government nor the women's division of the RDC pub-
 licly addressed this issue in 1992.
 Article 187 of the Penal Code forbids blows or injuries to children under the age
 of 15. Current interpretation of the Article includes prohibition of female genital
 
 
 mutilation (circumcision), but this traditional tribal practice is common in some
 rural areas and, to a lesser degree in Bangui. A 1966 law forbidding female mutila-
 tion has never been enforced. In March an International Women's Day conference
 on female mutilation and food taboos publicized this widespread practice, and the
 Association of Female Jurists and the State Secretary of Social Affairs have pub-
 licized women's rights on this subject.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Sine May 1, 1989, when a new Labor Code went
 into effect, all workers have been free to form or join unions of their own choosing
 without prior authorization. The right of association has been widely exercised by
 the relatively small part of the population holding wage-earning jobs notably per-
 sons in the large public sector, including teachers, civil servants, and postal work-
 ers. The Ministry of the Interior had recognized four union federations.
 The Government continued in 1992 to harass and inhibit labor activity, although
 not on the scale of 1991, when it suspended four public service unions for 4 months.
 In March the International Labor Organization (ILO) issued a report that expressed
 concern over the authorities' actions against union leaders, union members, and
 union premises in 1991 and termed the suspension of trade union activities in the
 public sector a "blatant violation of Article 4 of Convention 87." In April five teach-
 ers in the town of Bangassou were arrested and detained for engaging in union ac-
 tivity. In another case, security forces violently broke up an otherwise peaceful
 march on August 1, resulting in in*uries to some unionists (as well as the death of
 a political opposition leader). The Government also used soldiers to occupy the lead-
 ing federation of the Labor Union of Central African Workers (USTC) from August
 17 to 19, preventing meetings of union members during that time.
 The Labor Code refers to a single trade union federation, and, in fact, most unions
 belong to the USTC The USTC and its member unions continued to assert and
 maintain their independence from the Government and political parties during
 1992. At the same time, the Government continued to encourage the formation of
 three new federations.
 Of the three new federations, however, labor sources reported that two, the Con-
 federated Syndicate of Central African Workers (CSTC) and the Christian Confed-
 eration of Central African Workers (CCTC), are directly subsidized by the Govern-
 ment. Neither actually was formed from constituent unions; rather they were cre-
 ated as federations for which members and member unions were then recruited,
 without much success. The third, the National Confederation of Central African
 Workers (CNTC), was the reinstitution of a federation suppressed in 1981, and it
 attracted a few independent unionists disaffected with the USTC.
 The ILO has requested that the Labor Code be amended to delete any reference
 to a single trade union federation. Irrespective of the Code, the Government's advo-
 cacy of permitting unions to affiliate or not affiliate with the federation of their
 choice has the effect of producing trade union pluralism, but this is reportedly
 aimed at weakening the USTC. During 1992 the USTC's six public sector unions
 did consider breaking off brom the USC, although this was the result more of in-
 ternal policy differences than of any government action. At year's end, four of the
 six had suspended their activity within the USTC.
 Unions have the right to strike and exercised it in both the private and public
 sectors in 1992. To be legal, strikes must be preceded by union presentation of de-
 mands, employer response, a conciliation meeting, and a finding by an arbitration
 council that the union and employer have failed to reach agreement on valid de-
 mands. Strikes held in 1992 did not always meet these requirements although
 whenever the Government sought to enforce them, the unions acceded to them.
 The federations are free to affiliate internationally. Both the USTC and the CNTC
 maintain international labor contacts, although neither has formally affiliated with
 any international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-The Labor Code accords trade
 unions full egal status, including the right to sue in court. However, by requiring
 a union official to be employed full time in the occupation as wage-earner, the Labor
 Code serves to restrict union organizing activities to afterhours. The ILO in 1992
 reiterated its view that the provisions of the Labor Code that require workers to
 be full-time wage-earners in order to become union members and stand for union
 office contravene ILO Convention 87.
 The Labor Code does not specifically state that unions may bargain collectively.
 Collective bargaining has nonetheless taken place in periods when unions have been
 allowed to function, as, for example, in the settlement of the cotton buying agents'
 strike in February 1992. An ILO report in March discussed a complaint that the
 C.A.R. Government had hindered direct bargaining between the USTC and the Na-
 
 
 50
 tional Employers Federation over private sector wage rates and reguested that the
 CA.R. Government inform it about the outcome of collective bargaining in the pri-
 vate sector.
 Wage scales in the CA.R. are set by the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service, but
 have been only a tangential issue in CA.R. labor negotiations; the outright
 nonpayment of salaries has been the major complaint of the unions during 1992.
 While the law expressly forbids discrimination against employees on the basis of
 union membership or union activity, the Government itself suspended the five
 teachers noted above on the basis of their union activity, reinstating them only after
 teachers went on strike to demand their rehiring.
 Leaders of public sector unions, particularly teachers, continue to complain of gov-
 ernment discrimination against themselves and their members, most often through
 arbitrary reasssignment to provincial posts. Some union leaders also complain of
 personal harassment, such as threats by government employers to fire them if they
 maintained their union activity.
 There are no export processing zones in the CA-R.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is specifically prohib-
 ited by the Labor Code, and there were no reports of such labor in 1992. The ILO
 in 1992 repeated its longstanding concern that the CA.R. Government amend or re-
 place a number of laws that stipulate imprisonment involving compulsory labor for
 persons engaged in independent activities of a political nature.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under 14
 years of age is forbidden by law, but this provision is only loosely enforced by the
 Ministry of Labor and Civil Service. In practice, the role of children in the labor
 force is generally limited to helping the family in traditional subsistence farming or
 in retaihng.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are established by the Gov-
 ernment and in September 1991 were raised for the first time since 1980 by be-
 tween 10 and 50 percent, depending on the category of employee. The lowest paid
 workers received the largest percentage increases in the minimum wage, which
 assures a family the basic necessities but is barely adequate to maintain a decent
 standard of living. Still more serious for public sector employees has been the out-
 rght nonpayment of wages due to the Government's chronic revenue shortfalls.
 oat labor is performed outside the wage and social security system, especially by
 farmers in the large subsistence agricultural sector.
 The law sets a standard workweek of 42 hours for government employees and
 most private sector employees. Domestic employees may work up to 55 hours per
 week. There are also general laws on health and safety standards in the work place,
 but they are neither precisely defined nor actively enforced by the Ministry of Labor
 and Civil Service.
