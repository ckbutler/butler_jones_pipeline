 CONGO
 The People's Republic of the Congo is officially a
 Marxist-Leninist state governed by an elite group of party,
 cabinet, and military officials through the single legal
 .party, the Congolese Labor Party (PCT). In addition to
 serving as President of the Republic and Head of Government,
 Denis Sassou-Nguesso is also head of the party. The President
 nomiflates the 10-member Political Bureau, the key policymaking
 group, which is approved by the 75-member Central Committee.
 Within the Central Committee, members from the northern regions
 of the country are in the majority and hold the balance of
 power even though they represent a minority of the population.
 The military and security services are also firmly under the
 control of the northerners, and they ultimately are the
 arbiters of power in the Congo. The need to maintain consensus
 among the political leaders representing traditionally
 conflicting areas provides a check on arbitrary policies.
 The security apparatus, which is under the direction of the
 presidency,- is headed by the State Security Organization
 (DSGE) and is patterned after those in Eastern Europe. Its
 principal objective is to protect the State against possible
 dissident activity. There are also party core groups in all
 ministries, labor organizations, mass brganizations, and urban
 districts which'monitor the activiEies of coworkers and
 neighbbrs. In-tddition to the DGSE, there are the regular
 police forces whose discipline is generally improving with
 continuin'g:Eastern European and Cuban training.
 The Cdxgoleseedonomy is highlydeendent on oil, which in
 past years hbs accounted for over'90 percent of exports. In
 1982 the Congo began to implement an ambitious 5-year
 investment plan, concentrated beavily on infrastructural
 developdint; 'butby 1985 sharp reductions in'oil revenues
 forced the Government to'but its budget in half and in 1986 to
 accept an Ifitfrnational Monetary Fund (IMF) adjustment program.
 In 1987 the-World;Bank approved two loans totaling $85.2
 million for a structural adjustment program and a short-term
 advisori.program to'study reformd in public enterprises.
 The human rights situation in the Congo changed little in
 1987." WiIe-not politically free, most Congolese live their
 daily lives with a minimum of government and police
 iritefference. In July there was a reported coup attempt
 against the Government. Subsequently, the Government arresEed
 six persons, including four members of the military forces,
 and was contifiuing its special investigation. In August a
 former army'captain, who  reportedly was a 'participant in the'
 July attempt, 'and a few supporters with alleged fies to former
 President Yh6mbi, engaged goverriment forces in battle in the
 northern town of.Owando, at the reported cost of five dead and
 several injnred. The captain remained at large at the end of
 1987, but the Government had detained Yhombi and moved him
 from Owando, his home town, to Brazzaville, claiming that
 Yhombi had voluntarily "plabed himself' at the disposition of
 the judic!4l system." Amnesty International (AI) had reports
 that 11 military officers had been arrested following the July
 incident 'and that one, Lt. Col. Henri Eboundit, had been
 tortured and was in ill-health. The GoVernment denied that
 Eboundit had been tortured or was in ill. health.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported cases of killing for political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearance for political
 motives.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The practice of beating suspects at police and at state
 security centers in the course of interrogations is not
 uncommon. Neither is it uncommon for the public or the police
 to beat thieves who have been caught in the act of stealing.
 Political prisoners are held incommunicado, and it is
 reasonable to assume that torture is used to extract
 information desired by the police that is not freely given.
 However, several political prisoners held incommuncado in the
 past have been freed and are now leading normal lives with no
 apparent ill effects. Some have managed to regain their
 earlier status and are serving as government ministers. AI,
 in its 1987 Report and in 1987 statements, expressed concern
 over reports of torture, including the case of Lt. Col.
 Eboundit.
 Prison conditions in general are poor, and there is a lack of
 adequate food, hygiene, and medical care. Both detainees and
 prisoners may be visited by family or friends who bear the
 responsibility for providing food and medicines.
 d. Arbitary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 While the Constitution provides protection against arbitrary
 indictment, arrest, and detention, in practice a warrant is
 not required to make arrests. There is a legal requirement
 that a detainee be brought before an investigating judge within
 3 days of arrest. The judge may then order detention for a
 maximum period of 6 months, after which the detainee must be
 charged or released. However, this law does not apply in
 cases involving the security of the State, and some political
 detainees have been held for lengthy periods without being
 brought before a judge or charged. The trial of those accused
 of having participated in the 1982 bombings in Brazzaville did
 not take place until 1986, and some of the accused were held
 incommunicado for several years.
 Despite the Government's steps to increase the number of
 magistrates and to improve procedures, the administrative
 processing of regular cases is slow, and persons awaiting
 trial are often detained for considerable periods. Detained
 persons are entitled to an attorney. All lawyers are under
 the general authority of the Government. In criminal cases,
 defense lawyers are provided by the Government for those
 without funds.
 
 
 CONGO
 Whether a detainee is formally charged usually depends upon
 the seriousness of the crime and the economic situation of the
 family. For lesser crimes, the person is usually taken to
 jail, where he may be beaten and held for a few days, then
 released on bail pending a trial which may or may not ever
 take place. A person accused of a serious crime (e.g., murder,
 rape) is held in prison until the trial, which may be months
 or even years later.
 At the end of 1987, the number of political detainees or
 prisoners was unknown. The Government officially acknowledged
 the arrest of four military men and two civilians for alleged
 participation in the 1987 coup attempts. Col. Jean Michel
 Ebaka and Lt. Col. Eboundit are the ranking military officers
 under detention (house arrest, according to the Government).
 Ex-President Yhombi was also being held under "protective
 custody." Prior to his state visit to France in 1987,
 President Sassou granted a pardon to a French national, Claude
 Buisson, who had been sentenced to 7 years' hard labor in the
 August 1986 bombing trial.
 There is no known forced labor in the Congo.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system in not insulated from political interference.
 The Constitution provides for a Supreme Court which is in
 practice an arm of the executive rather than an independent
 body. The amended Constitution also provides for
 nonprofessional judges to be elected to all courts below the
 Supreme Court. The stated purpose of this change was to
 "popularize justice," i.e., provide a role for peers to
 influence the formal judicial process.
 According to the law, any Congolese citizen may now become a
 judge but can adjudicate cases only in collaboration with
 trained judges. Each nomination must be approved by the
 party. By law, the right to a fair and public trial exists in
 all cases, and the judicial process is relatively fair and
 open for those accused of common crimes. Also, it is not
 uncommon to have a higher court reverse lower court decisions
 in nonpolitical cases.
 Political cases are tried by a special court, the
 Revolutionary Court of Justice. In its 1987 Report, AI
 expressed its concern that the August 1986 trial of 10 persons,
 who were convicted of causing bomb explosions in Brazzaville
 in March and July 1982, had not met international standards of
 fairness for several reasons, e.g., several judges were members
 of the PCT Central Committee and had been involved in the case
 at an earlier stage.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is little interference by the Government with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence. Citizens are not forced to
 participate in the party or its organs. In general, so long
 as a person does not engage in any activity which involves or
 implies opposition to the Government, he is not oppressed or
 harassed.
 
 
 CONGO
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are restricted, despite guarantees
 in the Constitution. The State owns and controls the media
 except for one weekly religious newspaper. The Government
 allows some criticism of its policies and programs judged not
 to be politically sensitive, but it does not allow its ultimate
 authority to be challenged publicly. Journalists may raise
 issues and concerns only within general guidelines laid down
 by the Government and the party. The Government and party are
 selective in the kinds of news and information they permit
 Congolese journalists to publish from various outside sources
 of information. Television viewers have access to Zairian
 media programs. A state censorship board reviews the content
 of newspapers, movies, books, and records. Publications are
 subject to censorship if they contain critical articles.
 While the Government controls the local press, foreign
 journalists are generally permitted to travel freely once an
 entry visa and a special permit for travel to the interior are
 obtained. These are usually granted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of peaceful assembly is limited by the State's
 perceived self-interest. Political meetings are permitted
 only for the party and its organizations. Government
 permission is not required for groups to assemble for
 religious and social purposes but is required for use of
 official facilities. Government authorization is also
 required to establish professional clubs and organizations, of
 which there are several.
 The labor code adopted in March 1975 is quite liberal in
 theory and provides for the right of association. However,
 given its past active political role, the labor movement is
 closely scrutinized and controlled by the Government and
 party. In practice, the party controls the unions, largely
 through the umbrella union, the Congolese Trade Union
 Confederation (CTUC), which is an appendage of the party. The
 party approves the national leadership of the CTUC. No group
 is allowed to form an independent, alternative union outside
 the party, which led to a complaint to the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) that the Congo was not observing the
 Convention on Freedom of Association. The CTUC is represented
 in every ministry and state-owned enterprise and serves on
 mandatory boards which include a union representative along
 with a member of the Government and the party. Known as the
 "determinant trilogy," this structure is responsible for
 ensuring that the three major points of view are represented
 in the decisionmaking process and serves as the Congo's form
 of collective bargaining. The CTUC unions are prohibited from
 striking, although wildcat strikes do occur with relative
 impunity. The local unions within the Confederation have been
 able in some instances to persuade the Government to provide
 workers with increased benefits. As long as political subjects
 are avoided, there is also a certain degree of democratic
 dialogue within the labor movement and with the Government.
 The CTUC maintains relations with recognized international
 organizations such as the ILO.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law. In practice, party
 members are prohibited from practicing any religion. Religious
 organizations, such as the Salvation Army, must obtain the
 Government's permisson to work in the Congo. Jehovah's
 Witnesses, for example, are not permitted in the Congo,
 allegedly because Witnesses do not recognize the authority of
 the State. With these exceptions, the party does not normally
 interfere in religious affairs. The Catholic Church, the
 largest religious community, maintains a seminary for the
 training of its clergy and has missions throughout the country.
 Masses are held in the various local languages as well as in
 French. The Catholic Church publishes the only independent
 newspaper, La Semaine Africaine. Catholic and other
 missionaries are active in running private missions and
 clinics and provide other social services. While some of
 these services are joint ventures between church and
 government, many of the services formerly provided by churches
 have been abolished. The Government is officially atheist.
 .Christmas Day is called Children's Day.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises limited control over the internal
 movement of its citizens through identification card checks.
 There are control points outside all major towns manned by
 soldiers who vigorously check identification documents.
 Congolese citizens who wish to travel abroad require exit
 authorization from the DSGE. For most citizens this is a
 fairly routine process. However, those who are suspected of
 traveling for political motives encounter obstacles in
 obtaining such authorization. Government employees traveling
 abroad must obtain permission from the appropriate government
 office. Passports must be returned to the Office of State
 Security after the traveler's return from abroad.
 The Government exercises tight control over travel by
 foreigners in the Congo. Most visas are for one entry only,
 exit visas are required for nondiplomats, and those desiring
 to travel into the interior must obtain permission from the
 appropriate ministry. There are no known instances of
 Congolese being refused the right to return to their country.
 Citizenship may be lost under conditions established in the
 nationality code. For example, citizenship may be lost by
 taking citizenship in another country or for conviction for
 espionage. There are no known cases of a native-born
 Congolese being denied citizenship.
 The Congo is the home of about 3,400 exiles and refugees,
 mostly from surrounding central African states. While refugees
 are subject to surveillance and occasional harassment by the
 Congolese Government, there were no cases of forcible
 repatriatign in 1987. The Congo is a party to the U.N.
 Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees,
 and a representative of the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees is resident in Brazzaville,
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 While the President is the most powerful single person in the
 Government, his authority is limited by his need to maintain a
 consensus in the Political Bureau of the party. The balance
 
 
 CONGO
 of power in the Political Bureau and in the larger Central
 Committee is held by northerners to the detriment of the far
 more numerous southerners. Military officers occupy key
 positions among the ruling group and help ensure its
 continuation in power.
 The Congolese people do not have the right to change their
 government through democratic processes. Opportunities for
 political involvement by Congolese citizens are limited to the
 Marxist-Leninist Congolese Labor Party, including its mass
 organizations, and to participation in the national, regional,
 and local assemblies. The Congolese Labor Party (PCT) is the
 supreme organ of state. No other political parties are
 permitted to operate. PCT membership, which numbers
 approximately 8,700 out of a total population of almost 2
 million, is highly controlled, and membership is awarded on
 the basis of loyalty and political performance.
 The powers of the National Assembly are limited. The
 national, regional, and local assemblies are "elected" from
 single-party approved lists, which present only one candidate.
 The selection process can involve a certain amount of
 negotiation, and incumbents have been turned out of office in
 the process. Representatives of the National Assembly are
 chosen from a broad spectrum of the population, including
 traditional leaders, small farmers, and workers. The National
 Assembly has some impact on social and economic issues, and
 regional and local assemblies may discuss issues before the
 decisions are made at the national level.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no human rights organizations in the Congo. The
 Government permitted AI to send an observer to the 1986
 bombing trial.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Under the Constitution there is no official discrimination
 based on race, sex, religion, language, or social status. As
 noted, northerners carry disproportionate influence in the
 political and security organs. Women have the same legal
 rights as men in the private, political, and social domains.
 There is a large disparity, however, between salaries for men
 and women, and women are relegated to a secondary role in the
 modern sectors of society. In traditional society, women are
 often the chief decisionmakers. Five women are members of the
 party's 75-member Central Committee.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 In previous years, revenues from oil production allowed the
 Government to employ large numbers of Congolese for various
 government organizations, including state corporations. Owing
 to declining oil revenues and the need to comply with an
 IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program, the Goverment
 has abandoned its program of guaranteed employment for all
 university graduates. It is in the process of privatizing
 some state enterprises and has frozen government hiring. Cash
 flow difficulties sometimes cause delays in meeting the public
 payroll.

 CONGO
 Working conditions for Congolese in the modern sector, which
 employs about 50 percent of the population, are generally
 good. These include a minimum working age of 16, a maximum
 40-hour workweek, at least 1 day of rest per week, family
 benefits, and medical aid. There is social security, and the
 minimum hourly wage is $1.96 for urban employees. Domestic
 workers must be paid at least $78 monthly. Outside government
 employment, these minimums are often ignored. There is a code
 of occupational safety and health, although it too is probably
 not enforced. While many salaried Congolese have a generally
 high standard of working conditions and social benefits, most
 of the rural population is still engaged in subsistence
 farming.
