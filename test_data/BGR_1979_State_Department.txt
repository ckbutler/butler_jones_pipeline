 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a nation of some nine million people which traces
 its history back 1300 years. Its modern history as an inde-
 pendent state began in 1878 when 500 years of rule by the
 Ottoman Turks ended. A fully independent Kingdom of Bulgaria
 was proclaimed in 1908. At the close of World War II the
 Communist-dominated Fatherland Front supported by the Soviet
 Union seized power, and Bulgaria has had a Communist government
 since that time. The country has never had a tradition or
 experience in participatory democracy or individual liberties.
 The present Bulgarian Government imposes restrictions on
 individual liberty and expression of political and economic
 views. There is no apparent organized dissident movement or
 organized opposition to the government. The people do not
 have effective means to participate in the selection of their
 government or in the determination of the policies of that
 government.
 The Bulgarian Government has pursued a course of economic and
 social developmefit that provides an effective pension system,
 free universal public education, and guaranteed employment for
 all. In doing so, it has maintained tight restrictions on
 political, civil and economic liberties and has not permitted
 its citizens to exercise such rights as participation in the
 government, freedom to travel abroad, expression of dissenting
 political opinion, formation of free labor unions, and access
 to information from the West.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Bulgarian criminal code and procedures state that individuals
 in criminal procedures shall not be subjected to coercive measures.
 There is no evidence to indicate that torture is either carried
 out or condoned by the Bulgarian Government.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are reports of severe prison conditions in Bulgaria,
 particularly for persons sentenced to hard labor. Prisons
 are said to be crowded, with adequate though basic diet, but
 generally inadequate medical services. All prisoners, except
 those convicted of crimes that the Bulgarian Government considers
 politically sensitive, are allowed family visits on a monthly
 basis. Legal counsel is permitted, though often such counsel is
 provided by the government and presumably is government-influenced.
 International organizations interested in prisoner welfare have
 not been allowed access to political prisoners.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Amnesty International is investigating the case of 23 Bulgarians
 alleged to be political prisoners, and the total number of
 political prisoners may be as high as several hundred. The
 Bulgarian Government does not recognize the existence of "poli-
 tical prisoners" in the Bulgarian penal system. Articles 108,
 109, and 273 of the criminal code provide for punishment of
 (1%4)
 
 
 565
 several specific political acts such as anti-state agitation,
 membership in an organization aimed at the "destruction of the
 people's democracy" and dissemination of "untruthful remarks
 which might incite mistrust of the state power or cause con-
 fusion in society." The principle of habeas corpus exists
 under the Bulgarian criminal code, but is not followed in
 sensitive political cases. The law provides for "preliminary
 detention" in those cases where evidence indicates some justi-
 fication for a later indictment, though the law states that
 there will be a ten-day limit on such detentions. In all
 cases, the accused is to be informed of the charges pending
 against him. There have been occasional reports of persons
 held clandestinely, though not for extended periods. Amnesty
 International and Freedom House have reported instances of
 political dissidents being confined in psychiatric hospitals.
 There is no firm supporting evidence that psychiatry is being
 used systematically to control dissent, however. Banishment
 to remote villages is apparently used to discourage political
 dissidence as well as criminal behavior.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The law provides for a public trial in criminal cases, and
 it appears to be generally honored in practice. While defendants
 are entitled to access to counsel, such access is limited. There
 are special court procedures for cases involving state security
 and political trials are generally held in camera. Total Party
 and state control over the legal processresults in a court
 system that is not independent of executive control, although
 trials in non-political cases appear to be conducted fairly.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 By law, the sanctity of the home is safeguarded. Authorities
 may enter and search property only with the authorization of
 a responsible court or prosecutor. Such searches may, however,
 be legally undertaken in urgent cases by the preliminary inves-
 tigation authorities prior to approval by judicial authorities.
 In practice, there are reports that illegal entries have been
 made.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 Bulgaria endeavors to provide for the material needs of its
 citizens. All citizens are guaranteed a job and officially
 there is no unemployment, although not everyone is able to
 select a job that suits his or her preference. The average
 monthly salary of about 150 leva ($175 at the official exchange
 rate) allows Bulgarians an adequate, if frugal, existence,
 particularly in light of low rents, inexpensive public trans-
 portation, and low-priced staple food. There are no great
 disparities in income distribution in Bulgaria., Admission to
 the higher ranks of society, in effect a privileged class
 comprising less than 5% of the population, brings considerable
 comfort and privileges. As in other Eastern European countries,
 most individual taxes are included in the price of goods. Some
 necessities (e.g., public transportation, rents, food) are
 subsidized by the state, although prices of many of these
 items increased dramatically in November 1979 when the govern-
 ment instituted wide-spread price increases. There are limits
 
 
 566
 on private property ownership; a person may own his home, a
 country villa, a car, a small number of livestock and a plot
 of land normally not exceeding 2.5 acres. In practice, of
 course, few people can afford most of these luxuries.
 Extensive construction of new public apartment buildings in
 the past decade has improved the general housing situation.
 Shortages of housing still exist, however, and Bulgarians
 living in crowded conditions may still have to wait years for
 their turn for a new apartment.
 Education is free through the university level. There is a
 general system of merit selection, although children of
 Party officials usually have easier access to higher education
 than does the general population. No appreciable differences
 in the standard of primary and secondary education exist be-
 tween towns and rural areas. The literacy rate is high.
 Widespread corruption does not appear to exist. Some Bulgarians
 complain that basic services such as medical care, which is
 free, require payments to doctors to assure special treatment
 or choice of a doctor. Favors are also exchanged, for example,
 to obtain materials in short supply.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 The Bulgarian Constitution of 1971 guarantees a number of
 basic rights including free education, speech, press, associa-
 tion and demonstration, freedom of worship, and the right to
 privacy of correspondence and communication except in cases of
 nationql emergency. Women are guaranteed equal rights with
 men, and all citizens are declared to be equal before the law,
 regardless of national origin, creed, social status, education
 or sex.
 In practice, these freedoms do not exist. Political freedom
 does not exist. The state controls the press, decides which
 political organizations may exist, and which political demon-
 strations may take place. Laws severely punish anyone accused
 of spreading "slander" against the state. Domestic opposition
 to the state or Party is not tolerated and is dealt with
 promptly and severely. The public is, however, allowed to and
 does make criticisms, suggestions, and complaints to newspapers
 and to national assembly representatives on a broad range of
 specific and non-ideological topics, e.g., inadequate service
 from a public agency, housing shortages. And the government
 evidently seeks to investigage these charges and respond to them.
 Bulgaria jams the Bulgarian-language radio broadcasts from Radio
 Free Europe, Radio Deutsche Welle, and Radio Tirana, but not
 the Voice of America or the BBC. It does not permit the open
 sale of Western periodicals except for occasional, very small
 numbers of newspapers sold in hotels frequented primarily by
 foreigners. Mail from Western countries is periodically
 screened, and items that are offensive to the Bulgarian state
 or are pornographic are confiscated.
 All media are government controlled. They operate within well-
 understood Party and state guidelines and practices, e.g,
 
 
 567
 international news is usually limited to the government news
 agency or official Soviet sources. Topics taboo in the
 Bulgarian press include unauthorized criticism of: Party
 and state leaders, "socialist" ideology, and the USSR and
 other friendly Communist countries. Opposition views have
 not been aired since 1947, when the last independent news-
 papers were taken over by the state.
 The government actively and aggressively promotes Bulgarian
 cultural activity, while ensuring that it is consonant with
 and supportive of government policy.
 Religion may be practiced within limits by believers in
 denominations recognized by the government, especially the
 Bulgarian Orthodox Church. However, being a church member or
 being active in religious affairs has a decidedly negative
 effect on admission to higher government and Party positions.
 Amnesty International has reported that Moslem believers in
 Bulgaria, both members of the Turkish minority and ethnic
 Bulgarians, have been persecuted and imprisoned because of
 religious activities or their ethnic background. There have
 also been reports that members of Pentacostal sects have been
 punished by the government for religious activities.
 Although theoretically there is separation of church and
 state, the government and the Party exert very strong
 influences over the church. The state uses the overwhelmingly
 predominant Orthodox Church to support its policies in areas
 where the objectives of the church coincide with those of the
 state, e.g., propaganda for peace and disarmament.
 The government closely monitors and circumscribes organized
 religion in Bulgaria through numerous restrictions, e.g., on
 the importation of Bibles, and on the distribution of religious
 publications other than those of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.
 The inadequate supply of Bibles and the prohibition on their
 importation have been a cause of conflict between the govern-
 ment and believers who have attempted to bring or send Bibles
 to Bulgaria. Nonetheless, the state has allowed the Bulgarian
 Orthodox Church some privileges, e.g., to operate a seminary, to
 distribute publications, to sell religious artifacts. It has
 also taken some measures to preserve and protect Judaism. Jewish
 cultural, social and religious institutions receive financial
 support from the State. There are no Jewish schools or rabbis.
 It also allows all religions to hold church services and to
 take up collections at those services.
 In practice, there is no freedom of assembly. Assembly is a
 right granted only to legally constituted organizations and
 only for approved purposes. Public assemblies are always
 Party or state organized to achieve a particular purpose.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement, within the country and abroad, is
 neither guaranteed under law nor respected in practice. With-
 in the country, Bulgarians normally may travel freely and
 visit all areas except certain designated border zones. The
 right to change residence within the country, however, is
 strictly controlled by the government.
 Travel to other Eastern European countries is somewhat limited,
 and travel to the West is severely restricted. A citizen's
 
 
 568
 application for an exit document may be refused for a number
 of reasons, most often because the travel is deemed "not in
 the interests of the state." This arbitrariness is especially
 evident in cases of applications to visit the West and
 particularly when the applicant wishes to visit a relative
 who left Bulgaria without the permission of the state.
 Emigration is provided for by law, but rarely permitted. On
 many occasions, Bulgarian citizens desiring to visit the
 United States, or to travel to the United States to join their
 relatives, have been unsuccessful in gaining Bulgarian
 Government approval. In the case of applications to visit
 relatives in the U.S., however, approvals of such requests by
 the Bulgarian Government have noticeably increased in recent
 years.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Officially, Bulgaria has a two-party system. The Bulgarian
 Communist Party and the Agrarian Union present candidates in
 elections and are represented in the National Assembly.
 Article 1 of the Bulgarian Constitution gives clear primacy
 to the Communist Party and, in practice, it is this party
 which controls the country's political process. The Agrarian
 Union does not have a meaningful or independent role. Only a
 small percentage of the population belongs to the Communist
 Party and only a small fraction of these members has an
 opportunity to'express opinions on Party policy or to
 participate in the decision-making process. Due to a com-
 bination of factors, including historical experience,
 tradition, pervasive internal controls, and the examples made
 in the early years of the Communist Party's rule active and
 organized dissent within Bulgaria has been infrequent.
 Women under law have equal rights with men, and their status
 has steadily improved in recent years. A national women's
 committee produces a monthly publication and otherwise takes
 an active role in promoting women's interests. In practice,
 however, women continue to be overrepresented in manual
 occupations (e.g., on farms in light industry) and under-
 represented in the highest decision-making bodies of the
 government and party (only two of the 14 full Politburo members
 and one of the five candidate-members are women).
 Active labor organizations exist, but totally within the
 Party/state framework. Unions, for example, do not have
 the right to strike, bargain collectively, or lobby. They
 are largely restricted to looking after the social welfare
 of their members and working to increase the quantity and
 quality of production.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 National and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Bulgaria has not admitted any independent, non-Bulgarian
 group to investigate human rights violations and considers
 that the question of human rights is strictly an internal
 matter for each government to resolve.
 
 
 CANADA
 
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary
 form of government and a strong democratic tradition.
 Parliament, the media and the public are quick to react
 to any real or suspected infringement of human rights, not
 only in Canada but elsewhere in the world. Canada is a
 staunch supporter of United Nations resolutions and dec-
 larations concerning human rights. It has played a leading
 role in stimulating international concern over human rights
 abuses in such areas as Vietnam and Kampuchea, and served
 as Chairman of the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 in 1979. Canada alone has accepted over 350,000 refugees
 since World War II. In addition, it has pledged to accept
 up to 3,000 Indochina refugees per month through 1980.
 The 1977 Canadian Human Rights Act provides for a Federal
 Human Rights Commission which combats discrimination by en-
 suring that, at the federal level, all public agencies and
 Crown Corporations provide equal employment opportunity and
 eliminate discrimination based on race, creed, country of
 national origin, sex, pardoned criminal record, and, in
 matters related to employment, physical handicap. Human
 rights are also an ongoing concern of provincial legislation.
 In March 1979, Canada submitted to the Secretary General of
 the United Nations its first report on progress toward the
 implementation of the provisions of the International Cove-
 nant on Civil and Political Rights. The 479-page report
 deals with the Covenant in the context of the Canadian con-
 stitutional structure and examines the degree of conformity
 between its provisions and Canadian federal, provincial,
 and territorial law. An example of Canada's continuing
 commitment to human rights, the report contains evidence
 of continuing progress in ensuring that domestic law cor-
 responds to Covenant precepts.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by Canadian law and
 respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed and provided in practice.

 570
 e   Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is protected by Canadian
 law.
 An official commission is continuing its inquiry into
 alleged past civil rights abuses by the Royal Canadian
 Mounted Police, including surreptitious entries and illegal
 opening of mail.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education:
 The Canadian Government has demonstrated a strong commitment
 to improving the lot of the poor. The federal and provincial
 governments participate in social welfare programs. All
 Canadians are covered by a national medical and health insur-
 ance program. There is a comprehensive and generous program
 of unemployment insurance compensation admininistered by the
 Federal Department of Employment and Immigration. About 2.1
 million Canadians over 65 receive old-age security payments.
 Federal and provincial tax systems are progressive. Education
 is free up to grade 13, and as a matter of law and public
 policy the Provinces, in concert with the Federal Govern-
 ment, are striving to improve the quality and availability
 of minority and second-language instruction.
 while there have been individual abuses for which members of
 Parliament and civil servants have been indicted, the govern-
 mental system of Canada is almost entirely free from corrup-
 tion. Canadian law enforcement agencies enjoy a high regard
 and the attitude of Canadians toward them is supportive.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Laws guarantee freedom of internal movement within the
 country, foreign travel and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Canada has an open and democratic political system.
 The Status of French Canadians within the Confederation is
 a matter of serious national concern. Historical factors
 have limited the range of political and economic opportunities
 open to the cultural and linguistic minority of francophone
 Canadians, but the Canadian Federal Government is deeply
 committed to ensuring the full realization of equal oppor-
 tunity for all ethnic groups within the country. Much
 emphasis has been placed on the fostering of a bilingual,
 multicultural society in which all may enjoy freedom from
 discrimination. In particular, the Official Languages
 Act establishes equal status for French and English in
 
 
 571
 federal institutions. A federal Commissioner of Official
 Languages acts as a linguistic ombudsman on behalf of indi-
 viduals who feel their language rights have not been re-
 spected by federal authorities.
 Discrimination on the basis of sex is outlawed. A Cabinet
 Minister is specifically charged with responsibility for
 the status of women. A Federal Advisory Council on the
 Status of Women, consisting of thirty women with distin-
 guished records in business, government and social service,
 advises the minister on women's affairs and on measures to
 maintain sexual equality within the public service and in
 federal enactments.
 Canadian labor unions enjoy wide freedom of action. Canadian
 law insures the right of labor in both the public and private
 sectors to associate freely, organize, and bargain collec-
 tively. Federal and provincial legislation also proscribes
 discrimination in union membership recruitment and employee
 hiring.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 To the knowledge of the Department of State, Canada's
 human rights performance has prompted no outside requests
 for investigation.
