 IRELAND
 The Republic of Ireland, a parliamentary democracy with a long
 tradition of orderly transfer of power, attaches great
 importance to the observance and maintenance of human rights
 both in theory and practice. Individual liberties and civil
 rights are guaranteed and protected by the 1937 Irish
 Constitution. Ireland places strong emphasis on human rights in
 formulating foreign policy. It plays an active role in human
 rights questions in the United Nations, where it has been deputy
 chairman of the United Nations Human Rights Commission since
 1983.
 Successive Irish governments have had to deal with the problem
 of recurring outbreaks of violence in Northern Ireland and its
 spillover into the Republic. In recent years, the spillover of
 violence has included the assassinations of the British
 Ambassador (1976) and Lord Mountbatten (1979), as well as the
 deaths of individual police officers and soldiers, most recently
 in late 1983, in armed confrontations with Irish Republican Army
 and Irish National Liberation Army elements. This violence has
 led Irish governments of both main political parties to adopt
 special legislation to deal with acts of terrorism. During 1984
 the Government has demonstrated a high awareness of human rights
 issues and has sought to apply such special legislation with
 fairness and balance.
 In response to a growing crime rate and a serious drug problem
 in urban areas, an omnibus criminal justice act was passed by
 Parliament in November 1984. This act gives the police added
 power to detain, interrogate and charge those accused of
 criminal offenses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killings occur in Ireland as a spillover
 from the violence in Northern Ireland. In these cases, such
 groups as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) or the
 Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) usually claim
 responsibility. Both the Government and the population as a
 whole strongly deplore these actions. The Government uses the
 full force of the law to pursue and prosecute such cases.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities, nor does the
 Irish Government condone such practices by any element of
 society. Various terrorist groups have sometimes resorted to
 kidnapping for political purposes, most recently in the case of
 Don Tidey in 1983. The British-born supermarket executive,
 kidnapped by the IRA for ransom, was rescued unharmed by the
 Irish police, but a police officer and an Irish soldier were
 killed in the operation. In all such cases of political
 kidnapping, the Irish Government uses full police power either
 to prevent or solve the crime.

 IRELAND
 C. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture is provided by the general guarantees under
 the Constitution and is respected in practice. This extends
 equally to freedom from cruel and degrading punishment. From
 time to time allegations are made that individual police
 officers have used physical abuse during interrogations or have
 mistreated prisoners. Such allegations are investigated and
 charges, where warranted, have been brought and/or convictions
 overturned. Some civil rights groups, however, are not fully
 satisfied with existing investigative procedures, and the
 Government plans to introduce legislation establishing an
 independent Police Complaint Review Board on which the Police
 Commissioner would be the only police representative.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that *no citizen shall be deprived of
 his personal liberty save in accordance with law.' The same
 section of the Constitution provides for habeas corpus and
 requires that full charges, in writing, be made available to any
 individual placed under arrest. Neither in law nor in practice
 is anyone subject to arrest for the expression of political or
 religious views. Arrest is carried out openly, by warrant, and
 the right to a fair and speedy trial with full right of legal
 counsel exists in law and practice. Detention without charge is
 limited to a maximum of 48 hours. After this period the
 individual must be brought before a magistrate and presented
 with written charges and be given legal representation.
 Critics of the omnibus criminal justice bill passed by
 Parliament in November 1984 argue that the increased powers it
 gives to the police to detain and interrogate suspects could
 seriously diminish human rights. Supporters of the bill point
 out that the Irish police under the proposed law would have less
 power to detain and interrogate suspects than the police forces
 of other European Community states.
 There are no political crimes under Irish law, and there is
 therefore no political status for any convicted persons. A
 number of those convicted for terrorist offenses are members of
 the PIRA and other illegal organizations and will often claim
 political status. This claim is not recognized.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. The courts are independent and jury
 trial is the norm. The Constitution provides, however, for the
 creation of-special courts" to deal with cases where the
 'ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective
 administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace
 and order.' The "Offenses Against the State Act' of 1939
 formally established such courts and provided that they may try
 persons for offenses against national security. These courts
 are used in response to the spillover of violence from Northern
 Ireland. Rather than having juries, these courts have panels of
 judges, each consisting of an uneven number of judges, but in
 any event not less than three; their verdicts are by majority
 vote. Rules of evidence generally are similar to those of
 regular courts, except that the statement of a police chief
 
 
 1019
 IRELAND
 superintendent that the accused is a member of an illegal
 organization is considered evidence of such membership. Court
 sessions are usually public but may exclude certain persons,
 other than genuine press representatives. There is provision
 for free legal aid and appeal against conviction or sentence.
 In 1983 and early 1984 Irish civil rights groups and the Irish
 chapter of Amnesty International were expressing concern over
 the case of Nicky Kelly, who had been tried by just such a
 special court. Kelly, along with two other defendants, was
 convicted in 1978 of a mail train robbery, the Government's case
 having been based almost entirely upon confessions. On appeal,
 tne Supreme Court set free Kelly's co-defendants because of
 *reasonable doubt' that the confessions had been voluntarily
 obtained, as required by Irish law.
 In the meantime, however, Kelly, who had escaped from custody
 during the course of the initial trial and was not included with
 his co-defendants in the successful appeal, was sentenced in
 absentia. In 1980 Kelly returned to Ireland and gave himself
 up. By court action, Kelly requested an extension of the
 statutory time limit, which had expired, for filing an appeal
 against his conviction. In late 1982, the Irish Supreme Court
 ruled that proper procedures had been followed and that Kelly
 was not entitled to such an extension. A 'free Nicky Kelly'
 group was organized in Ireland and actively campaigned to have
 Kelly pardoned. In March 1984, without reference to Kelly's
 guilt or innocence, the Minister of Justice exercised his power
 of commutation and ordered Kelly freed. Kelly's supporters are
 still demanding his full exoneration.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution protects the basic human right of
 non-interference with personal privacy, family, home, or
 correspondence which, in general, is observed. The
 Constitution, however, provides that the State shall enact no
 law 'providing for the grant of the dissolution of marriage."
 Arguing that divorce is a basic human and family right, an Irish
 couple, in late 1983, persuaded the European Court of Human
 Rights to review the Irish Government's denial of their right to
 a divorce as a denial of human rights. This case is still under
 review. In addition, an all-party committee of the Irish
 Parliament has been appointed to review existing law on this
 subject.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and generally
 respected in practice. The state endeavors to insure that
 organs of public opinion, while preserving liberty of expression
 (including criticism of government policy) shall not be used to
 undermine public order, morality, or the authority of the
 state. Furthermore, "publication or utterance of blasphemous,
 seditious or indecent matter' is an offense punishable by law.
 Ordinarily, such censorship as exists in Ireland is directed
 largely toward materials considered pornographic in nature.
 Nonetheless, the state-owned radio and television network, on
 
 
 1020
 IRELAND
 the basis of the constitutional provisions dealing with public
 order and the authority of the state, have a longstanding
 practice of denying air time to representatives of Provisional
 Sinn Fein, the political wing of the illegal PIRA. In late
 1982, this prohibition was challenged before the Irish Supreme
 Court and upheld on constitutional grounds. All other legal
 political parties are given full and regular access to both
 public-owned radio and television facilities and major
 independent daily newspapers. Criticism of the Government in
 such media is not only allowed but flourishes.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 in practice. Certain terrorist organizations, such as PIRA,
 however, are illegal, and membership in them is an offense
 against national security. The INLA was added to this list in
 early 1983. Political parties or groups associated with such
 organizations, such as Provisional Sinn Fein, are not
 proscribed. Labor unions have full freedom to organize
 independently from the Government, and engage fully in free
 collective bargaining. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which
 represents unions in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, has
 over 90 member unions with over 600,000 members. The Irish
 Labor Party has not had formal links to the trade union movement
 since the 1930's, but many union officials and members play an
 active role in politics through the parties of their choice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Ireland is 94 percent Roman Catholic. The Constitution
 guarantees freedom to all religious groups. There are no
 restrictions upon freedom of worship or association.
 Discrimination in employment, education, and other fields based
 on religious grounds has not been alleged. Some Irish laws,
 such as the prohibition against divorce, reflect the point of
 view of the majority community. The area of family law is the
 subject for much current debate in which minority religious
 communities have felt fully at liberty to take a vocal and
 active role. Reflecting traditional religious values on the
 role of women in society, many family law restrictions fall most
 heavily upon women. Pressure for change in these practices is
 coming from the relatively new but increasingly effective and
 articulate feminist movement in Ireland.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement within the country, and
 freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and voluntary
 repatriation. Ireland has accepted displaced persons on a
 limited basis as the needs of particular situations required it.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a consistent history
 of the orderly transfer of power by elections since the end of
 the Irish Civil War in 1923. Ireland has two major parties,
 three smaller parties, and provision for independents to stand
 for election to either house of the Irish Parliament. The
 constitutional requirement that elections be held at least every
 
 
 1021
 IRELAND
 5 years has always been met. Ireland uses a proportional voting
 system and the secrecy of the ballot is fully safeguarded. The
 Government elected in November 1982 is a two-party coalition in
 which the party leader of the larger party serves as Prime
 Minister.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Irish Government cooperates with independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights abuses. Ireland is
 currently on the UN Human Rights Commission. Amnesty
 International is active in Ireland, adopting *prisoners of
 conscience* in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Because
 of the nature of the special courts described in Section l.e.,
 Amnesty International has expressed some concern about their
 conduct. Observers, including representatives of Amnesty, have
 been given free access to trials conducted in such courts.
 Amnesty International's 1984 report mentioned the Nicky Kelly
 case as it unfolded during 1983, before the commutation of his
 sentence. Freedom House rates Ireland "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Successive Irish Governments have successfully promoted
 industrialization and diversification, raising living standards
 considerably. The population in 1984 totaled approximately 3.58
 million and is growing at 1.2 percent a year. Life expectancy
 at birth is 73.4 years, and the infant mortality rate is 10 per
 1,000 live births. Estimated per capita gross national product
 in 1982 was US$ 5,149. Over the last 3 years Ireland has been
 hurt by rising unemployment (16.6 percent in September 1984) and
 a high rate of inflation (11 percent for 1983). Nonetheless,
 the people enjoy more than adequate access to food, shelter,
 health care, and education. These services are available
 without regard to race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or
 political opinion. People whose means are inadequate and who
 are not entitled to other benefits may receive pensions or other
 payments from public funds.
 In recent years women have been playing a more significant role
 in the Irish work force. Although the Constitution recognizes
 the woman's role in terms of 'her life within the home,* women
 have been entering the office and market place relatively
 smoothly but slowly. Severaj recent studies have highlighted
 the difference in pay scales between men and women and have
 drawn particular attention to the fact that in recent pay
 increases female workers have lagged considerably behind the
 male sector, thus further exacerbating the gap. Equal pay for
 equal work is now very much on the agenda of Ireland's small but
 growing women's movement.
