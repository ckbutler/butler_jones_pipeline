 BURMA
 The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma is a one-party,
 authoritarian state whose leaders come from a narrow elite
 within the military. Under Burma's 1974 Constitution, the
 ruling Burma Socialist Program Party (BSPP) dominates the
 Government. All major decisions are subject to the approval
 of party chairman U Ne Win, who was commander of the army in
 1962 when the present regime came into power in a coup. The
 Government is headed by a 29-member Council of State, the
 chairman of which, U San Yu, is ex officio President of
 Burma. A unicameral national assembly includes 475 members
 chosen in unopposed elections for 4-year terms, and is the
 titular source of all power in the state. Though non-party
 members are permitted to run for the National Assembly and
 'people's councils,* the basic unit of local administration,
 lists of candidates are approved by the BSPP. Opposition
 political groups are banned and public criticism of the
 Government is not tolerated.
 A 1974 anti-subversion law codified the wide discretionary
 powers of government security agencies. Several government
 organizations are charged with state security. In addition,
 each local people's council has its own security committee
 with block and neighborhood wardens in cities and towns.
 Most Burmese maintain a reasonably good standard of living,
 although statistically Burma remains among the world's least
 developed countries according to most economic measures. The
 Government is trying to build a centrally planned economic
 system under an ideological program known as the "Burmese Way
 to Socialism.' Most significant economic enterprises are
 .government-owned, and control of the economy is centralized.
 For many years, the Government pursued a rigid policy of
 economic self-sufficiency; a historical tradition of
 isolationism has contributed to political and cultural
 insularity as well. After encountering serious economic
 difficulties in the early 1970's, the Government has over the
 past decade tempered its doctrinaire socialism with some
 pragmatic economic measures, including greater tolerance of
 the private sector and acceptance of foreign grant and loan
 capital. Although the state retains ultimate rights to all
 land and natural resources, the right to own private property,
 alone or in association with others, is recognized by the
 Constitution and respected in practice.
 A central factor affecting the human rights situation in Burma
 has been the continued widespread insurgencies against the
 Government. Dozens of different insurgent groups, based
 primarily among Burma's ethnic minorities, have been fighting
 the Government for decades. Some of these groups are fighting
 for autonomy or independence and against what they perceive to
 be domination by ethnic Burmans, who constitute at least
 two-thirds of the population. The Burma Communist Party has
 also been fighting for over 30 years to overthrow the
 Government. The Communists and many of the insurgent groups
 traffic in narcotics to finance their operations. Some of the
 insurgent groups are in effect narcotics syndicates with
 private armies. There are recurrent reports of human rights
 abuses by all sides in the fighting.
 There was little change in the overall human rights situation
 in 1984. Authoritarian control over the political and
 economic systems was essentially unchanged. On the positive
 side, over a hundred undocumented 'illegal aliens,* some of
 whom had been held in indefinite detention for many years,

 BURMA
 were allowed to depart for repatriation and resettlement in
 other countries, and the government has indicated those
 remaining will be allowed to leave if other countries accept
 them for resettlement. In addition, draft laws to bring Burma
 into compliance with certain International Labor Organization
 (ILO) conventions were submitted to the Law Commission for
 consideration.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Summary executions are not allowed under the Burmese judicial
 system. There are no specific reports of political killings.
 However, there have been reports that government forces have
 executed captured prisoners or killed suspected insurgent
 supporters during military operations. Government forces
 often conscript civilian porters for use in military
 operations, and their deaths from mines and other causes occur
 frequently.
 There are also frequent credible reports of noncombatant
 deaths resulting from the fighting with the insurgents. Some
 insurgent groups have carried out summary executions of
 prisoners, opponents, and suspected informers.  Some
 insurgent groups have resorted to terrorist attacks such as
 bombings, train derailments, kidnappings, and assassinations.
 b.  Disappearance
 There were no specific reports over the past year of people
 being abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandestine
 detention by security forces. There is no attempt to conceal
 common criminal or political/security arrests from family
 members, although details about the charges may not be
 revealed. Some insurgent groups have resorted to abduction as
 a political weapon or to coerce local inhabitants into
 cooperation.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution provides that punishment shall not be in
 violation of human dignity, and the Government denies that
 torture or inhuman treatment is practiced. However, reports
 suggest that the police and other security forces continue to
 use physical and psychological coercion, including torture,
 during investigations in order to obtain confessions or other
 information in both common criminal and political/security
 cases. There are unconfirmed reports of mistreatment of some
 political/security prisoners in regular prison facilities.
 Prison conditions are poor as a consequence of the generally
 low standard of living, over-crowding, low government
 expenditures, and limited staff.
 There are credible reports that some insurgent groups employ
 death threats, beatings, and other forms of physical and
 mental coercion against opponents or villagers who refuse to
 cooperate with them.

 BURMA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no provision in Burmese law for a person in detention
 to seek a judicial determination of the legality of his
 detention. In cases involving national security, persons are
 sometimes never formally charged but held in indefinite
 detention without trial. The Government neither acknowledges
 holding political prisoners nor considers itself compelled to
 justify the detention or imprisonment of anyone. The number
 of political detainees is thought to have decreased since
 1980, when there was a general amnesty. Some estimates place
 the current number in the hundreds.
 In common criminal cases, police may detain suspects up to 24
 hours, after which a court order must be sought from competent
 judicial authorities. These court orders, which are
 renewable, authorize extensions of the detention of 14-day
 periods until charges are formally brought before a court.
 Detainees are frequently held incommunicado during the period
 of investigation and interrogation.but are normally allowed
 visitors thereafter. Refugees and other stateless persons are
 regarded as illegal immigrants subject to arrest. If they
 cannot be repatriated after serving sentences for illegal
 entry, they may be detained indefinitely. The Burmese
 Government is thought to have under detention several hundred
 illegal immigrants from a number of Asian countries. Over 100
 of these detainees have been voluntarily repatriated in recent
 years, and the Burmese Government is reportedly willing to
 release those remaining if they are accepted for permanent
 resettlement elsewhere.
 Civiliar% males in the vicinity of military operations
 (primarily ethnic minority populated areas) are frequently
 conscripted for porter duty by the Burma Army. Insurgent
 groups also reportedly press-gang villagers as recruits or as
 porters.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Justice is administered by *Judges' Committees.0 These
 committees are elected from a single slate of candidates
 chosen by the party. Almost all judges are BSPP members, and
 a large number are military officers, either active or
 retired. Although untrained in the law, they are normally
 advised by professional legal officers. The legal code is
 residually based upon the British colonial system of law with
 an overlay from the present Constitution and other legal
 measures imposed by the present Government. The judiciary is
 not independent of the Government, which can influence both
 verdict and sentence, particularly in political/security cases.
 The Constitution provides for public trials in most cases, and
 this practice is followed in common criminal cases. In
 political/security cases, special judiciary committees may be
 named by the Council of State. The public is normally not
 allowed to attend such trials.
 When both common criminal and political/security cases come to
 trial, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the
 accused has the right to counsel. Legal counsel is provided
 for indigent defendants if they are faced with a possible
 sentence of seven years or more. Normally, defendants can
 consult freely and privately with their lawyers, and
 defendants and their lawyers are made aware of the charges and
 
 
 715
 BURMA
 evidence and are permitted to submit their own evidence. The
 verdicts of civil, security, and military courts may be
 appealed to the next higher court up to the Council of State.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In common criminal cases, police officials are required to
 have a valid search warrant or be accompanied by a member of.
 the local People's Council at the time of search.
 Search warrants are issued by local or state Judges'
 Committees. In political/security cases, security forces are
 not subject to judicial procedures and usually enter homes
 without warrants. Unannounced searches are sometimes
 conducted to insure compliance with laws requiring that any
 house guest be registered at the local People's Council
 Office. In areas of insurgency, forced entry and warrantless
 searches are carried out by government security forces and
 rebel groups alike.
 It is widely believed that security personnel monitor private
 correspondence and telephone calls as a normal practice. A
 well-developed system of neighborhood informers reports on
 dissent and criticism of the Government. Private religious
 practices are not interfered with. There are reports that
 some persons in insecure areas have been forcibly resettled.
 These include former opium poppy growers who are resettled to
 control illegal opium production and improve security.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, expression, and
 publication but stipulates that the exercise of such freedoms
 should not be 'contrary to the interest of the working people
 and socialism.' In practice, opposition viewpoints and public
 criticism of the Government are not tolerated. Party members
 can express some views about economic problems or bureaucratic
 failures, but outspoken members can be disciplined or
 expelled. Anyone criticizing the Government's leadership in
 public or private is subject to arrest although muted private
 criticism is usually ignored.
 All mass media in Burma are government-owned and operated,
 including television, radio, and the six national newspapers.
 Newspaper editors are appointed by the Ministry of
 Information. Editorials must be approved in advance.
 Journalists are subject to strict guidelines as to what can be
 broadcast or published, especially on domestic matters.
 Although subject to prior review, international news reporting
 is generally objective and balanced. All foreign publications
 must be cleared by the press scrutiny board before they may be
 legally imported or distributed.
 Criticism of government officials is not permitted, although
 cartoons and opinion editorials will sometimes criticize local
 administration indirectly. All forms of communications--
 domestic and imported books and periodicals, stage plays,
 motion pictures, and musical recordings--are subject to
 government control and censorship.
 The Government monitors academic inquiry in the social
 
 
 716
 BURMA
 sciences. All research proposals by foreign scholars must be
 approved. The extreme difficulty of obtaining scholarly
 publications from abroad and of communicating with foreign
 scholars seriously impedes academic research in all areas.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right of assembly and
 association, but only for those organizations permitted by
 law. In practice, most legitimate organizations are limited
 to the BSPP. BSPP units and "mass organizations' for workers,
 peasants, and youth have been established at every
 administrative level. These organizations serve primarily as
 vehicles for communicating national policies and implementing
 government programs. Opposition political groups are banned,
 and their members are subject to arrest. Certain nonpolitical
 secular organizations, such as professional, religious, and
 social associations, are not under direct government or party
 control.
 There is no independent labor movement in Burma. Workers do
 not have the right to organize independently, negotiate or
 strike. The labor force is organized into party controlled
 workers' and peasants' mass organizations. Most of the
 leaders of these organizations are party officials and the
 national leadership is made up of ranking party and government
 officials. For example, the workers' organization national
 chairman is also the Minister for Social Welfare and Labor,
 and the peasants' organization chairman is also the Minister
 for Agriculture and Forests; both are members of the party's
 central committee.
 Burma is a member of the ILO. In the past it was criticized
 by thht organization for failure to comply with various ILO
 conventions. According to the 1984 report of the ILO
 Committee on the Application of Conventions and
 Recommendations, draft laws to bring Burma into conformity
 with ILO conventions 17, 62, and 87 were submitted to the Law
 Commission on December 26, 1983 and will be tabled before the
 National Assembly as soon as they are passed by the Law
 Commission.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burma is a secular state. Freedom of religion is guaranteed
 in the Constitution and widely observed in practice. The
 great majority of Burmese are Buddhist, although there are
 sizable Christian, Muslim, and animist minorities among
 minority ethnic groups. Minority religious groups are allowed
 to practice and there is a fairly high level of religious
 tolerance among the Buddhist majority. In some areas, there
 is tension between the Buddhist and Muslim communities, a
 reflection of both ethnic and religious differences. The
 Government has made an effort to prevent attacks on religious
 minorities in line with its proclaimed policy of religious
 tolerance.
 Under the 1982 citizenship law, ethnic Burmese, including
 indigenous minoritiesr enjoy advantages that are not available
 to immigrants and their immediate descendants. Although there
 is no official discrimination on the basis of religion, some
 persons of mixed descent reportedly believe it advantageous to
 convert to Buddhism in order to benefit from the advantages of
 being considered ethnic Burmese.
 
 
 717
 BURMA
 All religious organizations are required to register with the
 Government, and religious publications are subject to the same
 governmental control and censorship as other publications.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees Burmese citizens the right to live
 anywhere in the country. Except for limitations in areas of
 insurgent activity, internal travel by Burmese citizens is
 unrestricted, but they must inform local authorities of their
 temporary place of residence. Non-citizens must obtain prior
 permission to travel. Permission is normally granted only for
 periods of several weeks maximum.
 Citizens wishing to travel abroad, except for official
 purposes, must obtain approval from the Passport Board. There
 are long delays in the processing of applications, and less
 than half of them are believed to receive approval. Although
 the Passport Board does not need to justify its decisions, it
 is apparent that political considerations are a factor in some
 cases.
 Before traveling abroad private citizens normally must
 reimburse the Government for their university and professional
 education and pay income tax in advance. Non-citizens are
 generally unable to travel abroad legally.
 While no policy has been formally enunciated, emigration is
 restricted because of the Government's concerns about security
 and loss of trained personnel. Legal requirements and
 bureaucratic procedures cause long delays, and the right to
 emigrate often is denied. Emigrants are severely limited in
 terms of what they are allowed to take out of the country with
 them. Persons who retain their Burmese citizenship and who
 left the country legally are generally allowed to return to
 visit relatives, although there are often delays in obtaining
 entry visas. Emigrants wishing to return permanently are
 required to reapply for Burmese citizenship. In general,
 those who leave the country illegally cannot legally return
 under any circumstances.
 Burma does not permit foreign refugees or displaced persons to
 resettle or seek safehaven within Burma. The Government
 treats persons claiming to be refugees as illegal immigrants
 subject to arrest or deportation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Burma has an authoritarian, one-party system in which
 leadership is essentially drawn from a small elite within the
 military officer corps. All government institutions and other
 organizations in Burma are subordinate to the guidance of the
 ruling BSPP. The party in turn follows the leadership of
 Chairman U Ne win, who has personally ruled and guided the
 formulation and execution of national policy for the last two
 decades.
 Political opposition is not tolerated, and opposition
 political parties are illegal. The BSPP is used to mobilize
 popular support behind decisions of the leadership rather than
 as a vehicle to express individual or group opinions of the
 members.
 
 
 718
 BURMA
 The party chooses a single slate of candidates for government
 offices. Although party nominees run unopposed, they must
 receive 50 percent of the vote to be elected. In a few cases
 at the lower levels, the party nominees have not been
 elected. In party and governmental decision-making
 assemblies, votes are almost always unanimous.
 Ethnic Burmans dominate the political system although the
 party seeks to expand participation by Burmese ethnic
 minorities. Women are underrepresented in the Party and at
 senior levels of government, reflecting the military
 background of most of Burma's present leaders.
 Persons with a significant proportion of non-Burmese ancestry
 (usually Chinese or Indian) are barred from party and
 government offices and are forced to resign if their mixed
 ancestry is discovered. The national bodies of workers' and
 peasants' organizations deny leadership positions to members
 of mixed ancestry. The Citizenship Law of 1980 significantly
 limits the rights of many primarily ethnic Chinese and
 Indians.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Burmese Government does not permit investigations of its
 human rights practices, nor is it willing to discuss human
 rights problems with outside governmental or non-governmental
 organizations. The Government has permitted a visit by ILO
 representatives to discuss the labor situation in Burma. No
 Burmese organization, governmental or private, monitors the
 human rights situation in Burma. Burma does not actively
 participate in internationalor regional human rights bodies.
 In its 1984 Report, Amnesty International noted that it
 continued to receive occasional reports of arrests on
 political grounds, and it was concerned that some of those
 arrested were said to be held without charge or trial. It
 also noted allegations that some of these detainees were
 ill-treated. Freedom House's 1984-85 report listed Burma as
 *not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 According to data supplied by the World Bank, Burma's
 population in 1984 was 36,196,000 and it had a population
 growth rate of two percent. Burma remains one of the poorest
 nations in'the world, in terms of estimated per capita gross
 national product, only $187 in 1982. This figure and other
 economic and social indicators for Burma are generally very
 rough, outdated estimates that often may not accurately
 reflect actual conditions. Burma is rich in natural resources
 and is essentially self-sufficient in food; the majority of
 the population appears to have the basic economic necessities.
 Life expectancy in 1984 was 55.5 years at birth and the infant
 mortality rate for 1984 was estimated at 90.8 per 1,000 live
 births. Calorie supply as a percentage of minimum established
 daily requirements was estimated at 113 in 1981. The
 precentage of the population with access to safe drinking
 water was estimated to be 17 percent in 1976.
 Education in Burma is free through the university level, and
 the party and Government have made a major effort to improve
 
 
 719
 BURMA
 literacy in recent years. The World Bank reports the primary
 school enrollment ratio as of 1981 was 84 percent overall:
 87 percent for males and 81 percent for females. Burma's
 numerous ethnic minorities have their own distinct cultures
 and languages; many of them live in remote, insecure areas.
 Many of the minority groups have historically resisted
 assimilation and view central control as a chauvinistic
 attempt by ethnic Burmans to dominate them. Numerous
 insurgent groups continue to fight for autonomy or
 independence. Economic development among the ethnic minority
 groups has lagged, and many still live at the subsistence
 level. This is due in part to the chronic insurgencies and
 geographic factors which impede economic development in the
 rugged, isolated ethnic minority populated border areas.
 Minorities are underrepresented in the party and Government
 and are largely excluded from the military leadership.
 The Chinese and Indian minorities enjoyed a favored status
 when Burma was a British colony and dominated the country's
 economy. Members of these groups are now generally denied
 full citizenship status and are not permitted to hold
 important party or government jobs, although they continue to
 play an important role in the economy.
 Women in Burma have distinct social roles, which vary with
 their cultural traditions and ethnic backgrounds. In general,
 Burmese women enjoy most of the same rights as men.  They keep
 their own names after marriage, are active in trade and often
 control family finances, and enjoy the same legal rights as
 men. Buddhism, like many religions, limits the religious role
 of women and assigns them a theoretically inferior status to
 men. Women are greatly underrepresented in senior positions
 in the party and Government.
