 AUSTRIA
 Austria, a neutral and Western-oriented country, attaches
 highest importance to human rights. It is a parliamentary
 constitutional democracy. The Austrian Constitution and
 Austrian State Treaty of 1955 define and guarantee basic
 human rights concerning the integrity of the person, and
 civil and political liberties. Austria's record of
 assistance to refugees from other countries, many of whom
 have settled there, and its important role in facilitating
 the transit of Jewish emigrants from the Soviet Union, are
 widely recognized. During the reporting period Austria
 has continued'to respect and defend human rights in all
 domains. Steady progress has been made toward the solution
 of the country's minority problem.

 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice.
 Austria adheres to the 1950 European Convention for the
 .protection of .Human 1 ights and Fundamental Freedoms.
 The Austrian ratification document contains a reservation
 to Article 5 which states that the provisions contained
 in the Austrian federal law on administrative procedures
 on deprivation of liberty will not be affected. Under
 this law persons may be arrested and detained administra-
 tively for disturbing the peace, drunk and disorderly
 conduct, traffic violations and certain other offenses.
 The law provides for control of such proceedings by either
 an administrative or constitutional court. Appeals of

 administrative detention to the courts can be very time-
 consuming.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Austria has a highly developed social welfare system.
 An equitable distribution of income is achieved through
 a progressive income tax system. Government, labor
 and management cooperate well in a "social partnership"
 which has been effective in avoiding serious labor-
 management disputes. Basic human needs are met for all
 citizens. Austria's socialist government places heavy
 emphasis on maintaining and improving health, education
 and social services.
 Although by law women enjoy full equality with men, there
 are some differences in treatment resulting from tradition
 and local custom.
 The Austrian State Treaty states that the Slovene and
 Croation minorities shall enjoy the same rights on equal
 terms as all other Austrian nationals and grants to them
 the right to "...elementary instruction in the Slovene
 or Croat language and to a proportional number of their
 own secondary schools." Interpretation and implementation
 of these rights have been subject to differing opinions,
 but Austria provides instruction in minority languages
 for all those who wish it. The Slovenian language high
 school in Klagenfurt, which is one of the most modern
 and best equipped in Austria, has about 500 students.
 Another recent government step has been the posting of
 road signs in minority areas in minority languages.
 During the past year, there have been no confrontations
 of any importance between the Austrian authorities and
 the minorities. In the recent elections of the legis-
 lature in the state of Carinthia, the Slovene party slipped
 from 2 percent of the vote to 1.4.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms-are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Labor unions have the right to strike.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 This freedom is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.

 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 This freedom is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights.
 There have been no investigations of Austria's human
 rights record nor, to the knowledge of the Department
 of State, have there been any requests for such investi-
 gation by major, non-governmental human rights organiza-
 tions.
 Austria has deposited a declaration with the Secretary
 General of the Council of Europe recognizing the competence
 of the Human Rights Commission in Strasbourg under Article
 25 of the European Convention to receive petitions from
 any person or persons claiming to be a victim of a violation
 of the rights set forth in the convention, and undertaking
 not to hinder the effective exercise of these rights. Thus
 persons believing that their rights have been infringed
 by the Austrian authorities may bring the matter before
 the commission.
