 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is a functioning multibarty democracy in which
 respect for human rights is guaranteed in the constitution
 and observed in practice. The Gambia attained independence
 in 1965, and since then has made significant progress in
 social and economic development.
 With an annual per capita income of $200, the Gambia is
 a poor nation. Because 85 percent of the work force is
 self-employed, mainly on farms, and because the agricultural
 sector is responsible for 55 percent of the gross hational
 product (GNP), the country's economy is especially sensitive
 to climatic conditions. Food crop production, including
 peanut exports, has suffered in recent years, due largely to
 unfavorable weather conditions. The Gambia's current Yive-
 year plan for economic and social development emphasizes
 rural development, improved health care, self-sufficiency in
 basic foodstuffs, a more equitable distribution of income,
 better educational opportunities and a wider participation of
 Gambians in the planning process and economic development.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Torture
 The constitution, Chapter III, Section 17, specifically
 states that "no person shall be subjected to torture or
 inhuman or degrading punishment." This prohibition is
 respected and enforced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Gambian law prohibits capital punishment; executions, summary
 or otherwise, are nonexistent. Sentences, fines and imprison-
 ment are uniformly administered based on the severity of the
 crime committed. Conditions in prisons and other places of
 detention meet internationally accepted standards and prison
 facilities are open to inspection by human rights groups.
 Hinimum and maximum security prisons are internally segregated
 on the basis of sex alone. Treatment of prisoners is fair
 and considerate.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no record, past or present, of persons being abducted,
 secretly arrested or held in clandestine detention by official
 or quasi-official security forces or by elements whose activ-
 ities are condoned by the Gambian government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There is no record in recent years of persons being arrested
 or detained without due process of law. There are no political
 prisoners in The Gambia. The right of habeas corpus is
 implicit in the constitution and is respected. Although
 preventive detention is permitted as an antidote to civil
 disturbance, the constitution states that a person arrested
 or detained on suspicion of a crime shall be brought "without
 
 
 99
 undue delay" before a court. In actual practice this is
 interpreted to be a period not to exceed 24 hours.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Articles 13 through 28 of the constitution guarantee everyone
 charged with a criminal offense a fair hearing within a
 reasonable period of time before an independent and impartial
 court established by law. The defendant is presumed innocent
 until-proven guilty and informed, in a language clearly
 -understood, of the nature of the offense charged. He is given
 adequate time and facilities for preparation of his defense,
 -permitted the right to legal counsel, granted the right to
 cross-examination of witnesses and permitted to have, without
 ,payment, the assistance of an interpreter if the language used
 at the trial cannot be understood.
 The Gambian judiciary is independent of the executive, and
 since there are no.armed forces, military courts do not exist.
 Verdicts of the lower courts may be appealed to the Court of.
 Appeals and the Supreme Court.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution in article 13 provides adequate and effec-
 tive safeguards to protect the individual's right to privacy.
 No person may be subjected to search, to seizure of his
 property or to arbitrary entry into his home without warrant.
 Exceptions are made only on the basis of (1) voluntary consent
 of the individual, or (2) a clearly demonstrated public good
 (i.e., defense, public safety, public order, public morality,
 public health).
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Every person in The Gambia is entitled to these basic economic
 rights, regardless of race, place of-origin, political opinion,
 color, creed-or sex. Economic conditions, however, militate
 against a satisfactory implementation of these rights. The
 .structure of the Gambian economy-remained virtually unchanged
 during the past year. Agriculture, primarily peanuts,. accounts
 for more than 55 percent of the gross.domestic product (GDP).
 Commerce and tourism comprise about..17 percent, and government
 and other service professions contribute an additional 12
 percent to the GDP. The outlook for peanut .export earnings is
 not promising. Although the-price will not deteriorate much
 further, the shortfall-in 1979/1980-because of bad weather has
 led to a decline in total earnings.
 The health profile of .the rural population is unchanged:
 life expectancy remains at 35 years and infant mortality
 in rural areas is estimated at 217-per thousand. The 2.8
 percent annual growth rate has consumed much of the increase
 in the GnP. Educational statistics show no real improvement,
 .and rural literacy rates remain at five percent. The lack of
 qualified professional management and technical manpower
 at all levels is a major hindrance to project preparation
 and execution.

 Despite these obstacles, the government is dedicated to
 reducing unemployment and narrowing the disparity between
 urban and rural incomes. Educational reforms implemented
 during the last decade emphasize vocational training of rural
 youth. Women remain decidedly underrepresented in the
 minuscule modern sector but the growth of tourism and light
 industry has assisted them in efforts to enter the labor
 market. Price incentives to cultivators, marketing reforms
 geared to agricultural diversification, improved public
 health and education in rural areas, creation of rural
 growth centers and expansion of the road network are primary
 objectives. Of the total planned expenditure, 17.5 percent
 has been allocated to agriculture, 53.8 percent to transpor-
 tation and communications and 19.3 percent to social infra-
 structure.
 Private property rights in The Gambia are guaranteed by
 statute.
 There is little concentration of wealth or economic oppor-
 tunity in any specific social class. Gambians of moderate
 wealth and most government officials maintain a modest style
 of living. The standard of living in The Gambia ranges from
 subsistence in the rural areas to slightly above marginal in
 the urban sectors. Public sector corruption seems to be
 increasing.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Gambia has a good record in granting and protecting
 the individual's rights to these basic freedoms.
 Censorship, whether of individuals or of the media, is
 nonexistent. Opposition viewpoints are discussed openly
 both on the radio and in printed media. Criticism of
 the government and government officials is tolerated openly
 and there is no interference with academic inquiry in the
 natural or social sciences.
 There are no restrictions on the individual's right to
 assemble freely and to associate with other persons.
 Gambians are permitted to form or belong to trade unions or
 other associations for the protection of mutual interests.
 Approximately 85 percent of The Gambia's population is
 Muslim, with the remaining 15 percent divided among Christian,
 Animist, and other faiths. Article 13 of the constitution,
 which is observed in practice, protects the individual's
 right to freedom of conscience, thought and religion, freedom
 to change religion or belief, and the freedom, either alone
 or in community with others, to practice and propagate
 religious beliefs. No person is compelled to take an oath
 which is contrary to the individual's own religion or belief.
 Also, no person attending any educational facility is com-
 pelled to receive instruction or attend any ceremony which
 contravenes his religious tenets.
 
 101
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement into, within or out
 of The Gambia and all citizens are immune from expulsion
 from the country.
 Small numbers of refugees have entered The Gambia from
 other, more drought-stricken regions of the Sahel. Lan-
 guage, tribal and ethnic similarity has facilitated refu-
 gees' rapid integration into the Gambian agricultural sector.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Gambia is a parliamentary-democracy based on a function-
 ing multiparty system. There are four parties: the govern-
 ing Progressive People's Party (PPP); the United Party (UP);
 the National Convention Party (NCP); and the National Libera-
 tion Party (NLP). Several-groups sharply critical of'Presi-
 dent Jawara have moved recently-to forge a new coalition
 under the banner of The Gambia Socialist Revolutionary Party
 (GSRP).
 There is full freedom, under the.law and in practice, to
 participate in the political process, which includes universal
 adult.sufferage. The Gambia has open elections in which the
 political parties participate freely. Opposing political
 views are broadcast and published freely.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violat-
 tions of Human Rights
 There is-no evidence of a pattern of human rights violations
 in The Gambia, and there are no outstanding requests for out-
 side investigations of human rights conditions within the coun-
 try. It is believed that the-government would respond favor-
 ably to such a request from ,any responsible organization. In
 June 1980 the Gambia hosted a 37-nation Organization of
 African Unity Conference on Human and People's Rights. In
 his keynote address, President Jawara stressed the need for
 fully international cooperation to implement basic human
 rights principles.
