 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal
 structure. Federal legislative power is vested in a bicameral
 legislature. Given its linguistic and religious diversity,
 Switzerland has developed a political system based on
 considerable autonomy for its 26 cantons'and on local and
 national political consensus.
 The Swiss armed forces are a militia based on universal
 military service for able-bodied males. There is virtually no
 standing army apart from training cadres and a few essential
 headquarters staff functions. Police duties are primarily a
 responsibility of the individual cantons, which have their own
 distinct police forces. The National Police Authority has a
 coordinating role and relies on the cantons for actual law
 enforcement.
 Switzerland has a mature, free-enterprise, industrial and
 service economy which is highly dependent on international
 trade. There has been virtual full employment and labor peace
 for many years. The standard of living is one of the highest
 in the world.
 There were no significant human rights problems during 1989.
 Switzerland maintained its own strong association with human
 rights issues, exemplified by hosting the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission in Geneva. The headquarters of the the
 International Labor Organization and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross are located in Switzerland.
 RESPECT FOR HUM4AN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abductions, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution provides freedom from all of the above, and
 there were no allegations of any violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile is provided
 by law. A detained person may not be held longer than 24
 hours without a warrant of arrest issued by the magistrate
 conducting the preliminary investigation. A suspect must
 -immediately be shown the warrant and has the right to contact
 legal counsel as soon as a warrant is issued. A suspect may
 be detained with a warrant until an investigation is completed,
 but the length of investigative detention is always reviewed
 by higher judicial authority, and investigations are typically
 completed quickly. Release on personal recognizance or bail
 is granted unless the examining magistrate believes the person
 is a danger to society or will not appear for trial. There is
 no summary exile, nor is exile used as a means of political

 control, although non-Swiss convicted of crimes may receive
 sentences which include denial of reentry for a specified
 period following completion of a prison sentence.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials. All courts of
 first instance are cantonal courts, with right of appeal to
 the Federal courts and freedom from interference by other
 branches'of government. Minor cases are tried by a single
 judge, difficult cases by a panel of judges, and murder or
 otber serious crimes by a public jury. Even the most serious'
 cases are usually brought to trial within a few months. There
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reported violations of this nature by Swiss
 authorities. Police entry into the premises of a person
 suspected of a criminal offense is regulated by cantonal
 legislation.' Regulations differ widely among the cantons.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning
 democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech
 and press. Groups or associations determined to be a potential
 threat to the State may have restrictions placed on their
 freedom of speech and press. No groups or associations are so
 designated at the present time. Broadcast media are government
 funded but possess editorial autonomy, and foreign broadcast
 media are freely available. Press and publishing are private
 enterprises operated without government intervention. Academic
 freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only restriction on peaceful assembly and association is a
 requirement to obtain permits from police authorities before
 holding public meetings. These are routinely granted unless
 authorities have reason to believe the meeting will lead to
 violence.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Switzerland enjoys religious freedom. There is no single
 state church but individual cantons may support a particular
 church out of public funds, and most cantons do so. Foreign
 clergy are free to perform their duties in Switzerland. The
 legal requirement for universal male military service provides
 no exemption for conscientious objectors. They may apply for
 military service which does not entail bearing arms, but in
 the past refusal to serve has nearly always led to prosecution
 and conviction. Efforts continued during 1989 to develop
 alternative service for those claiming exemption for reasons
 of conscience.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Swiss citizens have freedom to travel in or outside the
 country and can emigrate without difficulty. Switzerland has
 traditionally been a haven for refugees, but public concern
 over the growing number of asylum seekers, many of whom come
 for economic reasons, sparked a government review of existing
 policy. Although some asylum seekers were forced back into
 Italy as they attempted to cross the border, there were no
 cases of refugees being forced to return to countries in which
 they fear persecution.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Switzerland is a highly developed constitutional democracy.
 There is universal adult suffrage by secret ballot in Federal
 elections. Elections are free and actively contested by four
 major national parties and at least a dozen significant
 regional or minor parties. Initiative and referendum
 procedures provide unusually intense popular involvement in
 the legislative process. Participation by women in politics
 has been limited historically but continues to expand slowly.
 One of the smallest and most rural of the 26 cantons still
 excludes female suffrage at the cantonal level.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Switzerland cooperates with international and nongovernmental
 groups in all areas of human rights. All major international
 human rights groups are active in Switzerland, and some of the
 leading ones--e.g., the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)--are
 based there. The ICRC is made up of Swiss nationals, and
 Swiss play prominent roles in other humanitarian
 nongovernmental organizations. Human rights advocacy groups
 in Switzerland concern themselves almost exclusively with
 lobbying the Swiss and other Governments about human rights
 situations in other countries. During 1988 the European Court
 of Human Rights found against Switzerland in a case of a
 complaint by a woman who alleged that her legal rights had
 been violated by an investigating magistrate in one of the
 cantons. The Swiss changed legal procedures in 1989 to
 prevent any repetition of this problem.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination against
 women in the workplace, government and other sources noted in
 1989 that further implementation was necessary to ensure equal
 pay and other benefits for women. Switzerland created a
 special government office of equal rights for men and women to
 -address this problem. A Federal Commission for Women's Rights
 and several private groups, such as the Federation of Women's
 organizations, monitor and promote women's rights. The
 discrimination that persists today is typically social, not
 legal, but it nevertheless hinders opportunities for women in
 fields that have been traditionally dominated by men.
 Swiss policymakers have become aware in recent years of the
 issue of violence toward women. Observers believe that many
 
 
 1258
 5WITZERLAND
 cases go unreported, so that accurate statistics are lacking.
 There is, however, widespread agreement that a problem
 exists. The Federation of Women's Organizations and other
 women's advpcacy groups have heightened public consciousness.
 Each city has an emergency telephone number through which
 women who are victims of violence can obtain help and
 counseling. Specialists work with police authorities to
 interview women who report attacks. Appropriate laws exist
 against wife beating and similar crimes, although there is
 some disagreement among Swiss as to whether existing law
 adequately 'prohibits spousal rape. While the penal code is
 established at the Federal level, enforcement is the
 responsibility of the cantons. Thus, variations in
 enforcement can occur.
 Italian and Romansch linguistic minorities (respectively about
 iG and 1 percent of the population) express concern that the
 limited resources made available to them by the Federal
 Government endanger the continued intellectual vitality of
 these languages.' Some argue that this amounts to deprivation
 of freedom of speech. The Federal Government's announced
 policy is to'ensure, through careful apportionment of funds,
 that all linguistic groups have commensurate facilities and
 means to carry out cultural activities in their own
 languages. Employment opportunities and residence permits are
 limited for foreigners. Some assert that this reflects racial
 prejudice and discrimination, but these limitations apply to
 all non-Swiss. There is no discrimination on religious
 grounds.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers, including foreign workers in Switzerland, have
 freedom to associate freely, to join unions of their choice,
 and to select their own representatives. Unions are free to
 publicize their views and determine their own programs and
 policies to represent member interests without government
 interference. Unions may join federations or international
 bodiez. Swiss trade union federations belong to the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World
 Confederation of Labor, as well as to the European Trade Union
 Confederation. The right to strike is legally unfettered, but
 a unique labor peace agreement betweeA unions and employers
 has provided a nearly strike-free environment for over 50
 years.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Swiss law provides workers the right to organize and bargain
 collectively and protects workers from acts of antiunion
 discrimination. The industrial sector is generally unionized;
 in the service sector, union membership is less general. The
 Government encourages voluntary negotiations between employer
 and worker organizations, although for the most part employers
 and workers alike (in common with most Swiss institutions)
 seek successfully to exclude the Government from involving
 itself in their affairs. There are no export processing zones
 in Switzerland.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor. While there is no
 specific statute or constitutional ban on compulsory labor,
 
 
 1259
 SWITZERLAND
 legislation regulating conditions of employment and,
 specifically, the rights of a worker upon terminating
 employment, make clear that compulsory labor would be illegal.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 15 years.
 Children over 13 may be employed in light duties (e.g.,
 helping in retail stores) for not more than 9 hours a week
 during the school year and 15 hours otherwise. Employment
 between ages 15 and 20 is strictly regulated. For example,
 youths may not work at night, on Sundays, or under hazardous
 or dangerous conditions. These laws are observed in practice
 and enforced through inspections by the Federal Office of
 Industry, Trades, and Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minimum wage. Employer associations and
 unions negotiate industrial wages during the collective
 bargaining process. The Labor Act established a maximum
 45-hour workweek for blue- and white-collar workers in
 industry, offices, and retail trades, and a 50-hour workweek
 for all other workers. The workweek for blue-collar workers
 in most industries is 43 hours and for white-collar workers 40
 to 43 hours. Overtime is limited by law to 120 hours
 annually. The economy is normally at or near full
 employment. The resulting take-home pay provides Swiss
 workers and their families with a standard of living that is
 among the highest in the world.
 The Labor Act and The Federal Code of Obligations contain
 extensive regulations to protect worker health and safety.
 The regulations are enforced, providing a high standard of
 worker health and safety. Female workers may not be employed
 in dangerous work, and women in industrial enterprises may not
 work at night or on Sundays. These special protections came
 under review in 1989. The Government proposed to eliminate
 restrictions against female Sunday or weekend work in its
 effort to remove sexist bias from the labor law. There were
 no allegations of worker rights abuses from any domestic or
 foreign source.
