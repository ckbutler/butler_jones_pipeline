 FRANCE
 France is a constitutional democracy with freely-functioning
 political parties and regular elections.      Its leaders are
 popularly elected, with every adult citizen of both sexes
 having the unimpeded right to the vote.   The presidential and
 legislative elections of 1981, which resulted in a major change
 of political power, reconfirmed the fundamental commitment of
 France to a democratic system.      During 1982, canton-level
 elections were held, and political parties began preparing for
 nation-wide municipal elections in March 1983.
 The economy is highly developed, and contains a mixture of
 public and private enterprise. Since the Mitterrand Government
 took office, a number of private companies and most of the
 remaining private banks were nationalized.   However, there is
 still a large private sector.
 The current Government remains committed to the maintenance of
 full respect for human rights, and there is strong support for
 this policy among the society at large.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The Government does not condone political killing.     In 1982
 acts  of  terrorism  increased  significantly, most   of  them
 apparently carried out by non-French groups with ties to Middle
 East  and   Armenian  terrorist  organizations.   An  unknown
 "Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Front" claimed responsibility for
 the murder of a US Army Officer assigned to the American
 Embassy, as well as for the assassination of an Israeli
 diplomat. One other Embassy officer was also a target of an
 assassination attempt during 1982, and there were a number of
 threats to US personnel and facilities.     Some international
 terrorist incidents appeared to have anti-Semitic overtones.
 In August gunmen attacked a popular restaurant in Paris' Jewish
 quarter, killing six, including two American tourists, and
 wounding  22 others.    The French  Government condemned   the
 terrorist attacks and adopted a series of counter-terrorist
 measures.  One indigenous anarchist group, "Direct Action",
 with  ill-defined  motives,   has also   engaged  in terrorist
 activity, as have Corsican nationalist extremists.
 b. Disappearance
 There has been no evidence that security forces have engaged in
 abduction or secret arrest.
 c. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. There have been no credible allegations of the use
 of torture.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom  from   cruel,  inhuman  or   degrading  treatment  or
 punishment is guaranteed by law. No reports have been received
 of ill treatment of prisoners. Prison facilities are adequate,
 
 
 897
 and generally are well maintained.    Reimbursed work programs
 are widely available to inmates, the parole system is liberal,
 and the possibility exists of periodic release for family
 visits.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed by
 French law. There have.been no allegations of persons detained
 for political reasons. There is no direct equivalent of habeas
 corpus in the French legal system, but a suspect can only be
 held by the police one, or at most two, days before being
 transferred to a magistrate for investigation.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected  in practice.   Suspects have the right to legal
 counsel as soon as a case is transferred from the police to a
 magistrate.  Pre-trial confinement in the magistrate phase is
 limited to four months for misdemeanors, but can be longer in
 cases of felony. French law provides for the right of appeal.
 Amnesty International expressed some concern about the status
 of conscientious objectors and the possibly prejudicial use of
 summary judicial procedures in misdemeanor cases, but noted
 both  issues were   scheduled  for  Parliamentary  review  and
 reform.  The Amnesty International report for 1982 also noted
 that because of legislative changes introduced in the second
 half of 1981, its previous concerns had abated.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. .Search warrants are required for an
 official to enter a private residence.     Searches must take
 place between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., except in special cases such
 as drug offenses, when they can be undertaken at any time.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These  freedoms  are, guaranteed  by   law  and  respected  in
 practice.  Newspapers and magazines are free from government
 .control and carry views ranging across the political spectrum.
 Major radio and television stations are government-owned.   In
 1982, in a move to      separate  the  Government  from direct
 involvement with radio and TV,  these media have been put under
 Jurisdiction of a "High Authority'! whose appointment is shared
 among the. President, the National Assembly, and the Senate.
 .(Opposition parties currently control the latter institution.)
 .Allegations of government pressure on television and radio
 continue to be heard, and denied.      To the extent that it
 sexists, government pressure on the audiovisual media is not a
 .significant limitation on political freedom.
 , b.. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom  . of   peaceful  ..assembly.  and    association   is
 .constitutionally -guaranteed and respected  in practice.  Labor
 unions  have  the  right . tc. organize .. free  from  government
 control.   Although only roughly-20 percent of the. labor force
 is ounionized, -trade unions exercise a, significant. influence on
 the economic and political life of the country and are present
 
 
 898
 and  active  in  numerous  tripartite  (government, employers,
 labor) bodies which deal with social affairs, including labor
 courts and the prestigious Economic and Social Council, a
 constitutionally-mandated consultative body.  Trade unions are
 free to associate with political parties and with international
 labor groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Roman Catholic Church is by far the largest religious group
 in France. Separation of church and state is guaranteed by the
 French 1905 Concordat with the Vatican (except in Alsace and
 Lorraine where, for historic reasons, the Concordat does not
 apply and the Catholic Church enjoys a favored status).    All
 other religious groups function freely without persecution or
 restriction.  Government service is open to members of all
 religions. There are parochial as well as public schools.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There  is   freedom  of  internal  movement,  foreign  travel,
 emigration, and repatriation.    Arriving refugees, intending
 emigrants, and   intending repatriates can undertake foreign
 travel and return to France.  France has an extensive record of
 refugee aid.  As of the end of 1982 France had accepted well
 over 100,000 Indochinese refugees.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The French Constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens
 before the law, without distinction as to origin, race, or
 religion. All French.citizens of both sexes who have reached
 their majority may vote. These provisions are fully respected
 in practice. A wide choice of political parties exists; these
 parties compete freely in elections.   In addition to national
 presidential and legislative elections, there are regularly
 scheduled elections at the local level. The Government is in
 the  process of   transferring  significant  powers  from  the
 executive  branch   to   locally-elected  assemblies.   Women,
 representing approximately 52 percent of the population, have
 equal  status  under  the  law, but   remain  engaged  in  the
 continuing. effort to maintain and strengthen their rights.  A
 Cabinet-level ministry   is charged  with   responsibility  for
 women's affairs.   In- 1982 the French Government promoted
 efforts to   close  loopholes  in French   legislation on sex
 discrimination in the workplace, to disseminate information on
 contraception, and to put-into force partial state financing of
 abortions. A wide range of special interest groups -- labor,
 veterans, consumer advocates, ecologists, and other groups --
 organize  freely, run   candidates  for  elective  office  and
 otherwise influence the French body politic. Legislation over
 the past year has been enacted to broaden civil liberties.
 While isolated incidents of discrimination occur, particularly
 against the large guest-worker community, government policy
 does not condone'racial, religious, or political discrimination.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 France has traditionally been a leader in the human rights
 area.  Human rights :organizations operate freely in France.
 Amnesty International maintains a large office in Paris. Other
 
 
 899
 human rights organizations in France are the International
 Federation for Human Rights -and the International Institute for
 Human Rights.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 France has an advanced .-industrial mixed economy which     is
 accompanied by a system of social assistance to needy members
 of the population regardless of, race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.   France's population as of
 1981 was 53,849,000.   Population growth rate is 0.4 percent.
 GNP per capita is $11,731 (1980). Life expectancy at birth was
 74 years (as of 1980) and the infant mortality rate is 9.8/i000
 as of 1981.    Adult literacy rate is 99 percent (1975), the
 primary school enrollment ratio is 112 percent (i.e., including
 adults enrolled), and the ratio of calorie supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements is 136 percent
 (1977).
