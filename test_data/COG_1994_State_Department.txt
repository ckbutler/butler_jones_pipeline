 CONGO
 The effort to establish democratic government in the Republic of Congo was se-
 verely tried by episodes of violent civil unrest during 1993 and early 1994. President
 Pascal Lissouba, freely elected in 1992, governs with the parliamentary support of
 a group of parties known as the Presidential Movement. This coalition won a major-
 ity in 1993 legislative elections which the political opposition challenged, claiming
 that the first round of those elections was fraudulent. In May 1993 the opposition
 boycotted the second round, leading to violence in June and July. The Organization
 of African Unity and Gabon brokered a peace agreement (the Libreville Accords) in
 August 1993, but violence in the capital, Erazzaville, erupted again in late 1993 and
 continued through January 1994. The Government and the opposition signed a
 oeace accord on January 30.
 In early February, under the Libreville Accords, international jurists completed
 their examination of 58 accusations of fraud, finding fraud in nine district elec-
 tions-three from the Presidential Movement and six from the opposition. A few
 months later the Presidential Movement, in cooperation with the opposition, began
 to decentralize power to the regions and the municipalities, a process which c1l
 minated in the installation of Bernard Kolelas, a major opposition figure, as Mayor
 of Brazzaville, and Jean-Pierre Thystere-Tchicaya, another opposition leader, as
 Mayor of Pointe-Noire.
 During the civil unrest, the official security apparatus, composed of the military
 and police, lost control over certain elements and individuals. The major political
 parties established private militias, which included police and army personnel who
 had tmporarily deserted their units. These private militias were responsible for the
 bulk of human rights abuses, but government troops also committed extrjudicial
 killings, and the police continued to use torture andothr brutal measures against
 detainees. The Government failed in most cases to idnti1 andpunish the perpetra-
 tors. Drawing from the army, the Government formed the pcial Interposition
 Group (GSIP) in January to dampen continued ethnically-motivated civil violene.
 theiSIP played an important reconciliation role by maintaining calm in formerly
 embattled nei hborhoods. Public security forces also integrated some members of
 the private miitias into their formal ranks but have insufficient funds to continue
 this process.
 D The economy, which is heavily dependent upon petroleum revenues and external
 borrowing, continued its transition from socialismto a free market system. Faced
 
 
 55
 with low oil prices and an extremely high per capita debt, Congo began implementa-
 tion of structural adjustment measures and free market economic policies.
 The human rights situation remained poor. Abuses perpetrated by the private mi-
 litias included extrajudicial killing, kidnaping, torture, and looting, but their fre-
 quency decreased significantly after the January 30 signature of the peace accord.
 Deplorable prison conditions, police brutality, societal discrimination against
 women, and exploitation of Pygmies in remote areas by Bantu farmers persisted.
 Congo's strong worker rights provisions remained intact.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KRlling.-Supporters of the Government and
 the opposition were implicatedin extrajudicial killings as were some police units--
 the so-called Aubevillois. Estimates of the number killed from November 1993 to
 January 1994 range from several hundred to 2,000. Deaths due to continuing politi-
 cal violence after January 1994 are rumored at 10 to 30 persons, but accurate esti-
 mates are unavailable. The Government was slow to take measures to end the vio-
 lence and slow to identify and punish the perpetrators. Victims appear to have been
 targeted principally on the basis of ethnic and political affiliation. Members of
 groups at both ends of the political spectrum purged ethnic majority neighborhoods
 of minority ethnic groups through the use of arson, looting, and assassination. In
 an industrial strike in September, the army fired into a crowd of machete-wielding
 protesters, killing one person and injuring several others.
 b. Disappearance.-There were numerous credible reports of kidnaping and dis-
 appearances, both political and for ransom, but no firm numerical estimates exist.
 Leaders of both sides tacitly admitted, by participating in hostae exchange negotia-
 tions, that their partisans engaged in kidnaping. Although sustantially reduced,
 kidnaping remained a political weapon. The Government ailed to investigate seri-
 ously those security service personnel or private militia members who were impli-
 cated in disappearances.
 The easing of political tensions has allowed authorities to begin bringing criminals
 to justice without fear of accusations of political motive. They investigated and ar-
 rested individuals of all ethnic origins who had used political conflict as a pretext
 for their activities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture and "cruel, inhuman, or degrading"
 treatment. Nonetheless, there continue to be reliable reports of torture and rape by
 members of the security forces and the opposition militias. Army, police, an cus-
 toms officials continued their physical abuse of detainees, both to extract informa-
 tion and as punishment. Some military and security force leaders tacitly condoned
 such beatings; they failed to punish offenders or to provide effective training in the
 lawful treatment of suspects.
 Prison conditions are dire and life-threatening. The death rate, and the incidence
 of disease and malnutrition are considerably higher than among the civilian popu-
 lation. Buildings are dilapidated, security is lax, and food and medical care are inad-
 equate. Most prisons, built during French colonial rule, were not designed for long-
 term incarceration. Dozens of prisoners are often kept in overcrowded cells for long
 periods of time, sleeping on the floor and subsisting on one meal per day. Catholic
 missionaries work with prisoners to improve living conditions but with limited suc-
 cess.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile. While the Code of Penal Procedure requires that all detain-
 ees be apprehended openly and have a lawyer present during initial questioning, po-
 lie often ignored these requirements. Acording to the Code, the Prosecutor's Office
 must issue these warrants and the authorities must bring detainees before a judge
 within 3 days and charge or release them within 4 months. The authorities often
 fail to enforce these requirements as well.
 Lawyers have free access to their imprisoned clients. Over half of all persons in
 custody are pretrial detainees. The Ministry of Justice estimates that the average
 detention is less than 6 months. Although the Penal Code provides that defendants
 have the right to be represented by lawyers of their choice and the State will pay
 legal fees for the indigent, the authorities do not enforce this in practice.
 From November 1993 to January 1994, partisans on all sides engaged in arbitrary
 arrests and kidnapings, often for ransom or use in hostage exchanges. No reliable
 estimates of the number arbitrarily arrested and detained exist. At year's end, the
 Government was not known to be holding any political detainees.
 Political exile is not used.
 
 
 56
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system consists primarily of local
 courts, courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court. In rural areas, traditional courts
 continued to handle many local disputes, especially property and probate cases.
 Many domestic disputes are adjudicated under traditional law and Within the ex-
 tended family.
 Some cases never reach the court system, however. For example, it is common
 practice for citizens to beat thieves caught in the act, sometimes to death. In gen-
 eral, defendants are tried in a public court of law presided over by a state-appointed
 magistrate. The defense has access to, and the right to counter, prosecution evidence
 and testimony. Defendants are presumed innocent and have the right to appeal.
 There are credible reports of prisoners languishing-sometimes for years-in ja be-
 cause of lost files, oversights, and bureaucratic inertia. The judiciary is overbur-
 dened with a caseload that far exceeds its capacity to ensure fair, public trials.
 Supreme Court justices are appointed for life; lower court judges may serve until
 age 65. There were no known cases of termination_ or transfer of a judge for political
 reasons. At year's end, the Government was not known to be holding any political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects the privacy of homes as well as correspondence and tele-
 communications. Official searches of private properties and communications require
 a warrant, but in practice warrants are not umformly served. There is widespread
 belief that the Government continues to tap telephones.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pres.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and calls for the establishment of a special council to safeguard speech and
 press freedoms. Despite constitutional and judicial protections, the media enjoy only
 limited freedom. People talk openly and opposition newspapers circulate freely, but
 the Government retains control over broadcast media. Censorship declined from
 1993, but the state media still practiced it in 1994. Despite the State's monopoly
 on local radio and television, which are the principal means of public communica-
 tion, it increased opposition journalists' access to radio and television and permitted
 them to broadcast political debates.
 Tn March the Government attempted to prohibit state-employed  urnalists from
 serving as stringers for international news agencies, but suspended its efforts after
 journalists protested. Subs ent to the expulsion of a Radio France International
 (RFI) correspondent in late 1993, the Government negotiated the rebroadcast from
 Brazzaville of two foreign stations, including RFI.
 In June the Government detained a state-employed journalist for 2 days following
 an interview with former President and opposition leader Denis Sassou-Nguesso.
 The Government officially reprimanded the journalist for failing to seek approval to
 take state equipment to the remote site of the interview. In a similar case in No-
 vembr, the Government suspended a journalist for 3 weeks for failing to obtain
 prior permission to interview an opposition party leader on television, incidents of
 this nature are, however, uncommon.
 There were no known abridgements of academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. In practice, any group wishing to hold a public
 assembly must inform the Minister of Interior, who reserves the right to forbid as-
 semblies which in the Government's view threaten public order. The Minister of In-
 teor, claiming a threat to public order, denied one of several requests by students
 seeking to protest the nonpayment of scholarships. There are no restrictions on
 trade associations or professional bodies, and affiliation with international bodies is
 permitted.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution forbids discrimination based on reli-
 gious beliefs. In practice, people arefee to join any church and practice any reli-
 gion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-he Constitution rovides for the right of all citizens to circulate freely
 within Ciong, and it specieicay prohibits roadblocks and barricades. Nonetheless,
 soldier and political militia hindered free movement with barricades in early 1994.
 The National Conference Charter of Rights gives all citizens the right to travel
 abroad and to return. At year's end Congo hosted some 13,500 refugees, the major-
 ity of whomuwere Angolans from the Cabinda enclave. Refugees are registered with
 the United Nations High Commisioner for Refugees, the United Nations Develop-
 ment Program, and the Government, and are allowed to work and to establish reo-
 dency. They may apply for citizenship after 10 years of continuous residence. There
 were no known cases of forced repatriation or deportation of refugees.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The President and the National Assembly were elected in 1992 and 1993 respec-
 tively. The opposition disputed the legislative elections claiming the results were
 fraudulent. An international panel of jurists rejected all but 9 of 58 accusations of
 fraud. Six of the nine fraudulently elected deputies were from the opposition parties,
 while three were members of the Presidential Movement. Despite President
 Lissouba's victory in 1992 and his coalition's victory in the 1993 legislative elections,
 the opposition continued to resist his rule and tried to wrest power from him
 through political maneuvers and armed resistance until the signature of the Janu-
 1994 peace accord.
 arThe Constitution divides power between the Presidency and a Government headed
 by a Prime Minister and formed with the approval of the National Assembly. The
 onstitution provides for 5-year terms of office for the President and National As-
 sembly Deputies, all elected by universal suffrage, and 6-year terms for Senators,
 who are chosen by local councils. International monitors have observed the last sev-
 eral rounds of elections and have found them to be free and fair.
 The Issouba Government sought to create a representative Government by ap-
 pointing members of each geographical region in the Cabinet. However, members of
 he Prsident's ethnic group occupy the key ministerial portfolios. Women occupy 2
 of the 28 Cabinet posts. Indigenous Pygmies, living in remote regions, are largely
 excluded from the political process (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vesttion of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local human rights organizations remained active, including the National
 Committee on Human Rights, the Congolese Human Rights League, and Committee
 of the Congolese Association of Women Lawyers. All freely criticize government
 human rights violations as well as abusive and discriminatory aspects of some tradi-
 tional local customs.
 The Government permits international nongovernmental organizations to operate
 freely.
 Sectigti            ion Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Dsabiliy, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically forbids such discrimination, but it persists in fact,
 particularlagis Pygmies and women.
 Women.-ithough the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex and
 specifically endorses the right of women to earn equal pay for equal work, discrimi-
 nation against women is widespread. Inequities persist in salaries, employment op-
 portunities, and access to education.
 While traditional inheritance customs favor maternal links, marriage and family
 laws overtly discriminate against women. For example adultery is illegal for women
 but not for men. Polygyny is legal;lyandy is not. Vomen in rural areas are espe-
 cially disadvantagedin terms of edcation and wage employment and are confined
 largely to family farm work, petty commerce, and childrearing responsibilities.
 Nonetheless, educated women are making some limited progress in profesional em-
 ploeyment.
 Violence against women occurs frequently. Wife beating is a continuing abuse, but
 cases are usually handled within the extended family; police rarely intervene in do-
 mestic disputes. Only in extreme instances of abuse do courts prosecute these cases.
 The general population and the media largely ignore the issue of violence against
 women.
 Children.-The Constitution states that the Government must protect children in
 accordance with international conventions. Child labor is illegal, and education is
 mandatory until age 16. In practice, limited state resources prevent achievement of
 these objectives, particularly in rural areas.
 Natiohnal/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution provides the same rights
 for Pygmies, an ethnic minority numbering apprximately 7,000 and living pri-
 marily in the northern forest regions, as it does for other citizens. In practice--in
 a society in which Bantu Congolese predominate in every respect--they d not enjoy
 equal treatment. Pygmy workers are generally underpaid for their work relative to
 others, with compensation often being in the form of clothing, food, or other goods
 instead of wages. This practice has its roots in the anestral tradition of Pygmy
 slavery maintained by Bantus. Ithe past, Pygmies were denied access to public
 education, health, and-other basic services, and the right to own prope. Pygmies
 have traditionally been excluded from the political process, and they have little abil-
 ity to influence government decisions affecting their interests.
 
 
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides the disabled 'specific meas-
 ures of protection in relation to their needs." In practice this means very little, al-
 though the Government has provided special education to some disabled students
 and hand-powered tricycles to some polio victims. The Ministry charged with the
 welfare of the disabled is hampered by severe financial constraints. The country has
 not implemented laws mandating access for people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both the Constitution and the Labor Code affirm the
 right of workers to associate freely, allowing no restrictions on the formation of
 trade unions. Nearly all workers in the formal (wage) sector are union members
 and unions have made efforts to organize informal sectors such as agriculture and
 retail.
 Unions are free to join or form new federations or confederations. The formerly
 monolithic Congolese Trade Union Confederation (CSC) fractured into six independ-
 ent union confederations in 1994; the State has formally recognized all of them.
 They are dependent on the voluntary contributions of their membership. There are
 some links between the Government and union leadership. The Secretary-General
 of the CSC is a member of the National Assembly, and the head of the Union Con-
 federation of Congolese Workers (CSTC), Congo's second largest union, is serving in
 the office of the mayor of Brazzaville.
 Unions are free to strike but must file a letter of intent with the Ministry of Labor
 beforehand, thereby starting a process of arbitration. In theory, a strike may not
 take place until both parties have submitted to a process of nonbinding arbitration
 under the auspices of a regional labor inspector from the Labor Ministry. The letter
 of intent must include the strike date, at which time the strike may legally begin
 even if arbitration is not complete. Employers have the right to fire workers if they
 ive no notification in advance of a strike. In practice, the Ministry seldom enforces
 this aspect of the Labor Code, and workers hnave initiated many strikes without
 prior attempts to resolve disputes through arbitration.
 In 1994 the CSTC called three general strikes for immediate payment of salary
 arrears by the State. The first strike was postponed by the union leadership, and
 the second failed to generate support. The Government responded to most union de-
 mands before the third had begun. The Government reportedly threatened to keep
 lists of government employees who failed to report for work, implicitly for use in
 civil service work force reduction.
 In Septemb:er, sugar factory workers went on strike for standardization of their
 salaries and allowances, a reduction in workload, and free medical treatment. The
 Army shot into a crown of machete-wielding protesters, killing one person and injur-
 ig several others (see Section L.a.).
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade unions. Some trade unions
 have signed cooperative accords with other African, European, and American trade
 union organizations. Although the CSC has not formally disaffiliated from the once
 Commumst-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions, the relationship has all
 but dissolved due to lack of interest or funding.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain (Tollectively.-With union attention ab-
 sorbed by current economic problems and the Government in the midst of structural
 adjustment efforts, the National Assembly has only initiated deliberations to revise
 the Labor Code. In the past many benefits were legally mandated, and industry-spe-
 cific wage scales ("Conventions") were determined by negotiated agreement between
 union representatives, employers, the Ministry of Labor, and the CSC. At present,
 unions may negotiate freely, either independently or in cooperation with other
 unions, federations, or confederations.
 Under the Constitution employers are prohibited from discriminating against em-
 ployees who exercise their Constitutional right to organize or join a union. There
 were no reported firings for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and there was no evidence of its practice in the formal economy.
 There were, however, allegations that Pygmies experienced exploitation (see Section
 5).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution prohibits chil-
 dren under the age of 16 from working. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for en-
 forcing child labor laws but concentrated its efforts on the formal wage sector.
 Young children continued to work on small family subsistence farms in rural areas
 and in the informal sector in cities without government intervention.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a minimum wage of
 about $44 (CFA 23,500) per month, a level which the Government claims allows for
 
 
 "human dignity." However, high urban prices and dependent extended families
 oblige many workers to seek out opportunities beyond their main employment and
 practice subsistence agriculture. In 1994 this was particularly true for government
 workers, who were forced to cope with salary backlogs of several months. In those
 trades still subject to "Conventions" (see Section 6.b.), the negotiated minimum
 wages were without exception considerably higher than the legal minimum.
 The Constitution provides for not only reasonable pay, but also paid holidays,
 periodic paid vacations, and legal limits on allowable hours of work. The Labor Code
 stipulates that overtime must be paid for all work in excess of 40 hours per week
 and regular days of leisure must be granted by employers. Although health and
 safety regulations require twice yearly visits by enforcement officers from the Min-
 istry of Labor, in practice such inspections occur on a much less regular basis. There
 is no specific regulation granting workers the right to remove themselves from haz-
 ardous situations without jeopardy to continued employment, but unions were gen-
 erally vigilant in calling attention to such situations.
