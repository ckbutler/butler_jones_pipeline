 GHANA
 Ghana continues its transition from a single-party, authoritarian system to a con-
 stitutional democracy. Flight Lieutenant (ret.) Jerry John Rawlings has ruled the
 country for 16 years. He became the first President of the Fourth Republic following
 controversial elections in 1992. This ended 11 years of authoritarian rule under
 Rawlings and his Provisional National Defense Council (PNDC), which had seized
 power from an elected government in 1981. The opposition fully contested the De-
 cember 7 presidential and parliamentary elections, which were described as peace-
 ful, free, and transparent by domestic and international observers. President
 Rawlings was reelected with 57 percent of the popular vote. Rawling's NDC party
 won 133 of the Parliament's 200 seats. The Constitution calls for a system of checks
 and balances, with an executive branch headed by the President, a unicameral Par-
 liament, an independent judiciary, and several autonomous commissions, such as
 the Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ). In reality
 this system of checks and balances is circumscribed by a Parliament monopolized
 by the President's party, a hesitant judicial service, and a system-wide lack of re-
 sources which hobbles the effectiveness of all three branches. The election of a sig-
 nificant number of opposition parliamentarians, however, may provide a more open
 process and debate in Parliament. The judiciary is subject to executive influence and
 lacks adequate resources.
 Several security organizations report to various government departments. The po-
 lice, under the jurisdiction of an 8-member Police Council, are responsible for main-
 taining law and order. An independent department, the Bureau of National Inves-
 tigations (BNI) handles cases considered critical to state security and answers di-
 rectly to the executive branch. Although the security apparatus is controlled by and
 responsive to the Government, monitoring, supervision, and education of the police
 in particular remain poor. Credible allegations continue of police involvement in
 human rights abuses, especially in areas remote from the capital.
 The economy remains highly dependent on agriculture, with about 45 percent of
 gross domestic product derived from this sector. Gold, cocoa, and timber are the tra-
 ditional sources of export earnings with gold growing in importance. The economy
 grew at a 4.5 percent rate in 1995, up from the 3.8 percent recorded in 1994. In-
 creased gold production and a good cocoa harvest accounted for the slightly higher
 growth rate. However, inflation accelerated dramatically during 1995 and 1996 and
 at year-end registered 40 to 45 percent. The privatization of state-owned enterprises
 continues, but the pace of divestiture remains slow.
 The Government's human rights record improved slightly, but problems remain
 in several areas. There were continued credible reports that members of the police
 beat prisoners and other citizens; arbitrarily arrested and detained persons; used
 excessive force, which resulted in a few instances of deaths in custody;, and infringed
 on citizens' right to privacy. Newly organized municipal security forces, which fall
 outside the regular police service, injured a number of persons in using excessive
 force to control street vendors and public demonstrations. Prison conditions re-
 mained harsh despite modest reforms, and prolonged pretrial detentions remained
 a problem. Inadequate resources and a system vulnerable to political influence com-
 promised the integrity of the overburdened judicial system. The Government failed
 to investigate the deaths of four demonstrators during a 1995 antigovernment pro-
 test.
 The Government pressured the media. It resorted to an obscure 1960 law to pros-
 ecute several journalists, and there were a spate of criminal and civil libel suits that
 seemed to signal possible official harassment of the independent press. Neverthe-
 less, the small but independent press, human rights monitoring groups, and opposi-
 tion parties were again vigorous and out-spoken in criticizing various aspects of gov-
 ernment policy. The CHRAJ, a government body, issued a critical report on the pris-
 on system and was successful in arbitrating individual human rights cases and in
 educating the public. Several new independent radio stations reflected the Govern-
 ment's public commitment to open airwaves.
 The Government carefully controlled all aspects of the preelection procedures, but
 the participation of eight political parties and a large citizen turnout highlighted the
 gradually improving human rights situation.
 Traditional practices still result in considerable discrimination and abuse of
 women and children, with violence against women a particular problem.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. However, on two separate occasions in attempting to control crowds, poorly
 trained Kumasi police killed two persons, reportedly as a result of stray bullets from
 warning shots. Police fired shots that accidentally killed a man after a December
 1995 soccer match that ended in violence between the teams' supporters. In January
 another person was killed by a stray police bullet when police attempted to disperse
 demonstrating students who had erected road blocks. Police authorities announced
 that rubber bullets and water cannons had been ordered for crowd control.
 There were two reports in the press of possible wrongful deaths of suspects in po-
 lice custody. In January the official press reported that the authorities in the north-
 ern region had prosecuted two policemen for using excessive force in the death of
 a detainee, but that a court had subsequently acquitted the officers. In another case,
 at year's end the authorities had still not clarified or made arrests in the unex-
 plained death of a man in a Central Region police cell in February, and the case
 remained open.
 The Government continued to refuse to launch an inquiry into the deaths of four
 demonstrators during a prtest of government tax policy in May 1995. There was
 credible evidence that the Minister of Youth and Sports bad organized and armed
 the counter-demonstrators who were responsible for the killings. A police commit-
 tee's report about the events surrounding the killings has never been publicly re-
 leased. The police, however, claimed at a 1995 press conference that they were un-
 able to identify any specific individuals responsible and that the matter was thus
 closed. The Minister of Youth and Sports has charged an independent newspaper
 with libel for reporting on the 1995 U.S. Government report on human rights prac-
 tices in Ghana and his possible involvement in the killings.
 In 1995 the police beat a Tetrem man in the Ashanti region who subsequently
 died. A police service inquiry determined that one of the two officers involved was
 primarily responsible for the suspect's death. Over 18 months later, the police offi-
 cer's trial had not yet begun although the Attorney General has requested that the
 officer be charged with manslaughter. It is generally believed that severe beatings
 such as this occur throughout the country but go largely unreported.
 Journalists were unsuccessful in their continued efforts to persuade the Govern-
 ment to investigate extrajudicial killings in the early years of PNDC rule, despite
 police professions in 1993 of willingness to investigate such killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that the dignity of all persons shall he inviolable and that
 no one shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment, or any other condition that detracts from human dignity. Nonethe-
 less, there were continued credible reports that members of the police beat prisoners
 and other citizens. Police used excessive force in attempting to control crowds, at
 times resulting in citizens' deaths (see Section L.a.).
 Security forces outside the control of the police service made a high-profile debut
 in 1996 and proved a threat to civil liberties. The Mayor's office in Accra dispatched
 a specially trained force, known as the City Crime Combating and Cleaning Unit,
 to eject forcefully unlicensed street vendors from city streets. The special force in-
 flicted physical injuries on a number of vendors and destroyed much of their prop-
 erty. After withdrawing the forces for retraining, the Metropolitan Assembly decided
 in November to negotiate with the traders to resettle them in other less congested
 areas. In Tema a metropolitan security unit beat a taxi driver unconscious, and an-
 other unit, the so-called traffic task force, handed out unduly harsh penalties to and
 engaged in regular shake-downs of Kumasi taxi drivers. These actions sparked a
 demonstration by taxi drivers in August, and angry demonstrators burned vehicles
 and destroyed property, injuring 17 persons, some with gunshot wounds. Many re-
 ports indicated that most injuries were caused by metropolitan security forces. It
 was unclear if these injuries occurred before or atr army troops were called in to
 restore order, or who caused the injuries.
 Prisons are in most cases ve   poorly maintained, and conditions are extremely
 harsh. In March the CHRAJ pulished its long-anticipated report on prison condi-
 tions. It described prisons that are unsanitary, overcrowded, and poorly ventilated.
 Prisoners are malnourished (the daily food allowance per prisoner is about $0.35)
 and suffer from lack of medicines unless paid for by the inmates or provided by
 their families. The report concluded in part that prison conditions are "a flagrant
 violation of the individual's fundamental human rights." The CHRAJ's findings and
 recommendations generated much positive press coverage, but the only concrete ac-
 
 
 tion taken by the Government was a decree of amnesty for certain convicted pris-
 oners and commuted sentences for others in order to relieve overcrowding in the
 prisons. Juvenile offenders were moved from prisons to schools for delinquent
 youths.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for protection
 aganst arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile and states that an individual detained
 shall be informed immediately, in a language the detained person understands, of
 the reasons for the detention, and of the right to a lawyer and to an interpreter,
 the latter at state expense. It also requires judicial warrants for arrest and provides
 for arraignment within 48 hours. In practice, however, many abuses occur, including
 detention without charge for longer than 48 hours and failur to obtain a warrant
 for arrest. The government press reported that the Inspector General of Police and
 the northern regional police commander were sued in January by a private busi-
 nessman for unlawful arrest and detention.
 The court has unlimited discretion to set bail, which can be excessive. It may
 refuse to release prisoners on bail and instead remand them without charge for an
 indefinite period, subject to weekly review by judicial authorities. It is common to
 remand a prisoner to investigative custody. The Constitution requires, however, that
 a detainee who has not been tried within a "reasonable" time shall be released ei-
 ther unconditionally or subject to conditions necessary to ensure that he appears at
 a later date for court proceedings.
 Despite the provisions of the law, abuses occur. People are sometimes detained
 for trivial offenses or on unsubstantiated accusations. Approximately 30 percent of
 the prison population consists of pretrial detainees. In November the press reported
 the release of 5 suspects on bail who had been in prison from 5 to 10 years without
 trial. In December there were reports of remanded suspects languishing in prison
 without trial for up to 9 years. The suspects had petitioned the CRAJ, which nego-
 tiated their release. The Commission was reported as saying at the time that it had
 other such instances under investigation.
 The CHRAJ report on prison conditions recommended improvement in the admin-
 istration of criminal justice, which currently denies many citizens their constitu-
 tional rights to be charged within 48 hours, to have bail posted within the same
 period, and to a speedy trial. The report concluded that the "penal system is unwit-
 tingly but inexorably punishing the innocent."
 At the year's end, a Presidential Commission on the Police Service continued to
 hold public hearings in efforts to improve police effectiveness.
 There were no known political arrests in 1996. However, an army captain,
 charged with plotting to overthrow the Government, was remanded into custody and
 awaited trial for treason.
 The Government does not practice forced exile and encourages citizens with valu-
 able skills who are living abroad to return, including dissidents. Some former gov-
 ernment and discredited PNDC officials have returned and resumed careers and po-
 litical activities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but in practice the judiciary is subject to executive influence. The Constitution
 allows the Government to nominate up to 15 members of the Supreme Court; con-
 firmation is the responsibility of a Parliament dominated by the President's party.
 Furthermore, the Chief Justice is empowered to impanel the justices of his choice
 to hear cases. These provisions along with a debilitating lack of resources have hin-
 dered the Court's role as a balance to the power of the executive branch. There were
 no official charges of judicial corruption but a recent survey revealed that 66 percent
 of the citizens believe that money influences the judicial system. Furthermore, the
 integrity of the legal system is compromised by a severe lack of financial, human,
 and material resources.
 The Constitution establishes two basic levels of courts: superior and lower. The
 superior courts include the Supreme Court, the Appeals Court, the High Court, and
 regional tribunals. Parliament may establish lower courts or tribunals by decree.
 Legal safeguards are based on British legal procedures. Defendants are presumed
 innocent, trials are public, and defendants have a right to be present, to be rep-
 resented by an attorney (at public expense if necessary), and to cross-examine wit-
 nesses. In practice the authorities generally respect these safeguards.
 The CHRAJ's charter provides for it to investigate alleged violations of human
 rights and take action to remedy proven violations. It continues to hold workshops
 to educate the public, traditional leaders, the police, and the military on human
 rights issues. It mediates and settles cases brought to it by individuals with griev-
 ances against government agencies or private companies. In 1995 the CHRAJ re-
 ceived 6,173 petitions in its offices around the country and completed action on over
 3,700 from 1995 and previous years. The majority of the complaints lodged with the
 
 
 113
 commission were labor and workplace related, but cases involving human rights is-
 sues are increasing. In October the Commission concluded its lengthy corruption
 p robe of high government officials. Its findings, damaging to the careers of three of-
 ficials, were accepted as fair and reasonable.
 The Chieftaincy Act of 1971 gives village and other traditional chiefs powers to
 mediate local matters, including authority to enforce customary tribal laws dealing
 with such matters as divorce, child custody, and property disputes. However, a num-
 ber of laws passed during the PNDC era (1981-92) and the 1992 Constitution have
 steadily eroded the authority of traditional rulers and vested it in civil institutions,
 such as courts and district assemblies.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. The last known political prisoner was
 Gershon Dompreh, who was released in January 1995.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides that a person shall be free from interference within the pri-
 vacy of his home, property, correspondence, or communication. This article has yet
 to be tested in court. In practice, although the law requires judicial search warrants,
 police do not always obtain them. Observers assume that the Government continues
 to engage in surveillance of citizens engaged in activities that it deems objection-
 able. In the past, this included monitoring of telephones and mail.
 There have also been confirmed reports of interference in the affairs of private
 businessmen when they have been perceived as unsympathetic to the ruling NDC
 party. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO), created in 1994, has launched politically di-
 rected attacks on private business people perceived as unsympathetic to the regime.
 The SFO can freeze assets for up to a week without judicial review, a prerogative
 that it has not yet exercised. It has, however, attempted to seize passports of sub-
 jects of its investigations.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and opposition political parties and others have used these freedoms
 to criticize the Government. However, the Government dominates the print and
 electronic media and has continually pressured the government-run media for con-
 formity. The Government controls the principal radio and sole television station and
 the two daily newspapers. The official media do not directly criticize government
 policies or President Rawlings although they report charges of corruption or mis-
 management in government ministries and state-owned enterprises. The Govern-
 ment occasionally disciplines or dismisses journalists working in government-sub-
 sidized media for articles deemed unacceptable. The Government reportedly ended
 subsidies to the two state-owned publishing companies as a first step in partial di-
 vestiture.
 Despite the Government's dominant position, the independent press continued to
 publish unimpeded, with newspapers and magazines critical of the Government, in-
 cluding personal attacks on the President, his wife, and his close advisers. However,
 independent newspapers and magazines tend to be small, with little circulation out-
 side major cities.
 While the Government has not overtly suppressed the independent print media,
 there were clear indications that the authorities were concerned and suspicious, par-
 ticularly during an important election year. In November security forces detained
 a freelance journalist who, in his opinion column in an independent newspaper, al-
 leged that the armed forces were prepared to rig or annul the results of the upcom-
 ing elections. The journalist was accused of "subversive activities leading to a trea-
 sonable offense," but was released on bail the day after having been taken into cus-
 iere was also a spate of libel charges against independent journalists and their
 editors during the year. These libel cases resulted largely in small fines and pub-
 lished apologies, but in general appeared to be officially inspired harassment of the
 independent press. However, two journalists and their editor face the more serious
 prospect of criminal prosecution and 10-year prison sentences under an obscure
 1960 law, never before used, prohibiting defaming or slandering the "Ghanian
 State". The journalists and editor had essentially republished an article that origi-
 nally appeared in a U.S.-based publication. They were first arrested in February,
 jailed, and then detained 10 days without bail before being released to prepare their
 case. By year's end, a decision had not yet been handed down. Prosecution under
 the criminal libel law became a more serious threat when the Supreme Court ruled
 in July that all citizens, rather than just those closely associated with the State,
 may avail themselves of the provisions of this law. Formerly criminal charges could
 only be sought when a false report was considered to have injured the credit or rep-
 utation of the State. Civil suits for libel are also allowed.
 
 
 114
 In July in another case, a contempt of court charge was leveled at a journalist
 reportin court proceedings in a case embarrassing to the President. The court sen-
 tenced tle journalist to jail for 30 days, but more disturbing was the restraining
 ("gag") order the presiding judge imposed both on the case under consideration and
 reporting on the contempt charge. The independent press widely challenged the re-
 straining order through noncompliance.
 The Minister of Youth and Sports charged an independent newspaper with libel
 for its reporting on his possible involvement in the May 1995 deaths of four dem-
 onstrators (see Section L.a.).
 There were also accusations that the Government indirectly manipulates the inde-
 pendent press by refusing to do business with companies that advertise in opposi-
 tion newspapers. However, advertising is steadily increasing in the independent
 newspapers. Foreign periodicals are sold in Accra and other major cities; they cir-
 culate freely and sometimes contain articles critical of the Government. Most Gha-
 naians obtain their news from the government-owned electronic media and the Brit-
 ish Broadcasting Corporation radio service.
 The Constitution states that individuals are free to own radio and television sta-
 tions. While in the past the Government has been slow to grant licenses to inde-
 pendent broadcasters, six independent radio stations and a private television station
 egan operations by year's end. While these stations are clearly independent, they
 cannot be characterized as outspoken critics of the Government.
 There has been no restriction of academic freedom on university campuses, al-
 though the authorities clashed with demonstrating students on two occasions. In
 January a stray bullet fired by the Kumasi police killed a student protesting the
 lengthy closure of the universities (see Section L.a.). The National Union of Gha-
 naian students, one of the more vocal critics of the Government, is allowed to orga-
 nize and hold meetings. In June an appearance by President Rawlings at the Legon
 University campus ended in a brawl between demonstrating student union members
 and NDC supporters.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly andassociation; it does not require permits for dem-
 onstrations. Parliament passed a public order law in late 1994 requiring that all or-
 ganizers of "special events" or "processions" inform the police of their intentions so
 that the police can institute precautionary measures. The law also provides for cur-
 fews and arrest without warrants in specified instances. The authorities did not
 abuse the provisions of the law during the year.
 In November five workers demonstrating in favor of union demands for improved
 working conditions were injured by bullets fired by the police. The proper authori-
 ties had been notified in advance, as required by law, that the demonstration would
 take place. The press secretary of the ruling NDC said that the party "regretted"
 the incident. The union chairman was quoted in the government press as saying
 that workers wanted a peaceful demonstration to remind management of union de-
 mands.
 NGO's are required to register with the Registrar General's office, but this reg-
 istration is routine. However, the possible threat of government interference in the
 form of mandatory NGO registration remains in a bill that has been languishing
 in a parliamentary committee for nearly 2 years. The council that would implement
 the law would consist primarily of government appointees and would have the au-
 thority to deny, suspend, or cancel an NGO's right to operate.
 Political parties must be accredited by the Electoral Commission. The parties
 must show evidence of a "national character" such as official representation in all
 10 of the country's regions. The Electoral Commission evaluates whether the party
 has shown evidence of a viable national support base before granting accreditation.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 There is no state-favored religion and no apparent advantages or disadvantages
 attached to membership in any particular sect or religion. Foreign missionary
 groups have generally operated throughout the country with a minimum of formal
 restrictions.
 During the year, there were a series of violent confrontations between religious
 groups, particularly among Islamic sects, but the issues involved were theological
 rather than political.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights as an aspect of the provision
 for personal liberty.
 Ctizens and foreigners are free to move throughout the country without special
 permission. Police checkpoints exist countrywide to prevent smuggling, but most are
 
 
 115
 left unmanned during daylight hours. Roadblocks and car searches are a normal
 part of nighttime travel in Accra.
 Citizens are generally free to travel internationally and to emigrate or to be repa-
 triated from other countries.
 Ethnic tension and violence in the northern region diminished during the year.
 Army troops were deployed to the area and as a result Konkomba farmers were
 again able to travel to regional markets to sell produce (see Section 5).
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Ghana
 has a liberal policy of accepting refugees from other West African nations. The Gov-
 ernment provides fist asylum. It has provided frst asylum in  years to Togo-
 lese refugees, most of whom have returned to Togo as part of the UNHCR's orga-
 nized voluntary repatriation program which was implemented in mid-year. It con-
 tinues to provide first asylum to some 34,000 Toglese and approximately 18,000 Li-
 berians who are still in Ghana. It provided first asylum to an additional 1,800 who
 arrived in 1996, most of whom arrived in April aboard the ship Bulk Challenge from
 Liberia, after other countries in the region refused to permit the passengers to dis-
 embark.
 In June the Government did not authorize disembarkation of passengers from the
 Russian refugee ship, the Zolitita, which had been searching for a port to dis-
 embark its 435 passengers, including many Liberians. There were no other reports
 of persons not being allowed to request asylum. There were no reports of forced re-
 turn of persons to a country where they feared persecution. There were no forced
 expulsions of refugees with a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Rigid of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government, and
 citizens exercised this right through a democratic process in presidential elections
 held in December.
 In preparation for the elections, the Electoral Commission consulted closely with
 representatives of all registered political parties regarding election processes and
 laws. By October 1995, the Commission had registered over 9 million citizens. It
 was noteworthy that in five regions women registered in greater numbers than men;
 and in the Central Region women accounted for 54 percent of the total number reg-
 istering. Over 6 million citizens returned to the 20,000 registration sites to ensure
 that their names were included on the registy.
 As a result of these careful preparations, the elections proceeded smoothly, and
 observers judged them free and fair. The 77 percent turnout was significantyher
 than the 52 percent in 1992, but the electorate was orderly. Hard work by the Na-
 tional Electoral Commission, political parties, and national and international NGO's
 contributed to the successful election. President Rawlings was reelected for a final
 4-year term with 57 percent of the popular vote. The Great Alliance candidate, John
 Kufuor, received 40 percent. The C retained control of the 200-member Par-
 liament with 133 seats, while opposition parties took 66 seats (1 seat was not con-
 tested due to a court injunction).
 There are no obstacles to the participation of women in government. In 1996 there
 were 16 female parliamentarians and several ministers and Council of State mem-
 bers were women. In the December elections, 17 women were elected to the Par-
 liament taking office in 1997.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Aleged Violations of Human Rights
 NGO's interested in human rights continued to grow in number and strength.
 These NGO's operate without government interference and, at year's end, without
 the need to register with the Government (see Section 2.b.). Prominent NGO's in-
 clude the Red Cross, Amnesty International, the International Federation of Woman
 Lawyers (FIDA), and Women in Law and Development in Africa (WILDAF).
 The Government cooperates with international humanitarian organizations in-
 cluding the International Committee of the Red Cress (ICRC).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, dis-
 ability, language, or social status. The courts are specifically empowered to enforce
 these prohibitions, although enforcement by the nut orities is generally inadequate,
 in part due to limited financial resources.
 Women.-Violence against women, including rape and wife beating, remains a sig-
 nificant problem. These abuses usually go unreported and seldom come before the
 
 
 116
 courts. The police tend not to intervene in domestic disputes. However, the media
 increasingly report cases of assault and rape. Women's groups have not yet raised
 the issue of domestic violence with the Government.
 Women continue to experience societal discrimination. Women in urban centers
 and those with skills and training encounter little overt bias, but resistance to
 women in nontraditional roles persists. Few women enter college. Women, especially
 in rural areas, remain subject to burdensome labor conditions and traditional male
 dominance. Traditional practices and social norms often deny women their inherit-
 ances and property, a legally registered marriage (and with it, certain legal rights),
 and the maintenance and custody of children, all provided for by statute.
 Women's rights groups are active in educational campaigns and in programs to
 provide vocational training, legal aid, and other support to women. The Government
 is also active in educational programs, and the President and First Lady are among
 the most outspoken advocates of women's rights. Although there has been no con-
 crete policy change on the national level, the 1995 United Nations Conference on
 Women and the resulting platform for action generated widespread positive discus-
 sion about the status of women in Ghana.
 Children.-Within the limits of its resources, the Government is committed to pro-
 tecting the rights and welfare of children. There is little or no discrimination
 against females in education, but girls and women frequently drop out of school due
 to societal or economic pressures. Statistics show that from grades 1 to 6, 45 of
 every 100 pupils are girls; from grades 7 to 9, this number drops to 41. In the
 grades equivalent to high school (grades 10 to 12), the number of girls drops to 33
 per 100 students, and drops even further to 25 per 100 students at the university
 level.
 There are several traditional discriminatory practices that are injurious to female
 health and development. In particular, female genital mutilation (FGM), which is
 widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and
 psychological health, is a serious problem. According to one study, the percentage
 of women who have undergone this procedure may be as high as 30 percent, al-
 though most observers believe 15 percent to be more accurate. FGM is practiced
 mostly in Muslim communities in the far northeastern and northwestern parts of
 the country. As of 1994, FGM became a criminal act, and at least one practitioner
 and an accomplice were arrested during the year. Officials at all levels have been
 vocal in publicly speaking out against the practice of FGM, and a local NGO is mak-
 nsome inroads through its educational campaigns to encourage abandonment of
 Trokosi, a traditional practice found among the Ewe ethnic group and primarily
 in the Volta region, is an especially severe abuse and a flagrant violation of chil-
 dren's and women's rights. It is a system in which a young girl, usually under the
 age of 10, is made a slave to a fetish shrine for offenses allegedly committed by a
 member of the girl's family. The belief is that if someone in that family has commit-
 ted a crime, such as stealing, members of the family may begin to die in large num-
 bers unless a young girl is given to the local fetish shrine to atone for the offense.
 The girl becomes the property of the fetish priest, must work on the priest's farm,
 and perform  other         or    . Because they are the sexual property of the
 priests, most trokosi slaves have children by him. Although the girls' families must
 provide for their needs, such as food, most are unable to do so. There are at least
 4,500 girls and women bound to various shrines in the trokosi system, a figure that
 does not include the slaves' children. Even if released, generally without skills or
 hope of marriage, a trokosi woman has continued obligations to the shrine for the
 duration of her life. When the fetish slave dies, the family is expected to replace
 her with another young girl for the fetish shrine.
 Although the Constitution outlaws slavery, Parliament has yet to pass a law ex-
 plicitly prohibiting trokosi. The practice persists because of deeply entrenched tradi-
 tional beliefs, and it is therefore unlikely that any legislative prohibition alone
 would eliminate the practice. Nevertheless, a local NGO has had some success in
 approaching village authorities and fetish priests and winning their confidence with
 the ultimate objective of securing the release of the trokosi slaves. There were 3
 ceremonies where a total of over 120 trokosi women and girls were released through
 the efforts of this NGO, and the organization is working for additional releases.
 Another traditional practice that violates the rights of children is forced childhood
 marriages. The prostitution of female children exists, despite its illegality.
 People With Disabiities.-The Constitution specifically provides  or the rights of
 people with disabilities, including protection against exploitation and discrimination.
 In practice, the disabled are not discriminated against in any systematic or overt
 manner. It also states that "as far as practicable, every place to which the public
 
 
 117
 has access shall have appropriate facilities for disabled persons." In practice, how-
 ever, this provision has yet to be implemented.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Government plays down the
 importance of ethnic differences, its opponents occasionally complain that it is domi-
 nated by the Ewe ethnic group from the eastern part of the country. The President
 and many of his close advisers are Ewe, but many ministers are of other ethnic ori-
 gins.
 To address the continuing tensions between the Konkomba and other ethnic
 groups in the north, the Government has created a permanent negotiating team
 comprised of religious leaders, NGO's, Council of State members, and other inter-
 ested parties to help resolve the conflict. A series of highly publicized "peacemaking"
 ceremonies were held at which tribal leaders pledged to solve their differences
 through negotiations. The primary issue of contention among the northern ethnic
 groups is land.
 There were numerous violent confrontations between and within ethnic groups re-
 lated to chieftaincy issues, particularly those of succession. Beyond regular pleas by
 government officials for peace, there has been little effective intervention.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-This right is restricted, as the Trades Union Ordi-
 nance confers broad powers on the Government to refuse to register a trade union.
 However, neither the PNDC nor the Government has interfered with the right of
 workers to associate in labor unions.
 About 9 percent of workers belong to unions, a figure that has been declining
 slowly over the past several years. The Industrial Relations Act (IRA), initially writ-
 ten in 1958, and amended in 1965 and 1972, governs trade unions and their activi-
 ties. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is the only existing confederation, although
 it has no legal monopoly. In recent years it has been led by experienced union lead-
 ers who, aided by a revised union constitution and by-laws, continued to define an
 autonomous role for the TUC within the NDC regime. Since the 1992 elections, the
 TUC has taken a somewhat more confrontational stance vis-a-vis the Government
 and has criticized some of its economic policies. Civil servants have their own union,
 the Civil Servants Association, which operates outside of the TUC umbrella.
 The law recognizes the right to strike. Under the IRA, the Government estab-
 lished a system of settling disputes, first through conciliation, then through arbitra-
 tion. A union may call a legal strike if negotiations and mediation fail. However,
 because no union has ever gone through the complete process, there have been no
 legal strikes since independence. The IRA prohibits retribution against strikers, and
 this law is enforced. There has been no progress in implementing the Government's
 declared intention to establish labor tribunals to arbitrate industrial disputes cer-
 tified as deadlocked.
 Unions have the right to affiliate with international bodies. The TUC is affiliated
 with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, headquartered in Accra, and
 is also a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The IRA provides a frame-
 work for collective bargaining and some protection against antiumon discrimination
 as well. Trade unions engage in collective bargaining for wages and benefits with
 both private and state-owned enterprises without government interference. The
 Government, labor, and employers negotiate together, however, through a tripartite
 commission to set minimum standards for wages and working conditions. The law
 requires employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination to reinstate workers
 fired for union activities. No union leaders have been detained in recent years for
 union or other activities.
 Press reports in February claimed that management refused workers at the Volta
 garment factory in Teshie the right to unionize. This right, however, was ultimately
 respected, and in November the workers announced their decision to affiliate with
 the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union.
 Legislation approving export processing zones (EPZ's) has been passed and a sec-
 retariat established, but at year's end there was no EPZ in operation. Existing labor
 law, however, will apply in any EPZ, including the right to organize.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and it is not known to be practiced except in the trokosi system (see Section 5). The
 International Labor Organization (ILO) continues to urge the Government to revise
 various legal provisions that permit imprisonment with an obligation to perform
 labor for offenses that are not countenanced under ILO Convention 105.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor legislation sets a minimum
 employment age of 15 and prohibits night work and certain types of hazardous labor
 for those under 18 years of age. In practice, child employment is widespread, and
 
 
 young children of school age often perform menial tasks during the day in the mar-
 et or collect fares on local buses. An ILO survey conducted in three rural districts
 between 1992 and 1993 concluded that 11 percent of school age children were em-
 ployed for wages and another 15 percent without remuneration. Observance of mini-
 mum age laws is eroded by local custom and economic circumstances that encourage
 children to work to help their families.
 Officials only occasionally punish violators of regulations that prohibit heavy labor
 and night work for children. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and Social Wel-
 fare are responsible for enforcement of child labor regulations. They visit each work
 place annually and make spot checks whenever they receive allegations of viola-
 tions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1991 minimum standards for wages and
 working conditions were set by a tripartite commission composed of representatives
 of the Government, labor, and employers. The daily minimum wage, revised in 1996,
 combines wages with customary benefits, such as a transportation allowance. The
 daily minimum wage is $1.00 (1,700 cedis). This sum is insufficient for a single
 wage earner to support a family. Furthermore, there is widespread violation of the
 minimum wage law. In most cases households have multiple wage earners, and fam-
 ily members engage in some family farming and other family-based commercial ac-
 tivities.
 The law sets the maximum workweek at 45 hours, with one break of at least 36
 consecutive hours every 7 days. Through collective bargaining, however, the basic
 workweek for most unionized workers is 40 hours. In February, however, workers
 at the Spintex textile factory publicly charged that management was forcing them
 to work overtime without compensation under threat of layoffs. When workers for-
 mally requested that they be laid off, management refused the requests, which un-
 leashed a worker protest that ended in the police using tear gas and firing warning
 shots. Workers have filed petitions with the CHRAJ, the Ministry of Employment
 and Social Welfare, and the Ministry of Labor. The status of the petitions was un-
 known at year's end.
 Occupational safety and health regulations are in effect, and the Labor Depart-
 ment of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare occasionally imposes sanctions
 on violators. Safety inspectors are few, however, and poorly trained. They take ac-
 tion if matters are called to their attention, but lack the resources to seek out viola-
 tions. Workers have the right to withdraw themselves from dangerous work situa-
 tions without jeopardy to continued employment, although they rarely exercise this
 right.
