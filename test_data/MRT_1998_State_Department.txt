 MAURITANIA
 Mauritania is a highly centralized Islamic Republic dominated by a strong presi-
 dency. The 1991 Constitution provides for a civilian government composed of a dom-
 inant executive branch, a senate, and a national assembly. President Maaouya Ould
 Sid'Ahmed Taya has governed since 1984, first as head of a military junta, and
 since the 1992 multiparty election as head of a civilian government. In December
 1997, Taya was reelected President, receiving over 90 percent of the vote. The elec-
 tion, contested by four opposition candidates but boycotted by the five-party Opposi-
 tion Front coalition, was widely regarded as fraudulent. Most opposition parties also
 boycotted earlier parliamentary elections but participated in senate elections in
 1994 and 1996; they gained only one seat. In the country's first multiparty elections
 to the 79-member National Assembly held in 1996, 1 opposition and 6 independent
 candidates were elected; candidates of the ruling Republican, Democratic and Social
 Party (PRDS) won 72 seats. The outcome of these elections was marred by fraud
 on all sides and pervasive government intervention. The Constitution provides for
 
 
 264
 an independent judiciary; however, the judiciary is subject to significant pressure
 from the executive through its ability to influence judges.
 The Government maintains order with regular armed forces, the National Guard,
 the Gendarmerie, and the police. The Ministry of Defense directs the armed forces
 and Gendarmerie; the Ministry of Interior directs the National Guard and police.
 The armed forces are responsible for national defense. The National Guard performs
 police functions throughout-the country in areas in which city police are not present.
 The Gendarmerie is a specialized paramilitary group responsible for maintenance
 of civil order in and outside metropolitan areas. Security forces are under the full
 control of the Government and are responsible to it. Some members of the security
 forces committed human rights abuses.
 Mauritania, with a population of 2.4 million, has a generally market-oriented
 economy based on fishing, mining, subsistence farming, herding, and a small com-
 mercial sector. Fish and iron ore are the country's main export-earners. Drought,
 desertification, and insect infestation have contributed to rapid urbanization, exten-
 sive unemployment, pervasive poverty, and a burdensome foreign debt. Continued
 drought in 1997-98 fueled urbanization, further straining government finances. The
 concentration of much of the country's wealth in the hands of a small elite, includ-
 ing the President's tribe and related Moor tribes, as well as a lack of transparency
 and accountability in certain areas of governance, also impedes economic growth.
 Annual per capita national income has increased by 1.5 percent in recent years and
 is estimated at $443 (1997 figure). Mauritania receives foreign assistance from bilat-
 eral and multilateral sources.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor, and problems remain in
 certain areas, although there was some improvement in a few areas. Democratic in-
 stitutions remain rudimentary and the Government circumscribes citizens' ability to
 change their government. Police at times used excessive force, beat or otherwise
 abused detainees, and used arbitrary arrest, and detention, incommunicado
 prearraignment detention, and illegal searches. The Government failed to bring to
 justice officials who commit abuses. Prison conditions remained harsh and
 unhealthy, despite recent improvements. Pretrial detention is often very lengthy. Al-
 though the Government instituted judicial programs and training, the executive con-
 tinued to exercise significant pressure on the judiciary, and in practice the right to
 a fair trial was restricted. At times the Government restricted freedom of speech;
 in January the Government arrested human rights activists who allegedly collabo-
 rated in making a film clip that purported to show that slavery persists in the coun-
 try. While the Government tolerates a critical independent press, it continued to
 censor individual editions without official explanation other than to cite the Con-
 stitution, which prohibits material that undermines national sovereignty, territorial
 integrity, or national unity; however, there were no reports that the Government
 censored or seized any newspapers in the second half of the year. The Government
 at times restricts freedom of assembly and association. The Government arrested
 and detained the leader and other officials of a major opposition party, who re-
 mained in detention in a remote area at year's end. The Government limits freedom
 of religion. The Government's refusal to recognize officially some nongovernmental
 organizations somewhat circumscribed their efforts. In May the Government signed
 a headquarters agreement with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 establishing the terms under which the UNHCR could help resettle returning refu-
 gees and created a ministry-level High Commission for human rights, poverty allevi-
 ation, and integration. Societal discrimination against women continued, and female
 genital mutilation remained a serious problem despite government efforts to halt
 the practice. Ethnic tensions continued to ease, but the largely southern-based eth-
 nic groups, including the Halpulaar (also called Fulani or Peuhl), Soninke, and
 Wolof ethnic groups, remained underrepresented in political life and some of their
 members feel excluded from effective political representation. In April the Govern-
 ment recognized a third trade union confederation. Child labor is common.
 The Government continued efforts to resolve a serious abuse from the 1989-91 pe-
 riod, in which approximately 70,000 members of southern ethnic groups were ex-
 pelled or fled, by facilitating cooperation between the Mauritanian Red Crescent As-
 sociation and the UNHCR to assist returnees from Senegal and Mali. Informed ob-
 servers estimate that 40,000 to 65,000 have returned; the UNHCR documented
 33,248 returnees to 4 southern provinces along the Senegal River, but believes, like
 the Government, that the total number of returnees nationwide is significantly high-
 er. However, some of these returnees have failed to regain access to the homes they
 had occupied and the land they had farmed before their expulsion, and there were
 varying reports about their success in obtaining other homes and land from the Gov-
 ernment. There were also a number of unconfirmed reports that the Government
 confiscated the farmland of members of southern ethnic groups in or near the Sen-
 
 
 265
 egal River valley and redistributed them to members of the dominant White Moor
 ethnic group-reportedly leaving some southerners landless. A net redistribution of
 land from southerners to both Black Moors and White Moors displaced from the
 northern and central regions by desertification since the 1970's may have occurred
 under a Government land reform program in place since the early 1980's; however,
 this program is designed specifically to avoid leaving any rural family landless, and
 provides land to landless persons from all ethnic groups.
 The Government failed to address fully another major abuse from the 1989-91 pe-
 riod, when 503 members of the military, almost entirely from the Halpulaar and
 Soninke ethnic groups of the south, were killed, tortured, and maimed. The Govern-
 ment in earlier years gave pensions to the documented widows of those killed, but
 not to undocumented individuals claiming to be additional wives. In 1996 the Gov-
 ernment extended pension benefits to some of those who survived the purge. There
 were no indications of further action on alleged wives who lack documentation. A
 1993 amnesty law precludes legal pursuit of those responsible for the killings, and
 the Government does not acknowledge responsibility or wrongdoing nor has it pro-
 vided honorable discharge papers to survivors or other compensation to families of
 those killed.
 A system of officially sanctioned slavery in which government and society join to
 force individuals to serve masters does not exist; however, there continued to be
 unconfirmed reports that slavery in the form of forced and involuntary servitude
 persists in some isolated areas. Unofficial, voluntary servitude persists with many
 former slaves continuing to work for former masters for food, shelter, and clothing,
 although they were under no legal compulsion to do so. Many persons including
 some persons from all ethnic groups still use the caste designation of slave.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 There was one known extrajudicial killing by the security forces-a smaller num-
 ber than in past years. Toward the end of the year, police in an antidrug brigade
 arrested a young man and beat him severely. The judge before whom he was
 brought to be charged released him to his family, but he died a few days later. The
 two police officers responsible were fired, but had not been prosecuted as of year's
 end.
 Extrajudicial killings from past years remained unresolved, principally the 1990-
 91 deaths while in military custody of 503 largely Halpulaar and Soninke military
 personnel and civilians detained in the investigation of an alleged coup attempt. In
 1993 the Government began to provide pension benefits to some of the widows and
 families of those killed, and in 1996 the Government recognized the prior govern-
 ment service of some of the civilian survivors and began to pay them pensions. The
 military has not released the results of its 1991 internal investigation, and in 1993
 Parliament passed an amnesty bill to preclude legal pursuit of those responsible.
 The Government has not acknowledged responsibility or wrongdoing nor has it pro-
 vided honorable discharge papers to survivors to facilitate alternative employment
 and their reintegration into society.
 The gendarmes who shot a man crossing the Senegal River from Senegal to Mau-
 ritania in April 1997 (who later died of his wounds) were brought to court and re-
 moved from their jobs. There was no punishment of the Coast Guard officials who
 fired on Senegalese fishermen in Mauritanian waters in November 1997. Coast
 Guard officials determined that the men were fishing illegally and fled when or-
 dered to stop.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other forms of cruel or inhuman punishment, but the
 police reportedly continue on occasion to beat criminal suspects while in custody.
 owever, one prominent human rights advocate arrested in January and held in
 prison for 2 months under conditions that enabled him to interact with other pris-
 oners said that he neither observed nor heard reports of any torture. Police in some
 instances used force to break up peaceful demonstrations or disperse crowds (see
 Section 2.b.). Military forces along the Senegal River used excessive force against
 individuals suspected of smuggling. Authorities have not tried or punished persons
 suspected of committing such abuses, which has contributed to the widespread belief
 that security officials are a force apart from government authority and not subject
 to legal restraints.
 
 
 On April 23, gendarmes in the area of Boghe shot and seriously injured a man
 attempting to escape after he was caught burning illegally cut trees to make char-
 coal. The Government evacuated him to the Nouakchott hospital, where he survived.
 In early May, an official in Abdel Bagrou was beaten severely by several police-
 men in retaliation for having hit a police brigade chief who was attempting to com-
 mandeer his car to provide security for a presidential visit. The police brigade chief
 filed a complaint, but when his supervisors did nothing, he and members of his bri-
 gade beat the man unconscious. The official was being evacuated for medical rea-
 sons to Nouakchott by a military aircraft when the plane crashed, killing him and
 his wife. The Government dismissed the district chief because of the incident.
 Prison conditions remained harsh and still do not meet minimum international
 standards, although there was some improvement during the year. The Prime Min-
 ister visited the Nouakchott central prison in May to highlight better prison condi-
 tions. Human rights activists agree that a new prison administration instituted in
 August 1997 has improved tangibly the conditions of prisoner food, health, hygiene,
 and family contacts. A decrease in the prison population from over 650 in 1997 to
 496 this year and the completion of a new cellblock eased overcrowding at the cen-
 tral prison, which originally was built to house 300 men. However, a new prison re-
 portedly planned for Akjoujt did not open. Sanitation facilities remain inadequate
 and reportedly have contributed to diseases such as tuberculosis, diarrhea, and der-
 matological ailments. The infirmary is understaffed but now contains a sufficient
 supply of medicine provided by an international NGO. Some prisoners receive spe-
 cial treatment based on family and position. Prisoners with high-level connections
 and families to bring them food, medicines, and reading material fare better than
 the less privileged or Africans from other countries. Witnesses have claimed that
 prisoners occasionally are beaten, but human rights activists indicate that beatings
 have become infrequent and could not cite any recent instances. New guard force
 management has enforced instructions against beatings and torture. Observers re-
 port that conditions at the women's prison and children's detention center in
 Nouakchott continued to be better than in the men's prisons. An NGO supervises
 a literacy program and a mechanic's workshop at the children's detention center.
 There have been no reported cases of persons dying in custody during the year.
 The Government permits prison visits by diplomats and human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that authori-
 ties cannot arrest, detain, prosecute, or punish anyone except as provided for under
 the law; however, at times police arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens. The ac-
 tual application of the constitutional safeguards continued to vary widely from case
 to case.
 The law requires that courts review the legality of a person's detention-within 48
 hours of arrest. Thepolice may extend the period for another 48 hours, and a pros-
 ecutor or court may detain persons for up to 30 days in national security cases. Only
 after the prosecutor submits charges does a suspect have the right to contact an at-
 torney.
 Human rights activists report that police showed greater respect for legally man-
 dated procedures and that prison administration improved considerably. However,
 pretrial detention after arraignment is often prolonged. According to a 1997 appeal
 written by prisoners in the Nouakchott prison, only 130 of the inmates had received
 a sentence, and 450 had not received a trial, but observers believe the actual num-
 ber to be lower.
 Some indicted detainees are released before trial without explanation; familial,
 tribal, or political connections may explain some of these cases. There is a provision
 for granting bail, but it is used rarely.
 On January 17, the Government arrested three prominent human rights activists
 who allegedly collaborated in making a short film for a French television network,
 which sought to document assertions that slavery persists in Mauritania. Arrest oc-
 curred 2 days after the film clip was broadcast. Two of the three persons arrested
 were charged formally with acting on behalf of organizations not officially recog-
 nized by the Government, an act that is prohibited by law. All three were denied
 contact with lawyers and family for 4 days. A fourth individual, living in France,
 was charged in absentia. One of the defense lawyers, another leading human rights
 activist, also was arrested. On February 5, all five were convicted for acting on be-
 half of nonauthorized organizations, and on February 12, they were sentenced to 13
 months' imprisonment. On March 24, after an appellate court had confirmed the
 convictions, President Taya pardoned all five, and the four individuals in the coun-
 try were released.
 On February 5, eight persons were arrested and detained during a demonstration
 organized by the Action pour le Changement (AC) opposition party to protest the
 January arrests of the human rights activists (see Section 2.b.). Those arrested and
 
 
 267
 
 detained included AC executive bureau member Professor Oumar Ould Yadi and
 Samory Ould Beye, secretary-general of the Free Confederation of Mauritanian
 Workers, a trade union confederation with close ties to the AC (see Section 2.b.),
 as well as the lawyer for the human rights activists arrested on January 17. Except
 for the lawyer, all were released under a form of house arrest.
 On January 29, the former high commissioner of the Senegal River Valley Author-
 ity (OMVS), Baba Ould Sidi Abdallah, was arrested for treason and accused of be-
 traying Mauritania's economic interests by supporting and concealing a Senegalese
 irrigation project and by sanctioning the elimination of six high-level OMVS posi-
 tions occupied by Mauritanians in a World Bank-mandated restructuring. However,
 many observers viewed him as a political scapegoat and attributed his arrest to trib-
 al retribution. Amnesty International concluded that he was being detained for po-
 litical reasons. Abdallah's lawyers argued that he enjoyed diplomatic immunity as
 head of the OMVS. The judge ruled that the charges were not substantiated, and
 he was acquitted on August 6.
 On December 16, the Government arrested Ahmed Ould Daddah, leader of the op-
 position party Union of Democratic Forces-New Era/Ahmed Ould Daddah Faction
 (UFD-A), and two UFD-A members, Mohameden Ould Babah and Mohameden Ould
 Icchedou, ostensibly because Ould Daddah had repeated at political rallies and to
 French radio charges of unknown foreign origin that the Government had agreed
 with the Government of Israel to bury Israeli nuclear waste on Mauritanian soil.
 The Government made no formal charges but kept the three men in detention in
 an isolated village in the country's interior. They remained in detention at year's
 end.
 Occasional reports of arbitrary arrests and intimidation committed by security
 forces continued, particularly among returned refugees in communities in the south
 along the Senegal River. There were unconfirmed reports that the security forces
 physically abused or detained some members of southern ethnic groups when they
 tried to reoccupy their former land and homes afer returning from other countries
 to which they had been forcibly expelled or fled in 1989-91. However, the extent
 of abuses among returnees continued to decline, as the Government, in conjunction
 with the UNHCR and Mauritanian Red Crescent society, resettled many returnees
 (see Section 2.d.). Local authorities often detained local residents involved in land
 disputes, or in disputes between farmers and nomads along the river. There were
 a number of unconfirmed reports that security forces physically abused or detained
 southerners in the course of confiscating their farmland for redistribution to White
 Moors (see Section 1.f.). There were also some unconfirmed reports that members
 of the security forces detained or physically abused southerners, who reportedly
 tried to use the legal system to regain from White Moors farmland confiscated from
 them either recently or in the expulsions of 1989-91.
 The Government no longer employs forced exile. The Government continued ef-
 forts to encourage the return of southerners who had been expelled or who had fled
 during 1989-91.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for the inde-
 pendence of the judiciary, in practice the executive branch exercises significant pres-
 sure on the judiciary through its ability to appoint and influence judges. In addition
 poorly educated and poorly trained judges who are susceptible to social, financial,
 tribal, and personal pressures limit the judicial system's fairness. However, the Gov-
 ernment is carrying out a program to improve judicial performance and independ-
 ence.
 There is a single system of courts with a modernized legal system that conforms
 with the principles of Shari'a (Islamic law). The judicial system includes lower-,
 middle-, and upper-level courts, each with specific jurisdictions. Departmental, re-
 gional, and labor tribunals are the principal instances at the lower level. The 53 de-
 partmental tribunals, composed of a president and magistrates with traditional Is-
 lamic legal training, hear civil cases involving sums less than $49 (10,000 UM) and
 family issues, for example, domestic, divorce, and inheritance cases. Thirteen re-
 gional tribunals accept appeals in commercial and civil matters from the depart-
 mental tribunals and hear misdemeanors. Three labor tribunals, composed of a
 president and two assessors (one who represents labor and one who represents em-
 ployers), serve as final arbiters for labor disputes. At the middle level, three courts
 of appeal, each with two chambers (a civil and commercial chamber, and a mixed
 chamber) hear appeals from the regional courts and have original jurisdiction for
 felonies. Nominally independent, the Supreme Court is headed by a magistrate ap-
 pointed to a 5-year term by the President. The Supreme Court reviews decisions and
 rulings made by the courts of appeal to determine their compliance with the law
 and procedure. Constitutional review is the purview of a six-member Constitutional
 Council, composed of three members named by the President, two by the National
 
 
 268
 Assembly President, -and one by the Senate President. Annual review of judicial de-
 cisions is undertaken by the Supreme Council of the Magistrature, over which the
 President presides; the president and senior vice president of the Supreme Court,
 the Minister of Justice, three magistrates, and representatives from the Senate and
 National Assembly are members of this Council. The annual review is intended to
 determine whether courts applied the law correctly and followed proper procedures.
 The Constitution provides for due process and the presumption of innocence until
 proven guilty by an established tribunal. All defendants, regardless of the court or
 their ability to pay, have the legal right to representation by counsel during the pro-
 ceedings, which are open to the public. If defendants lack the ability to pay for coun-
 sel, the court appoints an attorney, from a list prepared by the National Order of
 Lawyers, who provides defense free of charge. The law provides that defendants
 may confront witnesses, present evidence, and appeal their sentences, and these
 rights generally are observed in practice.
 Because Shari'a provides the legal principles upon which the law and legal proce-
 dure are based, courts do not in all cases treat women as equals of men. For exam-
 ple, the-testimony of two women is necessary to equal that of one man. In addition,
 in awarding an indemnity to the family of a woman who has been killed, the courts
 grant only half the amount that they would award for a man's death. There are no
 female magistrates. However, for commercial and other modern issues not specifi-
 cally addressed by Shari'a, the law and courts treat women and men equally.
 With international assistance, the Government continued a program to improve
 judicial performance and independence, which consists of organizing all laws and
 statutes into a single reference text and training officials throughout the justice sys-
 tem. The Government has instituted a progran to improve the skills of magistrates,
 under which magistrates receive 6 months' training abroad, then return to train
 other magistrates in Nouakchott and in regional capitals. Within President Taya's
 current term, the investment, administration, commercial, civil, and arbitrage bank-
 ing codes are to be updated and made cohesive. Popular dissatisfaction with the ju-
 dicial system and the belief that security officials can commit abuses with impunity
 persisted.
 On May 4, the Government suspended two magistrates for a period of 6 months
 for lack of professionalism. The two magistrates improperly released a man on bail
 while the original magistrate handling the case was on vacation.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires judicial warrants in order to execute home searches, but the authorities re-
 portedly often ignore this requirement.
 Government surveillance of dissidents and the political opposition is believed to
 continue, although the extent to which the Government used informants is un-
 known.
 There were a number of unconfirmed reports that the Government confiscated the
 farmland of members of southern ethnic groups in or near the Senegal River valley
 and redistributed it to members of the dominant White Moor ethnic group, leaving
 southern farmers landless, forcing a number of them into the cities, and impelling
 some to flee the country. Since 1983 the Government has been engaged in a land
 reform officially aimed at providing land for landless persons, including victims of
 desertification in the northern and central regions (both White Moors and Black
 Moors) and also, in recent years, for returning southerners who had been expelled
 in 1989-91. These reports may reflect abuses in the program's implementation; the
 proper implementation of the land reform does not leave families landless, and the
 program is not explicitly discriminatory. However, there may have been a net redis-
 tribution of land from southerners to Moors under that program, since the south has
 been less affected by desertification than the more northerly regions historically in-
 habited by the Moors. There were also some reports that some southerners who had
 been expelled or fled from the country during 1989-91 were unable either to regain
 possession of the land they had farmed before 1989 or to gain possession of other
 land from the Government.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, but the Government continues to restrict these rights through pre-
 publication press censorship by the Interior Ministry. NGO's and the privately
 owned press openly criticized the Government and its leaders. Antigovernment
 tracts, newsletters, and petitions circulated widely in Nouakchott and other towns.
 On April 25, the Government began issuing press cards to journalists and requiring
 this identification for participation in official events.
 
 
 The Press Law requires publishers to submit copies of newspapers to the Min-
 istries of Interior and Justice before distributing them. The Ministry of the Interior
 reviews all newspaper copy prior to publication and usually authorizes sales and
 distribution within 2 to 3 ays. However, the Press Law provides that the Minister
 of the Interior can stop publication of material that discredits Islam or threatens
 national security. Although the Ministry did not excise material from journals or
 otherwise censor individual articles, it did censor entire issues by seizing them. The
 authorities seized 19 individual issues of various journals; by comparison, in 1997,
 17 individual issues were seized. The Government provided no specific reason for
 the seizures other than to cite Article 11 of the Constitution, which prohibits mate-
 rials that undermine national sovereignty, territorial integrity, or national unity.
 The Government did not censor or seize any newspapers in the second half of the
 year, following the creation of the High Commission for Human Rights in May.
 All newspapers and political partdes must register with the Ministry of the Inte-
 rior. Although the Government did not refuse to register any journal, it suspended
 publication of Mauritanie Nouvelles, an independent weekly, for 3 months on Janu-
 ary 12. Mauritanie Nouvelles had just resumed publication after the expiration of
 a previous 3-month suspension that prevented it from covering the 1997 election.
 As a result of the January suspension, the journal decided to close permanently.
 There are more than 20 privately owned newspapers, including 5 new French lan-
 guage newspapers, 5 new Arabic publications and1 bilingual publication that ap-
 peared fairly regularly during the year. These journals are weeles and reach lim-
 ited audiences. Private journals reported openiy and critically on both the opposition
 and the Government and pubished p arty declarations and tracts without govern-
 ment censure or restralnt. In December the Government announced that it would
 exempt from all taxes any materials used to produce newspapers, journals, or books
 for the private press.
 All broadcast media (radio and television) and two daily newspapers, Horizons
 and Chaab, are government-owned and operated. Radio is the most important me-
 dium in reaching the public, and the official media strongly support government
 policies. During the 1997 presidential election campaign, the Government gave all
 five candidates equal access to its two newspapers and to the electronic media; for
 the first time, citizens heard or read criticisms of both the Government and the
 President in these media and not just in the private newspapers. Opposition parties'
 access to government radio broadcast facilities at other times is limited. Citizens can
 receive foreign television broadcasts including from France and other Arab coun-
 tries. The Government continued to deny private applications to establish domestic
 radio stations. However, the Government allowed domestic FM rebroadcasting of
 Radio France International programming, including news about the country that
 often covers opposition parties.
 In January the Government arrested three human rights activists who allegedly
 collaborated in making a short film for a French television network, which sought
 to document assertions that slavery persists in Mauritania (see Section 1.d.).
 There are five domestic Internet servers, which operate without governmental re-
 strictions.
 Academic freedom generally is respected, and there were no cases when the Gov-
 ernment prevented research, or publication or censored lectures. The one university
 is government funded and operated.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right, although
 there were occasions when it restricted public gatherings. The law requires that all
 recognized political parties and NGO's apply to the local prefect for permission for
 large meetings or assemblies. Permission generally is granted freely.
 On February 5, police clashed with protesters during a demonstration organized
 by a political opposition party to protest the January 17 arrest of three human right
 activists. The protesters applied in advance for a permit to hold the demonstration
 but the Government denied the request. When demonstrators began gathering as
 originally planned, police charged into the crowd, injuring at least 2 persons, and
 perhaps as many as 20, as claimed by the opposition party. The protesters were dis-
 persed, and the demonstration was never effectively held. Eight individuals were de-
 tained, but with one exception all were released quickly (see Section 1.d.).
 On February 8, police again clashed with demonstrators who had gathered to pro-
 test the arrest of the human rights activists. Carrying batons and shields, police
 charged into small groups of protesters, injuring some and prevented them from
 forming a large demonstration. The protesters eventually were dispersed.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, the Government
 circumscribes the efforts of some groups by denying them official recognition. The
 number of political parties, labor unions, and NGO's continued to increase. Some 22
 
 
 political parties and a wide array of NGO's, many of them highly critical of the Gov-
 ernment, functioned openly, issued public statements, and chose their own leader-
 ship. Two new political parties, the Popular Front and the National Union for De-
 mocracy and Development, were recognized officially in January and February re-
 spectively. The Government has not yet granted some NGO's official standing but
 did not prevent them from functioning. Among these are the Mauritanian Associa-
 tion for Human Rights (AMDH) and SOS-Esclaves (an antislavery NGO), which the
 Government claims are potentially divisive in that they appeal to specific ethnic
 groups, namely the Southern and Black Moor communities respectively. However,
 in January the Government used the pretext that the two NGO's were not reg-
 istered to prosecute their leaders for allegedly having collaborated in making a short
 film that sought to document assertions that slavery persists in Mauritania (see
 Sections 1.d. and 2.a.). Following widespread criticism of the arrests, President Taya
 pardoned the-two NGO leaders in March. The Government continued to allow these
 and other NGO's to function without registration.
 The Government officially registered a third trade union confederation, the Free
 Confederation of Mauritanian Workers (CLTM), on April 30. The CLTM is associ-
 ated with the opposition party Action pour le Changement.
 At the end of the year, the Government announced that it'recognized 155 new
 NGO's and associations during the year, bringing the total of such organizations to
 577.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution established Mauritania as an Islamic
 republic and decrees that Islam is the religion of its citizens and the State, and the
 Government limits freedom of religion.
 All but a small number of citizens are Sunni Muslims and are prohibited by their
 religion from converting to another religion. Shari'a law, proclaimed under a pre-
 vious government in 1983, includes the Koranic prohibition against apostasy, but it
 has never been enforced. The small number of known apostates from Islam suffered
 no social ostracism, and there were no reports of societal or governmental attempts
 to punish apostates.
 Although there is no legal codification of a prohibition against proselytizing by
 non-Muslims, in practice the Government prohibits proselytizing by non-Muslims.
 The Government views any attempts by Christians to convert Muslims as under-
 mining Mauritanian society. There are no known non-Muslim groups engaged in
 proselytizing; foreign Christian NGO's limit their activities to humanitarian and de-
 velopment assistance.
 Christian churches have been established in Nouakchott, Atar, Zouerate,
 Nouadhibou, and Rosso. The expatriate community of Christians and the few citi-
 zens who are considered Christians from birth practice their religion openly and
 freely in these churches. The possession of Bibles and other Christian religious ma-
 terials in private homes is not illegal.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement and residence with-
 in all parts of the territory, and provides for the freedom to enter and leave. Histori-
 cally there were few restrictions on travel in Mauritania's nomadic society. With ur-
 banization and automobile travel, the Government set up regular road checkpoints
 where the Gendarmerie checks the papers of travelers, and often reportedly solicit
 bribes. The Government imposed no nighttime curfews.
 Of the approximately 70,000 largely southern-based ethnic groups who were ex-
 pelled by Mauritania or fled to Senegal and Mali during the 1989-91 crisis, and of
 those born abroad since then, the UNHCR documented 33,248 returnees to four
 provinces along the Senegal River. Both the UNHCR and the Governmentparee
 that many others have returned on their own to the larger towns and cities. Many
 more returnees among nomads, who are difficult to document, and urban dwellers
 are not included in UNHCR's figures. Informed observers estimate that the actual
 number of returnees ranges between 40,000 and 65,000. Many entire villages as
 well as almost all Peulh (nomadic herders of the Halpulaar ethnic group) have re-
 turned. Many were compelled to return by Senegalese authorities after Mauritanian
 refugees and Senegalese clashed in Kidira, Senegal on April 14 and 19, following
 incidents of livestock theft, which resulted in 13 casualties. The Government has
 stated since 1993 that any Mauritanian outside the country may return. However,
 the Government, the countries of asylum, and the UNHCR have signed no tripartite
 repatriation agreement. Under the UNHCR-funded, 2-year "Special Plan for Rapid
 Integration" (PSIR), which began to assist returnees in mid-1996, the Mauritania
 Red Crescent, the UNHCR, and NGO's have undertaken 223 small agriculture,
 water, health, education, and construction projects in 130 villages to assist return-
 ees. Considering its mission completed, the UNHCR terminated its Rapid Integra-
 tion program for refugees at the end of December. The UNHCR estimates that there
 
 
 are 15,000 to 20,000 Mauritanian refugees remaining in Senegal. They are still
 under UNHCR protection formally but are provided assistance no longer, since the
 UNHCR sees no impediment to their return to Mauritania.
 Cooperation by local authorities in addressing restitution and citizenship matters
 varies greatly, depending on individual officials and the returnee's region (see Sec-
 tions 1.d. and 1.f.). Repatriation efforts have achieved greater results in the Trarza
 and Brakna regions than in Gorgol and Guidimaka to the east. However, observers
 noted that the situation in Gorgol has improved considerably. Many returnees re-
 ceived their original homes, some property, and all or a portion of their land. Timely
 restoration of identity papers has varied, and some of those repatriated who re-
 turned in 1995 have not yet received identification cards. In some regions, persons
 lacking identity cards could not travel freely.
 The Government is a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to
 the Status of Refugees and Its 1967 Protocol and grants refugee status in accord-
 ance with them and on the basis of UNHCR recommendations. There is, however,
 no legislation providing for this practice. The Government, which has cooperated
 with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees since
 1989 signed a headquarters agreement with the UNHCR in May. In recent years,
 the Government has provided first asylum to refugees from neighboring countries.
 The Government also has accepted the UNHCR's registration of some 200 asylum
 seekers, mostly from Sierra Leone and Liberia. There were no reports of refugees
 being forced to return to a country where they feared persecution.
 Mauritania is host to over 50,000 nationals of other West African countries who
 seek refuge and employment, primarily in Nouakchott and Nouaohibou. An esti-
 mated 60 percent of Mauritania's small craft fishermen are Senegalese. In Septem-
 ber an estimated 100 to 200 Sierra Leoneans demonstrated in front of the UNHCR
 offices in Nouakchott to protest the limited monetary assistance offered by the
 UNHCR for repatriation.
 About 2,000 Malian former refugees who could repatriate have remained in the
 country and largely have integrated with the local population. Nearly all these Ma-
 lian refugees are Moors. The UNHCR no longer considers them refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government, but
 the Government circumscribes it in practice. The 1992 multiparty election of a civil-
 ian president ended 14 years of military rule, but both the opposition and inter-
 national observers concluded that the elections were fraudulent. Although civilians
 fill all ministerial-level positions, some members of the Military Council that ruled
 from 1984 to 1992, in addition to President Taya, remained in positions of power
 within the executive branch, the National Assembly, the armed forces, and govern-
 ment-owned enterprises. The armed forces continued to provide potentially critical
 support to the regime. The Government denied elements of the opposition the oppor-
 tunity to receive full access to government media and to compete on an equal foot-
 ing.
 The country's first multiparty legislative elections were held in 1996. Only 1 oppo-
 sition and 6 independent candidates were elected to the 79-member National Assem-
 bly; candidates of the ruling PRDS party won the remaining 72 seats. The outcome
 of the elections was marred by fraud on all sides and pervasive government inter-
 vention to support candidates from the ruling PRDS party. After the Government
 announced that presidential elections would take place on December 12, 1997, the
 anniversary of the 1984 coup, a coalition of five opposition parties announced on
 June 26, 1997, that it intended to boycott the election unless certain demands were
 met. These requirements included enhanced media access, an opposition role in elec-
 tion preparation, creation of an independent electoral commission, enlarging the
 commission charged with electoral list revision, and provision of official copies of the
 voting report from each polling station to representatives of each candidate. The
 Government granted the opposition full access to its media but did not meet the
 other demands, and four opposition parties declined to participate in the election.
 However, five individuals, including for the first time a Halpulaar, ran for president.
 All received equal treatment in the official electronic and print media as well as ex-
 tensive coverage in the private press. President Taya won an overwhelming victory,
 although his opponents fared much better in the cities than in the rural areas. The
 official turnout of 75 percent and the winning percentage of 90 percent were in-
 flated, since many individuals voted more than once. The Government distributed
 four voter registration cards to some persons, including government employees, in-
 structing them to vote repeatedly for the incumbent, a practice employed by all par-
 ties including the opposition. The Senate elections, held on April 17, were boycotted
 
 
 by the opposition. Of the 18 seats up for election, the PRDS gained all but 1, which
 was won by an independent candidate.
 Elections are held by secret ballot. At polling places on election day, registered
 citizens receive a package of color-coded cards, containing one card for each can-
 didate. Each citizen votes by depositing into a sealed ballot box, alone inside a
 closed booth, an-envelope containing one of these cards. The unused cards are dis-
 carded on the floor. Although voters could in theory take the unused cards out of
 the polling place with them, the ready availability of many unused cards on the
 floor makes unused cards.worthless as evidence of how a voter has voted and effec-
 tively eliminates the potential for abuse in such a multiple ballot system.
 The country is divided into 12 provinces that are divided further into prefectures.
 The Government appoints the Walls (governors) and Hakems (prefects). Municipal
 councils are elected- by general ballot and they elect their mayors, usually the head
 of the majority party's list. Most government services are provided by the central
 government. The elected councils are responsible for some public services, such as
 sanitation, and have fiscal autonomy and taxing power. Their administrative staff
 is independent of the Government. The councils elect the national Senate.
 Women have the iight to vote, and formed the majority of voters in the 1997 pres-
 idential election. Women occupy senior government positions, including three cabi-
 net posts, one secretary-general, two senior presidential advisors (including a
 Halpuaar), and four senior advisors to ministers. Women are well represented in
 the Secretariat of Women's Affairs, including a number of Halpulaar women. There
 are three female members of the National Assembly (including one Haratine and
 one Soninke from the Forger6n caste, a caste of lower status than the former slave
 caste), but no female senators.
 Haratines, Halpulaars, Soninkes, and Wolofs are underrepresented in senior gov-
 ernment positions. Of the Government's 19 ministerial posts, 3 incumbents are
 Haratine, 2 are Halpulaar, 1 is Soninke, and 1 is mixed White Moor/Soninke; the
 remaining 12 are of either White Moor or mixed White Moor/Haratine ethnicity (see
 Section 5). The full 28-member Cabinet, including secretaries of state, has 3
 Haratines, 3 Halpulaars, 1 Soninke, and 1 mixed White Moor/Sononinke. The 56-
 member Senate has 3 Haratines, 4 Halpulaars, 3 Soninkes, and the remaining 46
 are of either White Moor or mixed White Moor/Haratine heritage. The 79-member
 National Assembly has 2 Haratines, 7 Halpulaars, 2 Soninkes, and 1 Wolof.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There is an increasing number of human rights organizations. Some operate with
 official government registration, but others do not have this authorization. The old-
 est is the Mauritanian League for Human Rights, an independent, government-rec-
 ognized body. A second organization, the Mauritanian Human Rights Association
 (AMDH), is still unrecognized (see Section 2.b.). While not affiliated with the opposi-
 tion, it has many opposition members. The AMDH has been more critical of the
 Government than the League, particularly on the unresolved abuses of the 1989-
 91 period.
 Other organizations, including 14 unregistered associations, also address human
 rights issues. The .pan-African organization, International Study and Research
 Group on Democracy and Economic and Social Development in Africa (Gerddes-Afri-
 ca), established a branch in Mauritania in 1994. Two other groups, SOS-Esclaves
 and the National Committee for the Struggle Against the Vestiges of Slavery in
 Mauritania, focus their- efforts on overcoming the country's vestiges of slavery (see
 Section 6.c.). SOS-Esclaves was particularly active in drawing public attention to
 this issue, appealing to national and international audiences to support measures
 to eradicate slavery. SOS-Esclaves also intervened effectively with government au-
 thorities to push resolution of some of the cases, in particular child custody and in-
 heritance cases, brought to the organization by former slaves.
 The Committee of Solidarity with the Victims of Repression in Mauritania is con-
 cerned with the plight of the 1989 expellees. The Consultative Group for the Return
 of the Refugees was founded to promote the return of the remaining Mauritanian
 refugees in Senegal. The, Collective ofWorkers Victims of the 1989 Events seeks re-
 dress for government employees who lost their jobs in the events of 1989. The Com-
 mittee of the Widows and the Collective of Survivors focus on the sufferings of the
 victims of the 1990-91 military purge and their families. The Collective of Survivors
 of Political Detention and Torture was established in 1996 to seek redress for
 abuses committed during the 1986-87 period. These, and other groups of individuals
 with common concerns, function openly and actively, but their efforts are somewhat
 circumscribed because they are not officially recognized (see Section 2.b.). The Coali-
 tion of Human Rights NGO's is an umbrella organization for 12 of these organiza-
 
 
 273
 tions; it represents the group in various forums, including representations to foreign
 embassies. It includes althe organizations previously mentioned.
 In July the Inter-African Union for Human Rights and the Mauritanian League
 of Human Rights organized a 5-day seminar on citizen rights. Topics of discussion
 included: Freedom of the press; human rights and Islam; human rights training in
 the Arab world; evaluation of the democratic process in Africa; and the fight against
 corruption. Representatives of a number of international human rights groups vis-
 ited the country, especially at the beginning of the year in connection with the ar-
 rest of human rights activists. Among these groups were Amnesty International, the
 International Federation of Human Rights, the Union of Arab Lawyers, and several
 African associations.
 In May the Government signed a headquarters agreement with the UNHCR. This
 agreement formally conferred diplomatic status on UNHCR personnel in the coun-
 try, and established the terms under which the UNHCR could facilitate the resettle-
 ment and reintegration of returning refugees.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law for all citizens, regardless
 of race, national origin, sex, or social status, and prohibits racially or ethnically
 based propaganda. In practice the Government often favors individuals on the basis
 of ethnic and tribal affiliation, social status, and political ties. Societal discrimina-
 tion against women, strongly rooted in traditional society, is endemic, although the
 situation is improving.
 Women.-Human rights monitors and female lawyers report that physical mis-
 treatment of women by their husbands is rare. The police and judiciary occasionally
 intervene in domestic abuse cases but women in traditional society rarely seek legal
 redress, relying instead upon family and ethnic group members to resolve domestic
 disputes. The incidence of reported rape is low. It occurs, but newspaper accounts
 of attacks are rare.
 Women have legal rights to property and child custody, and, among the more
 modern and urbanized population, these rights are recognized. By local tradition, a
 woman's first marriage, but not subsequent marriages, requires parental consent.
 In accordance with Shari'a, marriage and divorce do not require the woman's con-
 sent, polygyny is allowed, and a woman does not have the right to refuse her hus-
 band's wish to marry additional wives. In practice polygyny is very rare among
 Moors but common among other ethnic groups. Arranged marriages are also in-
 creasingly rare, particularly among the Moor population. Women frequently initiate
 the termination of a marriage, which most often is done by husband or wife by repu-
 diation rather than divorce. It is also common in Moor society for a woman to ob-
 tain, at the time of marriage, a contractual agreement that stipulates that her hus-
 band must agree to end their marriage if he chooses an additional wife. The rate
 of divorce among Moors is estimated to be 37 percent and the remarriage rate after
 divorce is 72.5 percent.
 Women still face some legal discrimination. For example the testimony of two
 women is necessary to equal that of one man and the value placed on women's lives
 in court-awarded indemnities is only half the amount awarded for a man's death
 (see Section I.e.). However, women do not face legal discrimination in areas not spe-
 cifically addressed by Shari'a. The Secretariat for Women's Affairs works with many
 NGO's and cooperatives to improve the status of women. A booklet published late
 in 1996 advises women of their rights. A booklet was published in August that con-
 tained a plea calling for the Government to ratify the United Nations Convention
 on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and contained
 the convention's text, women's rights according to the precepts of the Shari'a, and
 the applicability of the convention to those precepts.
 There are no legal restrictions on the education of girls and women. Girls com-
 prised 47.7 percent of all school enrollments in 1997. Some 81 percent of school-age
 girls attended elementary school in 1997-98, up from 44.8 percent in 1990 (com-
 pared with 88.5 percent for boys, up from 58.3 percent). At the secondary level; fe-
 male students constituted 37.4 percent of those enrolled. Despite the increases, en-
 rollment in eastern Mauritania, the Brakna, and along the Senegal River remained
 at a lower level. The Government introduced a special countrywide program in
 1995-96 to boost female enrollment at the elementary level. Women made up 14
 percent of the university's 1997-98 enrollment, compared with 9 percent in 1990.
 Women also constituted 28.2 percent of students enrolled in technical schools, com-
 pared with 2 percent in 1990. The literacy rate for women is 36 percent compared
 with 50 percent for men.
 
 
 The Government seeks to open new employment opportunities for women in areas
 that traditionally were filled by men, such as health care, communications, police,
 and customs services. Women became more involved in the fishing industry and es-
 tablished several women's fishing cooperatives. For the first time, women were hired
 by the army to serve as police inspectors and customs officials.
 The law provides that men and women receive equal pay for equal work. While
 not universally applied in practice, the two largest employers, the civil service and
 the state mining company, respect this law. In the modern wage sector, women also
 receive generous family benefits, including 3 months of maternity leave.
 Children.-The Government does not require attendance at school, primarily be-
 cause it lacks the financial resources to provide educational facilities and teachers
 throughout the country, especially in remote areas. However, the Government has
 made universal primary education a priority and has targeted the year 2000 to
 achieve that goal. The Government has doubled the percentage of its budget devoted
 to education in the past 10 years and has increased the rate of primary school at-
 tendance from 45 percent in 1986 to 86 percent in 1998. In addition almost all chil-
 dren, regardless of sex or ethnic group, attend Koranic school from the ages of 5
 to 7 and gain at least rudimentary skills in reading and writing Arabic in addition
 to memorizing Koranic verses.
 The law makes special provisions for the protection of children's welfare, and the
 Government has programs to care for abandoned children. However, these programs
 are hampered by inadequate funding. Local NGO's estimate that there are 150
 street children. The Government relies on foreign donors in such areas as child im-
 munization. Moreover, it does not enforce existing child labor laws, and children
 perform a significant amount of labor in support of family activities (see Section
 6.d.). Following public criticism and government action against families that send
 their young sons to work abroad as "camel jockeys," there were no reports of this
 practice during the year.
 Traditional forms of mistreatment of females continue, mostly in isolated rural
 communities, but these practices appear to be on the .decline. Such mistreatment
 consists of forced feeding of adolescent girls (gavage) and female genital mutilation
 (FGM), which is widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to
 both physical and psychological health. Experts previously estimated that between
 60 and 70 percent of women experienced gavage, but now conclude that less than
 25 percent of Moor women have experienced gavage, which is practiced only among
 the Moors. The change in figures appears to reflect both prior overestimation and
 a decline in the practice in recent years. The Government initiated an intensive
 media and educational campaign against gavage in August.
 FGM is performed most often on young girls, often on the seventh day after birth
 and almost always before the age of 6 months, and it is practiced among all ethnic
 groups except the Wolof. A March 1996 report by the United Nations Population
 Fund and a study published in 1997 by Jeune Afrique Economie cited Mauritania
 as a country in which 25 percent of the women undergo FGM. Among Halpulaar
 women, over 95 percent undergo FGM. A broad, foreign-funded study still is cur-
 rently underway to obtain more precise data. Preliminary results of the foreign-
 funded study indicate that 66 percent of those who perform FGM recognize that the
 practice is detrimental to women's health, and 54 percent of imams agree that the
 practice is dangerous. Local experts agree that the least severe form -of excision is
 practiced, and not infibulation, the most severe form of FGM. The practice of FGM
 has decreased in the modern urban sector.
 It is the clear public policy of the Government, through the Secretariat of Wom-
 en's Affairs, that FGM should be stopped, and the Government bars hospitals from
 performing it. Public health workers and NGO's educate women to the dangers of
 FGM and to the fact that FGM is not a requirement of Islam. For example, a 1996
 officially produced Guide to the Rights of Women in Mauritania (with religious en-
 dorsement) stresses that Islam does not require FGM and that if medical experts
 warn against it for medical reasons, it should not be done. The campaign against
 FGM appears to be changing attitudes towards the practice, according to several
 women's rights experts.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not provide specifically for the disabled,
 and the Government does not mandate preference in employment or education or
 public accessibility for disabled persons. However, it does provide some rehabilita-
 tion and other assistance for the disabled.
 National IRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Ethnic minorities and low-caste individuals
 among all ethnic groups confront societal discrimination. Ethnic and cultural ten-
 sion and discrimination arise from the geographic and cultural line between tradi-
 tionally nomadic Arabic-speaking (Hassaniya) Moor herders and Peuhl herders of
 the Halpulaar group in the north and center, and sedentary cultivators of the
 
 
 275
 Halpulaar (Toucouleur), Soninke, and Wolof ethnic groups in the south. Although
 culturally homogeneous, the Moors are divided among numerous ethno-lingwistic
 clan groups and are racially distinguished as Beydane and Haratine, or White
 Moors and Black Moors, though it is often difficult to distinguish between the two
 groups by skin color. The majority of what are known as Black Moors are Haratine,
 literally "one who has been freed," although some Black Moor families never were
 enslaved. The Halpulaar (the largest non-Moor group), the Wolof, and the Soninke
 ethnic groups are concentrated in the south. "White Moors, large numbers of whom
 are dark-sned after centies of intermarriage with members of Sub-Saharan Af-
 rican groups, dominate positions in government and business. The southern
 Halpulaar, Soninke, and Wolof ethnic groups are underrepresented in the military
 and security sectors.
 A number of accounts indicate that redistribution of southern farmland to Moors
 since the acceleration of desertification in the 1970's has contributed to tensions be-
 tween Moors and southern-based ethnic groups. Although much of the government's
 redistribution of land has been from southerners to southerners some Moors have
 been resettled in the south. Ethnic tensions surfaced dramatically in the mass ex-
 pulsions of southern-based ethnic groups-mostly Halpulaars-in 1989-90 and the
 purge of Halpulaars from the military in 1991. Few regained their positions.
 The Constitution designates Arabic along with Pulaar, Soninke, and Wolof as
 Mauritania's national languages. However, successive governments-both civil and
 military-have pursued various policies of "Arabization" in the schools and in the
 workplace. Non-Arabic-speaking ethnic groups have protested this policy, as have
 Arabic-speakinggroups that want their children to obtain a bilingual Arabic-French
 education. The Government provides bilingual Arabic-French programs where the
 community demand is sufficient. Elementary school classes are also available in the
 other national languages in several localities.
 Ethnic divisions and ethnic tensions contribute significantly to political divisions
 and tensions. Some political parties tend to have readily identifiable ethnic bases,
 although political coalitin  mogthem are increasingly important. An acceleration
 of desertfication during the 1970ss that destroyed much of the traditional economic
 basis of Moorish society, and an upsurge of Arab nationalism among White Moors
 during the 1980's, contributed to explosive ethnic violence precipitated by a dispute
 with Senegal during 1989-91; this violence entailed the expulsion or flight of many
 non-Moors living in the south and occupation of much of their land by Moors, in-
 chiding Black Moors. Interethnic bitterness and hostility persists, and continues to
 be aggravated by climatic, land, and population pressures.
 A number of accounts suggest that some members of the long-dominant White
 Moor community, which traditionally enslaved a darker race, may continue to ex-
 pect or desire servility on the part of members of the generally darker Black Moors
 and southern ethnic groups, and that such attitudes may impede efforts to build a
 nondiscriminatory society and to eliminate the vestiges and consquences of slavery,
 goals to which both the Government and major opposition parties are committed.
 There are indications that racism on the part of some White Moors may have con-
 tributed both to the persistence of vestiges and consequences of past White Moor
 enslavement of Black Moors, and to the expulsions and reported dispossession of
 members of darker southern ethnic groups with no tradition of servility to White
 Moors. However, southern-based ethnic groups and Black Moors have manifested
 little racial solidarity socially or politically, and racial differences did not contribute
 either to historical slavery or to the persistence of its vestiges and consequences
 among southern-based ethnic groups.
 $ection 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.--The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 and the right of citizens to join any political or labor organization. All workers ex-
 cept members of the military and police are free to associate in and establish unions
 at the local and national levels.
 Prior to the 1993 amendment of the Labor Code, which repealed provisions re-
 stricting trade union pluralism, the government-controlled labor central, the Union
 of Mauritania Workers (UTM), was the only labor confederation allowed by law.
 Since 1993 seven new labor confederations have been recognized and four unofficial
 or unrecognized unions formed. The UTM, which many workers still view as closely
 allied with the Government and the Parti Republicain Democratique et Soiale
 (PDS), has lost ground to these organizations. The General Confederation of
 Mauritanian Workers (CGTM), recognized in 1994 and with 23 member unions, is
 not affiliated with any political party, although most of its members favor the oppo-
 sition; it continued to gain in strength during the year, in part because of the UTM's
 internal discord. The Government, which previously subsidized ouly the UTM, now
 
 
 276
 also provides funds to the CGTM  proportional to its- membership. Both confed-
 erations supplied representatives to the country's four labor tribunals, and the
 CGTM was included in most government deliberative or consultative bodies in
 which the UTM alone had participated in the past. A third labor confederation, the
 Free Confederation of Mauritanian Workers (CLTM), which was formed in 1995 and
 leans politically toward the opposition party, Action pour le Changement, was recog-
 nized officially on April 30. Several independent trade unions, in particular three
 for teachers at the elementary, secondary, and university levels, also were active.
 Seminars to educate the tripartite partners on responsible trade unionism and
 democratic labor relations were held under foreign embassy and other sponsorship.
 The bulk of the labor force is in the informal sector, with most workers engaged
 in subsistence agriculture and animal husbandr; only 25 percent-are employed in
 the wage sector. However, nearly 90 percent of the industrial and commercial work-
 ers are organized. The law provides workers with the right to strike, and there were
 several strikes and partial work stoppages. Most strikes were settled quickly due
 to limited worker and union resources. In 1997 authorities arrested secondary
 school teachers who threatened to strike and later cut their salaries. The law pro-
 vides for tripartite arbitration committees composed of union, business, and govern-
 ment representatives. Once all parties agree to arbitration, the committee may im-
 pose binding arbitration that automatically terminates any strike.
 International trade union activity increased. The Government included CGTM,
 UTM, and CLTM representatives in its delegation to the International Labor Orga-
 nization (ILO) in June, and the ILO conducted an extensive series of training work-
 shops in which the confederations participated as they did in 1997.
 Unions are free to affiliate internationally. The CGTM and UTM applied for mem-
 bership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in 1997, but at
 year's end, the applications still were pending. The UTM participated in regional
 labor organizations, and the CGTM has a application pending to join the Organiza-
 tion of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU). At year's end, the OATUU had not
 acted on the CGTM's application.
 The Government petitioned the United States for reconsideration of generalized
 system of preferences (GSP) trade privileges in 1997. The United States revoked
 GSP benefits in 1993 for failure to respect freedom of association or to take steps
 to eliminate forced labor, including vestiges of slavery (see Section 6.c.).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides that unions
 may organize freely workers without government or employer interference. General
 or sectoral agreements on wages, working conditions, and social and medical bene-
 fits are negotiated in tripartite discussion and formalized by government decree.
 Wages and other benefits also can be negotiated bilaterally between employer and
 union and the results of such negotiations are filed with the Directorate of Labor.
 Laws provide workers with protection against antiunion discrimination and em-
 ployees or employers may bring labor disputes to three-person labor tribunals ad-
 ministered jointly by the Ministries of Justice and Labor with the participation of
 union and employer representatives.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government prohibits forced
 and bonded labor, including by children, but does not enforce this prohibition effec-
 tively in specific cases (also see Section 5).
 Mauritanians continue to suffer the effects and consequences of generations of the
 practice of slavery and of caste distinctions including the traditional existence of a
 slave caste in both Moor and Southern communities. Slavery was abolished officially
 three times in Mauritania, most recently by the post-independence government in
 1980. Even before 1980, the practice of slavery among the traditionally pastoralist
 Moors had been greatly reduced by the accelerated desertification of the 1970's;
 many White Moors dismissed their former Black Moor slaves because the depletion
 of their herds left them unable either to employ or to feed slaves. However, wide-
 spread slavery was also traditional among ethnic groups of the largely nonpastoral-
 ist south, where it had no racial origins or overtones; masters and slaves alike were
 black The South has suffered less from desertification, and some reports identify
 it as the region in which vestiges and consequences of slavery may persist most
 strongly.
 A system of officially sanctioned slavery in which government and society join to
 force individuals to serve masters does not exist. There has been no open trading
 in slaves for many years. However, slavery in the form of forced and involuntary
 servitude reportedly persists in some isolated areas. Unofficial voluntary servitude
 persists, with some former slaves continuing to work for former masters in exchange
 for monetary or nonmonetary benefits such as lodging, food, or medical care. Many
 persons, including some from all ethnic groups, still use the caste designation of
 
 
 slave in referring to themselves or others. The reasons for the persistence of such
 practices appear to be economic, psychological, and religious, although they vary
 widely and may be quite different among pastoralist or formerly pastoralist Moors
 from what they are among the southerners and the few nonpastoralist Moors. Pov-
 erty, persistent drought, and a weak economy provide few economic alternatives for
 many and leave some former slaves vulnerable to possible exploitation by former
 masters. There are reports that some former slaves in some sedentary communities
 have continued to work for their former masters or others in order to retain access
 to the land they traditionally farmed, although the law provides for distribution of
 land to former slaves and this law has been enforced in many cases. In addition
 to their usual compensation, some former slaves, who continue to work for former
 masters also receive gifts on important family occasions such as births, marriages,
 and deaths. Deeply embedded psychological and tribal bonds also make it difficult
 for many individuals who have generations of forebearers who were slaves to break
 their bonds with former masters or their tribes. Finally, because of religious instruc-
 tion in the past, some individuals continue to link themselves to former masters for
 fear of religious sanction if that bond is broken.
 Adults cannot be obliged by law to remain with former masters nor can they be
 returned if they leave. However, adult females with children may have greater dif-
 ficulties and may be compelled by pressures other than physical force to remain in
 a condition of servitude. For example, in some cases, especially where the former
 master claims to be the father, former masters refuse to allow children to accom-
 pany their mothers. In other cases, the greater economic responsibility of a family
 may be the principal impediment to seeking a new life. Children's legal status is
 more tenuous than that of adults. There have been no reports of sales or "transfer"
 of children or other individuals from one employer or master to another since 1996,
 when there were occasional confirmed cases of transfers; however, reports of sales
 are rare, cannot be confirmed, and are confined to past years.
 The legacy of caste distinctions continues to affect the status and opportunities
 available to various groups. In some groups, for example, individuals of a higher
 caste who seek to marry someone of a lower caste may be barred by the community,
 and in Soninke communities members of the slave caste cannot be buried in the
 same cemetery as other castes.
 NGO positions on the existence of slavery are not uniform. For example, SOS-
 Esclaves in an April 1997 report characterized slavery as a persistent social reality,
 whose occurrence among disadvantaged classes is far from negligible. The Organiza-
 tion of African Unity's (OAU) African Commission on Human and People's Rights
 report issued in June 1997 disputed the conclusions of the April 1997 SOS-Esclaves
 report. While not dismissing the possibility of isolated cases of slavery in the remote
 countryside, the Commission concluded that while slavery does not exist as an insti-
 tution, the persistence of vestiges of slavery was the more convincing explanation
 of social relations. Anti-Slavery International has stated that there is insufficient
 evidence one way or the other to conclude whether or not slavery exists, and that
 an in-depth, long-term study was required to determine whether the practice contin-
 ues.
 The Government remains sensitive to allegations about slavery. In January the
 Government arrested three human rights activists for allegedly collaborating in
 making a film that sought to document assertions that slavery persists in the coun-
 try (see Sections 1.d. and 2.a.).
 Problems related to the vestiges and consequences of .slavery usually enter the
 public domain in judicial cases, most often in the form of child custody and inherit-
 ance disputes, between former masters and former slaves or their descendants.
 However, court adjudication of such cases is rare. Several inheritance disputes be-
 tween Haratines and the descendants of their former master were adjudicated in
 court in recent years. Most such disputes were decided in accordance with the law,
 as the courts ruled that the descendants of the former slaves should inherit their
 property. However, in some cases involving land tenure, courts reportedly did not
 uphold the property rights of former slaves. No further action is known to have been
 taken on a 1994 land case in which a court ruled against a Black Moor of slave
 background in favor of a White Moor former master.
 In a 1995 case, the Supreme Council of the Magistrature removed a magistrate
 from the bench because he ruled, contrary to the law, that a former master, rather
 than the former slave's descendants, should inherit the possessions of a former
 slave. In December 1996, the Supreme Council of the Magistrature removed the
 magistrate in Kankossa from the bench because he refused to accept the provisions
 of the 1980 law abolishing slavery. The Government censured for a human rights-
 related cause at least one of the other three judges removed at the same time. The
 
 
 removal of these magistrates reinforced for other judges that the provisions of the
 1980 law apply.
 A case involving a former master, who was awarded custody of three children in
 early 1997 because he was deemed to be the father, still is pending. The two moth-
 ers, who are sisters, are appealing the court's decision and deny that the former
 master is the father. The mothers' lawyers argue that the man should not have been
 awarded custody because his marriages to the two women were illegal. According
 to Shari'a law, a man cannot be married to two sisters at the same time. Lawyers
 expect the case to be settled in 1999. Determination of such cases is problematic
 in a country where there are polygyny, "secref' marriages, no written records, and
 divorce by repudiation. The courts are prepared to pursue the concept of genetic
 testing to determine paternity, but no such cases have yet been brought.
 Three NGO's, SOS-Esclaves, the National Committee for the Struggle Aginst the
 Vestiges of Slavery in Mauritania, and the Initiative for the Support of the Activi-
 ties of the President, had as their focus issues related to the history of slavery in
 Mauritania. Of these, SOS-Esclaves was particularly active in bringing to public at-
 tention cases in which it found the rights of former slaves to have been abridged
 and in assisting former slaves in their difficulties with former masters. Other
 human rights and civic action NGO's also follow this issue closely. The independent
 press, which includes journals that are published by Haratines and southern-based
 ethnic groups who emphasize issues of importance to these ethnic groups, is also
 quick to report any incident that comes to its attention in which the rights of former
 slaves have not been respected.
 The Government focuses on education, literacy, and agrarian reform as the main
 means to eradicate the vestiges of slavery and deal with its consequences. The Gov-
 ernment has raised the level of primary school attendance from 45 percent in 1986
 to 85 percent this year. Classes are fully integrated, including boys and girls from
 all social and ethnic groups. In recent years, the Government's record in cases in
 which an individual's civil rights were affected because of status as a former slave
 was weak. When complaints were filed with the Government to remedy cases involv-
 ing detention of individuals against their will, the Government intervened in accord-
 ance with the law, although sometimes only after considerable prodding and pas-
 sage of time. On May 21, the Government created a new cabinet post, the Com-
 missariat for Human Rights, Poverty Alleviation, and Integration. A major focus of
 the commissariat is to address the vestiges and consequences of slavery.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employmen.-The
 Labor Code states explicitly that children must not be employed before the age of
 14 in the nonagricultural sector unless the Minister of Labor grants an exception
 due to local circumstances. The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by
 children but does not enforce this prohibition effectively in certain specific cases (see
 Sections 5 and 6.c.). The Government has a functional labor inspectorate empowered
 to refer cases directly to the appropriate judicial authorities. The Government lacks
 sufficient resources to enforce existing child labor laws (see Section 5).
 Education is not compulsory and, for financial and other reasons, 15 percent of
 elementary school-age children do not regularly attend government schools. Labor
 law specifies that no child under the age of 13 may be employed in the agricultural
 sector without the permission of the Minister of Labor, nor under the age of 14 in
 the nonagricultural sector. The law states that employed children between the ages
 of 14 and 16 should receive 70 percent of the minimum wage, and that those be-
 tween the ages of 17 and 18 should receive 90 percent of the minimum wage.
 Young children in the countryside commonly pursue herding, cultivation, fishing,
 and other significant labor in support of their families' activities. In keeping with
 longstanding tradition, many children serve apprenticeships in small industries and
 in the informal sector. There is no child labor in the modern industrial sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for adults was raised to
 $48.87 (9,872 ouguiya) per month in January. It is difficult for the average family
 to meet minimum needs and maintain a decent standard of living at this salary.
 The standard, legal, nonagricultural workweek may not exceed either 40 hours or
 6 days without overtime compensation, which is paid at rates that are graduated
 according to the number of supplemental hours worked. Domestic workers and cer-
 tain other categories work 56 hours. The Labor Directorate of the Ministry of Labor
 is responsible for enforcement of the labor laws, but in practice inadequate funding
 limits the effectiveness of the Directorate's enforcement.
 The Ministry of Labor is also responsible for enforcing safety standards but does
 so inconsistently, due to inadequate funding. In principle workers can remove them-
 selves from hazardous conditions without risking loss of employment; in practice,
 they cannot.
