 COMOROS
 The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros is an archipelago
 comprising four islands in ï¿½he Mozambique Channel. Comoros
 unilaterally declared its independence from France in 1975.
 The first President, Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane, was overthrown
 almost immediately but regained power in 1978 when mercenaries
 ousted the increasingly repressive and xenophobic regime of
 Ali Soilih. Running unopposed, Abdallah was reelected in
 1984. In recent years, constitutional amendments have
 strengthened the President's position, notably in the
 appointment of governors and in the establishment of a single
 legal political instrument, the United Progress Party (UPP).
 Traditional social and economic institutions still influence
 the country's political development. Village notables and
 religious leaders dominate local politics.
 A mercenary force of about 50 expatriates continues to train
 and lead the Presidential Guard, the best equipped security
 force in the islands. French technical assistance is provided
 to the small Comorian atmed forces and the Gendarmerie. Each
 island also has a small local police force. There was an
 unsuccessful coup in March 1985 by two dozen Comorian
 soldiers, who allegedly planned to kill the mercenaries and
 members of the Government.
 Agriculture dominates economic activity, but with a population
 of 450,000 likely to double by the year 2000, Comoros is
 rapidly approaching full utilization of arable land. Revenues
 from the export of vanilla, essence of ylang-ylang, cloves,
 and copra cover only a portion of necessary imports. There
 are no industries, port facilities are inadequate, and the
 highway and communications infrastructure is limited. Three
 major families, of which the President's is one, control a
 large share of the import-export business. Comoros is part of
 the French franc monetary zone. Government expenses far
 exceed revenues, and the country depends heavily on France for
 budgetary support and technical assistance.
 The human rights situation changed little in 1987. The
 Abdallah Government remained firmly in control and increased
 its hold on the National Assembly, with the UPP winning 41 of
 42 seats (1 is still to be contested) in March elections.
 Observers of those March elections reported that progovernment
 candidates benefited from large-scale manipulation of votes,
 particularly on Grand Comore island. On November 30, there
 was an attempted coup by a group of dissidents, including
 former members of the Presidential Guard and several persons
 connected with the 1985 coup attempt. At least three
 Comorians were killed. About 50 persons were arrested by the
 Presidential Guard. There was no evidence in 1987 of Islamic
 fundamentalist opposition, which allegedly flared briefly in
 1986 in the form of student unrest.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killing in 1987.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance in 1987.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Reports that mercenaries tortured some alleged coup
 conspirators were investigated by several human rights groups
 in 1985 and in 1986. According to its 1987 Report, Amnesty
 International (AI) sent a mission to Comoros in August 1986
 and, inter alia, raised with the Government the authorities'
 failure to investigate reports of ill-treatment of coup
 detainees. The mission also criticized the use of
 incommunicado detention and solitary confinement, citing in
 particular the case of Moustoifa Said Cheikh, the leader of
 the outlawed Comorian Democratic Front (FDC) who was sentenced
 to life imprisonment in 1985. There were reports of torture
 of at 'least three victims of the November 1987 coup.
 For most prisoners, penal discipline is lax. Prisoners are
 usually released daily for prayers and work, and families
 provide their meals. Conditions, although still Spartan,
 improved as the prison population declined.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Current legal procedures and practices permit the Government
 to arrest and detain persons almost without restriction,
 especially in security cases. There are periodic reports that
 suspected dissidents are detained, roughed up, and subsequently
 released. The Government used house arrests during the 1987
 elections, ordering at least 200 opposition activists under
 housearrest before polling began on March 22.
 About 20 officials of the Ali Soilih regime, held without
 trial from 1978 to 1980, were released prior to 1985. The
 March 1985 attempt to murder the mercenaries and certain
 senior members of the Abdallahregime led to the interrogation
 of hundreds of suspects, the arrest of about 200 persons, and
 the extended detention, incommunicado of about 80, many of them
 members or sympathizers of the FDC. The Government arrested
 an additional 30 soldiers at the end of 1985, allegedly for
 planning a second coup. Most of those detained or tried in
 1985 and 1986 were released in 1986 and 1987, but some
 additional arrests connected to the investigation of the coup
 attempt reportedly occurred in 1987. Members of the
 Presidential Guard reportedly participated in the arrests of
 about 50 persons suspected of involvement in the November 1987
 coup attempt.
 There is no indication of forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of'Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for the equality of all citizens
 before the law and the right of all accused to defense counsel.
 The Comorian legal system applies Islamic law and an inherited
 French legal code, French and Comorian experts are drafting a
 new consolidated legal code. Most disputes are settled by
 village elders or by a civil court of first instance. In
 regular civil and criminal cases, the judiciary is independent
 and trials :are public.
 However, the President has appointive and other judicial
 powers. In this connection, Abdallah ordered the
 establishment of a special court of appointed members to try
 the alleged coup conspirators, based on a 1960 decree as
 amended in October 1985. The November 1985 and July 1986
 
 
 66
 COMOROS
 trials commanded considerable attention, including that of
 international human rights organizations which protested the
 lengthy procedural delays and the brevity of the trials. In
 its 1987 Report, AI stated that the two trials failed to
 satisfy internationally recognized standards of fair trial and
 noted that some defendants were convicted on the basis of
 statements made under duress while in incommunicado detention.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and
 property. There were no known cases of arbitrary interference
 with privacy in 1987.
 Section 2' Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression, of
 thought, and of conscience, but Comorians discuss and
 criticize the Government and its leading personalities only in
 private.
 The local news media consist solely of the government-
 controlled radio station and the bimonthly newspaper, which
 are careful not to criticize the Government when covering
 domestic events. However, the Paris-based Indian Ocean
 Newsletter, which is often critical of the Comoros, and the
 Comorian Letter, which is published by members of the Comorian
 opposition in Paris, generally arrive unhindered through the
 international mail. Other foreign journals and newspapers are
 available, as are books from abroad.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Con.titution states that freedom of association is
 guaranteed. In practice, this right is partially
 circumscribed since the only legal political activity must
 take place within the framework of the United Progress Party.
 On July 1, 1987, a number of Comorians opposed to the idea of
 a possible third 6-year term for President Ahmed Abdallah
 staged a short, peaceful demonstration and dispersed on their
 own without any violence.
 Social occasions, such as the traditional lavish, extended
 weddings and funerals of prominent Comorians, are used as
 opportunities to discuss political topics.
 The Constitution also makes provision for the freedom of
 workers to form unions and to strike. However, farming on
 small landholdings, subsistence fishing, and petty commerce
 make up the daily activity of most of the population. Hence
 the wage labor force is very small, and unions are not
 effectively organized. Collective bargaining does not take
 place. The increasing scarcity of jobs is also a real
 restraint on labor complaints, organizational activities, and
 formal strikes. The Government's inability to pay wages and
 salaries on schedule sometimes results in work slowdowns,
 absenteeism, and informal, peaceful protests.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 An overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. The
 Constitution holds Islam to be the "wellspring of the
 
 
 67
 COMOROS
 principles and rules which guide the State and its
 institutions." However, the State upholds non-Muslims' right
 to practice their faith. There are churches for the small
 Protestant and Catholic populations. Christian missionaries
 work in local hospitals and schools, but they are not allowed
 to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the Comoros and travel abroad for citizens and
 foreigners is not restricted. Members of the Comorian
 community abroad, concentrated in France, oppose the
 Government, but in 1987 there was no evidence that those
 returning to the Comoros were subjected to government
 reprisals.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The right of citizens to change their Government does not
 exist. The restoration of President Abdallah in 1978
 introduced an era of strong authoritarian leadership.
 Abdallah remained in 1987 the single most important factor in
 Comorian politics. He commands the personal loyalty of the
 Presiclentiail Guard, and his position is buttressed both by
 tradition and by his own personal wealth.
 Elections for the 42-seat National Assembly on March 22, 1987,
 were marked by widespread fraud. On Anjouan, the President's
 home island, and Moheli, Abdallah declared ineligible all the
 opposition candidates. On election day, the Government ordered
 at least 200 opposition activists under house arrest before
 polling began. Opposition candidates charge that Presidential
 Guard members intimidated voters in one district on Grande
 Comore. There were reliable reports that the Government
 rewrote ballots in order to change the outcome in instances
 when opposition candidates received a majority of the votes,
 and to enhance the victories of government candidates.
 Comoros has claimed sovereignty over the island of Mayotte,
 which is under French control. The French have postponed
 indefinitely a new referendum on the status of Mayotte. In
 1977, 96 percent of the voters in Mayotte opted in favor of
 remaining with France. The Comorian Government has alleged
 electoral coercion in the 1977 vote and has pressed France to
 acknowledge Comorian sovereignty without a plebiscite.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been critical of some aspects of AI's work,
 but has cooperated with the organization as recently as 1986,
 when Al delegates met with a wide range of judicial and
 military officials, including the Minister of Justice. They
 were not, however, permitted to speak with the four "prisoners
 of conscience" AI had adopted and were not given access to the
 records of the November 1985 and July 1986 trials.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The constitutional deference to Islam formalizes the deeply
 held commitment of most Comorians to an Islamic world view.
 
 
 68
 COMOROS
 The society respects authority based on inheritance, age,
 wealth, and religious leadership.
 The Constitution formally provides for the equality of
 citizens regardless of race, sex, or religion. Women have the
 right to vote and to participate, in theory, in the political
 process as candidates. Women are neither veiled nor limited,
 in terms of employment, to minor civil service posts. Change
 in the status of women is most evident in the major towns.
 Nevertheless, within Comorian society, men have a dominant
 role. At traditional ceremonies and social gatherings, the
 sexes are separated. The opinions of husbands and fathers
 exercise a formidable influence over women's voting habits.
 In politics, tradition has also been a powerful force in
 discouraging women from direct participation.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Most of Comoros' inhabitants make their living from
 subsistence agriculture and fishing. There is no
 industrialization or factory activity. Jobs in the small
 modern economy are scarce, and accordingly wages are low.
 There is no minimum wage, age of employment, or code
 specifying formal standards of occupational safety and
 health. However, the hours of work in any category rarely
 exceed 35 hours per week, and child labor is not an issue due
 to the lack of employment opportunities for adolescent and
 young adults. Young children do work in family units in the
 large subsistence section.
