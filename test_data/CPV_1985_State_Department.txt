 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is ruled by the African Party for the Independence
 of Cape Verde (PAICV), the country's sole political party.
 Government ministers, in most cases, are also senior members
 of the party. Many of them are former leaders of the
 revolutionary movement to free Cape Verde from Portuguese
 rule. The party leadership, headed by President Aristides
 Pereira, rules the country. Although the PAICV is officially
 open to anyone wishing to join, less than 10 percent of the
 voting population are active party "militants." Security
 responsibilities are divided between the Army and the security
 and police forces, which operate under leadership approved by
 the party.
 The Constitution adopted in 1980 declares the party to be "the
 supreme expression" of the people and designates the Popular
 National Assembly as the supreme organ. The Assembly, which
 selects the President, is elected from a single slate of
 candidates proposed to the electorate by the party. Elections
 for the third National Assembly were held on December 7, 1985.
 Cape Verde's economy has suffered from an 18-year drought but
 has benefited from generous foreign assistance, remittances
 from Cape Verdean emigrants, and efficient economic management
 by the Government. Moreover, the country has made substantial
 strides in providing adequate health care, education, and
 other services. The Government, which is the largest
 nonagricultural employer, controls banking, the import of
 basic commodities, the airlines, the press, and the schools.
 Private property rights are respected, and a substantial
 private sector consists of shops, hotels, farms, fishing,
 small industries such as tuna canneries, and the professions.
 The human rights situation during 1985 remained basically the
 same as in 1984. The Government passed a new law aimed at
 greater freedom of press, but the party cautioned that this
 right should be exercised responsibly. While little political
 activity takes place outside party or mass organizations, the
 largely apolitical population is not repressed and there is
 little sign of hostile opposition. The longstanding Cape
 Verdean tradition of emigration provides an escape valve for
 discontent. Within the one-party system, elections in 1985
 provided an opportunity for expanded participation in the
 political process by all persons over 18 years of age.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 During 1985 there were no reported instances of politically
 motivated killings. Cape Verde is the only country in Africa
 where capital punishment has been outlawed.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1985 there were no reported cases of disappearance.

 CAPE VERDE
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although there was no evidence in 1985 of torture and cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment being used in a
 generalized manner, groups of Cape Verdean emigres from time
 to time allege that one or another of these activities takes
 place. The possibility of beatings during interrogations by
 security officers cannot be ruled out, but there is no
 evidence that they are condoned by responsible government
 officials. Conditions in prisons are poor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 During 1985 there were no reported instances of people being
 detained, punished, or tried for the expression of views
 critical of or different from those of the Government. There
 were no instances of forced exile for political or other
 reasons. In cases of alleged crimes against state security,
 persons may be detained for up to five months upon a judge's
 ruling without trial. There are no forced labor practices in
 Cape Verde.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are no known political prisoners in Cape Verde. Habeas
 corpus exists in Cape Verde and appears to be observed except
 in state security cases. Unless caught in the act, the
 accused must be brought before a judge within 48 hours of
 arrest to hear the prosecutor's evidence against him. In
 exceptional cases, and then only with the concurrence of a
 procurator or judge, the laying of formal charges may be
 slightly delayed, but must nonetheless take place within five
 days. The accused has the right to representation by counsel
 at such hearings and, depending on the judge's ruling, may be
 held in custody, released on bail, or released
 unconditionally. Trials are conducted by a judge, and a
 public prosecutor presents the case against the accused, who
 is defended by counsel. The Autonomous Institute for
 Judiciary Support, to which all private lawyers belong, exists
 to provide counsel in cases of need. There is no jury
 system. Trials are generally handled expeditiously and appeal
 is possible. There is also a system of popular tribunals to
 adjudicate minor disputes in rural areas. The "judges" are
 usually prominent local citizens without legal training, who
 are appointees of the Ministry of Justice. Their decisions
 can be appealed within the regular court system.
 The judiciary does not have the authority to determine the
 constitutionality of legislation. Although, according to the
 Constitution, judges are independent, one former judge now
 living outside the country has claimed that one-party rule in
 practice has hampered the functioning of a truly independent
 judiciary. Most evidence suggests, however, that the courts
 protect individual rights in criminal cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution recognizes the inviolability of domicile,
 correspondence, and other private means of communication. In
 the case of a domicile, the law requires search warrants
 issued by a judge. There were no known cases of arbitrary
 interference with privacy, tamily, home, or correspondence
 during 1985. The Constitution also contains a provision
 
 
 CAPE VERDE
 stating that every citizen has the right and the duty to
 participate in the political, economic, and cultural life of
 the country. This provision theoretically could be used to
 force participation in activities against the individual's
 will. In practice, there is no evidence to suggest that it
 has been so used.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution proclaims freedom of speech and intellectual
 creativity, but it also stipulates that none of these rights
 may be exercised "contrary to national unity". While freedom
 of the press is not specifically guaranteed by the
 Constitution, a new law adopted in 1985 assures citizens the
 right to express their views in the press. At the same time,
 the political commission of the party underlined that this
 right should be exercised responsibly. The weekly newspaper
 and radio are government owned, and follow government
 policies. Although occasional articles critical of some
 aspects of government policy are printed or broadcast, this is
 probably done with prior government authorization.
 International periodicals'generally circulate freely in Cape
 Verde, even when they contain articles critical of or
 unflattering to the Government, as is sometimes the case with
 Portuguese newspapers. International radio broadcasts are
 received without interference. Censorship of movies is
 practiced, although it is not known if the criteria are
 political or moral. Local radio broadcasts carry items from
 Western press agencies as well as from Communist countries,
 generally identifying sources on controversial international
 issues and balancing, for example, Tass reports with reports
 from Western sources. The Catholic Church's newspaper, which
 occasionally publishes moderate criticism of some aspects of
 life in Cape Verde, seems to be tolerated without
 interference. The Nazarenes and Seventh Day Adventists
 distribute papers published abroad.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While the Constitution specifies the rights of freedom of
 assembly, association, and demonstration, as a practical
 matter no organization opposed to government actions or
 policies is permitted. Private associations other than sports
 clubs and religious youth groups do not exist, and those few
 are subject to authorization. Party sponsored "mass
 organizations" of women and youth are prominent.
 Workers in several sectors are organized into unions which are
 members of the National Union Confederation. Although it
 claims to be independent of the party, the Confederation is
 affiliated with the party and headed by a high ranking party
 member. Perhaps one-third of the active work force are
 nominal union members. Individual unions perform some
 traditional trade union functions and also act as party
 affiliates. The right to collective bargaining exists. If a
 dispute cannot be settled by the employer and the union or
 employees involved, the matter is referred to a labor
 tribunal. The right to strike is guaranteed but rarely used,
 even though union leadership in state enterprises has taken
 positions opposed to government policies on specific issues.
 The National Union Confederation is a participant in the
 International Labor Organization and is affiliated with the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity, but has not taken
 
 
 56
 CAPE VERDE
 positions independent of those officially sanctioned by the
 Government. It maintains contact and receives assistance from
 both Communist and non-Communist national unions abroad.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for separation of church and state.
 Freedom of worship is respected by the Government, and members
 of all faiths practice their religion without harassment.
 Two-thirds or more of the population, probably including most
 government leaders, are nominally Catholic, but the dominance
 of Catholicism does not appear adversely to affect other
 faiths. Evangelical Protestants and Seventh Day Adventists
 make up the two other principal religious communities.
 At least two faiths, the Baha'i and Christian Rationalism,
 which were formally banned or suppressed under the Portuguese,
 have been permitted to reestablish themselves since
 independence. There are no restrictions on religious
 conversion and teaching, or on contacts with coreligionists
 outside Cape Verde. The Catholic Church, for example, openly
 opposes birth control by other than the "natural family
 planning" method, even though other methods are advocated and
 supported by the Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no extraordinary legal or administrative restrictions
 on either travel or residence within the country. All resident
 Cape Verdeans wishing to leave the country, either temporarily
 or permanently, must obtain exit permission from the
 Government. Such permission has not been denied for political
 reasons. Emigration has long been an important and recognized
 means of escape from prevailing harsh economic conditions.
 The Government makes a considerable effort to maintain close
 contact with emigre communities, and provides every opportunity
 for Cape Verdeans living abroad to maintain their ties with
 the homeland, including making provision for them to vote in
 elections. Repatriation is a constitutional right, and the
 Government does not discourage intending repatriates.
 The law allows for revocation of citizenship on several
 grounds, including activities contrary to the interest of the
 country. However, there are no known cases of the Government
 instituting proceedings to deprive persons of citizenship.
 There are at most only a handful of foreign refugees in Cape
 Verde. In August 1985, when a Cuban family sought refuge in
 the American Embassy and assistance in departing to a third
 country, the Government not only authorized them to leave but
 provided protection and cooperated fully in making the
 departure arrangements.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The single-party monopoly of power in Cape Verde is inscribed
 in the Constitution. Opposition parties are not permitted,
 although small opposition groups exist abroad. The small
 group of men who actually led the struggle for independence
 occupy positions of leadership in both the party and the
 Government. The Secretary General of the party is President
 of the Republic; the Deputy Secretary General is Prime
 Minister; and the third ranking party official is President of
 the National Assembly. Altogether, seven of the nine members
 
 
 57
 CAPE VERDE
 of the party's Political Commission are also Ministers; the
 other two manage day-to-day activities of the party. At the
 time of the party's second and most recent Congress in 1983,
 there were 5,860 members, representing about 5 percent of the
 total adult population, a 100 percent increase since 1975.
 The party membership is young (47 percent under 30 years of
 age), largely male (women are 14 percent of membership),
 disproportionately urban (50 percent in a nation which is more
 than two-thirds rural), and heavily bureaucratic (25 percent
 of the party members are civil servants or employees of state
 enterprises). Within this elitist party, there exists modest
 scope for meaningful political activity. For example, the
 delegates to the Second Party Congress, and the leadership
 itself, were elected by secret ballot with some unexpected
 changes in the order of precedence of the Ministers. The
 party leadership at that Congress also made an obvious effort
 to give more-prominent roles to women and individuals
 possessing less solid revolutionary credentials.
 Elections for the Third Popular Assembly were held in December
 1985. The party controls the election process, but each list
 of candidates contained from 1 1/2 to 4 times more names than
 the number of deputies to be elected from a particular
 constituency. There are at least three stages of local
 consultation and the final candidates, including nonparty as
 well as party members, are selected by secret ballot. In the
 1985 elections, 6 persons not on the party's preliminary list
 were chosen by the people for inclusion on the final list.
 While the National Assembly is the formal supreme organ of the
 Government, in fact most day-to-day decisions are delegated to
 the Council of Ministers. The Assembly meets twice yearly in
 sessions at which earlier party/government decisions are
 ratified. Although issues are debated openly, with critical
 interventions reported by the media, policy decisions made by
 the Council of Ministers are not reversed. Nevertheless,
 deputies who believe the interests of their constituents are
 being harmed by Government policies or decisions feel free to
 criticize those policies or decisions, and do so.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In the past, the Government has permitted visits by private
 organizations to check on the condition of persons convicted
 for political or related offenses. There are no known
 instances in which the Government has been the subject of
 resolutions, investigations, or other actions by international
 human rights organizations. A few Cape Verdean emigrants
 living abroad have consistently made allegations of human
 rights violations. These charges may have influenced internal
 policies, given the Government's major effort to maintain
 close relations with the large communities of Cape Verdean
 emigrants around the world. There are no known human rights
 organizations in the country, although the lawyers'
 Association for the Provision of Judicial Support in effect
 acts as such. Amnesty International's 1985 Report does not
 contain an entry on Cape Verde. Freedom House rates Cape
 Verde as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Cape Verde has few natural resources and suffers from
 inadequate rainfall and other fresh water supplies. In
 
 
 58
 CAPE VERDE
 periods of normal rainfall, only 4 of the 10 islands support
 significant agricultural production. The population is about
 312,000 and growing at the rate of 1.9 percent a year. Over
 100,000 persons farm or work in agricultural production. Per
 capita GNP is estimated at about $353. Over the past 150
 years, recurrent droughts and high unemployment have led to
 massive emigration. There is a large Cape Verdean overseas
 population estimated at about 500,000, of whom some 300,000
 live in the United States. Emigrant remittances and foreign
 aid account for two-thirds of the country's GNP.
 The Government gives high priority to the prevention of
 famine, which has been averted since independence through food
 aid provided primarily by western countries, including a
 cumulative total of $60 million from the U.S. There have been
 no recorded deaths from starvation, though this was a serious
 problem during droughts prior to independence. Up to 20
 percent of donated emergency food is distributed free to the
 old, the infirm, and others unable to work. The remainder is
 sold under the terms of agreements with the donors and the
 proceeds used for development projects such as water and soil
 conservation programs.
 Life expectancy at birth is 62 years, with an infant mortality
 rate estimated at 88 per 1,000 live births, and an overall
 death rate in 1980 of 8 per 1000. The adult literacy rate is
 37 percent. Primary school attendance (ages 7 to 12) has
 increased 300 percent since independence, and schooling is now
 available to more than 80 percent of this age group.
 Nonetheless, schools continue to be characterized by
 overcrowded classrooms and a paucity of trained teachers.
 The Code of the Family, enacted in October 1981, prescribes
 full legal equality of men and women, including equal pay for
 equal work. Minimum wages are established by government
 decree. As of January 1, 1986, the established minimum wage
 for civil servants (the basis for minimum wages in all other
 forms of nonrural employment) is approximately $72 per month
 at current exchange rates. In rural areas, the daily minimum
 for the least skilled types of labor is about $0.83. There
 are 10 paid holidays per year, with supplementary "days of
 tolerance" for some religious festivals or other special
 occasions. There does not appear to be an overall safety and
 health code for the workplace, although there are particular
 regulations such as those prohibiting the employment of minors
 in establishments where toxic materials are present. The
 minimum age for employment is 14, and children under 16 are
 prohibited from working at night or working more than 7 hours
 per day. The normal work week is 44 hours over 5 1/2 days. A
 worker is entitled to at least one full day (24 hours) of
 leisure per week. These regulations seem to be respected in
 practice.
 Racial discrimination is not a problem in Cape Verde. The
 vast majority of the population is of Portuguese-African
 ancestry. Sex discrimination exists sociologically, although
 banned by the Constitution. Many of the traditional, male
 oriented values of the Portuguese and African ancestors of
 today's Cape Verdeans are still part of the country's
 culture. Women have been customarily excluded from certain
 types of work and are often paid less than men for comparable
 work. However, the Government has included women in the labor
 intensive economic development projects financed by foreign
 grants. The Organization of Cape Verdean Women was founded in
 1980, with party encouragement, to sensitize Cape Verdeans to
 issues affecting women.
