 LESOTHO
 Lesotho has a highly literate population and a tradition of
 political activism. The present Government came to power
 when Lesotho gained its independence from Great Britain in
 1966. In 1970 the government annulled the elections and
 suspended the constitution, and protests against these
 moves were suppressed. A feeble coup attempt in 1974 was
 quickly put down. A number of arrests were made and the
 opposition leadership fled the country. About a score of
 persons were convicted of various crimes in connection with
 the coup attempt; others were acquitted.
 While written guarantees of individual rights have been
 suspended, actual violations of human rights have been
 mitigated by an independent and impartial judiciary. In
 recent years the government embarked on a strategy of
 national reconciliation, which has included lifting the
 state of emergency, and appointing members of the opposition
 parties to key cabinet positions and the interim National
 Assembly. However, terrorist bombings and sabotage attempts
 began in April 1979, and these activities apparently have
 led the government to abandon further moves toward reconcil-
 iation. While the free play of political forces thus
 remains restricted, the Government has indicated that it
 recognizes the need to find a formula which would permit
 all Basotho political elements to participate in national
 elections.
 1.     Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.     Torture
 No instances of torture have been alleged in recent years,
 and there is no evidence that it is either practiced or
 countenanced.
 b.     Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No instances of treatment or punishment of this kind, which
 is forbidden by law, have been alleged in recent years.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross has affirmed
 that prisoners in Lesotho are treated humanely.
 c.    Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under emergency security legislation adopted in 1974,
 persons can be arrested without charges and detained for re-
 newable periods of 60 days. Detention may not be challenged
 in the courts. The legislation contains no provision for
 public acknowledgement of a person's detention. Some
 persons convicted and jailed for violence against the state
 are considered political prisoners by critics of the
 Government. Nearly all those imprisoned for participating
 in the 1974 coup attempt have been released.
 In November, 1979, a village chief and an eighteen year
 old girl in northern Lesotho were killed by members of
 the exiled opposition. Subsequent police operations
 conducted in villages considered sympathetic to the exiles
 
 
 103
 reportedly led to several deaths and prompted a few hundred
 villagers to seek refuge in neighboring South Africa.
 d.    Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No trial is accorded to persons detained under the emergency
 security legislation referred to above. All other persons
 arrested are accorded a fair, public trial. The judiciary
 in Lesotho retains its independence and integrity; a public
 trial, including rights of appeal, was granted to the
 leaders of the unsuccessful 1974 coup attempt.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 There have been no recent allegations of invasion of the
 home. Warrants are required for ordinary police officials
 to enter private homes, but senior police officers can
 enter homes without warrants at their own discretion.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Lesotho is one of the poorest countries in Africa, with a
 per capita income of approximately $245 per year (according
 to a recent government estimate) and it is heavily dependent
 on foreign assistance to improve the economic well-being of
 its people.
 Lesotho's dependence on South Africa for virtually all its
 economic needs has made it intensely aware of its vulnerabil-
 ity to economic disruptions (e.g. UN sanctions against
 South Africa) or politically-inspired economic pressures
 from its powerful neighbor. It has therefore given priority
 to projects aimed at reducing its dependence. The Government
 recognizes the dilemma this poses for development and the
 danger of reducing the emphasis on attention to the needs
 of the poor. It has cooperated with donor efforts to focus
 aid increasingly on fundamental problems of agriculture,
 health and literacy. It has encouraged foreign investment
 and sought to concentrate it in labor-intensive industries
 in order to increase limited domestic employment opportuni-
 ties.
 Public and private corruption exists in Lesotho, although
 it has not affected the implementation of U.S. assistance
 programs. There are indications that political loyalties
 sometimes are a factor in the provision of government
 services or in obtaining entrance to university and govern-
 ment employment.
 Lesotho's tax system is progressive. Taxes are collected
 primarily from those employed in the small cash sector,
 particularly the civil service, where real wages are
 considerably higher than in the rural subsistence sector.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.    Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Lesotho has no restrictions on religion but limitations
 
 
 104
 remain on freedom of speech. The radio and some printed
 media are government-owned, but two independent newspapers
 are frequently critical of the Government's policies and
 practices. Freedom of assembly for purposes of political
 dissent is not assured.
 b.    Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on domestic travel and few on
 emigration. Special permission must be obtained to travel
 to Botswana, which has granted political asylum to Lesotho
 refugees who oppose the Government's policies. Obtaining
 the required police security clearance for the issuance of
 an international passport has proven difficult for some
 opponents of the Government. One outspoken member of the
 opposition has been denied travel documentation on security
 grounds to prevent his leaving Lesotho. Lesotho has
 acceded to the 1951 convention on refugees and its 1967
 protocol and has taken in refugees and exiles from South
 Africa.
 c.    Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political activity has been restricted since 1970, when the
 Government suspended the constitution and declared a state
 of emergency. However, in 1973 an interim national assembly
 was established to act as a legislative branch. While all
 members are appointed by the Government, they include
 representatives from the opposition and important local
 interest groups as well as a number of traditional chiefs.
 This process has gradually been expanded until virtually
 all political groups have some representation in the
 government. No plans for elections, however, have been
 announced.
 Labor unions are allowed to bargain collectively with
 employers and enter into contracts, but are discouraged
 from political activity. Women have equal suffrage rights.
 Because so many Lesotho men seek work in South Africa, the
 majority of farms in Lesotho are worked by women. There is
 no discrimination on ethnic or other grounds. Lesotho has
 a small white minority who are citizens.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government of Lesotho has not denied that violations of
 human rights have occurred and is willing to discuss past
 excesses openly. The Government has allowed outside
 investigations of alleged human rights violations. In mid-
 1978 it met with representatives of Amnesty International
 to discuss the few persons still imprisoned for participa-
 tion in the 1974 coup attempt.
