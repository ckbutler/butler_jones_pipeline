 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka is a longstanding democratic republic with an active multipart system.
 Constitutional power is shared between the popularly elected President and the 225-
 member Parliament. President Chandrika Kumaratunga leads the governing Peo-
 ple's Alliance (PA), a coalition of parties. Both the Parliament and the President
 were elected in free and fair elections in 1994. The Government respects constitu-
 tional provisions for an independent judiciary.
 For the past 14 years the Government has fought the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
 Eelam (LTTE), an insurgent organization fighting for a separate state for the coun-
 try's Tamil minority. During the year, the fighting intensified. In May the Govern-
 ment launched a major offensive aimed at opening a land route to the Jaffna Penin-
 sula through LI2rE-controlled territory in the north. The offensive resulted in hun-
 dreds killed on both sides and created tens of thousands of newly displaced persons.
 The Government controls all security forces. The 50,000-member police force is re-
 sponsible for internal security in most areas of the country and has also been used
 in military operations against the LTTE. The 118,000 member army (which includes
 the Army Volunteer Force), and the 12,500-member navy and 10,000-member air
 force, bear principal responsibility for conducting the war against the LTTE insur-
 gents. The police paramilitary Special Task Force (STF) also battles the LTTE. The
 5,000 strong home guards, an armed force drawn from local communities, provides
 security forMuslim and Sinhalese village communities in or near the war zone. The
 Government also arms and directs various Tamil militias opposed to the LTTE,
 though at times these groups act independently of government authority. During the
 year, some members of the security forces committed serious human rights abuses.

 Sri Lanka is a low-income country with a market economy that is based on the
 export of textiles, garments, tea, rubber, coconuts, and gems, and on earnings from
 tourism and repatriated earnings of citizens employed abroad. The gross domestic
 product per capita is about $780. The economy grew in excess of 5 percent per year
 during 1990-1995 but growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 1996 due to the ongoing war
 and a severe drought. Renewed investor confidence, an upswing in tourism, and
 easier credit helped the economy rebound to a growth rate of almost 6 percent in
 1997. During the year, the Government made significant steps toward economic re-
 form, including trimming subsidies, privatizing government enterprises, and pro-
 moting foreign investment and trade.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens in areas not
 affected by the conflict. However, the ongoing war with the LTTE continued to be
 accompanied by serious human rights abuses by the security forces. Security forces
 committed as many as 100 extrajudicial killings. In addition, at least 100 individ-
 uals disappeared from security force custody on and near the Jaffna Peninsula in
 the north during the course of the year and 25 such disappearances occurred in the
 eastern part of the island. Torture remained a serious problem, and prison condi-
 tions remained poor. Arbitrary arrests-including short-term mass arrests and de-
 tentions-continued, often accompanied by failure of the security forces to comply
 with some of the protective provisions of the Emergency Regulations (ER). Impunity
 for those responsible for human rights abuses remained a serious problem. No ar-
 rests were made in connection with the disappearance and presumed killing of at
 least 300 LTTE suspects in Jaffna in 1996. Progress was made in a few longstand-
 ing, high-profile cases of extrajudicial killing and disappearance. In most cases, how-
 ever, no progress was made, or there was no investigation or prosecution at all, giv-
 ing the appearance of impunity for those responsible for human rights violations.
 Both the Government and the LTrE apparently killed prisoners taken on the battle-
 field. The Government infringed on citizens' privacy rights and engaged in direct
 censorship of domestic newspaper reporting and foreign television broadcasts from
 January to May. Discrimination and violence against women, child prostitution, and
 child labor continued to be problems.
 In positive developments, the Government took steps to control the abuses. A per-
 manent Human Rights Commission was constituted and began operations. A human
 rights office opened officially on January 8, 1998 in Jaffna. Prosecutions of security
 force personnel alleged to have engaged in human rights abuse continued in a few
 cases. In the Krishanthi Kumaraswamy murder and rape case in which a young
 woman and three other individuals were killed in September 1996 in Jaffna, the
 Government ordered an expedited trial for the nine accused. The case came to trial
 in September and was ongoing at year's end. There was no attempt, as in the past,
 to use the ER to cover up security force misdeeds. Through its rulings, the judiciary
 continued to exhibit its independence and uphold individual civil rights. Govern-
 ment security forces continued to take effective measures to limit civilian casualties
 during military operations. The Government also continued to provide relief to those
 displaced by the conflict even though many were still under the control of the L1E.
 However, government restriction on medical supplies contributed to poor health con-
 ditions for civilians in the Vanni. Three regional commissions established to inves-
 tigate disappearances completed their investigations although the results of these
 investigations were not made public.
 Progovernment Tamil militants committed extrajudicial killings and were respon-
 sible for disappearances, torture, detentions, and forced conscription.
 The LTTE attacked civilians during the course of the year. The LTTE regularly
 committed extrajudicial killings, and was also responsible for disappearances, tor-
 ture arbitrary arrests, and detentions. The LTTE killed two parliamentarians and
 nine other civilians in two separate incidents in Trincomalee in July. LTTE attacks
 on international shipping resulted in the death of several crewmen and considerable
 damage to property. The LITE continued to take civilians hostage and, in July, ab-
 ducted 32 Muslim villagers, demanding the release of 5 LTTE prisoners held by the
 security forces. All of these hostages had been released by November. The LTTE at-
 tacked a number of economic targets, including the October bombing of the World
 Trade Center and nearby hotels and the July attack on a Panamanian-flag mer-
 chant vessel. The LTTE continued to control large sections of the north and east
 of the country through authoritarian military rule, denying the people under its au-
 thority the right to change their government, infringing on their privacy rights, rou-
 tinely violating their civil liberties, operating an unfair court system, and severely
 discriminating against ethnic and religious minorities.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Police (mostly STF officers) and
 army and navy personnel committed extrajudicial killings in both Jaffna and the
 Eastern Province. Most of these were associated with operations against the LTTE
 insurgents or interrogation of suspected terrorists.  p to 100 individuals were
 killed, although the exact number was impossible to ascertain due to censorship of
 news relating to military or police operations, and lack of regular access to the north
 and east where the war was being waged.
 In some cases these extrajudicial killings were reprisals against civilians for
 LTTE attacks in which members of the security forces were killed or injured. In
 many cases, the security forces claimed that the victims were members of the LTTE,
 but human rights monitors believe otherwise. The perpetrators of these killings had
 not been arrested by the Government at year's end.
 Impunity remains a serious problem. Since April 1995 at least 700 persons have
 been extrajudicially killed by the security forces or disappeared after being taken
 into security forces custody and are presumed dead. As of year's end, no member
 of the security forces had been convicted for any of these crimes. In the vast major-
 ity of cases where military personnel may have committed human rights violations,
 the Government has not identified those responsible and brought them to justice.
 The military leadership has failed also in this regard. Almost all senior military offi-
 cers now serving were mid-level officers during the Janetha Vimukthi Peramuna
 (JVP) uprising, when security forces were given great leeway in dealing with that
 threat to the nation's security. Attitudes and practices have been slow to change.
 Security force personnel were probably responsible for the death of Reverend
 Innasi Arulpalan, a priest from the Jaffna Diocese of the Church of South India.
 The University Teachers for Human Rights-Jaffna (UTHR-J) reported that wit-
 nesses saw Rev. Arulpalan and two other individuals being taken away by the army
 on August 25. Their three mutilated bodies were found on September 9. The mili-
 ta  formally denied responsibility for the incident and placed the blame on the
 In November 1996, 16 police and army personnel were arrested for the rape and
 murder of Krishanthi Kumaraawany, the murder of 2 of her family members, and
 the rape and murder of another individual. Although 11 of the security personnel
 were originally accused in the case, charges against 2 have reportedly been dropped
 in return for their cooperation in the investigation. The Government in February or-
 dered a trial at bar against the 9 accused in an effort to expedite the case. A trial
 at bar means that the case is to be heard by a panel of judges, dispensing with a
 lengthier trial by jury. This is only the fourth time since independence that the Gov-
 ernment has taken the step of ordering a trial at bar. The case came to trial in Sep-
 tember and was ongoing at year's end.
 The case against the eight soldiers and one reserve police constable arrested in
 February 1996 in the Kumarapuram massacre of 24 Tamil villagers came to trial
 in September and was ongoing at year's end.
 In July 1996, the charred body of a Tamil textile merchant who had been detained
 under the ER was found at Giribawa in North Central Province. Six police officers,
 including the officer in charge of the police counter-subversive unit in Vavuniya,
 were arrested and detained under the ER. The officers in the Giribawa case were
 released on bail. The officer in charge was released at the end of December 1996;
 the other officers were released in January. The Attorney General had not made a
 recommendation to the High Court at year's end.
 In October 1995, 22 members of the STF were arrested and detained under the
 ER on suspicion of murdering 23 Tamil youths whose bodies were found floating in
 Bolgoda Lake and other bodies of water near Colombe. The suspects were released
 on bail and resumed their police functions in February 1996. At year's end the case
 had not come to trial. It was delayed on several occasions by the prosecution's fail-
 ure to be present during court proceedings.
 A presidential commission was established to investigate alleged torture and mur-
 der in the late 1980's at a government-run detention center at Eatalanda Housing
 Estate near Colombo. In August 1996 five police officers were arrested for alleged
 complicity in the center's abuses. The investigation was continuing at year's end.
 The People's Alliance (PA) Government came to power in 1994 promising to bring
 to justic  e perpetrators of extrajudicial killings from previous years. in 1994 it
 began prosecutions of suspects in several extrajudicial murders allegedly per-
 petrated by members of the security forces. The trial of 21 soldiers, accused of mas-
 sacring 35 Tamil civilians in 1992 in the village of Mailanthani in Batticaloa dis-
 trict, was transferred to the Colombo High Court in 1996. The trial was continuing
 
 
 1697
 at year's end. In April the 4 police officers indicted in 1994 for the 1990 murders
 of 12 civilians in Wavulkelle were acquitted for la&k of evidence.
 There were no developments in the Government investigations into the mass
 graves at Sooriyakanda, which contain an estimated 300 bodies, or the grave at
 Ankumbura, which is thought to-contain the bodies of 36 people killed by the police
 in 1989. There were also no developments in the Nikaweratiya army camp incident
 in which 20 youths were allegedly killed by soldiers in 1989 during the period of
 the JVP uprising.
 On July 10, the ER, which had been in force throughout the country intermit-
 tently since 1983, was lifted in most areas outside of the north and east and the
 capital of Colombo. There was no evidence that the Government was using the regu-
 lations, as in previous years, to conceal extrajudicial killings or disappearances.
 Nevertheless, crucial safeguards built into the ER and the legislation establishing
 the new Human Rights Commission (HRC)-which replaced the Human Rights
 Task Force (HRTF)-were being routinely ignored by the security forces-especially
 those provisions requiring receipts to be issued for arrests and ordering the security
 forces to notify the HRC (previously the HRTF) of any arrest within 48 hours. Al-
 though security force personnel can be fined or jailed for failure to comply with the
 ER, none were known to have been punished during the year.
 In the east and in Vavuniya in the north, the military wing of the People's Libera-
 tion Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), the Mohan group and the Rasheek
 grou-pro-government Tamil militant organizations-were responsible for killing a
 number of people. The security forces arm and use these militias to provide informa-
 tion, help identify LTTE insurgents and, in some cases, fight in military operations
 against the insurgents. The exact size of these militias is impossible to ascertain but
 they probably total less than 2,000 persons. Military oversight of these groups is in-
 adequate. These groups frequently operated beyond government control. The mili-
 tias gain access to internally displaced perons (IDP's) transit camps through a vari-
 ety of means, including bribery and threats. Complaints about their activities con-
 tinued as the number of IDP's interacting with them increased, especially in the
 IDP transit camps in Vavuniya. It was impossible to determine the number of vic-
 tims because of the secrecy with which these groups operated. Those killed by these
 militants included both L  operatives and civilians who failed to comply with ex-
 tortion demands.
 Violence between supporters of the major political parties worsened during the
 ear, and six people, including a member of Parliament, were killed in violence re-
 lated to local government elections held in March.
 The LTTE continued to commit extrajudicial killings. In July it killed two mem-
 bers of Parliament (M.P."s) in separate attacks that also claimed the lives of nine
 other individuals, including a small child. Killings of political opponents in the east
 continued, some perpetrated by "pistol gangs" which successfully carried out their
 attacks using motorcycles and revolvers. The LITE continued to execute suspected
 government informants. In the past, the LTTE has killed university professors,
 members of nonviolent Tamil opposition parties, and human rights monitors.
 In July the L'IE hijacked an empty Indonesian-flag passenger ferry and subse-
 quently burned it after releasing the crew. Later that month the LTTE hijacked a
 North-Korean flag cargo vessel, killing a member of the crew. In September the
 LTTE attacked and badly damaged a Panamanian-flag merchant vessel. Up to 15
 civilians were killed in the attack, including Chinese crewmen.
 The LTTE also attacked government installations. For example, in October there
 were several attacks on police stations and military bases in the north and east.
 Scores of people on both sides were killed in these actions.
 There were no developments in the October 1994 suicide bombing that killed the
 United National Party's presidential candidate, Gamini Dissanayake, and 58 other
 people, although the LTTE is generally believed to be responsible.
 b. Disappearance.-Disappearances at the hands of the security forces continued,
 especially in the east and north. There were no reports of disappearances in
 Colombo in 1997. Most of the disappearances were associated with the arrest of sus-
 "pected LTTE insurgents. At least 125 individuals disappeared, although, as with
 extrajudicial killings, the exact number was impossible to ascertain due to censor-
 ship of news about security force operations and infrequent access to the north and
 east.
 There were approximately 350 confirmed cases of disappearance in 1996, 34 in
 1995, and 10 in 1994. The large number of disappearances in 1996 corresponded to
 an intensification of the conflict with the LTTE, including the Government's capture
 of the Jaffna Peninsula and several acts of terror by the LTTE, including a suicide
 bombing in Jaffna in July 1996. Those who disappeared in 1997 and in previous
 years are presumed dead. The disappearances involved persons last known to be in
 
 
 1698
 olice or army custody. The Commander of the Army and the Inspector General of
 lichave both issued directives condemning disappearances and stating that per-
 petrators would be called to account. No security force personnel have been pros-
 ecuted to date.
 In November 1996, the Ministry of Defense established a Board of Investigation
 to look into disappearances in the north and east and review security forces proce-
 dures. According to press reports, the Board received more than 2,500 complaints
 of disappearances. After eliminating duplicated names, the Board found that 730
 persons were alleged to have disappeared. It was able to trace 182, who were lo-
 cated at home or in custody. The balance of 548 cases was unresolved. The Board
 completed its activities and disbanded by year's end, and its findings were not made
 public. At year's end, the Government had not publicly identified or charged those
 responsible for disappearances during the year, although government officials have
 indicated that those responsible would be held accountable.
 The mandates of the three regional commissions set up in November 1994 to in-
 quire into disappearances occurring after January 1, 1988 expired, and the commis-
 sions submitted their final reports to President Kumaratunga in September. The
 commissions investigated 19,079 cases of disappearance, most of which occurred
 during the 1988-89 period of the JVP uprising. The commissions are reported to
 have found evidence that 16,742 persons disappeared after having been involuntar-
 ily removed. The commissions were believed to have accumulated sufficient informa-
 tion to prosecute a large number of government officials and security forces person-
 nel for human rights violations. Their final reports had not been made public by
 year's end, nor had the Government taken steps to prosecute those responsible for
 the disappearances, although the Justice Minister promised that the Government
 would do so.
 The trial of 11 suspects, including an army brigadier general, in the disappear-
 ance of 32 youths from the southern town of Embilipitiya in 1989 and 1990 contin-
 ued at year's end. These were no developments in the Vantharamulle case, in which
 army troops allegedly abducted 158 Tamils from a refugee camp in Batticaloa dis-
 trict in 1990. Observers maintain there is credible evidence identifying the alleged
 perpetrators. There was also no progress in the case of 31 youths who allegedly dis-
 appeared following their arrests in Divulapitiya in 1989.
 The Government continued to give the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) unhindered access to approximately 250 detention centers, police stations,
 and army camps officially recognized as places of detention. This played an impor-
 tant role in enabling the ICRC to monitor the human rights practices of the security
 forces, as did the work of the HRC, which replaced the HRTF in mid-year. However,
 the HRC opened an office in Jaffna on January 8, 1998. Progovernment Tamil mili-
 tias detain people at various locations that serve, in effect, as undeclared detention
 centers.
 Progovernment Tamil militants in the east and north, acting independently of
 government authority, were also responsible for disappearances. As in the case of
 extrajudicial killings, it was impossible to determine the exact number of victims be-
 cause of the secrecy with whic these cups operated. The Government has taken
 no clear public steps to condemn the militants' actions or to stop them.
 The LTTE was responsible for an undetermined number of civilian disappear-
 ances in the northeastern part of the island. Most of the 400 to 600 police officers
 captured by the LTTE in 1990 are believed to be dead, as are over 200 security force
 personnel captured at a battle in Pooneryn in 1993. Although the LTTE denies tak-
 ing any prisoners following the Mullaittivu battle in July 1996, it is currently sus-
 pectd of holding some. The LTTE has not notified the ICRC of any new security
 forces prisoners since 1994.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 In 1994 the Government acceded to the Convention Against Torture and Other
 Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Parliament also enacted
 legislation to implement the torture convention by making torture a punishable of-
 fense. The Government, however, has not yet developed effective regulations under
 the new legislation to prosecute and punish military and police personnel respon-
 sible for torture, though it has ceased paying fines incurred by security force person-
 nel guilty of the offense. Security forces personnel have been fined under civil law
 for engaging in torture, but not prosecuted under criminal law (see Section 1.c.).
 Members of the security forces continued to torture and mistreat detainees and
 other prisoners, both  male and    female, particularly  during interrogation.
 Progovernment Tamil militants in the east and north, directly responsible to the se-
 curity forces, also engaged in torture. Most torture victims were Tamils suspected
 of being LTTE insurgents or collaborators.
 
 
 1699
 Methods of torture included electric shock, beatings (especially on the soles of the
 feet), suspension by the wrists or feet in contorted positions, burnings, and near
 drownings. In other cases victims are forced to remain in unnatural positions for
 extended periods, or bags laced with insecticide, chili powder, or gasoline are placed
 over their heads. Detainees have reported broken bones and other serious injuries
 as a result of their mistreatment. There were no reports of rape in detention.
 Under fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution, torture victims may file
 civil suit for compensation in the Supreme Court. The Court granted awards rang-
 ing from $200 to $2,500. Most cases, however, take 2 years or more to move through
 the courts. Moreover, because the 1994 Anti-torture Law imposes a heavy minimum
 punishment of 7 years' imprisonment, the Court is scrutinizing fundamental rights
 cases more carefully than in the past, since findings would weigh heavily in criminal
 prosecutions of torturers. During the year, there were no cases brought before the
 courts under the Anti-torture Law.
 The LTTE reportedly used torture on a routine basis. Because of the secretive na-
 ture of the LTTE, however, no first-hand information has available.
 Prison conditions are generally poor and do not meet minimum international
 standards because of overcrowding and lack of sanitary facilities. An increase in the
 number of detentions associated with the war with the LTTE caused a significant
 deterioration in already poor standards in short-term detention centers.
 The Government permitted representatives from the ICRC to visit approximately
 250 places of detention. The HRC also visited prisons on an ad hoc basis and other
 places of detention regularly. Usually those in prison already have been convicted
 and questions related to the proper use of the ER and PTA for arrest are no longer
 relevant.
 Conditions are also believed to be poor in detention facilities operated by the
 LTTE.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under ordinary law, authorities must in-
 form an arrested person of the reason for arrest and bring that person before a mag-
 istrate within 24 hours. In practice, persons detained under ordinary law generally
 appear before a magistrate within a few days of arrest. The magistrate may author-
 ize bail or order continued pretrial detention for up to 3 months or longer. Under
 the ER and the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), security forces may detain sus-
 pects for extended period of time without court approval. The ER, still in force in
 many areas in the nation, allow pretrial detention for a maximum of four consecu-
 tive 3-month periods. A magistrate must order further detention. Detainees may
 challenge their detention and sue the Government for violating their civil rights in
 the supreme court.
 In June the Government used the ER to arrest Sirisena Cooray, former housing
 minister under the UNP Government, who had formerly been a prominent figure
 in the opposition party. In August the Supreme Court ruled the fundamental rights
 of Cooray had been violated and ordered the Government to release him from cus-
 tody and pay $3,600 in compensation.
 In spite of government announcements that it would close all secret detention cen-
 ters, there were continued reports that the security forces held people in such a
 manner, especially on the Jaffna Peninsula. Tamil militant groups, ostensibly under
 the direct control of the security forces, were known to be operating illegal-and
 unmonitored-detention centers in the east and in Vavuniya.
 Detention of Tamils continued as a result of the continuing hostilities with the
 LTTE. At year's end, the Government held more than 1,500 detainees under the ER,
 compared with 1,500 at the end of 1996, 940 at the end of 1995, and 380 at the
 end of 1994. Many of these detainees were arrested during operations against the
 LTTE. Between January and July, 300 suspected members of the LTTE were de-
 tained on the Jaffna Peninsula. The Government continued to detain up to 300 indi-
 viduals under the PTA, which permits detention without charge or u      to 18
 months. In some cases, Tamils have been detained without charge under the PTA
 for up to 4 years.
 Arrests and detentions by the police took place in violation of the legal safeguards
 built into the ER and other legislation, particularly regarding requirements that re-,
 ceipts be issued and that the HRC (previously the HRTF) be notified of any arrest
 within 48 hours. Those arrested by the army were generally turned over to the po-
 lice within 24 hours as required under the ER. The HRC has a legal mandate to
 visit those arrested and this mandate was generally respected by police officials.
 Due to censorship and infrequent access to the area, it was unclear what was hap-
 pening to detainees on the Jaffna Peninsula. The ICRC visits declared detention
 centers, but there are undeclared detention centers in the north that are not visited
 on a regular basis but are visited as needed when information received indicates
 that persons are being held there. Reportedly there are not a large number of indi-
 
 
 1700
 viduals that are held in undeclared detention camps, probably fewer than 100. More
 than 95 percent of the detainees are held in the main detention center, where condi-
 tions reportedly are quite good. On the other hand, conditions in the undeclared cen-
 ters range from adequate to extremely poor.
 Security forces continued to conduct mass arrests of young Tamils, both male and
 female. Major sweeps and arrests occurred in Colombo, the east, and on the Jaffna
 Peninsula. Although exact numbers of arrests were impossible to determine, they
 reached into the thousands. Hundreds of Tamils at a time were picked up during
 police actions. Most were released after identity checks lasting several hours to sev-
 eral days. The Government justified the arrests on security grounds, but many
 Tamils claimed that the arrests were a form of harassment. In addition, those ar-
 rested, most of whom were innocent of any wrongdoing, were detained in prisons
 together with hardened criminals.
 After a LTTE truck bomb exploded in Colombo in October (see Section 1.g.), the
 police and the military detained hundreds of Tamils in a broad sweep through the
 city. All but 50 persons were quickly released.
 The HRTF and later the HRC continued to investigate the legality of detention
 in cases referred to it by the Supreme Court and private citizens. Although the HRC
 is legally constituted to exercise oversight over arrests and detentions by the secu-
 rity forces and to undertake visits to prisons, members of the security forces some-
 times breached the regulations and failed to cooperate with the HRC.
 There were unconfirmed reports during the summer that the LTTE was holding
 in custody more than 2,000 civilians in the northern part of the island, including
 7 crew members of the Indonesian-flagged passenger ferry hijacked and burned that
 same month. The LTTE did not permit the ICRC or any other humanitarian organi-
 zation to visit its detainees aside from the 22 security force personnel and 5 crew
 members of another civilian ferry hijacked in 1995. Three other crew members of
 the latter ferry and 17 Sinhalese fishermen previously held by the LTTE were re-
 leased.
 The Government does not practice exile. There are no legal provisions allowing
 or prohibiting its use.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects these provisions in practice.
 The President appoints judges to the Supreme Court, the courts of appeal, and
 the high courts. A judicial service commission, comprised of the Chief Justice and
 two Supreme Court judges appoints, transfers and dismisses lower court judges.
 Judges serve until mandatory retirement age, which is 65 for the Supreme Court
 and 62 for judges on other courts. Judges can be removed for reasons of misbehavior
 or physical or mental incapacity, but only after a legal investigation followed by
 joint action of the President and the Parliament.
 In criminal cases, defendants are tried in public by juries. They are informed of
 the charges and evidence against them, ma  e represented by the counsel of their
 choice, and have the right to appeal. The Government provides counsel for indigent
 persons tried on criminal charges in the high courts and the Court of Appeal but
 not in other cases; private legal aid organizations assist some defendants. There are
 no jury trials in cases brought under the PTA. Confessions, which are inadmissible
 in criminal proceedings, are allowed in PTA cases. Most convictions under the PTA
 rely heavily on them. Defendants bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that their
 confessions were obtained by coercion. Defendants in PTA cases have the right to
 appeal. There are approximately 1,100 people now remanded under the PTA.
 Through October, there were 844 cases filed under the PTA and ER this year. In
 332 of these cases, indictments have been filed, but no cases came to trial during
 the year.
 The LTTE has its own court system, composed of young judges with little or no
 legal training. The courts reportedly impose severe punishments. The courts operate
 without codified or defined legal authority and essentially operate as agents of the
 LTTE rather than as an independent judiciary.
 The Government claims that all persons held under the ER and the PTA are sus-
 pected members of the LTTE and, therefore, legitimate security threats. There is
 insufficient information to determine whether these detainees or members of the
 now legal Sinhalese JVP similarly detained in past years, were political prisoners.
 Between 200 and 300 of those previously detained-mostly JVP members-have
 been convicted under criminal law and remain incarcerated. In many cases, human
 rights monitors question the legitimacy of the criminal charges brought against
 these people.
 The LTTE also holds a number of political prisoners. The number is impossible
 to determine because of the secretive nature of the organization. The LTTE refuses
 to allow the ICRC access to these prisoners.
 
 
 1701
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government generally respects the constitutional protections of individual privacy
 and the sanctity of the family and home. The police obtain proper warrants for ar-
 rests and searches conducted under ordinary law. The security forces, however, are
 not required to obtain warrants for searches conducted under either the ER or the
 PTA. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for providing oversight for such
 searches. In at least one case, observers believe that the search of a prominent oppo-
 sition politician's residence under the ER was in part politically motivated. There
 is no judicial review or other means of redress for alleged illegal searches under the
 ER.
 The Government is believed to monitor telephone conversations and correspond-
 ence on a selective basis. The security forces routinely open mail destined for the
 LTTE-controlled areas and seize contraband.
 Progovernment Tamil militant groups, nominally operating under government
 control, use forced conscription. There are credible reports that Tamil youth in the
 east in particular have been. forced to join these groups under threats to themselves
 and their families.
 The LTTE routinely invades the privacy of citizens. It maintains an effective net-
 work of informants. In 1990 the LTTE evicted thousands of Muslim residents from
 their homes in the north. These Muslims currently live in refugee camps, although
 a few have begun returning to their homes in Jaffna. There are credible reports the
 LTTE has warned Muslims displaced from the Mannar area (approximately 50,000
 persons) not to return to their homes until the war is over.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-Hostilities between the Government and the LTTE continued throughout the
 year. The security forces generally exercised greater restraint in the use of excessive
 force than they had previously. From October 1995 through April 1996, the Govern-
 ment conducted coordinated military attacks on LTI'E-held territory in the Jaffna
 Peninsula, resulting in the capture of Jaffna City in December 1995 and the remain-
 der of the peninsula by April 1996. In May government forces launched a major of-
 fensive north of Vavuniya in the Vanni region aimed at opening a land supply route
 to the Jaffna Peninsula. Casualties in the offensive have been heavy. Over 400,000
 people remain displaced by the past 2 years of fighting.
 The fact that the Government was planning an offensive to open a land route to
 Jaffna was widely publicized well before it began, allowing civilians time to vacate
 the probable area of military operations. Civilian casualties were also reduced due
 to the relatively slow and methodical manner in which government security forces
 pushed forward, enabling the relatively few civilians remaining in the area to flee
 well in advance of troop movements. Civilians living or moving near the military's
 established forward defense lines, however, have been killed by security forces. Ac-
 cording to credible reports, such killings have been a particular problem near
 Kilinochchi in the north.
 The Government organized convoys of food to the roughly 500,000 civilians living
 in LTTE-controlled areas in the Vanni. During the year, it shipped 33,340 metric
 tons of food, and furnished an additional 17,997 metric tons through Multi-Purpose
 Cooperative Societies. These supplies, supplemented by locally produced food, were
 adequate to satisfy the short-term minimum food needs of most civilians. Neverthe-
 less, the food situation in the Vanni was serious. Experts noticed an increase in ane-
 mia and a lower birth rate, both indications of lower levels of nutrition. Nutrition
 levels were below the national average, and there were confirmed cases of malnutri-
 tion, including hundreds of cases of malnourished children. Malnutrition resulted
 from several factors, including food shortages, poverty, and war-related dislocations.
 In addition, the LTTE appropriated government-supplied food for use by non-civil-
 ians. In September, using estimates that 400,000 people in the Vanni were in need
 of food assistance, the Government agreed with NGO s and international organiza-
 tions that monthly deliveries of 6,000 metric tons were needed to provide a nutri-
 tional minimum of 15 kilos per person. However, subsequent monthly shipments
 averaged only 3,400 metric tons.
 The Government maintained a long-list of prohibited "war-related" medical items,
 such as sutures, Plaster of Paris, IV's, bandages, and some drugs. NGO's and other
 groups desiring to take these items to LTTE-controlled areas in the Vanni needed
 permission from local officials as well as the Ministry of Defense. Delays were com-
 mon and approval was sometimes denied, lest supplies fall into the hands of the
 LTTE. As a result, many medical items in the Vanni were in short supply. This
 shortfall contributed to an already-serious deterioration in the quality and quantity
 of medical care furnished to the civilian population.
 The security forces also continued to receive instruction in international humani-
 tarian law as part of their training courses (see Section 4). Civilian casualties in
 
 
 1702
 the north and east battle zone have been relatively low, but rose through the year.
 The armed forces operate under written rules of engagement which severely restrict
 the shelling, bombardment, or other use of firepower against civilian-occupied areas
 such as villages. Although incidents occurred where the rules seemingly were
 breached or waived, these were isolated cases. Poor targeting by the armed forces
 resulted in civilian casualties from artillery fire and bombs. For example, in August,
 a bomb from a government attack aircraft missed its intended target (an LTTE
 camp) by approximately a kilometer and struck a church, killing eight civilians and
 wounding 14 others. In a separate incident, an attempt to bomb LITE cadre near
 Pooneryn resulted in several civilian deaths. The security forces use aerial observa-
 tion for selecting targets for shelling and bombing. They also attempt to locate the
 source of incoming mortar fire before responding. Government mortar and artillery
 fire is, however, very inaccurate and has killed civilians.
 The Government reported capturing seven L7TE cadre prisoner on the battlefield
 during the year. In addition, the Ministry of Defense reported that in 1997 more
 than 50 LTrE insurgents turned themselves in and in excess of 80 insurgents were
 apprehended by security forces. Given the scale of hostilities and the large number
 of LTTE casualties, observers found the number of prisoners taken under battlefield
 conditions to be extremely low; many L'TE fighters were apparently killed rather
 than taken prisoner. Observers believe that a "take-no-prisoners" policy was in ef-
 fect, but that it was impossible to estimate the number of killings. Various cir-
 cumstances may have worked to limit the number of LTIE fighters who were taken
 prisoner, including LTTE guerrilla tactics, its efforts to remove wounded fighters
 from the battlefield, and the proclivity of fighters to choose suicide over capture. No
 army or other security forces personnel were prosecuted or disciplined for executing
 prisoners.
 The Government refused to permit relief organizations to provide medical atten-
 tion to wounded LTTE fighters, although it has offered to treat any LITE wounded
 entrusted to government care.
 The LTTE admits that it kills security force personnel rather than take them pris-
 oner. It admits to holding only 22 security force prisoners, all of whom were cap-
 tured in 1993 and 1994. the LTTE is believed to have killed most of the police offi-
 cers and security force personnel that it has captured in recent years.
 The navy sank or badly damaged seven LTTE boats and killed scores of rebels
 in a 5-hour sea battle in October; at least 2 naval personnel were killed.
 The LTrE uses excessive force in the war. During the course of the year, the
 LTTE engaged in the killing of noncombatants, hostage-taking, hijackings, torture,
 and bombing of civilian targets. On March 22, a bomb thrown at a crowd of PA sup-
 porters in the north wounded 10 persons. On October 15, LTTE guerrillas set off
 a powerful truck bomb in Colombo, killing 18 people and wounding more than 110
 others. One of the LTTE terrorists fleeing the scene of the October 15 bombing ob-
 served a group of devotees praying at a Buddhist temple. The terrorist threw a gre-
 nade into the temple compound, killing a Buddhist monk.
 The LTTE has been accused in the past of using church and temple compounds,
 where civilians are instructed by the Government to congregate in the event of hos-
 tilities, as shields for the storage of munitions. In the July 1996 attack on the army
 base at Mullaitivu, the LTIE killed upwards of 1,500 government troops, reportedly
 killing even those troops who attempted to surrender. During the Government offen-
 sive on the Jaffna Peninsula in 1995-96, LTTE fighters forced some civilians to
 abandon their homes and retreat with them, allegedly as human shields, in the face
 of advancing government troops. Reports that the LTTE were using children on the
 battlefield were unverified.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and expression, restrictions are permitted on national security grounds.
 During the year, the Government strictly limited the access of domestic and foreign
 media to information and censored news relating to military and police matters.
 There was direct censorship of newspaper reports relating to ongoing military oper-
 ations from January until the end of May, with censrs deleting specifics regarding
 these operations. International television broadcasts received in the country were
 also censored during the same period, with references to Sri Lanka filtered out of
 the broadcasts. The new Media Minister indicated in June that all censorship would
 cease. During the year, the Government also limited access of journalist to areas
 of conflict and in at least one case is believed to have harassed a journalist who
 regularly reported on defense matters.
 
 
 1703
 The Government controls the country's largest newspaper chain,-two major tele-
 vision stations, and the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. There are, however,
 a variety of independent newspapers, journals, and radio and television stations.
 A number of government actions during the-year were of concern to the media.
 The Government has still failed to reform the Press Law and privatize government-
 owned media as promised during the 1994 election campaign. The Government pre-
 sented a draft Broadcasting Reform bill in Parliament in April, but opposition from
 members of the media was considerable, and in May the Supreme Court ruled that
 the bill was inconsistent with the Constitution. In one of two defamation of char-
 acter suits fied by President Kumaratunga in 1995 against leading editors, one edi-
 tor was found guilty, fined $180, and sentenced to 18 months in prison. The sen-
 tence was suspended, and the editor is appealing the verdict. The second defamation
 case and three new ones--all against editors of major pro-opposition newspapers-
 were pending at year's end. These cases were viewed by journalists as frivolous, in-
 tended only to harass and intimidate the media. Journalists were also concerned
 about continuing political attacks on the local press by leading politicians. Both for-
 eign and national journalists are allowed to go to Jaffna, but they must first receive
 permission from the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Defense. There are often
 bureaucratic delays in processing requests and some journalists complain that they
 are individually prevented from going north. According to the Government, the
 delays are a result of the limited number of seats on military aircraft flying journal-
 ists to Jaffna. The Government occasionally organizes groups of journalists to visit
 Jaffna and the front lines. There was also a local newspaper that published in
 Jaffna.
 Ishini Perara, news director of an independent television and radio company, had
 been charged under the PTA for broadcasting news that could have incited inter-
 communal violence. The charges were dismissed by court order in June. The court
 stated that the case against Perera had been filed with vengeful motives and was
 also critical of how the police handled the affair. In August there was evidence of
 close government monitoring of a journalist who reported on defense matters, al-
 though the Government denied the accusation.
 In a positive development, the Government in September rescinded the Par-
 liamentary Powers and Privileges Act. This law stipulated an unlimited fine or up
 to 2 years' imprisonment for anyone who criticized a Member of Parliament. Af-
 though the Government had not invoked the law since 1992, journalists and civil
 libertarians complained that it was an unjustified infringement on freedom of the
 press.
 The LTTE does not tolerate freedom of expression. It tightly restricts the print
 and broadcast media in areas under its control. In the past, the LTTE has killed
 those reporting and publishing on human rights.
 The Government generally respects academic freedom. During the year, the ER
 were not used, as they had been in the past, to control students.
 The LTTE also does not respect academic freedom and has repressed and killed
 intellectuals who criticize it, such as a university vice-chancellor who was kidnaped
 in November 1995 and released in January 1996. It has severely repressed members
 of a human rights organization, the University Teachers for Human Rights, which
 was formerly based on the Jaffna Peninsula; most former members of this group
 have been killed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for freedom
 of assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice. Although the PTA
 may restrict this freedom, the Government did not use the act for that purpose in
 1997. The Government generally granted permits for demonstrations.
 The law provides for freedom of association, and the Government respects this
 right in practice. Although the PTA may restrict this right, the Government did not
 use the act for that purpose in 1997.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official na-
 tional religion, but it also provides for the right of members of other faiths to prac-
 tice their religions freely. The Government respects this right in practice. Foreign
 clergy may work in Sri Lanka, but for more than 30 years the Government has pro-
 hibited the entry of new foreign Jesuit clergy. Thirty years ago, the Government
 reached an agreement with the Catholic Church that new foreign clergy would not
 be permitted to enter the country on a permanent basis. As foreign clergy retired,
 they would be replaced by Sri Lankans. It permitted those already in the country
 to remain. However, the Jesuits want their clergy to be replaced by foreign members
 of their order as they retire. The local Catholic Church hierarchy does not support
 the Jesuits in the dispute and is not lobbying the Government to change the agree-
 ment.
 
 
 1704
 Evangelical Christians, who constitute less than 1 percent of the population, have
 expressed concern that their efforts at proselytization are often met with hostility
 and harassment by the local Buddhist clergy and others opposed to their work (see
 Section 5). They sometimes complain that the Government tacitly condones such
 harassment. However, there is no evidence to support this. The Assemblies of God
 filed a fundamental rights case with the Supreme Court, after the local village coun-
 cil in Gampaha had tried to block the construction of a church on the grounds that
 it would interfere with Buddhism. The Supreme Court ruled that the construction
 of the church could proceed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution grants every citizen "freedom of movement and of
 choosing his residence" and "freedom to return to Sri Lanka." The Government gen-
 erally respects the right to domestic and foreign travel. Nonetheless, the war with
 the LTTE prompted the Government to impose more stringent checks on travelers
 from the north and the east and on movement in Colombo, particularly after dark.
 These security measures had the effect of restricting the movement of Tamils, espe-
 cially young males.
 Prior to the Government military offensive on the Jaffna Peninsula in 1995 and
 1996, an estimated 600,000 citizens had been displaced by the insurgency. Most
 lived in camps financed by the Government and nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's). The Jaffna offensive, in addition to the military advance on Kilinochchi in
 the Vanni region in July 1996, resulted in the displacement of 480,000 people in
 LTTE-controlled areas of the Vanni; some of these people were being displaced for
 a second or third time. Some of the displaced lived with friends or relatives, or in
 "welfare centers" in schools, religious institutions, and other public buildings. Many
 others lived in makeshift shelters or camped out under trees. The Government con-
 tinued to supply them with food, medicine, and other essential supplies. A military
 offensive in the Vanni that began in May created over 70,000 newly displaced peo-
 ple. The return of tens of thousands of displaced persons to their homes on the
 Jaffna Peninsula has helped to relieve the situation.
 Prior to 1996, the LTTE severely restricted the movement of Tamils under its con-
 trol, often levying a large "exit tax" on persons wishing to travel to areas under gov-
 ernment control and requiring travelers to leave all their property in escrow. In ad-
 dition, it would usually grant permission to only one family member to travel at a
 time. Following the Government capture of Jaffna, however, the LTTE began to
 allow people to move more freely into government-controlled areas, although it did
 disrupt the movement of IDP's from Trincomalee and Mannar to Jaffna by hijacking
 or attacking civilian shipping in the north.
 From October 1996 until the end of 1997, over 90,000 people are estimated to
 have moved out of L'TE-controlled regions through Vavuniya and other transit
 points. Of these, over 60,000 persons were repatriated to Jaffna and other Tamil-
 majority areas. Many had left the Vanni with the intention of proceeding south;
 they opted for other destinations only after learning they would have to remain in
 transit camps until security clearances for southward travel were obtained. Obtain-
 ing a clearance was often a lengthy process and some human rights groups alleged
 that the procedures were arbitrary and unreasonably strict. Clearance procedures
 were applied to everyone, including the elderly and very young. While the Govern-
 ment had a legitimate interest in identifying LTTE infiltrators, it also seemed reluc-
 tant to allow displaced Tamils to travel to Colombo where they would contribute to
 unemployment and other social problems. About 9,000 of these displaced people con-
 tinue to live in substandard conditions in camps in Vavuniya. Many of these people
 hope to return to their homes in the areas of conflict once the fighting stops.
 Several thousand Tamils fled LTTE-controlled areas to Tamil Nadu in southern
 India in 1997. An estimated 64,000 Taril refugees were already estimated to live
 in camps there. Another 100,000 refugees are believed to have been integrated into
 Tamil society in southern India. On February 20, a boat carrying ethnic Tamils flee-
 ing the fighting reportedly overturned. Authorities believe that approximately 165
 persons were killed.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The issue of
 the provision of first asylum did not arise in 1997. The Government does not permit
 the entry of refugees into the country, nor does it aid those who manage to enter
 to seek permanent residence elsewhere. There were, however, no instances of forc-
 ible repatriation.
 
 
 1705
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government through peri-
 odic multiparty elections based on universal adult suffrage. This right was exercised
 during parliamentary elections in August 1994, when the People's Alliance Party
 (PA) ended the 17-year rule of the United National Party, and during the Presi-
 dential election in November 1994, when PA presidential candidate Chandrika
 Kumaratunga won 62 percent of the vote. In March local elections for municipal,
 urban, and village councils were held in those areas of the country under govern-
 ment control. The local elections were marked by significant violence and some
 charges of electoral fraud. Most of the violence was simple hooliganism and thug-
 gery. There was a considerable number of beatings and threats, as well as acts of
 thievery, arson, and vandalism. The violence did not seem to be organized, except
 at the very local level by some groups of party activists. Neither political party took
 action to discipline party activists who engaged in violence. Nevertheless, election
 monitors generally believed that the outcome of the election-in which the PA won
 most council seats--was not affected.
 Although the Government planned to hold elections for local government bodies
 on the Jaffna Peninsula during the year, the elections were postponed until January
 1998 because of the prevailing security situation.
 The Commissioner.of Elections recognizes 34 parties; 9 hold seats in the 225-
 member Parliament. The two most influential parties, the PA and the UNP, gen-
 erally draw their support from the. majority Sinhalese community. Historically,
 these two parties have alternated in power. There are 27 Tamil and 20 Muslim
 M.P.'s.
 Although there are no legal impediments to the participation of women in politics
 or government, the social mores in some communities limit women's activities out-
 side the home. Nonetheless, in August 1994, voters elected a parliament that chose
 a female Prime Minister for the third time in Sri Lanka's history. In November
 1994, a woman was elected President for the first time. Eleven women hold seats
 in the Parliament. In addition to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Women's
 Affairs, four deputy ministers are women.
 The LTTE refuses to allow elections in areas under its control.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In July 1996, Parliament passed the Human Rights Commission Act which cre-
 ated a permanent human rights commission, the HRC. The five-member body is em-
 powered to monitor government human rights practices, to ensure compliance with
 constitutional fundamental rights provisions, and to investigate complaints of
 human rights abuse. The HRC has assumed the Human Rights Task Force's
 (HRTF) responsibility for investigating human rights complaints. Between June 2
 and the end of November, the RC had received 1,235 complaints, averaging more
 than 200 complaints a month. It had also conducted more than 600 visits to police
 stations and 120 visits to detention camps. In addition, when the Sri Lanka Founda-
 tion's Center for Elimination of Discrimination (CED) ceased operation in the sum-
 mer, the HRC accepted 1,900 cases previously on the CED's books for investigation.
 Some of these cases were duplicates of the 1,235 received directly by the HRC, but
 it is estimated the HRC now has well over 2,000 cases pending Recently, as pro-
 vided by law, the Supreme Court has started referring cases involving the violation
 of fundamental rights to the HRC for review. Thus far, the HRC has finished pre-
 liminary investigative work on 50 to 75 cases. The slow progress is attributable to
 the demands placed on the HRC in setting itself up, continuing the HRTF work in
 visiting prisons and detention centers, and opening an office in Jaffna on January
 8, 1998.
 The legislation also provides safeguards for people detained under the PTA and
 ER and gives the HRC the power to monitor the welfare of detainees. The Human
 Rights Commission was constituted in March and began operations in mid-year.
 The Cabinet ratified the optional protocol to the international Covenant on Civil
 and Political Rights in September 1996. Administrative machinery to implement
 government compliance with the protocol had not been established by year's end.
 There are several local human rights groups, including the Movement for Inter-
 racial Justice and Equality (MIRJE), the University Teachers for Human Rights,
 the Civil Rights Movement (CRM), and the Law and Society Trust (LST), that mon-
 itor civil and political liberties. There are no adverse government regulations gov-
 erning the activities of local and foreign NGO's.
 The Government continued to allow the ICRC unrestricted access to detention fa-
 cilities. The ICRC provided international humanitarian law training materials and
 
 
 1706
 training to the security forces. The UNHCR, ICRC, and a variety of international
 NGO's assisted in the delivery of food, medical and other essential supplies to the
 northern war zone. Following the capture of the Jaffna Peninsula in April 1996, the
 army seriously restricted the movement of supplies by international organizations
 and NGO's to LTTE-controlled areas. Most of these restrictions were lifted by 1997,
 although the Government periodically limited the delivery of supplies around the
 time of military operations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights under the law for all citizens and the
 Government generally res cts these rights. The Supreme Court regularly upholds
 court rulings in cases in which individuals file suit over the abridgment of their fun-
 damental civil rights. The new Human Rights Commission is another mechanism
 the Government has established to ensure enforcement of constitutional provisions
 in addition to access to the courts.
 Women.-Sexual assault, rape, and spousal abuse (often associated with alcohol)
 represent serious and pervasive forms of societal violence against women. New
 amendments to the Penal Code introduced in 1995 specifically addressed sexual
 abuse and exploitation. Rape laws were modified to create a more equitable burden
 of proof and to make punishments more stringent. Marital rape is considered an of-
 fense in cases of spouses living under judicial separation, and laws govern sexual
 harassment in the workplace and sexual molestation. While the Penal Code may
 ease some of the problems faced by victims of sexual assault, many women's orgam-
 zations believe that greater sensitization of police and judicial officials is also re-
 quired.
 Laws against procuring and trafficking were strengthened in 1995, facilitating the
 prosecution of brothel owners. Police statistics indicated that there were 26,862
 crimes against women during the period from January to June, compared with
 31,241 crimes during the same period in 1996.
 The Constitution provides for equal employment opportunities in the public sec-
 tor, but women have no legal protection against discrimination in the private sector,
 where they are sometimes paid less than men for equal work, often experience dif-
 ficulty in rising to supervisory positions, and face sexual harassment. Women con-
 stitute approximately one-half of the formal work force.
 Women have equal rights under national civil and criminal law. However, issues
 related to family law, including divorce, child custody, and inheritance, are adju-
 dicated by the customary law ofeach ethnic or religious group. In 1995 the Govern-
 ment raised the minimum age of marriage for women from 12 to 18 years, except
 in the case of Muslims, who continue to follow their customary marriage practices.
 The application of different legal practices based on membership in a religious or
 ethnic group often results in discrimination against women.
 During massacres of civilians in the east in October 1995, the LL'=E raped a num-
 ber of the victims. This marked the first time in the ethnic conflict that the LTTE
 deliberately used rape as a weapon of terror. Such abuses were not reported in 1996
 or 1997.
 Children.-The Government is committed to protecting the welfare and rights of
 children but is constrained by a lack of resources.
 The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's rights and wel-
 fare through its widespread systems of public education and medical care. Education
 is compulsory to the age of 12 and free through university. Health care, including
 immunization programs, is also free.
 There is a significant problem of child prostitution in certain coastal resort areas.
 The Government estimates that there are more than 2,000 active child prostitutes
 in the country, but private groups that claim the number is much higher. Many of
 these prostitutes are boys who sell themselves to foreign tourists, and the Govern-
 ment has pushed for greater international cooperation to bring those guilty of
 pedophilia to justice. The Penal Code was amended to strengthen punishments for
 trafficking of persons. In 1995 the Ministry of Media, Tourism and Aviation created
 a task force specifically to study the problem of sex tourism and related offenses,
 but no new legislation has resulted.
 In the first half of 1997, the police recorded 1,633 cases of crimes against children,
 a decrease from 3,687 crimes in the first half of 1996. NGO's attribute the problem
 of exploitation of children to the lack of law enforcement rather than inadequate leg-
 islation. Many law enforcement resources are diverted to the war with the LTE.
 Close to 26,000 children are known to be full employed, compared with approxi-
 mately 20,600 in 1996. Additional thousands of childr en are believed to be working
 in domestic service. There have been reports of rural children working as domestic
 
 
 1707
 servants in urban households-often given into service by poverty stricken par-
 ents-and being abused by their employers. Some of these children nave reportedl
 been starved, beaten, sexually abused, and forced into prostitution (see Section 6.c.)
 The Government -states that it does not have sufficient resources to protect these
 children from such exploitation (see Section 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings or
 government services for people with disabilities. The World Health Organization es-
 timates that 7 percent of the population is disabled. Most disabled people who are
 unable to work are cared for by their families. The Department of Social Services
 runs 8 vocational training schools for the physically and mentally disabled and
 sponsors a program of job training and job placement for graduates. Some private
 companies, at the uring of the Government, have provided training and jobs to dis-
 abled veterans. The Government also provides some financial support to NGO's as-
 sisting the disabled, subsidizes prosthetic devices and other medical aids for the dis-
 abled, makes some purchases from disabled suppliers and has registered 74 schools
 and training institutions for the disabled run by NGO's. In December 1996, Par-
 liament passed legislation forbidding discrimination against any person on the
 grounds of disability.
 Indigenous People.-The indigenous people of Sri Lanka, known as Veddas, num-
 ber less than a thousand. They prefer to maintain their isolated traditional way of
 life and are protected by the Constitution. There are no legal restrictions on their
 participation in the political or economic life of the nation. However, some Veddas
 complain that they are being forced off their traditional land and not allowed to live
 according to their own culture -and traditions. For the first time in 1996, the Govern-
 ment allowed Veddas to participate in the U.N. Working Group on Indigenous Peo-
 ple in Geneva, where they were able to state their grievances.
 Religious- Minorities.-Discrimination based on religious differences is much less
 common than discrimination based on ethnic group or caste. In general, the mem-
 bers of the-various faiths tend to be tolerant of each other's religious beliefs. How-
 ever, evangelical Christians have, on occasion, been harassed by Buddhist monks for
 their attempts to convert Buddhists to Christianity (see Section 2.c).
 In the northern part of the island, LTTE insurgents expelled some 46,000 Muslim
 inhabitants from their homes in 1990-virtually the entire Muslim population. In
 the past the LTTE has expropriated Muslim homes, lands, and businesses and
 threatened Muslim families with death if they attempt to return.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are approximately 1 million Tamils of
 comparatively recent Indian origin living in Sri Lanka. About 85,000 of these people
 do not qualify for either Indian or Sri Lankan citizenship and face discrimination,
 especially in the allocation of government funds for education. Without national
 identity cards, they are very vuinerable to arrest by the security forces. However,-
 the Government has stated that none of these people will be forced to depart the
 country.
 Tamils maintain that they have long been the victims of systematic discrimina-
 tion in university education, government employment, and in other matters con-
 trolled by the Government. However, in recent years,, there has been little clear evi-
 dence of overt discrimination in -university enrollment or government employment,
 although some-groups continue to assert that it exists. In January 1996, the Gov-
 ernment established a parliamentary select committee to consider a "devolution"
 package designed to devolve wide-ranging powers to local governments, thereby pro-
 viding ethnic minorities greater autonomy in governing their local affairs. The devo-
 lution proposals were placed before Parliament in September and were still being
 debated at year's end.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Government respects the constitutional right of
 workers to establish labor unions. Any seven workers may form a union, adopt a
 charter, elect leaders, and publicize their views. About 75 percent of the plantation
 work force which is overwhelmingly Tamil is unionized. Approximately 34 to 40 per-
 cent of the nonagricultural work force in the private sector is also unionized. Most
 workers in large private firms are represented by unions, but those in small-scale
 agriculture and small businesses usually do not belong to unions. Public sector em-
 ployees are unionized at very high rates.
 Most large unions are affiliated with political parties and play a prominent role
 in the political process. More than 30 labor unions have political affiliations, but
 there are also a small number of unaffiliated unions, some of which have active
 leaders and a relatively large membership. In 1996, the most recent year for which
 data are available, the Department of Labor registered 101 new unions and canceled
 the registration of 34 others, bringing the total number of functioning trade unions
 
 
 1708
 to 1,512. The Department of Labor is authorized by law to cancel the registration
 of sny union that does not submit an annual report. This requirement is the only
 legal grounds for cancellation of registration.
 lworkers, other than civil servants and workers in "essential" services, have
 the right to strike. By law, workers may also lodge complaints with the Commis-
 sioner of Labor, a labor tribunal, or the Supreme Court to protect their rights. Be-
 fore September 1994, the Government controlled strikes by declaring some indus-
 tries to be essential under the ER. Subsequently, this practice largely ceased. How-
 ever, the President retains the power to designate any industry as an essential serv-
 ice. he International Labor Organization (ILO) has pointed out to the Government
 that essential services should be limited to services where an interruption would en-
 danger the life, personal safety or health of the population.
 Civil servants may collectively submit labor grievances to the Public Service Com-
 mission but have no legal grounds to strike. Nonetheless, government workers in
 the transportation, medical, educational, power generation, financial, and port sec-
 tors have staged brief strikes and other work actions in recent years. There were
 82 strikes from January to June.
 The law prohibits retribution against strikers in nonessential sectors. Employers
 may dismiss workers only for insubordination. Incompetence or low productivity are
 not grounds for dismissal.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international bodies and many of them have done
 so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to collective bargaining, and it is widely practiced. Large firms may have employees
 in as many as 60 diferent unions. In enterprises without unions, including those
 in the Export Processing Zones (EPZ's), work councils-composed of employees, em-
 ployers, and often a public sector representative-are generally the forums for labor/
 management negotiation. The councils, however, are not mandatory outside the
 EPZ's and do not have the power to negotiate binding contracts.
 The law currently does not require management to recognize or bargain with
 unions, and, in some cases, employers have declined to recognize the unions in their
 factories. However, the law prohibits antiunion discrimination. Employers found
 guilty of such discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activi-
 ties but have the right to transfer them to different locations.
 There are 96,400 workers employed in the EPZ's. Under the law, workers in the
 EPZ's have the same rights to join unions as other workers. However, no unions
 have been formed, largely because of severe restrictions on access by union organiz-
 ers to the zones. Some labor representatives allege that the Government's Board of
 Investment (BOI), which manages the EPZ's, has discouraged union activity. Work
 councils in the EPZ's are chaired by the BOI and consist of equal delegations from
 labor and management, but councils only have the power to make recommendations.
 While employers in the EPZ's offer hither wages and better working conditions gen-
 erally than employers elsewhere, workers face other concerns, such as security, ex-
 pensive but low quality boarding houses, and sexual harassment.
 In most instances, wage boards establish minimum wages and conditions of em-
 ployment, except in the EPZ's, where wages and work conditions are set by the BOI.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by provisions of the Abolition of Slavery Act of 1844. The act does not spe-
 cifically prohibit forced or bonded labor by children, but government officials inter-
 pret it as applying to persons of all ages. Forced or bonded labor by children is al-
 most nonexistent. However, according to some reports, a few rural children are em-
 ployed in debt bondage as domestic servants in urban households (see Section 5).
 There are credible reports that some members of the police Special Task Force
 (STF) operating in the Batticaloa area force local villagers to work without com-
 pensation in clearing jungle and in other manual labor in and near STF camps. In
 some cases, the villagers are directly or indirectly threatened with physical abuse
 if they do not perform the work.
 The LTTE continues to conscript high-school age children for work as cooks, mes-
 sengers, and clerks. In some cases, the children reportedly help build fortifications.
 Children as young as 10 are said to be recruited and placed for 2 to 4 years in spe-
 cial schools that provide them with a mixture of LTTlE ideology and formal edu-
 cation.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment is 15. The law also permits the employment of younger
 children by their parents or guardians in limited agricultural work. In addition it
 permits employment in any school or institution for training purposes. Gaps in ex-
 isting legislation regarding child labor make it difficult to establish with certainty
 what types of employment are restricted for children, which age groups are affected
 
 
 1709
 and what the minimum age for child labor is for particular jobs. The law does not
 specifically prohibit forced or bonded labor by children; a few rural children report-
 edly serve in debt bondage (see Section 6.c.).
 Persons under age 16 may not be employed in any public enterprise in which life
 or limb is endangered. Children are not employed in the EPZ's, the plantations, the
 garment industry, or any other export industry. About 85 percent of children below
 the age of 16 attend school. The law permits the employment of such persons for
 not more than 1 hour on any day before school. A 1995 labor survey of the planta-
 tions, however, indicated that half of all children in plantations drop out of school
 after the fourth grade, leaving a large pool of children between the ages of 10 and
 15 available to pursue employment.
 Despite legislation some child labor still exists. A 1996 Census and Statistics De-
 partment survey found 19,123 children between the ages of 10 and 14 were fully
 employed. This included 15,495 males and 3,628 females. Additional thousands of
 children (estimates range from 50,000 to 100,000) are believed to be employed in
 domestic service, although this situation is not regulated or documented. A signifi-
 cant portion of employed children work outside their families. In addition to domes-
 tic service, regular emplo ent of children occurs mainly in the informal sector and
 in family enterprises suchas family farms, crafts, small trade establishments, eat-
 ing houses, and repair shops. Children are also involved in the manufacture of coco-
 nut fiber products, bricks, fishing, wrapping tobacco, street trading, and farming.
 Government inspections have been unable to eliminate these forms of child labor
 (see Section 5). There are an estimated 250 to 300 prosecutions each year in cases
 related to the employment of minors. Under legislation dating from 1956, the maxi-
 mum penalty for employing minors is about $18, with a maximum jail term of 6
 months.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Department of Labor effectively enforces
 the minimum wage law. While there is no universal national minimum wage, about
 40 wage boards set minimum wages and working conditions by sector and industry.
 According to the Statistics Department of the Labor Ministry, current minimum
 wage rates average $34 (2,000 rupees) per month in industry, commerce, and the
 service sector; and $1.27 (75 rupees) per day in agriculture. The minimum wage in
 the garment industry is $34 (-2,000 rupees) per month. These minimum wages are
 insufficient to support a worker and the standard family of five, but the vast major-
 ity of families have more than one breadwinner.
 Most permanent full-time workers are covered by laws that prohibit them from
 working regularly more than 45 hours per week (a 5Y2-day workweek). Such work-
 ers also receive 14 days of annual leave, 14 to 21 days of medical leave, and some
 20 local holidays each year. Maternity leave is available for permanent and casual
 female workers. Employers must contribute 12 percent of a worker's wage to an em-
 pee's rovident fund and 3 percent to an employee's trust fund. Employers who
 failte comply may be fined, although the effectiveness of government enforcement
 of this provision is unknown.
 Several laws protect the safety and health of industrial workers. The Department
 of Labor's small staff of inspectors, however, is inadequate to enforce compliance
 with the laws..Workers have the statutory right to remove themselves from situa-
 tions that endanger their health, but many workers are unaware of, or indifferent
 to, health risks, and fear that they will lose their jobs if they remove themselves.
