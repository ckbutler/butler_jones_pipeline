 GUINEA
 The People's Revolutionary Republic of Guinea is a one-party
 socialist state. Ahmed Sekou Toure has been the nation's
 president since Guinea broke away from the French community
 and declared its independence in 1958. The party-state,
 under the direction of President Toure, remains the supreme
 authority. The government has always been concerned about
 its security. This concern led in earlier years to the
 arrest and imprisonment of many suspects, some of whom were
 condemned and, on occasion, executed.
 A general amnesty of all Guinean exiles was declared in July
 1977, and thousands of emigrants have returned to Guinea.
 The government's concerns for its security were lessened in
 March 1978 with normalization of Guinea's relations with
 neighboring Senegal and Ivory Coast. The more relaxed
 climate is reflected in many aspects of Guinean political,
 economic, and social life. Internal security controls have
 been relaxed, and international movement of goods and people
 has been eased. More recent security threats, such as an
 attempted assassination of President Toure on May 14, 1980,
 and reports of attempted sabotage at Conakry Airport in
 February 1981, have not prompted the government to impose
 extreme police measures. In December 1981, representatives
 of Amnesty International's London office visited Conakry and
 met with government officials. The group's findings will
 reportedly be issued in mid-1982.
 The party-state emphasizes the rights of the people over
 rights of the individual; nonetheless, the government in
 January 1978 ratified the International Covenant of Economic,
 Social and Cultural Rights. The government regularly
 emphasizes the individual's duty to the revolution, to
 the party-state and to the people. The government maintains
 broad police powers and an extensive security apparatus.
 While exact information is not available, the number of
 political prisoners has been sharply reduced over the past
 several years. Hundreds have been released since 1977,
 including some 10-20, among whom were several former senior
 officials, freed in October 1980. There were reports of
 arrests and imprisonment, often for as long as six months,
 during the government investigation of the February 1981
 incident. Although some of those arrested during that
 investigation may still be held, most appear to have been
 released.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not prohibited by Guinean law. Although
 torture has occurred in the past, no specific cases have
 been reported during the past year.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions in Guinea are generally very poor. Police
 handling of suspects is frequently rough. Ill treatment and
 poor conditions in Guinean prisons are a recognized feature
 of the prison system, and in past years deaths in prison
 
 (106)

 were not uncommon. Reportedly, conditions are most difficult
 for those held in solitary confinement. Prisoners not held
 in solitary confinement can usually receive food from family
 or friends. The government of Guinea reportedly permitted
 Amnesty International access to some detainees in December
 1981. There have been no reports of executions in 1981 for
 political offenses. There are no reports that treatment of
 prisoners differs according to type of conviction, social
 class, race, sex or religion. Prisoners released during the
 past few years have spoken of efforts to improve their
 prison food and to improve their physical condition before
 they were released.
 c. Disappearances
 Arrests and detentions by security forces in Guinea are not
 publicized, but news of their occurrence seems to have no
 difficulty finding its way throughout the community. No
 reports of prolonged or permanent disappearance have been
 received in 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There is no legal prohibition against "preventive detention"
 and no provision for habeas corpus. Persons can be arrested
 and held without charge and without fixed terms. There have
 been reports of such actions by the state in the past year.
 Following the attempted assassination of President Toure in
 May 1980, and a reported sabotage attempt at Conakry Airport
 in February 1981, there were a number of arrests and deten-
 tions. However, those seem to have been handled as normal
 public security (rather than political) investigations.
 Since May 1977, several hundred prisoners have been released,
 including former senior government officials. In 1980 the
 government released more prisoners, including three former
 senior officials in November. Although there are no reports
 of releases in 1981, most observers conclude that the number
 of political prisoners has been substantially reduced over
 the past few years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although citizens have access to the courts-, most civil
 complaints are handled at the local administrative level.
 This procedure corresponds to African tradition and provides
 considerable scope for testimony by plaintiffs, defendants
 and witnesses. Guinean courts are controlled by the party-
 state. In civil and criminal cases, constitutional and
 statutory procedures exist, but do not seem to be consistently
 applied. Guinean law does not permit professional lawyers
 to practice privately. However, counsel is available from
 government rosters of private or official persons deemed
 qualified to serve as people's lawyers. Defendants have the
 right to legal counsel, which is provided when defendants so
 request -- which rarely seems to occur -- or when the
 government decides to appoint counsel from the roster of
 people's lawyers. Those charged with security or political
 offenses do not have benefit of counsel. They are required
 to make their own defense without being aware of the charges
 or evidence against them. No political trials are known,
 however, to have taken place in Guinea since 1976.

 f. Invasion of the Home
 Police may enter homes without warrants to pursue suspects
 or to obtain evidence. There are no reports of bugging or
 demolition of doors or windows of homes.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Guinean government does not tolerate dissent from its
 political and ideological tenets. Although Islam is officially
 supported, Christianity is fully accepted by the state.
 Assembly is subject to police controls. All the media are
 government-controlled, and no opposition views are aired.
 The media on occasion sharply criticizes state organizations
 and enterprises for abuses such as corruption. Few publica-
 tions are available and all are censored. In recent years
 visas have been issued more readily to foreign newsmen.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement, while traditionally a part of African
 custom, is not guaranteed by Guinean law. Families and tri-
 bal groups are frequently spread across the state frontiers,
 and substantial movement has been permitted and observed
 in recent years. Internal movement remains, as it has
 been for the past several years, substantially free.
 Documents are often required, but they are readily obtain-
 able and do not present unreasonable difficulties for
 Guinean travelers or foreigners within the country. Legal
 entry into, and exit from, the country remains subject to con-
 trol, but enforcement has become notably relaxed. Guineans,
 except for those who are suspected of being opposition-
 ists or who in the government's view might otherwise pose
 threats to the state, appear to be able to move without
 great difficulty across borders with neighboring countries.
 Many former Guinean exiles, mostly those who departed for
 economic reasons, have returned since the general amnesty of
 all "exiles" was announced in 1977. The official government
 attitude of encouragement to those intending repatriation
 does not apply to those considered to be traitors or enemies
 of the state. Women and other groups are not subjected to
 different rules in matters of internal travel, emigration,
 or repatriation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Guinean people are strongly encouraged by their leaders
 to participate in the political process by full involvement
 in the "continuing revolution" which the party-state conducts
 in their name under the direction of President Toure. There
 is little possibility for the individual to avoid taking
 part in the party-controlled political activity which
 guides most aspects of national life. No opposition
 organizations exist openly. President Toure is considered
 to be accessible, and is known to receive many petitioners
 and supplicants.   The government holds that the party-state
 structure, with its frequent meetings and popular referenda
 down to the level of the local communities, allows the
 people to fully express their will.
 
 
 111
 Labor unions are not an independent force in Guinean society.
 They are controlled by the government, and their potential
 political role is entirely absorbed by the party.
 The political role of women in Guinea. continues to match the
 significant influence and power which they enjoy in, economic
 life. Women traditionally have provided President Sekou
 Toure a large, articulate, and faithful political group
 in his power base, and on occasion have demonstrated the
 will and capability to influence policy.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government of Guinea continues to reject charges
 leveled by the International League for Human Rights and by
 Amnesty International regarding political prisoners and
 their treatment. According to the Guinean government,
 Amnesty International was provided some information on
 several detainees during the group's December 1981 visit to
 Conakry. The government maintains that there are no politi-
 cal prisoners, and that those who are imprisoned in such
 circumstances are traitors and enemies of the state and of
 the people.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The latest government budget allots its largest share to the
 agro-pastoral sector, where over 80 percent of Guineans live
 and work. In 1981, the government has moved vigorously to
 eliminate corruption from state enterprises. Private
 commerce, allowed since 1977, has continued to bring more
 goods into the parallel non-official marketplace -- although
 at relatively high prices. Periodically, the government
 renews its efforts to enforce official price levels. In
 1981, the government again emphasized the important role of
 private commerce in the Guinean economy, but-only within the
 official price structure. Compared to earlier years, a
 gradually expanding range of food and consumer goods is
 available. The preliminary signs of an improved standard of
 living noted last year remain in evidence.
 Guinea's estimated per capita GNP was $280 in 1979. This
 does not accurately reflect living conditions of most of
 Guinea's population, which is essentially outside the money
 economy and is largely self-sufficent in foodstuffs. In
 1980 salaries increased an average of 20-25 percent. The
 private market activity allowed since 1977 continues,
 bringing greater availability of food and consumer goods
 than was formerly the case. Occasional government efforts
 to enforce official prices, however, tend to provoke with-
 drawal of goods from the normally flourishing parallel
 market. The government, in late 1981, launched a campaign to
 eliminate corruption from state enterprises, stressing that
 official position should not be abused for personal gain.
 In 1981, party-state economic and revolutionary conferences
 again emphasized the important role of private commerce in
 the Guinean economy.
 
 
 112
 The government of Guinea has sought to improve the health
 and nutrition of its population. The largest share (26
 percent) of the latest 5-year plan budget is devoted to the
 agro-pastoral sector. An October 1981 national revolutionary
 council decision again stressed the overriding importance of
 expanding agro-pastoral production. Nonetheless, agricultural
 development and food production continue to lag. In 1977
 the calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirement was 84 percent. Present government
 policies and ideology have not led to increased agricultural
 output. In agriculture, the party-state has focused its
 limited resources more on state controlled production than
 on the small individual farmers, who still produce an over-
 whelming percentage of total output.
 Life expectancy at birth rose from 38.5 years in 1968 to 43.5
 in 1978. For females it was 45.1 years in 1978, up from
 40.1 in 1968. Infant mortality, however, rose from 141 per
 thousand in 1960 to 175 per thousand in 1972. It is believed
 that infant mortality is linked to poor nutrition and the
 high birth rate, reflected in a fertility rate of 6.2 children
 per woman during child-bearing years. The government of
 Guinea is beginning an attempt to persuade Guinean mothers
 to space births so as to facilitate recuperation and nursing.
 About 44 percent of the urban population has access to a
 safe water supply, but this drops to only 2.5 percent for
 the rural population. However, the government has launched
 a nationwide program of improving the rural population's
 access to safe water; concentrating initially on the Fouta
 Djalon region, the national water supply service is improving
 wells and springs. Its goal is to provide safe water within
 a reasonable distance from each village in the country.
 Education is free and open to all. The percentage of
 children of primary school age in school rose from about
 8 percent in 1958 to 34 .percent in 1978. The government of
 Guinea estimates that the ratio of females in school rose
 from 21 percent in 1958 to 31 percent in 1978. Although 1965
 statistics indicate only 4 percent of females were literate
 compared to 14 percent of males, it is government policy to
 provide equal opportunity to all. The adult literacy rate
 grew from 1 percent at independence to 9 percent in 1965,
 and to 10 percent in 1970. The actual literacy rate may now
 be higher, as a result of the emphasis given to education at
 all levels over the past decade. Guinean officials report
 that 15-25 percent of the population is literate in French,
 and about 48 percent in one or more of the Guinean national
 languages.
