 GRENADA
 Grenada has a parliamentary form of Government with a Governor General as
 titular Head of State. No political party received a clear majority in elections held
 on March 13, 1990, and the Governor General appointed Nichola Brathwaite as
 Prime Minister. He successfully formed a mority Government around National
 Democratic Congress (NDC) parliamentarians.    _
 National security in Grenada is the responsibility of the 600-member Royal Gre-
 nada Police Force (RGPF), which includes a 75-man paramilitary Special Services
 Unit (SSU) and a 30-man Coast Guard Unit. The RGPF and its elements are con-
 trolled by and responsive to civilian government authorities.
 Grenada has a small flee market economy based upon agriculture and tourism.
 Over the past several years, economic growth dropped to 3 percent, and the country
 experienced persistent fiscal imbalances. This forced the Government to initiate a
 structural., ajustment program in February 1992, aspects of which were unpopular.
 Grenadians enjoy a wide range of civil and political rights. Human rights prob-
 lems in- 1992 included incidents of domestic violence against women and allegations
 of police brutality in the course of criminal investigations.
 RESPBCr FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Ftiujudicial Kiling.-here were no reports of politically
 motivated or other extrejudicial killings.
 b. Disaperance-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there were no reported incidents
 of torture in 1992. Charges of police brutality against detainees were the subject of
 a meeting in January involving members of the Grenada Association of Lawyers and
 senior police officials. 'Me lawyers were assured that all reports of brutality would
 be thoroughly investigated and strong disciplinary measures taken when warranted.
 Sincet    time, a few policemen have been dismissed from the force following such
 investisations.
 A citizen prison visitation committee formed in 1990 to monitor conditions at Gre-
 nada's Richmond Hill Prison, especially in regard to the treatment accorded Bernard
 Coard and accomplices convicted of the 1983 murder of Prime Minister Maurice
 Bishop, continued periodic visits in 1992.
 Flogging is a legal form of punishment. Flogging is rare but has been used re-
 cently in sex crime and theft cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Ei/e.-According to law, police have the right
 to detain persons on suspicion without a warrant, but formal charges must be
 brought within 48 hours. This time limit is adhered to in practice. If the detainee
 is not charged within this time, he must be released. In 1992 no one was detained
 for political reasons.
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality of detention within
 15 days after arrest on a criminal charge. Formal arraignment or release of the ar-
 restee must be decided within 60 days. These procedures were generally followed.
 There is a functioning system of bail, although those charged with capital offenses
 are not eligible. Persons charged with treason may be accorded bail only upon rec-
 ommendation of the Governor General. Foreigners held for serious offenses, such as
 drug traf-cking are frequently denied bail for fear they would not return to face
 prosecution if released.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The right to a fair public trial is provided for by
 law and is observed in practice. Those arrested and charged with criminal charges
 are brought before an independent judiciary and are allowed access to a lawyer of
 their choice. In other criminal cases which reach the appellate stage, the court will
 similarly appoint a lawyer to represent the accused if he was not previously rep-
 resented, or reappoint the defendant's earlier counsel if the appellant can no longer
 afford the lawyer's services. Following a determination by a judicial hearing that
 there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a criminal charge the defendant is re-
 manded for trial. Due to the backlog of cases caused by a shortage of judges and

 facilities, a significant amount of time can pass before those charged are brought
 to triaL
 Grenada rejoined the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States' (OECS) judicial
 system in 1991. By doing so, the Grenada Supreme Court, which had been insti-
 tted by the Marxist People's Revolutionay Government (PRG) in 1979 as the high-
 est judicial authority with jurisdiction over Grenadians, ceased to exist for that
 function. The court is now the Supreme Court of Grenada and the West Indies Asso-
 dated States. Under the OECS system, appeals may be made to the Privy Council
 in London.
 There are no _political prisoners.
 f. Arbibary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of these types of arbitrary interference. Judicially issued warrants
 for searching homes are normally required by law except in cases of hot pursuit.
 In practice, warrants are obtained in the majority of cases before a search is con-
 ducted. The Firearms Act of 1968 and the Drug Abuse Prevention Act No. 7 of 1992
 give the police and security units legal authority to search persons and property
 without warrants in certain circumstances.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is provided for by
 the Constitution and is freely exercised. There are four weekly newspapers and sev-
 eral newspapers which publish irregularly. One is affiliated with a political party
 but the three most widely circulated newspapers are independent and are frequently
 critical of the Government. The newspapers frequently carry press releases by the
 opposition parties, one of which regularly provided a weekly column of its views.
 Grenadahas four radio stations. The main station is part of the Grenadian Broad-
 casting Corporation (GBC), a statutory body not under direct government control.
 It covers all of Grenada and parts of the Eastern Caribbean. A privately-owned sta-
 tion provides regional coverage to the four Windward Island states. Grenada's main
 television station is also part of GBC. A privately-owned television station began
 broadcasting in 1992, and a cable companypbegan operating in the capital area with
 plans to extend eventually throughout the country. In May GBC-Television stopped
 its unofficial policy of permitting political parties to purchase broadcasting time
 until a formal policy on paid political broadcasts was developed. Prior to that
 change, one opposition party frequently purchased such time. Throughout 1992,
 however, the television news often carried reports on opposition activities.
 In February the Speaker of the House, reacting to what he viewed as inaccurate
 reporting on a Parliamentary debate and unfair editorial comments about himself,
 revoked the press accreditation of one of Grenada's leading newspapers. The Press
 Association of Grenada and the Caribbean Publishing and Broadcasting Association
 strongly criticized this action for contravening press freedom. The Speaker
 reaceredited the paper in June.
 b. Free dom of Peaceful Assembly and Association--Grenadians enjoy the right to
 assemble for any pe.aceful purpose. Supiporters of political parties meet frequently
 and hold punlic rallies; permits are required for the use of a publc address system
 but not for public meetings themselves.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-All groups enjoy freedom of religion. The Roman Catholic
 and Anglican faiths predominate.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation-There is freedom of movement within Grenada, and all citizens have
 the right to enter and leave the country except in special circmstances as outlined
 in and limited by the 1986 Act to Restrict the Freedom of Movement of Certain Per-
 sons. This law allows the Minister for National Security to restrict travel out of Gre-
 nada by any person whose aims, tendencies, or objectives include the overthrow of
 the democratic and parliamentary system of government; it has not been invoked
 in the past few years. Anyone so restricted may appeal after 3 months to an inde-
 pendent and impartial tribunal, presided over by an accredited lawyer chosen by the
 Chief Justice.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Ctiiosttuton previdos for the right of citizens to change their government
 through free and fair elections to be held at least every 5 years. It provides that
 Parliament sit no longer than 5 years and that elections be called witi3 months
 of its dissolution. Grenadians held national elections in 1984 and 1990. The political
 system is not dominated by any particular ethnic group, nor are there any restric-
 tions that limit participation of any elements of the Grenadian population.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups operate without government restriction, and the Gov-
 ernment cooperates with visits from international human rights organizations...
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 There is no evidence of official discrimination in health care, employment, or edu-
 cation. Women frequently earn less than men performing the same work; such wage
 differences are less marked for the more highly paid jobs.
 Knowledgeable women's rights activists report that violence against women in
 Grenada is common and that most cases of spouse abuse go unreported to police
 authorities. A seminar organized by the legal aid and counseling clinic which dealt
 with rape, other sexual offenses, and crimes against female minors was held in Au-
 gust. It recommended to the Government that more laws were needed in these
 areas.
 The police confirm that most cases of alleged abuse are not reported and others
 are settled out of court. Grenadian law stipulates a sentence of 15 years' imprison-
 ment for a conviction of rape. Sentences for assault against a spouse vary according
 to the severity of the incident.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers are free to organize independent labor
 unions. Labor Ministry officials estimate the percentage of the work force that is
 unionized to be between 20 and 25 percent. Union leaders play a significant role
 in the political process, and one labor leader serves in the Senate.
 Workers in the public and private sectors may and de strike legally if they give
 advance notification. There were several strikes in 1992, often in statutory entities
 such as the telecommunications company, but all were short-lived and settled with
 the intervention of the Ministry of Labor. In 1992 all unions were free of govern-
 ment control, and none was given government financial support. All the major
 unions in Grenada belong to the one umbrella labor federation the Grenada Trades
 Union Council (GTUC), which holds annual conventions and determines some poli-
 cies for member unions. The GTUC and its unions freely affiliate with regional and
 international trade union groups.
 b. The Riqht to Organize and Bargain Colectively.-Workers are free to organize
 and to participate in collective bargaining. Legislation compels employers to recog-
 nize a union that represents the majority of workers in a particular business. The
 law prohibits antiunon discrimination by employers against union members and or-
 ganizers. If a complaint of discrimination arises, mechanisms exist for attempting
 to resolve it. After all avenues for resolving a complaint have been exhausted be-
 tween union representatives and employers, both sides may agree to ask for the as-
 sistance of the Labor Commissioner. If the Labor Commissioner is unable to find
 a resolution to the impasse, the Minister of Labor may appoint an arbitration tribu-
 nal if both parties agree to abide by its ruling. These procedures are routinely and
 effectively used.
 Unions may organize and bargain anywhere in the country, including in the one
 expert processing zone (EPZ), which is not exempted from Grenada's labor legisla-
 tion. However, no EPZ firm is presently unionized; the one firm previously union-
 ized has since shut down its Grenada-based operations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, and no such instances were reported in 1992.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment of children, 16 years, is enforced in the formal sector by periodic cecks
 made by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor. Enforcement efforts inthe informal
 sector are lax.oe
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legislated minimum daily wage rates, most re-
 cently revised in 1990, are set for the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sec-
 tors. most workers in Grenada receive other benefits from their employers through
 collective bargaining, but even when these benefits are added to wages from a full-
 time minimum wage job, it is barely enough to provide a decent standard of living.
 The law does not prescribe a set number of hours as the standard workweek, ex-
 cept for the public sector which is expected to work a 40-hour week Monday through
 Friday. However, the normal workweek in all sectors seldom exceeds 40 hours, al-
 though in the commercial sector this includes Saturday morning work.
 Health and safety standards set by the Government are minimal and not effec-
 tively enforced. Laws on working conditions and their enforcement apply equally to
 the export processing zone.
