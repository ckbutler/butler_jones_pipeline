 CUBA
 Cuba is a totalitarian state controlled by President Fidel Castro, who is Chief of
 State, Head of Government, First Secretary of the Communist Party, and Com-
 mander in Chief of the armed forces. President Castro exercises control over all as-
 pects of Cuban life through the Communist Party and its affiliated mass organiza-
 tions, the government bureaucracy, and the state security apparatus. The party is
 the only legal political entity, and President Castro personally chooses the meaer-
 ship of the select group which heads the party. The party controls all government
 positions, including judicial offices.
 The Ministry of nterior is the principal organ of state security and totalitarian
 control. The Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), directed by President Castro's
 brother Raul, exercise de facto control over this Ministry. In addition to regulating
 migration and controlling the Border Guard and the police forces, the Interior Min-
 istry investigates and actively suppresses organized opposition and dissent. It main-
 tains a pervasive system of vigilance through undercover agents, informers, the
 Rapid Reaction Brigades, and the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution
 (CDRs). While the Government traditionally used the CDR's to mobilize citizens
 against dissenters, impose ideological conformity, and root out "counter-revolution-
 ary" behavior, severe economic problems have reduced the willingness of citizens to
 participate in the CDR's and thereby lessened their effectiveness. Other mass orga-
 nizations also inject government and Communist Party control into every citizen's
 daily activities at home, work, and school. Members of the security forces committed
 human rights abuses.
 The Government continued to control all significant means of production and re-
 mained the predominant employer, despite some foreign investment and legalization
 of some types of self-employment. Although the Government claimed 2.3 percent
 economic growth during the first 9 months of 1995, the economy remained in a de-
 pression due to the inefficiencies of the centrally controlled economic system, the col-
 lapse of Cuba's trade relations with the former Soviet bloc, and the end of the $4
 to $5 billion in annual Soviet subsidies. Despite some indications of economic
 growth, gross domestic product is still only about two-thirds the 1989 level, and
 total foreign trade about one-fourth the 1989 level. The Government continued its
 austerity measures known euphemistically as the "special period in peacetime." Ag-
 ricultural markets, legalized in 1994, gave consumers wider access to meat and
 produce, although at prices beyond the routine reach of most Cubans living on peso-
 only incomes. The system of "tourist apartheid" continued, in which foreign visitors
 
 
 381
 received preference over citizens for food, consumer products, and government serv-
 ices, as well as access to hotels and resorts from which Cuban citizens were barred.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be poor with allegations of
 serious abuses. Although the Government made some positive gestures, including
 ratifying the United Nations International Convention Against Torture, permitting
 a delegation led by France-Liberte to interview a number of political prisoners, and
 releasing several prominent political prisoners, it continued to restrict sharply basic
 political and civil rights. These included. the right of citizens to change their govern-
 ment; the freedoms of speech, press, association, assembly, religion, and movement;
 as well as the right to privacy and various workers' rights. The judiciary is subordi-
 nate to the Government and to the Comnmnist Party.
 Authorities continued to harass, threaten, imprison, defame, and physically attack
 human rights advocates and members of independent professional associations, in-
 cluding journalists, economists, and lawyers, often with the goal of encouraging
 them to leave Cuba. In October a number of human rights groups and other non-
 overnmental organizations formed an umbrella association, known as the "Conciio
 ubano." The Government responded by detaining and harassing certain key mem-
 bers and obstructing meetings of the group. Human rights advocates were denied
 the right of due process and subjected to unfair trials. Political prisoners were regu-
 larly offered the choice of exile or continued imprisonment. Prison conditions re-
 mained harsh.
 Human rights advocates and religious leaders, such as Francisco Chaviano and
 Pentecostal pastr Orson Vila, were denied the right of due process and subjected
 to unfair trials. In March the United Nation's Human Rights Co ssion U C)
 once again passed a resolution endorsing the report of the UNHRC Special
 Rapporteur, which detailed Cuba's violations of human rights. The Government con-
 tinued to refuse the Special Rapporteur permission to visit Cuba.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.--One criminal suspect died as a re-
 sult of a beating received while in plice custody. On September 12, police in the
 city of Consolacion del Sur informed the family that Etanislao Gonzalz Quintana,
 detained since September 8 for the alleged illegal purchase of beef, had died of a
 heart attack. However, his body showed signs of having been beaten, including a
 deep gash on his forehead and multiple bruises. The family received no response to
 the formal complaint they filed with the police.
 The Government never conducted a full investigation into the Cuban  Coast
 Guard's sinking of the "13th of March" tugboat on July 13, 1994, which caused the
 death of 37 people.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 cTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits abusive treatment of detainees and prisoners, but mem-
 bers of the security forces and prison officials continued to beat and otherwise abuse
 human right advocates, detainees, and prisoners. For example, Marta Beatriz Roque
 Cabello, president of the Institute of Independent Economists of Cuba, received sev-
 eral anonymous, written death threats and on one occasion was visitod by an un-
 known man who brandished a gun and made a gesture as if slitting her tbroat.
 Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz, head of the Cuban Commission on Human Rights and
 National Reconciliation, was visited on several occasions by individuals claiming to
 be relatives of political prisoners who shouted abuse, threatened him, tried to punch
 him through the window, and finally hurled porch chairs against the window. Local
 police never followed up on his complaint. This harassment is consistent with the
 pattern of abuse practiced by state seourity agents.
 Prison conditions continued to be harsh. The Goverment claims that prisoners
 have guaranteed rights, such as family visitation, adequate nutrition, pay for work,
 the right to request parole, and the right to petition the prison director However
 police and prison officials often used beatings, neglect, isolation, denial of medica
 attention, and other abuses against detainees and prisoners, including those con-
 victed of political crimes or those who persisted in expressing their views. State se-
 curity officials often subjected dissidents to systematic psychological intimidation,
 including sleep deprivation, in an attempt to coerce them to sigt incriminating docu-
 ments or to collaborate. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)
 found that the erious prison conditions and other deliberately severe and degrad-
 ing treatment meted out to prisoners by the Cuban Government amount to serious
 violations of human rights."
 
 
 382
 Prison authorities used physical violence even against prisoners seeking medical
 attention. On May 10, Leonor Zamora Fernandez, imprisoned in the Manto Negro
 women's prison, was kicked, beaten, and thrown down the stairs by a prison official
 for demanding medical attention. She was then sent to a punishment cell and left
 for 8 days without medical treatment for either her new injuries, including a broken
 arm, or her original medical problem. In September three guards at the Combinado
 del Este prison beat prisoner Victor Villar Vidot for having shouted out for medical
 attention to deal with his migraine headache.
 A group of political prisoners in the Kilo 8 prison in the province of Camaguey
 reported that prison authorities routinely denied political prisoners the right to have
 their sentence reduced for good behavior, as well as access to food, clothing, medical
 and dental treatment, and educational, sporting, and cultural activities. They re-
 ported that prisoners received no salary for their work in the Abatur SA. company
 that provides laundry services for the hotels in Camaguey province. Kilo 8 prison
 authorities also denied political prisoners requests for visits by the local priest.
 Other prisons also routinely denied prisoners their "guaranteed" rights. Pastor
 Orson Vila, serving an 18-month sentence for disobedience and illegal meetings in
 the work farm "La 40" in the province of Camaguey (see Section 2.c.), was denied
 regularly authorized passes as well as a special award pass due him as "best work-
 er. For over a year, prison authorities at the Kilo 51/2 prison in Pinar del Rio denied
 a family visit to Jose Miranda Acosta, sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment for al-
 leged terrorist acts. Only when his ailing 85-year-old father appeared at the prison
 and refused to leave did prison authorities permit him to see his son. They told the
 father that they would not allow further visits because Miranda Acosta refused to
 wear the prison uniform and demanded that his rights as a political prisoner be re-
 spected.
 The IACHR described the nutritional and hygienic situation in the prisons, to-
 gether with the deficiencies in medical care, as "alarming." Both the IACHR and
 the U.N. Special Rapporteur, as well as other human rights monitoring organiza-
 tions, reported widespread incidence of tuberculosis, scabies, hepatitis, parasitic in-
 fections, and malnutrition in prisons. Moreover, the IACHR noted that prison au-
 thorities subjected prisoners who protested the conditions or treatment to reprisals
 such as beatings, transfer to punishment cells, transfer to prisons far from their
 families, suspension of family visits, or denial of medical treatment.
 Political prisoners Sebastian Arcos Bergnes, Agustin Figueredo Figueredo, and
 Luis Enrique Gonzalez Ogra, released in May at the urging of the French humani-
 tarian organization France-Liberte (see Section 4), suffered from advanced stages of
 cancer that, despite obvious symptoms had gone undiagnosed and untreated during
 their imprisonment. Omar del Pozo Marrero, sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment
 for revealing state secret3, was denied medical treatment despite the fact that his
 family brought all the necessary medicines and supplies to the military hospital for
 the required surgery.
 Prison authorities often placed Folitical prisoners in cells with common and some-
 times violent criminals and required that they comply with the rules for common
 criminals. Luis Gustavo Dominguez Gutierrez, sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment
 for enemy propaganda, conducted a hunger strike for several weeks to protest his
 confinement in a cell with common criminals who had been harassing and threaten-
 ing him. Political prisoner Francisco Chaviano (see Section Le.) undertook a hunger
 strike for several weeks in September to protest his unfair imprisonment as well
 as his treatment as a common criminal. Omar del Pozo Marrero wrote several let-
 ters to government leaders demanding that they respect his status as a political
 prisoner.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prison conditions by
 international or national human rights monitoring groups. However, the Govern-
 ment did permit the France-Liberte delegation to interview 24 political prisoners in
 the prisons' administrative sections. The Government refused the delegation access
 to prison cells, kitchens, dining halls, or infirmaries (see Section 4).
 Effective May 17, the Government ratified the United Nations Convention Against
 Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment, with certain reserva-
 tions relating to the investigation and arbitration of complaints.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Law of Penal Procedures requires
 police to file formal charges and either release a detainee or bring the case before
 a prosecutor within 96 hours of arrest. It also requires the authorities to provide
 suspects with access to a lawyer within 10 days of arrest. However, the Constitution
 states that all legally recognized civil liberties can be denied anyone actively oppos-
 ing the "decision of the Cuban people to build socialism." Authorities routinely in-
 voke this sweeping authority to deny these guarantees to those detained on pur-
 ported state security grounds.
 
 
 383
 Authorities routinely engage in arbitrary arrest and detention of human rights
 advocates, subjecting them to interrogations, threats, and degrading treatment and
 conditions for hours or days at a time. Ramon Varela Sanchez, vice president of the
 Marti Civic League, has been detained without charges since July 31. In addition,
 the Government regularly cracked down on groups of human ights advocates, in-
 cluding the newly formed Concilio Cubano. Between May 13 and May 16, state secu-
 rity agents detained 17 provincial and municipal leaders of the Human Rights Party
 of Cu ba for periods ranging from several hours to several days. They were released
 pending trial on charges of enemy propaganda. To prevent any organized commemo-
 ration of the anniversary of the death of 37 people aboard the "13th of March" tug-
 boat, state security agents detained over 30 human rights advocates between July
 11 and July 13, releasing them hours or days later without charges.
 The Penal Code also includes the concept of "dangerousness," defined as the "spe-
 cial proclivity of a prson to commit crimes, demonstrated by his onduct in mani-
 fest contradiction of socialist norms." If the police decide a person exhibits signs of
 dangerousness, they may bring the ofenderbfore a court or subject him to "ther-
 apy" or "political reeducation. Government authorities regularly intimidate critics
 by threatening prosecution under this article. Both the LTHC an  the TACHR
 condemned this concept for its subjectivity, the summary nature of the judicial pro-
 ceedings employed, the lack of legal safegards, and the political considerations be-
 hind its application. According to the IACHR, "the special inclination to commit
 crimes referred to in the Cuban criminal code amounts to a subjective criterion used
 by the Government to justify violations of the right to individual freedom and due
 process of persons whose sole crime has been an inclinalion to hold a view different
 from the official view."
 Jesus Castillo, an independent lawyer who works with human rights and inde-
 pendent labor organizations, was threatened with a charge of dangerousness if he
 refused to accept work washing floors at a cafeteria. The National wer' Organi-
 zation had disbarred him in 1984 for "ideological deviationism," and authorities also
 detained him for 2 years without charges. On October 20, state security agents de-
 tained independent journalist Olance Nogueras Rofes and threatened him with im-
 prisonment on the charge of dangerousness if he did not leave thm country or apply
 or refugee status (see ion 2.a.). They released him 5 days later but rearrested
 him on October 26 and held him for several days. He was released pending police
 investigation of potential charges of revealing state secrets and enemy propaganda.
 Nogueras had been investigating alleged construction and safety deficiencies at the
 Juragua nuclear power plant in Cienfuegos.
 The Government also used exile as a tool fur controlling and eliminating internal
 opposition. The Government regularly offered exile as the condition for release to
 political prisoners. Rodolfo Gonzalez Gonzalez, Luis Alberto Pita Santos, and Pablo
 Reyes Martinez were all taken directly from prison to the airport for flights to other
 countries. The UNHIRC condemned the practice of "obligating political prisoners to
 and subjecting them to pressure while they are in prison to accept
 this condition.  or the first time, however, the Government permitted the uncondi-
 tional release of a number of political prisoners, although many of those ostensibly
 released unconditionally as "special cases" were advised to begin their refugee proc-
 essing immediately or risk reimprisonment. Six prisoners released in late-May fol-
 lowing the visit of France-Liberte, including Sbatian Arcos Bergnes and Yndamiro
 Restano Dias, were allowed to remain in the country.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Cons itilon provides for independ-
 ent courts, it explicitly subordinates them to the National Assembly (ANPP) and the
 Council of State, which is headed by Fidel Castro. The rubber-stamp ANPP and its
 lower level counterparts elect all judges. The subordination of the courtrtt the Com-
 munist Party further compromises the judiciarys independence.
 Civil courts exist at municipal, provincial, and Supreme Court levels. Panels com-
 posed of a mix of professionally certified and lay judges preside over them. Military
 tribunals assume jurisdiction for certain counterrevolutionary cases. Cuban law and
 trial practices do not meet international standards for fair public trials. Almost all
 cases are tried in less than 1 day.
 There are no jury trials. Most trials are public; however, trials are closed when
 state security is allegediy involved. Prosecutors may introduce testimony from a
 CDR member as to the revolutionary background of a defendant, which may contrib-
 ute to either a longer or shorter sentence. The law recognizes the right of appeal
 in municipal courts but limits it in provincial courts to cases such as those involving
 maximum prison terms or the death penalty. The law requires that an appeal be
 filed within 5 days of the verdict.
 Criteria for presenting evidence, especially in cases of human rights advocates,
 are arbitrary and discriminatory. Often the sole evidence provided, particularly in
 
 
 political cases, is the defendant's confession, usually obtained under duress and
 without the legal advice or knowledge of a defense lawyer. The authorities regularly
 deny defendants access to their lawyers until the day of the trial. Several dissidents
 who have served prison terms say that they were tried and sentenced without coun-
 sel and were not allowed to speak on their own behalf.
 The law provides the accused the right to an attorney, but the control the Govern-
 ment exerts over members of the state-controlled lawyer's collectives-especially
 when they defend persons accused of state security crimes-thoroughly compromises
 their ability to represent clients. Observers have reported reluctance among attor-
 neys to defend those charged in political cases out of fear of jeopardizing their own
 careers.
 Several members of the "Corriente Agramontista,' an association of reform-mind-
 ed lawyers who often defend individuals accused of political crimes, were either
 transferred to remote locations to encourage them to resign or were fired and dis-
 barred. Agramontista President Rene Gomez Manzano was fired on October 6 for
 his "disrespectful and ironical attitude" at the 1992 general meeting of the National
 Lawyers' Organization, as well as for having written a letter containing "calumnious
 comments about the performance of the National Executive Board." Gomez' letter
 had criticized the financial and political management of the organization and had
 proposed the democratization of the organization and the reinstatement of the pri-
 vate practice of law.
 The military trial of human rights advocate and leader of the National Council
 for Civil Rights, Francisco Chaviano, on charges of revealing state secrets and fal-
 sifying documents, exemplified the absence of fair trial procedures and due process.
 Chaviano, who was detained for 11 months without charges, received notice of his
 indictment only days before his April 15 trial date. After having dismissed his attor-
 ney in protest over the Government's refusal to give her access to his file or to con-
 duct private interviews with him, he had only 1 day to review his 500-page case
 file. On the day of his trial, he accepted a court-appointed lawyer. During the 1-
 day trial closed to everyone except his immediate family, the military tribunal pro-
 hibited Chaviano from making any statement, calling defense witnesses, or present-
 ing exculpatory evidence. The prosecution presented no physical evidence in support
 of the charges. Chaviano was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment; his appeals were
 subsequently denied. During the trial, the local CDR amassed a group of about 50
 people armed with pipes, sticks, bats, and stones outside the courthouse to threaten
 the small group of family, friends, and human rights advocates who had gathered
 there.
 According to Amnesty International, 600 persons were imprisoned for various po-
 litical crimes. Other human rights monitoring groups estimate that between 1,000
 and 1,500 individuals-not including those held for dangerousness-were impris-
 oned on such charges as enemy propaganda, illicit association, contempt for author-
 ity (usually for criticizing Fidel Castro), clandestine printing, or the -broad charge
 of rebellion, often brought against advocates of peaceful democratic change. In a tel-
 evision interview in October, President Castro acknowledged and attempted to jus-
 tify the existence of political prisoners in Cuba by stating that this was a normal
 practice in many other countries.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Constitution provides for the inviolability of one's home and correspond-
 ence, official surveillance of private and family affairs by government-controlled
 mass organizations, such as the CDR's, remains one of the most pervasive and re-
 pressive features of Cuban life. The State has assumed the right to interfere in the
 lives of citizens, even those who do not actively oppose the Government and its prac-
 tices. The Communist Party controls the mass organizations which permeate soci-
 ety. Their ostensible purpose is to "improve" the citizenry, but in fact their goal is
 to discover and discourage nonconformity. Citizen participation in these mass orga-
 nizations has declined; the economic crisis has both reduced the Government's abil-
 ity to provide material incentives for their participation and forced many people to
 engage in black market activities which the mass organizations are supposed to re-
 port to the authorities.
 The authorities utilize a wide range of social controls. The Interior Ministry em-
 ploys an intricate system of informants and block committees (the CDR's) to monitor
 and control public opinion. While to a lesser extent than in the past, CDR's continue
 to report on suspicious activity, including conspicuous consumption; unauthorized
 meetings, including those with foreigners; and defiant attitudes toward the Govern-
 ment and the revolution.
 State security often reads international correspondence and monitors overseas
 telephone calls and conversations with foreigners. Citizens do not have the right to
 
 
 385
 receive publications from abroad. Security agents subject dissidents, foreign dip-
 lomats, and journalists to surveillance.
 State security officials threatened human rights advocate Victoria Ruiz Labrit
 with having her children removed from her custody if she continued her involve-
 ment in the human rights movement.
 The authorities regularly search people and their homes, without probable cause,
 to intimidate and harass them. In July police searched the homes of independent
 journalists Nestor Baguer and Jose Rivero Garcia and seized their facsimile ma-
 chines (see Section 2.a.). In August state security agents seized the replacement fac-
 simile machine that Baguer had received. On October 18, state security agents in
 Camaguey spent 2Y2 hours searching the home of Dulce Maria Suarez Ramirez, who
 provides temporary lodging for the visiting relatives of political prisoners detained
 in Camaguey province. State security agents seized letters from those families, as
 well as personal video cassettes and various foreign publications.
 The authorities regularly detained human rights advocates after they visited the
 U.S. Interests Section, confiscated their written reports of human rights abuses, and
 seized copies of US. newspapers and other informational materials.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government does not allow criticism of the
 revolution or its leaders. Laws against antigovernment propaganda, graffiti, and in-
 sults against officials carry penalties of from 3 months to 1 year in prison. If Presi-
 dent Castro or members of the National Assembly or Council of State are the object
 of criticism, the sentence is extended to 3 years. Local CDR's inhibit freedom of
 speech by monitoring and reporting dissent or criticism. Police and state security
 officials regularly harassed, threatened, beat, and otherwise abused human rights
 advocates in public and private as a means of intimidation and control.
 Miguel Angel Aldana, President of the Marti Civic League, which regularly re-
 ports human rights violations to the U.S. media, was assaulted by three unidenti-
 fied men in full daylight on June 15. While one pinned down his arm, another took
 a wooden stick and beat his hand telling him that it was "so you can't continue writ-
 ing garbage." Police in the emergency room at the local hospital asked no questions
 when Aldana arrived obviously beaten and bloody.
 Several members of the Independent Press Bureau of Cuba (BPIC), founded in
 September by former political prisoner Yndamiro Restano Diaz, were detained and
 threatened with imprisonment if they continued their work as independent journal-
 ists. Olance Nogueras Rofes was detained twice, each time for several days, and
 threatened with imprisonment if he did not either stop working for BPIC or leave
 the country (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government rigorously monitored other forms of expression and often ar-
 rested people for crimes of enemy propaganda and clandestine printing. Enemy
 propaganda was considered to include materials ranging from the Universal Dec-
 laration of Human Rights, to reports of human rights violations, to mainstream for-
 eign newspapers and magazines.
 The Constitution states that electronic andprint media are state property and
 "cannot become in any case private property. The Communist Party controls all
 media as a means to indoctrinate the public. All media can only operate under Party
 guidelines and must faithfully reflect government views. No other public forums
 exist. The Government continued to jam US.-operated Radio Marti and Television
 Marti, although it usually did not jam other foreign radio broadcasts. Radio Marti
 broadcasts frequently overcame the jamming attempts. The Government's control
 often extends to the foreign press as well. The Government controls access to the
 Internet.
 The Government circumscribes artistic, literary, and academic freedoms. Authori-
 ties denied exit permits to at least nine academics who were to attend the annual
 Latin American Studies Association (LASA) conference in the United States because
 of the content of their research. According to the LASA president, "to impose such
 restrictions on academic travel is an embarrassment for the freedom of education."
 The University of Las Villas dismissed Alvaro Zamora Hernandez, a psychology pro-
 fessor, for "ideological treason" after he was returned to Cuba following an illegal
 departure attempt. Although the university refused to offer him another position at
 an equal salary, they did continue to pay him his previous salary.
 The educational system teaches that the State's interests have precedence over all
 other commitments. The Ministry of Education requires teachers to evaluate stu-
 dents' ideological character and note it in the records that students carry through-
 out their schooling, and which affect their future educational and career prospects.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution
 grants limited rights of assembly and association, these rights are subject to the re-
 
 
 386
 quirement that they may not be 'exercised against. . . the existence and objectives
 of the Socialist State." The law punishes any unauthorized assembly, including for
 private religious services, of more than three persons, even in a private home, by
 up to 3 months in prison and a fine (see Section 2.c.). The authorities selectively
 enforce this prohibition and often use it as a legal pretext to harass and imprison
 human rights advocates. The authorities have never approved a public meeting of
 a human rights rup.
 The Penal Coe pecifically outlaws "illegal or unrecognized groups." The Ministry
 of Justice, in consultation with the Interior Ministry, decides whether to recognize
 organizations. Recognized churches, the Roman Catholic humanitarian organization
 CARITAS, the Masonic Order, small human rights groups, and several nascent
 independent professional organizations are the oly associations outside the control
 of the State, the Party, and mass organizations. All other legally recognized non-
 g vermental groups are affiliated with or controlled by the Government. The au-
 torities continue to ignore applications for legal recognition, thereby allowing the
 Government to threaten members of these groups with charges of illicit association.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-In recent years, the Government has eased the harsher
 aspects of its repression of religious freedom. In 1991 it allowed religious adherents
 to join the Communist Party.  In July 1992, it amended the Constitution to prohibit
 religious discrimination and removed references to "scientific materialism," i.e.
 atheism, as the basis for the Cuban State. While the Protestant Ecumenical Councii
 praised such actions, the Episcopal Conference of the Roman Catholic Church re-
 p lied with concern over the gap between the Government's rhetoric and actions. In
 late 1993 the Government harshly criticized the Roman Catholic bishops' pastoral
 letter caling for national reconciliation and dialog. Despite continued restrictions
 and harsh rhetoric, the Roman Catholic Church has observed that it has relatively
 more latitude in which to carry out its pastoral mission.
 Despite legal changes, religious persecution continues. The State prohibits mem-
 bers of the armed forces from allowing anyone in their household to observe reli-
 gious practices. It exempts elderly relatives only if their religious beliefs do not in-
 fluence other family members and are not "damaging to the revolution."
 The Government continued to use the Penal Code to persecute Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses and, to a lesser extent, Seventh Day Adventists because it considers them
 to be "active religious enemies of the revolution" for their refusal to accept obliga-
 tory military service or participate in state organizations. The Government also
 harasses other churches. Miguel Angel Leon, a Baptist minister in Cienfaegos prov-
 ince, and Jorge Luis Brito, a member of the church, were tried in December 1994
 after 14 months in detention and sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment for enemy
 propaganda.
 The Government requires churches and other religious groups to register with the
 Srovincial registry of associations to obtain official recognition. The Government pro-
 hibits, with occasional exceptions, the construction of new churches, forcing many
 congregations to violate the law and meet in people's homes.
 On May 24, Pentecostal Pastor Orson Vila was arrested, tried, and sentenced to
 23 months' imprisonment (reduced on appeal to 18 months) on charges of disobe-
 dience and illegal meetings for refusing to close his private house of worship in the
 city of Camaguey (see Section 1.c.). At the same time, authorities closed over 80
 Pentecostal private houses of worship in the province of Camaguey. They charged
 that the private houses of worship were operating without official authorization.
 Vila had followed the prescribed procedures for requesting such authorization but
 had only received responses to 16 of the 101 applications he submitted.
 Official recognition of all religious holidays ended in 1961. At that time, the Gov-
 ernment also prohibited nearly all religious processions outside churches and denied
 churches access to mass media. Despite obstacles raised by the Government, church
 attendance has grown in recent years.
 State security officials regularly harassed human rights advocates prior to serv-
 ices commemorating special feast days or before significant national days. A number
 of human rights advocates were warned against attending services at the Sacred
 Heart church in Havana on July 13, the anniversary of the sinking of the "13th of
 March" tugboat. Prior to the September 8 celebration of the feast day of the "Virgen
 de la Caridad del Cobre," 10 members of the Maximo Gomez Human Rights Demo-
 cratic Front in Pinar del Rio were either detained or warned not to attend the
 church service. Sixteen members of the Jose Marti Democratic Bloc were detained
 or threatened before the September 24 celebration of the feast day of the "Virgen
 de las Mercedes."
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not impose legal restrictions on domestic travel,
 except for persons found to be HIV-positive, whom it initially restricts to sani-
 
 
 387
 toriums for treatment and therapy before conditionally releasing them to the com-
 munity. However, state security officials forbade human rights advocates Aida Rosa
 Jimenez and Miguel Angel Aldana from returning to the provinces of Camaguey and
 Pinar del Rio, respectively, and prohibited independent journalist Olance Nogueras
 Rofes from leaving his province of Cienfuegos.
 The Government allows the majority of persons who qualify for immigrant or refu-
 gee status in other countries to leave Cuba. However, the authorities delay or deny
 exit permits in certain cases, usually without explanation. Many of the denials in-
 volve professionals who have tried to emigrate and whom the Government subse-
 quently banned from working in their occupational field. The Government refuses
 permission to others because it considers their cases sensitive for political or state
 security reasons. The Government also routinely denies exit permits to young men
 approaching the age for military service, even when it has authorized the rest of
 the family to leave. However, most of those cases approved for migration to the
 United States eventually receive exemptions from obligatory service and exit per-
 mits. In midyear, the Government made it more difficult for individuals to leave the
 country by inpsing high fees, payable in U.S. dollars, for passports, exit permits,
 and medical checkups. As a result of these fees, almost 1,000 approved migrants
 were unable to travel.
 The Government denied temporary exit permits to several human rights advo-
 cates, including Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz and Osvaldo Pays, as well as to emi-
 nent neurosurgeon Hilda Molina Morejon, who had hoped to visit her son and new-
 born grandson in Argentina.
 Unauthorized departures by boat or raft continue to be punishable by fines and
 prison terms of from 6 months to 3 years, although the Government agreed under
 the terms of the May 2 US.-Cuban migration accord not to prosecute or retaliate
 against rafters returned to Cuba from international or U.S. waters. Although none
 of the returned rafters has been prosecuted for illegal departure, 16 of 223 returnees
 were detained at year's end on various charges unrelated to their illegal departure
 attempt. Of these, nine were jailed on charges of committing common crimes, six
 on charges of escaping from prison or violating parole in connection with earlier ille-
 gal attempts to enter or exit Cuba, and one on charges of violating exit laws follow-
 ing his repatriation. The Penal Code provides for imprisonment from 1 to 3 years
 or a fine of 300 to 1,000 pesos for illegal departure. The U.N. High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) has stated that it regards any sentence for illegal exit of over
 1 year as harsh and excessive.
 In August 1994, the Government eased restrictions on visits by, and repatriation
 of, Cuban emigrants. Cubans who establish residency abroad, and who are in pos-
 session of government-issued "permits to reside abroad," may travel to Cuba without
 visas. The Government further reduced the age of people eligible to travel abroad
 from 20 to 18 years and extended the period for temporary stay abroad from 6 to
 11 months. In November the Government announced a further relaxation in travel
 requirements. Emigrants who are considered not to have engaged in "hostile ac-
 tions" against the Government and who are not subject to criminal proceedings in
 their country of residence may apply at Cuban consulates for renewable, 2-year mul-
 tiple-entry travel authorizations.
 The Constitution provides for the granting of asylum to individuals persecuted
 "for their ideals or struggles for democratic rights against imperialism, fascism, colo-
 nialism, and neocolonialism; against discrimination and racism; for national libera-
 tion; for the rights of workers, peasants, and students; for their progressive political,
 scientific, artistic, and literary activities, for socialism and peace." According to the
 UNHCR, no third country national sought asylum or refugee status from the Gov-
 ernment in 1995. The Government works with the UNHCR to process refugee and
 asylum claims.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have no legal right to change their government or to advocate change.
 The Constitution proscribes any political organization other than the Communist
 Party. A small group of leaders select members of its highest governing bodies-the
 Politburo and the Central Committee.
 The authorities tightly control all elections. The Government estimated a 97 per-
 cent turnout for the July 9 elections for municipal councils. Most of the candidates
 were members of the Communist Party, and no candidates entered in opposition to
 the Government.
 The Government has ignored calls for democratic reform. In an interview with
 Cable News Network television in October, President Castro reiterated his view that
 political parties would fragment Cuban society, and he would therefore not permit
 
 
 388
 them. The Government rejects any change judged incompatible with the revolution,
 as well as proposals by Cubans who seek nonviolent political change. The Govern-
 ment has systematically retaliated against those who have peacefully sought politi-
 cal chane.
 Thou    not a formal requirement, Communist Party membership is a de facto
 prereqisite for high-level official positions and professional advancement.
 Government leadership positions continued to be male dominated. There are very
 few women or minorities in policymaking positions in the Government or the Party.
 There are three women on the Politburo. Two of the 14 provincial party secretaries
 are women, the first chosen in 1993. The head of the Union of Communist Youth
 is a woman. Although blacks and mulattos make up over half the population, they
 hold only 2 seats in the 26-member Politburo.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not recognize any domestic or international human rights
 groups, or permit them to function legally. The Government subjects domestic
 human rights advocates to intense intimidation, harassment, and repression (see
 Sections 1.c., 1.d., and i.e.). In violation of its own statutes, the Government refuses
 to consider applications for legal recognition submitted by human rights monitoring
 groups.
 The Government has steadfastly rejected international human rights monitoring.
 In 1991 Cuba's U.N. representative stated that Cuba would not recognize the
 UNHRC mandate on Cuba and would not cooperate with the Special Rapporteur,
 despite being a UNHRC member. This policy remains unchanged. The Government
 consistently refused requests by the Special Rapporteur to visit Cuba. The Govern-
 ment did allow a brief visit by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in
 November 1994, but it did not honor his request that it permit the Special
 Rapporteur to visit in compliance with his U.N. mandate.
 As a result of an agreement between Danielle Mitterand, president of the humani-
 tarian organization France-Liberte Foundation, and President Castro, the Govern-
 ment permitted a four-person delegation, headed by Raphael Doueb, vice president
 of France-Liberte, to meet with 24 political prisoners between April 28 and May 5.
 The members of that delegation included representatives of the International Fed-
 eration for Human Rights, Doctors of the World, and Human Rights Watch/Ameri-
 cas. The delegation was not permitted to conduct interviews in the pri.an cells or
 to inspect prison facilities. The delegation reported that no prisoner had complained
 of physical abuse during his detention, but that all had complained of summary and
 unfair trials, prolonged pretrial incommunicado detention, cruel and inhuman pris-
 on conditions, and confinement with common criminals. The delegation reported
 being particularly struck by the severity of the sentences imposed on political pris-
 oners for nonviolent crimes.
 The delegation requested the immediate release on health grounds of four of the
 political prisoners interviewed, and special medical treatment for two others who
 had not been interviewed. At the end of May, the Government released Agnstin
 Figueredo Figueredo, Pedro Castillo Ferrer, Sebastian Arcos Bergnes, Ynanumro
 Restano Diaz, Ismael Salvia Ricardo, and Luis Enrique Gonzalez Ogra. Omar del
 Pozo Marrero, one of the four whose immediate release had been sought, was not
 released (see Section 1.c.). The delegation presented a preliminary report on its visit
 to the Government in mid-June and issued a final report in December. In a tele-
 vised interview conducted during his trip to New York, President Castro stated that
 he had disagreed with the preliminary report.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Cuba is a multiracial society with a black and mixed race majority. The Constitu-
 tion forbids discrimination based on race, sex, or national origin, although evidence
 suggests that racial and sexual discrimination often occur.
 Women.-Violent crime is rarely reported in the press, and there are no publicly
 available data regarding the incidence of domestic violence. The law establishes
 strict penalties for rape, and the Government appears to enforce the law. Prostitu-
 tion has increased greatly in the last few years; press reports indicate that tourists
 from various countries visit Cuba specifically to patronize inexpensive prostitutes.
 During its annual meeting, the official Federation of Cuban Women criticized gov-
 ernment-sponsored advertising which promoted sex-related tourism.
 The Family Code states that women and men have equal rights and responsibil-
 ities regarding marriage, divorce, raising children, maintaining the home, and pur-
 suing a career. Women are subject to the same restrictions on property ownership
 
 
 389
 
 as men. The Maternity Law provides 18 weeks of maternity leave and grants work-
 ing women preferential access to goods and services. About 40 percent of all women
 work, and the are well represented in the professions.
 Children.-The Constitution states that the Government will protect "family, ma-
 ternity, and matrimony.' It also states that children, legitimate or not, have the
 same rights under the law and notes the duties of parents to protect them. Edu-
 cation is free and is grounded in Marxist ideology. State orgnizations and schools
 are charged with the "integral formation of childhood an youth." The national
 health care system covers all citizens. There is no pattern of societal abuse of chil-
 dren.
 People With Disabilities.-The law prohibits discrimination based on disability,
 and there have been few complaints of such discrimination. There are no laws which
 mandate accessibility to buildings for people with disabilities.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minoritie&-Many blacks have benefited from the social
 changes of the revolution. Nevertheless, there have been numerous instances of po-
 lice harassment of blacks, including black foreigners and diplomats who were mis-
 taken for being Cuban. Many black dissidents also report that the authorities single
 them out for harassment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution gives priority to state or collective
 needs over individual choices regarding free association or provision of employment.
 The "demands of the economy and society" take precedence over individual worker's
 preferences. The law prohibits strikes; none are known to have occurred. Estab-
 lished labor organizations have a mobilization function and do not act as trade
 unions or promote or protect worker rights, including the right to strike. Such orga-
 nizations are under the control of the State and the party.
 The Communist Party selects the leaders of the sole legal confederation, the Con-
 federation of Cuban Workers, whose principal responsibility is to ensure that gov-
 ernment production goals are met. Despite disclaimers in international forums, the
 Government explicitly prohibits independent unions. There has been no change
 since the 1992 International Labor Organization (ILO) finding that independent
 unions "do not appear to exist" and its ruling that Cuba violated ILO norms on free-
 dom of association and the right to organize. Those who attempt to engage in union
 activities face government persecution.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining does not
 exist. The State Committee for Work and Social Security sets wages and salaries
 for the state sector. Since all legal unions are government entities, antiunion dis-
 crimination by definition does not exist. There are no independent unions.
 In 1993 the Government removed some of the restrictions on self-employment im-
 posed in 1968 and allowed people to apply for licenses to work in over 125 different
 occupations, expanded to over 160 in 1994. Besides adding another 20 occupational
 categories, in 1995 the Government removed its previous ban on self-employment
 licenses for university graduates. However, university graduates cannot get self-em-
 ployment licenses for work in their professional field and must remain employed in
 their state job to qualify for a self-employment license.
 There are no functioning export processing zones in Cuba, although the new For-
 eign Investment Law (Law 77), promulgated on September 6, authorizes the estab-
 lishment of free trade zones and industrial parks. Law 77 continued to deny workers
 the right to contract directly with foreign companies investing in Cuba. The Govern-
 ment requires foreign investors to contract workers through state employment agen-
 cies which are paid in foreign currency and, in turn, pay their workers in pesos.
 Workers subcontracted by state employment agencies must meet certain political
 qualifications. According to Marcos Portal, Minister of Basic Industry, the state em-
 ployment agencies consult with the party, the Confederation of Cuban Workers, and
 the Union of Communist Youth to ensure that the workers chosen deserve to work
 in a joint enterprise.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Neither the Constitution nor the
 Labor Code prohibit forced labor. The Government maintains correctional centers
 where it sends people for crimes such as dangerousness. They are forced to work
 on farms or building sites, usually with no pay and inadequate food. The authorities
 often imprison internees who do not cooperate. The Government employs special
 groups of workers, known as "microbrigades," on loan from other jobs, on special
 building projects. These microbrigades have increased importance in the Govern-
 ment's efforts to complete tourist and other priority projects. Workers who refuse
 to volunteer for these jobs often risk discrimination or job loss. Microbrigade work-
 ers, however, reportedly receive priority consideration for apartments. The military
 channels some conscripts to the Youth Labor Army, where they serve their 2-year
 
 
 military service requirement working on farms which supply bath the armed forces
 and the civilian population. he ILO s Committee of Experts criticized Cuba for vio-
 lating ILO Convention 29 on Forced Labor, based on information provided by the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. In response the Cuban state
 labor committee in 1993 eliminated "merits and demerits" from workers' labor
 records.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum working age
 is 17 years. The Labor Code permits employment of 15- and 16-year-olds to obtain
 training or fill labor shortages. All students over age 11 are expected to devote 30
 to 45 days of their summer vacation to farm work, laboring up to 8 hours per day.
 The Ministry of Agriculture uses "voluntary labor" by Student Work Brigades exten-
 sively in the farming sector. The law requires school attendance until the ninth
 grade, and this law is generally respected.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage varies by occupation and
 is set by the Bureau of Labor and Social Security. The minimum monthly wage for
 a maid, for example, is $6.60 at the unofficial but actual exchange rate of 25 pesos
 to $1.00 in November 1995 (165 pesos); for a bilingual office clerk, $7.60 (190 pesos);
 and for a gardener $8.60 (215 pesos). The Government supplements the minimum
 wage with free medical care, education, and subsidized housing and food. Even with
 these subsidies, however, a worker must earn far more than the average monthly
 wage to support a family. The Government rations most basic necessities such as
 food, medicine, clothing, and cooking gas, which are in very short supply, if avail-
 able at all.
 The standard work week is 44 hours, with shorter workdays in hazardous occupa-
 tions such as mining. The Government also reduced the workday in some govern-
 mental offices and state enterprises to save energy. Workplace environmental and
 safety controls are usually inadequate, and the Government lacks effective enforce-
 ment mechanisms. The Labor Code establishes that worker who considers his life
 in danger because of hazardous conditions has the right not to work in his position
 or not to engage in specific activities until such risks are eliminated. According to
 the Labor Code, the worker remains obligated to work temporarily in whatever
 other position may be assigned him at a salary prescribed by law. Industrial acci-
 dents apparently are frequent, but the Government suppresses such reports.
