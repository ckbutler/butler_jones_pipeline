 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is- A- parliamentary democracy which guarantees by lawx
 and respects in practice the civil, political, and religious
 rights of its citizens. It has free elections, a multiparty
 political system, an independent judiciary, and an elected
 legislature (the Knesset) which may limit the Government by
 legislation and can bring it down by a vote of no confidence.
 There is no constitution; a series of basic laws defines the
 responsibilities of government institutions. Emergency
 regulations, associated with the state of emergency in force
 since the founding of the State in 1948, are still in effect.
 Israel and its Arab neighbors, except for Egypt, continue to
 be in a formal state of war. Pursuant to the 1979
 Egypt-rsrael Treaty, Israel returned the remainder of the
 Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in 1981. Israel continues to occupy
 other territories (the Golan Heights, Gaza Strip, the West
 Bank, and the eastern sector of Jerusalem) captured in the
 1967 war. In mid-1985, Israel withdrew the bulk of its troops
 from southern Lebanon, where they had been since the 1982 war,
 but it still maintains a residual presence and continues to
 support a local militia, the "Army of South Lebanon."
 Many Israelis doubt that other Arab states are prepared to
 accept Israel's right to exist on the basis of U.N. Security
 Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Terrorist incidents within
 Israel and the absence of peace treaties between Israel and
 most of its Arab neighbors make security a dominant concern
 for Israel.
 Approximately 16 percent of the population of Israel are Arabs
 who do not share the Zionist principles upon which the State
 was founded. Some Jewish groups in Israel also reject Zionism.
 Israeli society is characterized by its openness and by its
 wide-ranging and lively public debate of virtually allissues
 of popular concern. Police and internal security functions
 are under the control of cabinet ministers who must answer to
 the Knesset concerning the actions of personnel for whom they
 are responsible and whose performance is subject to the
 scrutiny of a vigorous free press.
 Israel enjoys a relatively high standard of living. It has a
 predominantly market economy with substantial governmental
 participation and subsidized prices for basic commodities.
 Economic policy has a strong orientation toward social
 welfare. In recent years, Israel experienced increasing
 balance of payments deficits, rising foreign debt,
 triple-digit inflation, and declining foreign exchange
 reserves. A new economic program, initiated in 1985, has
 significantly reduced the level of inflation and improved
 Israel's interpational financial position.
 As in the past, the most significant human rights problems for
 Israel in 1987 derived from the strained relations between the
 Israeli adthorities and some Israelis on the one hand and the
 *Because of the sharply differing sociopolitical environments
 in Israel and in the Arab territories which Israel has
 occupied since the 1967 war, the respective human rights
 situations are treated in separate but parallel fashion. The
 report on the occupied territories follows the report for
 Israel.

 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Arab inhabitants of the occupied territories on the other hand.
 These problems were again exacerbated in 1987 by attacks
 against Israelis in those areas and by acts of provocation or
 violence by Jewish settlers. The number of attacks on Israelis
 and acts of violence by settlers increased somewhat in 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no indication that political killing is sanctioned by
 Israeli authorities.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Such practices are prohibited by law and by regulation.
 Evidence or confessions obtained under duress are inadmissible
 in court, and the administrative codes of conduct of the
 prison and police authorities contain stringent sanctions
 against the use of force or brutality. Police officers
 accused of brutality or violence against prisoners or suspects
 may be prosecuted either in administrative courts for violation
 of the code of conduct or in regular criminal courts for
 criminal assault.
 In October 1987, a special judicial commission, headed by
 former Supreme Court President Moshe Landau, issued a report
 which found that since 1971 the General Security Service (the
 Israeli internal security agency or Shin Bet) had routinely
 used physical and psychological mistreatment to obtain
 confessions, which were often the only evidence against
 persons accused of security offenses. The commission
 recommended that no criminal action be taken against Shin Bet
 personnel who had employed illegal interrogation methods
 before the report was issued. The commission recommended that
 limited and clearly delineated "physical and psychological
 pressure" may be exerted in the interrogation of terrorism
 suspects. These allowable pressures as well as illegal
 practices were defined in a secret annex submitted to the
 Prime Minister.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Israeli law provides guarantees against arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other procedural and
 substantive safeguards are available. Defendants are
 considered innocent until proven guilty.
 Administrative detention is allowed under emergency regulations
 and may be employed in security-related cases when it is
 determined to the satisfaction of a judge that formally
 charging a person would compromise sensitive sources of
 evidence. Any person under administrative detention is
 entitled to representation by counsel and must be brought
 before the president of the appropriate district court within
 48 hours of being taken into custody. Upon application of the
 Defense Minister to a district court, the right to
 
 
 .1182
 
 ISRAEL' "AND THE  OCCUPXED TERRITORIES'.
 representati6in by counsel may be delayed from 48 hours, to 7
 days in most- instances and up to 15 days in terrorist-related
 cases. : Each' case of administrative detention must be submitted
 to juidicial review.-,at least every 3 months thereafter for the
 entire fdriodof detention. .The decision of the president of
 the district court can be appealed to the Supreme Court. No
 cases of administrative detention were reported in Israel- in
 1987.
 Israel does not accord prisoner-of-war status under the Third
 Geneva Convention to prisoners captured in Lebanon following
 ,the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon who were 'not members of
 the armed forces of another country.
 Again i.n 1987, Israeli military forces brought an-.unknown
 number of prisoners captured in southern Lebanon across the
 border to prisons in Israeli territory in violation,of the
 Fourth Geneva Convention.
 There is no forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to-a hearing by an impalrtial .tribunal with.
 represehtatidnby counsel is guavanteed by law. 'The judiciary.
 is independent and effectively insulated from political  ,I
 interferedite. -With thkexception of security cases, which may
 be tried by-militat-y courts, all trials are-open. In security
 cas-esF,.'-lrraeli. law -provides:;that- part or. all of a trial may.be
 closed;W'ith the burden of justifying nonpubl-ic -proceedings
 falling on the  prosecution. Counsel-is present during closed
 proceedings. In some cases, security grounds are .cited to
 eny access to evidence by defendants or their lawyers. In
 security c.ases,, the law also, allows for restrictions on the
 choice of-,defense courseL, but -there were n known cases in
 1987 in dwhich this provision was.,invoked.
 In October the special judicial commission headed byformer
 Supreme Court President Moshe Landau issued its report on the
 methods and practices of Shin Bet.. The commission had been
 set up after the Supreme Court-ordered the release of an
 Israeli Circassian-army officer, Izat Nafsu, who had been.
 imprisoned for 7 years after being convicted of security
 offenses on the basis of an extracted confession and false
 evidence provided by the Shin Bet.
 The Landau CommiSsion-report stated that by 1974 it had become
 "well-rooted practice and the accepted norm" for Shin Bet
 interrogators to lie to the courts about their interrogation
 methods -and that.by the early 1980's.Shin Bet-ipterrogators
 "had been given written instructions" on how to lie to the
 courts when accused persons-tried to retract their forced
 confessions. As A result of Shin Bet assurances, which the
 Landau Commission found to be systematic perjury over the last
 17 years, the courts had refused to accept these retractions.
 The Landau.Commission recommended that external supervision
 and control of the Shin Bet by the Prime Minister, the
 Parliament, the Cabinet; and the State Comptroller should be
 expanded and strengthened. It further recommended that the
 Attorney General and military judicial authorities take steps
 to permit retrials in response to all legitimate requests
 submitted as a result of the report, and that guidelines
 should be developed to allow prisoners sentenced in military
 
 
 1183
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 courts in the occupied territories (where there currently is
 no appeal mechanism) the right to retrial.
 On the ground that they were not aware of the regular and
 systematic Shin Bet practice of perjury, the report
 recommended that political, judicial, and military authorities
 should not be held responsible. It also recommended that no
 criminal action should be taken against Shin Bet personnel who
 committed perjury before the report was issued.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Privacy of the individual and the sanctity of homelife and
 correspondence are protected by law. However, Israeli Arab
 political activists complain that their incoming and outgoing
 mail is delayed or confiscated. There are effective legal
 safeguards against arbitrary invasion of the home.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press, basic rights in Israel, are
 limited by security-based censorship provisions. These rights
 are protected by law and the judiciary and are broadly
 exercised. An independent and vigorous press expresses a wide
 variety of political opinion.
 The media are censored under emergency regulations, which
 allow prohibition of material that, in the opinion of the
 censor, will harm the defense of Israel, the public safety, or
 public order. Censorship decisions may be appealed through
 the judiciary. In practice, censorship of the media is
 usually limited to national security matters. Journalists
 generally know which security-related areas are off-limits to
 publication and practice self-censorship. Licenses to publish
 newspapers are required and normally are routinely issued.
 All newspapers are privately owned and managed.
 In 1987 a weekly Arabic magazine was denied permission to
 publish due to alleged connections with an external
 Palestinian organization which advocates violence against
 Israel. There was no allegation that the magazine
 itself advocated violence.
 Israeli radio and television are run by the independent Israel
 Broadcast Authority (IBA). The Government helps to fund the
 IBA and appoints its governing board, but has little control
 over programming. The independence of the IBA is protected by
 law, subject to the censorship provisions. Radio and
 television programs are in Arabic as well as in Hebrew.
 Movies and theater are subject to censorship if deemed
 pornographic or otherwise offensive to religious or social
 mores or likely to create a disturbance of public order.
 Censorship board actions, rarely imposed, can be appealed in
 the courts. Possession and distribution of literature
 considered hostile to the State or issued by illegal
 Palestinian organizations are punishable offenses.
 Israeli law forbids public manifestations of support for
 organizations defined by the State as terrorist in nature.
 Proscribed acts include flying the Pplestinian flag or
 displaying its colors, displaying Palestinian nationalist
 
 
 1184
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 slogans, and publicly expressing support for the Palestine
 Liberation Organization (PLO).
 Israeli law also prohibits the intentional fomenting of racism.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and the right to demonstrate are protected
 by law and court rulings. Permits are required and routinely
 granted for political rallies and outdoor meetings beyond an
 established size. Any contact by Israelis with the PLO, its
 subdivisions, non-PLO organizations classified by the
 Government as terrorist groups, or with individual members of
 these groups is punishable under Israeli law. In 1987 several
 cases were initiated against Israelis who met with PLO
 members, but no one has actually been prosecuted.
 Israel has a free, democratic labor movement, which plays an
 important role in social, economic, and political life.
 Israel's most powerful labor organization, the General
 Federation of Labor (Histadrut), and its affiliates operate
 the largest national health insurance program and seven
 retirement pension systems, as well as a number of large
 industrial enterprises. About 85 percent of all Israeli
 workers are Histadrut members. The membership includes 60
 percent of the adult Israeli Arab population. Israeli
 workers, including those in the public sector, make frequent
 use of the right to strike. Histadrut has traditionally been
 active in the international field; it runs a large labor
 assistance program and is active in various international
 labor organizations. Israel's labor laws are modern and
 comprehensive; they reflect social democratic values and the
 conditions of employment negotiated by Histadrut over many
 years. The collective agreements law of 1957 governs trade
 union representation and collective bargaining.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Israel was founded as a Jewish state in which all citizens are
 assured freedom of religion by law. Muslims, Christians,
 Druze, and other minority religious groups make up about 17
 percent of the population. The prevailing interpretation of
 the Jewish nature of the State has been secular rather than
 religious. The Law of Retutn of 1950, which abolished all
 British Mandate restrictions on Jewish immigration, and the
 Citizenship Law of 1952, which granted every Jew the right to
 citizenship upon arrival in Israel, confers an advantage on
 Jews in matters of immigration, residence, and citizenship.
 All religious groups may maintain contacts with their
 coreligionists outside Israel. Foreign clergy are permitted
 to live in Israel to minister to their coreligionists.
 Several thousand Israeli Muslims make the pilgrimage to Mecca
 each year. There is no operating Islamic seminary in Israel.
 Muslims may obtain such training in institutions in East
 Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza, or Egypt. The International
 Center of the Baha'i Religion is located in Haifa, and a
 Mormon study center is located in Jerusalem.
 Under Israeli law, each religious community is governed in
 matters of personal status by its own religious law and not by
 civil law. A system of religious courts, which coexists with
 the civil judiciary, does not fully protect the rights of
 individuals who do not follow the dominant tradition within
 their religious community. Difficulties do not normally arise
 
 
 1185
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 in religious worship, but do occur in areas such as marriage,
 legitimacy, inheritance, or conversion. Women's rights, in
 particular, are limited in some religious communities. Some
 Jewish and Christian congregations have complained that local
 and regional authorities have used zoning regulations to
 prevent establishment or expansion of their congregations.
 An antiproselytizing law enacted in 1977 prohibits the
 offering and receipt of material benefits as inducements to
 religious conversion. In 1979 the Justice Minister stated
 that the law is not intended to restrict the religious freedom
 of any community or to impede any community from the pursuit
 of normal educational or philanthropic activities. Since its
 enactment the law has not been employed, but it nevertheless
 continues to cause uneasiness among some Christian groups.
 Persons considered missionaries and purporting to belong to
 missionary groups have been subjected to physical attacks by
 individuals and in some cases harassment by extremist Jewish
 religious groups. The police have been active in protecting
 missionary groups.
 The Ministry of Religious Affairs cooperates with and gives
 financial support to various interfaith groups which seek to
 promote understanding among different religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Under Israeli law, Israeli citizens enjoy freedom of movement
 within the country and are free to travel abroad or to
 emigrate, subject to government review to determine whether
 military service obligations have been satisfied. Emergency
 regulations, however, provide that Israeli citizens may be
 confined by administrative order to their neighborhoods or
 villages, barred from traveling to the occupied territories,
 or prevented from traveling abroad. Restrictions of this
 nature have been applied most often to Israeli Arabs. Bans on
 the travel of an Anglican pastor, Canon Riah Abu al-Assal, and
 of an attorney, both of whom are officials of the Progressive
 List for Peace, a small, mostly Arab political party, were
 extended by administrative orders of the Prime Minister in his
 capacity as Acting Minister of Interior. A number of Arab
 journalists are also under restrictions not to leave their
 towns or are affected by other travel restrictions. In all
 cases, the Israeli authorities maintain that the restrictions
 are based on security grounds. Travel restrictions are
 subject to court appeal, but restricted persons are routinely
 'denied access to evidence against them, and thus have been
 unable to mount successful appeals.
 Since 1948 Israel has taken in over a million Jewish refugees,
 principally from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Soviet
 Union, and has worked toward integrating them into its society
 and economy; the flow of immigrants from abroad continued in
 1987. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 of
 December 11, 1948, calls upon Israel to permit Arab refugees
 who left their homes in the 1947-48 fighting to return if they
 are willing to live in peace, or to be compensated for their
 losses if they choose not to return. Israel has refused to
 recognize the validity of this resolution, pointing to the
 uncompensated losses of its own citizens who fled Arab states
 at the same time. Israel has allowed the return of some Arab
 refugees under the principle of family reunification, but the
 great majority of requests have not been approved. Israel
 
 
 1186
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 has, on occasion, indicated willingness to accept some refugees
 in the context of a final peace settlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty system.
 All adult Israeli citizens have the right to vote and to
 participate in the political process.
 The Israeli Arab community is underrepresented in the national
 Government; 16 percent of Israel's total population is Arab,
 but only 7 of 120 Knesset members are not Jews, and there are
 no Arabs in the Cabinet. This may be due, in part, to poor
 political organization within the Arab community and to
 refusal by some-Arabs to participate in Israeli politics.
 Israeli Arabs are included in the parliamentary delegations of
 several of the Zionist parties, the Progressive List for
 Peace, and the non-Zionist Israeli Communist Party.
 Israeli Arabs actively participate in local (municipal)
 elections, and Israeli Arab municipal councils serve in Arab
 towns throughout Israel. These municipal councils freely
 participate in Israeli regional councils.
 Women participate freely in the political process and account
 for more than 40 percent of the political party membership.
 Ten members of the Knesset and two of the judges of the
 Supreme Court are women. There is 1 woman ia the 23-member
 Cabinet.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights offices in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
 the Ministry of Justice answer requests for information on
 human rights laws and regulations and on specific cases from
 nongovernmental domestic and international human rights
 groups, as'well as from foreign governments and
 intergovernmental organizations. Officials in the Interior,
 Defense, Religious Affairs, Housing, and Education ministries
 also accept requests for information. Several human rights
 groups in Israel work for the protection of individual
 liberties and women's rights. Private Israeli groups, such as
 the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights, the Association
 for Civil Rights in Israel, and-Peace Now, freely criticize
 Israeli government actions in Israel, the Occupied Territories,
 and Lebanon. They issue statements and reports, hold press
 conferences, and organize demonstrations without government
 interference.
 The Government permits visits to Israel by representatives of
 private international human rights groups, as well as the
 United Nations Economic and Social Council, the World Health
 Organization, and the International Labor Organization. The
 Government has generally permitted the International Committee
 of the Red Cross to visit prisoners taken in Lebanon and the
 occupied territories, but only after a delay of 14 days. The
 Government also investigates and replies to most inquiries by
 organizatiohs such as Amnesty International.
 
 
 1187
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women's rights in Israel are protected by law as well as by
 governmental and private organizations. The Equal Opportunity
 Law forbids discrimination on account of sex or marital or
 parental status, and employers are legally bound to pay female
 workers a wage equal to that paid male workers for the same or
 generally similar work. Amendments to labor laws in 1987
 allow women to choose between early retirement at age 60 or
 mandatory retirement at age 65. Men do not have the option of
 early retirement at age 60. Laws and regulations also provide
 for protection of the rights of female employees with respect
 to pregnancy and childbirth. The Government includes a senior
 adviser on the status of women, and the Civil Service
 Commission and several government ministries have officers
 responsible for promoting fair treatment for women and
 ensuring that the rights of women are protected.
 Nongovernmental women's organizations also work to advance the
 status of women, ensure equal opportunity in all fields, and
 provide other family services such as child care for working
 mothers.
 Over 40 percent of university graduates are women, as are 39
 percent of the work force. Fifty-two percent of Israeli civil
 service employees are women. They account for approximately
 two-thirds of the instructors employed in the educational
 system. Women are underrepresented at the higher levels of
 government and the civil service, although there is debate
 over whether they occupy fewer senior positions as a result of
 discrimination or because they generally follow different
 career patterns from those followed by men. Women are well
 represented in professional and Eechnical jobs in the media,
 and work in a broad range of nongovernment professions and
 other occupations. Women are drafted into the army but are
 barred from many positions (some because they are
 combat-related).
 By law, the Israeli Arab minority has equal rights in most
 respects, and Israeli Arabs have made substantial educational
 and material progress since the founding of the State. A few
 have risen to responsible positions in the civil service,
 generally in the Arab departments of government ministries.
 Despite some governmental and private efforts to bridge the
 gap, there is little social interaction between Israeli Arabs
 and Israeli Jews, and Israeli Arabs tend to feel estranged
 from the mainstream of Israeli society and political life.
 They are disadvantaged in their access to, and the quality of,
 education, housing, and other services, and are discriminated
 against in such areas as employment and appointment to
 governmgnt positions. Government grants to Arab local
 councils represent a smaller percentage of the budgets of
 these bodies than is the case for government grants to Jewish
 municipalities. In 1987 Arab local councils held several
 short work stoppages and organized a 1-day general strike to
 protest the lack of budget parity.
 While Arabs make up about 16 percent of the population of
 Israel, less than 2 percent of senior government positions are
 held by Arabs, less than 3 percent of Israeli judges are
 Arabs, and no large bank, industrial enterprise, or
 agricultural undertaking in Israel is headed by an Israeli
 Arab. Only 3 percent of university.students and less than 1
 percent of the university academics are Israeli Arabs.
 
 
 1188
 
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Druze and Circassians are subject to Israel's military draft,
 and some Bedouin serve voluntarily in special units. Most
 Israeli Arabs do not wish to serve, however, and most of those
 who do wish to enlist are disqualified on security grounds.
 They therefore are not eligible for many economic and social
 benefits which require military service as a precondition.
 Nonveterans are particularly disadvantaged in seeking housing
 and new-household subsidies, and in applying for government
 employment and scholarships in the universities.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Legislati6n enacted in 1986 established the minimum wage at 45
 percent of the average salary as determined by the Central
 Bureau of Statistics. The Labor Ministry frequently uses
 provisions of the 1957 Collective Agreements Law to extend
 provisions of collective agreements to workers not covered by
 agreements. Public sector negotiations in 1987 lowered the
 maximum workweek to 45 hours for the public sector. Private
 sector negotiations moved toward a shorter workweek but remain
 at a legal maximum of 47 hours. Maximum legal work hours are
 8 hours per day, 45 hours per week. The Youth Labor Law of
 1955 prohibits the employment of children under the age of 15
 and regulates employment of youths unde{r the age of 18. The
 Labor Inspection Law of 1954 provides a labor inspection
 service to enforce health and safety standards in the
 workplace.
 Approximately 120,000 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza
 daily enter Israel legally for employment; they are not"
 allowed to remain overnight. There is also a large "gray
 market" for the labor of Palestinians from the occupied
 territories. Working conditions hnd wages, particularly for
 the gray market laborers, are often below Israeli legal
 standards.
 
 
 1189
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 In the course of the war of June 1967, Israel occupied the
 West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip
 and the Sinai Peninsula. As a result of the peace treaty
 between Egypt and Israel, the Sinai Peninsula was restored to
 Egypt. No peace treaty, however, has been concluded between
 Israel and its other neighboring countries. The West Bank and
 Gaza remain under military government. Israel unilaterally
 annexed East Jerusalem and regards the Golan Heights as
 subject to Israeli law, jurisdiction, and administration.
 The United States recognizes Israel as an occupying power in
 all of these territories and therefore considers Israeli
 administration to be subject to the Hague Regulations of 1907
 and the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention concerning the protection
 of civilian populations under military occupation.
 Israel denies the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention
 to the West Bank and Gaza, although it states that it observes
 many of the Convention's provisions in these areas. Israel
 enforces Jordanian law in the West Bank and British Mandate
 regulations in the Gaza Strip, although it has issued military
 orders significantly altering or overriding substantial
 portions of many of these laws.
 Since 1967 approximately 60,000 Israeli citizens have taken up
 residence in the West Bank and Gaza, most of them in suburban
 enclaves. Their presence has resulted in a dual system
 wherein Palestinians are subject to laws and regulations in
 effect before the 1967 war, as amended by Israeli military
 authorities, while Israeli residents are subject to laws and
 regulations applicable to Israeli nationals living in Israel.
 The complex human rights situation in the occupied territories
 arises from the absence of a peace settlement; the territories
 remain under military administration, and communal conflict
 continues between occupation authorities, Israeli settlers,
 and the Palestinian population. Among the signs of friction
 are active resistance to the occupation, including episodes of
 violence, sometimes encouraged by outside groups. Friction
 also arises from security measures taken by Israel to counter
 terrorism or other perceived threats to security. Other
 concerns include Israel's denial of residency rights to
 spouses and relatives of some residents and to those who try
 to return to the occupied territories following prolonged
 absences. Discontent is also caused by civilian Israeli
 settlers who are governed by different rules from those
 imposed on Palestinians, and who sometimes engage in violent
 activities against Palestinians. The advocacy by some Israeli
 political figures of annexation or permanent control of the
 territories, and the refusal of the main Palestinian
 organizations to recognize Israel or to accept a negotiated
 peace, further contribute to a complex situation.
 For many years, the situation in the occupied territories has
 fluctuated between periods of calm and periods of unrest, but
 tensions have been chronic and increasing, especially in the
 refugee camps and among younger Palestinians. Beginning in
 early December 1987, there were several weeks of violent
 confrontation, involving demonstrations and provocations by
 Palestinians and harsh reprisals by Israeli occupation
 authorities to restore security, which resulted in 22
 Palestinian deaths and numerous less serious casualties on
 both sides by the end of the calendar year.
 
 
 1190
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Israel implements its policy in the occupied territories
 through a Civil Administration created in 1981 under Defense,
 Ministry control and staffed by military and civilian
 personnel. Israel's national police, border police, internal
 security service (Shin Bet), and the Israel Defense Forces
 (IDF) all have roles in the Civil Administration. The
 national police,-which includes local Palestinians in its
 ranks, is seldom criticized by Palestinians for abuses, but is
 often castigated for its ineffective measures to'combat
 crime. There are frequent complaints by West Bankers and
 Gazans about the actions of the Border Police, IDF, and
 security services.
 The Civil Administration has sought to reshape local politics,
 notably by trying to reduce the influence of the Palestine -
 Liberation Organization (PLO) and other dissident Palestinian
 organizations. Israel has also discouraged political
 organizations'above the municipal level, and has transferred
 powers of Palestinian bodies to the Civil Administration.
 Authorities permitted municipal elections in 1972 and 1976,
 but postponed subsequent elections on security grounds, and
 removed many elected and appointed local officials. Threats
 by extremists have also inhibited the development of moderate.
 Palestinian leaders; even those who have expressed support for
 the PLO have been intimidated for cooperating with Israel or,
 at times, for even engaging in dialog with Israelis. Since
 1985, Israel has replaced several Israeli military appointees
 with non-PLO Palestinian mayors who have local and Jordanian
 support.' -
 Israel has allowed the establishment of four universities in
 the West Bank and one in Gaza,'but has restricted certain
 student and faculty activities which it believes threaten
 security. All five universities and many other schools were
 closed by the military government for varying periods in
 1987. Several students were killed in clashes with IDF
 soldiers during demonstrations at West Bank campuses.
 Israel permits criticism of its policies by the East
 Jerusalem-based Arabic press, but often censors articles or
 editorials and restricts circulation of Arabic publications in
 the West Bank and Gaza. Broad restrictions on free speech and
 assembly apply in the occupied territories.
 During 1987 there was a significant increase in violence and
 instability in the occupied territories, causing suffering to
 both Palestinian residents and Israeli settlers. With the
 exception of the major unrest at the end of 1987, PLO factions
 and various PLO dissident groups claimed responsibility for
 nearly all violent acts against the IDF, Israeli civilians, or
 Palestinians who disagreed with such groups. Yet, much of the
 violence appears to have been spontaneois or locally generated.
 Incidents of violence by Israeli settlers increased during the
 year, including the shooting death of one Palestibian youth,
 the use of'unabthorized armed patrols, physical harassment,
 disruptibn Of legally authorized political meetings, attacks
 on refugee camps, and running of IDF roadblocks. Occupation
 authorities stated they would take legal action against the
 settlers, and several were arrested. However, Palestinians
 assert that the authorities are generally lenient with Israeli
 settlers who violate security regulations.

 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killing is not condoned by Israel. However, there
 have been casualties as a result of both terrorist acts and
 Israeli security measures. In 1987, 42 Palestinians were
 killed and approximately 300 were wounded, of whom 22 were
 killed and approximately 150 were wounded in unrest in
 December, by the IDF or other Israeli security forces. The
 majority of the Palestinian casualties resulted from the use
 of lethal force by the IDF against demonstrations during which
 rocks, other objects, and sometimes Molotov cocktails were
 thrown at IDF soldiers. However, some of the Palestinian
 casualties were passers-by hit accidentally by IDF gunfire and
 others were unarmed persons fleeing from the IDF or running
 IDF roadblocks. An Israeli settler was arrested by the
 authorities and charged with killing a Palestinian in Gaza.
 Palestinians were believed responsible for the killing of 2
 IDF soldiers and 6 Israeli civilians in 1987, as well as the
 wounding of approximately 135 other Israeli soldiers and
 civilians.
 In some cases, Israeli military authorities have prosecuted or
 taken administrative action against IDF soldiers who have
 fired on unarmed Palestinians. However, Palestinians have
 charged that punishment of IDF personnel is often light or is
 suspended.
 b. Disappearance
 Israeli authorities neither sponsor nor condone disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by Israeli law, and Israeli authorities
 state that they do not condone torture.
 Palestinians and international human rights organizations
 complain of widespread and systematic mistreatment of
 prisoners. Amnesty International reports that confessions are
 extracted from suspects by severe interrogation and that
 security prisoners are subject to beatings, extended solitary
 confinement, hooding, and cold showers. Nearly all
 convictions in security cases are based on confessions.
 Attorneys are normally not allowed to see clients until after
 the suspects have confessed. The International Committee of
 the Red Cross is also denied access to prisoners for a
 prescribed period, resulting in frequent charges of physical
 mistreatment that are difficult to corroborate or disprove.
 Most interrogations are carried out by the General Security
 Service (Shin Bet). In 1987 a special judicial commission
 headed by former Israeli Supreme Court President Moshe Landau
 issued a report on Shin Bet practices since 1971. The
 commission found that Shin Bet officials for many years had
 used physical and psychological pressure to obtain
 confessions, and that they had routinely perjured themselves
 by denying in court that such mistreatment had occurred.
 
 
 1192
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 In September a report was published by an Israeli Arab
 Anglican priest and two Americans about children in Israeli
 prisons, providing details of alleged mistreatment of persons
 under 18 years of age. The report described 16 cases of minors
 whose experiences, while being held in Shin Bet interrogation
 centers, were said to reveal a pattern of abuse of Palestinian
 children by the IDF. The General Security Service, which
 conducts most interrogations, did not comment on the report.
 In October, five guards from the "Ansar II" military prison in
 Gaza were convicted of mistreating juvenile prisoners. In
 November, General Amram Mitzna, Officer in Charge of the IDF
 Central Command, announced that the commander and most of the
 staff of the FARA military prison in the West Bank had been
 dismissed and replaced by more professional military police.
 He also announced that new regulations had been adopted for
 the detention and treatment of juvenile prisoners. Among the
 new regulations are provisions requiring approval of the Legal
 Adviser for the Occupied Territories before arresting anyone
 under 14 years of age, "to ensure that children are not
 imprisoned without sufficient reason." New procedures were to
 be instituted "to enable better control over how children aged
 12 to 14 are treated in prison."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Persons arrested for common crimes in the occupied territories
 are usually provided the opportunity for bail, access to an
 attorney, and a clear statement of charges, although these
 rights are sometimes delayed. Individuals may be held in
 custody without formal charges for up to 18 days. The normal
 detention period after charges are filed is 60 days before
 trial. This can be extended indefinitely by a Supreme Court
 judge for 3-month periods.
 Persons held for security reasons are not allowed bail and
 initially are denied access to counsel or other outside
 contact. Many Palestinians suspected of security offenses are
 arrested without warrants. Officials at times have declined
 to confirm detentions to consular officers who have inquired
 on behalf of nationals of their countries. Under Israeli law,
 denial of notification of arrest to third parties, including
 immediate family members, can be extended for up to 15 days.
 Many who are released without charges have claimed ignorance
 of the reasons for their detention; Security detainees are
 usually denied access to their attorneys for 18 days, and
 access may be denied indefinitely for security reasons or if
 officials believe granting access would impede the
 investigation.
 Palestinians are often detained, sometimes in sizable numbers,
 after terrorist incidents or demonstrations. Such detentions
 usually do not result in formal charges and are not prolonged.
 Persons a rested during demonstrations are tried in military
 courts onlsecurity grounds. Security forces commonly detain
 persons without prompt notification of their relatives and
 without the use of warrants.
 Israeli authorities often impose curfews or close off
 Palestinian areas on the basis that they are conducting
 investigations following security incidents. These actions
 disrupt the daily lives of the Palestinian inhabitants, who
 charge that the actions are a form of collective punishment.
 
 
 1193
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 The use of 6-month administrative detention and deportation
 continued in 1987, when 9 Palestinians were deported and over
 120 Palestinians were placed under administrative detention.
 The United States has stated that deportation is inconsistent
 with the Fourth Geneva Convention. Administrative detentions
 require confirmation by a military judge. The hearing is
 confidential and the detainee and counsel are routinely denied
 access to evidence cited as grounds for the detention, since
 judges usually determine that confidentiality of the evidence
 is required for security reasons. Such rulings can be
 challenged in Israells Supreme Court, which has yet to
 overturn any of these determinations.
 There is no forced labor in the occupied territories.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jordanian law, substantially modified by Israeli military
 orders, remains in force in the West Bank for most criminal
 and civil matters.' British Mandatory law, as modified by
 Israel, prevails in Gaza. The application of these laws,
 except in land acquisition and security cases, or where
 jurisdiction has been transferred by military order, has been
 left in the hands of an independen'Palestinian judiciary.
 Palestinian residents of the occupied territories accused of
 nonsecurity'offenses receive public'trials in local courts.
 Israeli law is applied in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.
 Palestinians accused of security offenses, which are not
 precisely defined under Israeli lw,' are uiormally tried in
 Israeli military courts and are defended by counsel. However,
 Israeli residents of th& occupied territories who are accused
 of security offenses are tried by the Israeli district court
 closest to their residence or the site of the offense. The
 Israeli district courts are stricter than military dourts
 regarding admissibility of evidence and general standards of
 judicial practice.
 Most military triais are public, except for 6ome cases
 involving serious security offenses, but many trials involvd
 the use of at least 6me secret evidence, which neither the
 accused nor his attorney can see. At the request of the
 defendant, the Supreme Court will review whether sufficient
 security grounds exist to keep the evidence secret. It
 appears that the Supreme Court has always upheld the use of
 secret evidence. Consular officers are normally able to
 attend court proceedings involving'foreign citizens.
 Palestinian minors are tried in the same courts and under the
 same rules as adults. Convictions in these courts are often
 based on confessions recorded in Hebrew, a language most
 residents of the occupied territories do not understand.
 Orders of the Civil Administration may be appealed to the
 Israeli Supreme Court. Nonjudicial administrative orders of
 the military government may be appealed to area military
 commanders and the Supreme Court. Military court verdicts are
 not appealable, except on broadly interpreted procedural
 grounds to the Supreme Court, although the area commander may
 exercise the right of commutation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Coriespondence
 Under occupation regulations, military authorities may enter
 private homes and institutions without prior judicial approval
 
 
 1194
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 in pursuit of security objectives. An existing military
 order, for example, permits soldiers to search persons or
 premises on the West Bank without warrant on the suspicion
 that a person or organization may.possess a proscribed
 publication.
 In the West Bank and Gaza during 1987, at least 6 Arab houses
 were demolished and 13 sealed after their occupants or
 relatives of the occupants were accused of involvement in
 security incidents. Twenty-six individual rooms were also
 sealed. Such actions were usually taken before the suspects
 were tried.
 Most Palestinians and other observers believe that mail and
 telephone services in the West Bank and Gaza are monitored.
 Individuals are questioned on their political views by
 security officials. Such inquiries have in some cases
 involved overnight detention.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression is generally allowed, subject to
 restrictions imposed by the authorities on security grounds.
 Proscribed acts include displaying the Palestinian flag, its
 colors, or Palestinian nationalist slogans, and publicly
 expressing support for the PLO.
 The Arabic press, most of which is located in East Jerusalem,
 is outspokenly critical of Israeli policies and actions.
 Stories about .arrests,-prison sentences, land seizures, and
 other coptroversial topics are generally reported, but
 editorials and articles are often censored in whole or in
 part. All items in Jerusalem's Arabic press must be submitted
 to the censqr for prior review, and at least 20 editorials and
 commentaries were censored in 1987. Several Palestinian
 journalists were interrogated about allegedly inflammatory
 articles or for failing to submit articles to the censors.
 The censor also prevented East Jerusalem Arabicpapers from
 printing stories about alleged Israeli torture of Palestinian
 prisoners until Israeli papers ran the story. Hebrew papers
 need submit only articles on military security matters to the
 censors. Censorship decisions may be appealed to the chief
 censor.
 Materials licensed to be published in East Jerusalem are free
 to circulate throughout Jerusalem but need a further license
 for distribution in the West Bank and Gaza. In 1987 two
 newspapers were denied the right to distribute for 2 weeks for
 failing to nubmit material to the censors. Military orders
 also forbid the printing or publishing of politically
 significant material without a license. Political
 significance is not defined in the orders. During 1987
 Israeli authorities closed one Jerusalem press agency for 6
 months and one West Bank agency for 2 years. Another West
 Bank publishing company was closed for 6 months.
 A permit is required for publications imported into the
 occupied territories. Arabic educational materials,
 periodicals, and books originating outside Israel are censored
 and may be banned for anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli content, or
 for encouraging Palestinian nationalism. In the past several
 years, the number of titles banned by Israel has declined
 significantly. Possession of banned materials by West Bank or
 
 
 1195
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Gaza Arabs is a criminal offense. Usually, however, possession
 of illegal publications is one of a series of charges levied
 against persons accused of security offenses.
 At some point in 1987, Israeli authorities closed every
 university, as well as a number of vocational, secondary, and
 elementary schools, in the West Bank and Gaza on security
 grounds. The schools were closed for periods ranging from 1
 day to 4 months, and some were subject to repeated closures.
 Military authorities also accused some Palestinian students of
 being agitators and expelled them from the occupied territories
 in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
 The Hakawati Theatre in East Jerusalem, a Palestinian
 nationalist ensemble, was closed 6 times for periods of 12 to
 24 hours to prevent the staging of plays deemed harmful to
 Israeli security. Arabic-language radio and television
 programs from Jordan, Syria, and other Arab countries,
 including broadcasts of the Voice of Palestine, are received
 in the occupied territories without interference. Foreign
 journalists have not reported difficulties in meeting
 inhabitants of the occupied territories, although one foreign
 journalist was briefly detained in 1987 after interviewing an
 IDF soldier in uniform. As with reports by the local Arabic
 press, all reports filed by the foreign press are subject to
 military censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Professional, labor, and fraternal groups are active and often
 take public stands on political issues. Political parties and
 other groups viewed as primarily political are not permitted.
 Public gatherings of more than 10 people require permission,
 which is often withheld from both Palestinian and Israeli
 groups on grounds of public order.
 There are approximately 40 labor unions in the occupied
 territories, grouped into 2 rival federations. Since the
 beginning of the occupation, 15 new labor unions have been
 permitted to register in the West Bank, but over 100
 applications have been turned down, and several Arab unions
 have been disbanded by Israeli authorities because of asserted
 security concerns. During 1987 Israeli authorities closed
 down three labor union offices in the West Bank. The Young
 Men's Muslim Association in Hizma Village was closed for 6
 months, and Women's Day celebrations were banned in Qalqilya.
 West Bank unions are generally small and confined to urban
 workers in skilled craft trades. Israeli authorities must
 approve all candidates for union positions, but subsequent
 elections are held without interference. Strikes are legal,
 except when conducted for political reasons.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religious practice exists in the occupied
 territories. No group or sect is banned on religious grounds.
 Muslim and Christian holy days are observed without hindrance,
 and Muslims and Christians operate a variety of private schools
 and institutions. There has been no reported interference with
 the publication or distribution of religious publications.
 Israel protects Muslim and Christian holy places and assures
 freedom of access to them. On occasion, the authorities have
 
 
 1196
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 denied both Arab and Jewish groups access to certain religious
 sites on religious or security grounds.
 Israel facilitates travel into Jotdan for Muslim pilgrims to
 Mecca by expediting bridge clearance procedures and extending
 the hours of operation of the bridges. In 1987 several
 thousand pilgrims from the occupied territories made the hajj.
 However, 20 were reportedly refused permission on security
 grounds.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is generally unrestricted for Arabs within
 the occupied territories, but some restrictions exist.
 Approximately 100,000 Palestinians travel daily to Israel to
 work. All residents over 16 must carry identity documents and
 show them to security officials if requested. Arab vehicles
 are often stopped for security checks, sometimes by Israeli
 settlers at unauthorized roadblocks. Palestinians residing in
 the occupied territories need permits to remain overnight in
 Israel or East Jerusalem; West Bankers and Gazans are
 generally forbidden to remain in East Jerusalem after
 midnight, but the rule is not always rigorously enforced.
 Following violent incidents, curfews lasting several hours to
 a day are often imposed in the surrounding area. At least 10
 West Bank towns and 5 refugee camps were placed under curfew
 at least once during 1987. The Deheisheh and Balata camps were
 under curfew more than 10 times. Israeli authorities justify
 curfews as security measures, but Palestinians often perceive
 these restrictions as a form of collective punishment.
 In 1987 over 100 Palestinians were placed under new or renewed
 orders restricting them to their towns for 3 months or more.
 Such orders do not require formal charges and are made by
 regional military commanders without judicial review. Many of
 those affected were political activists, outspoken critics of
 Israeli policies, or PLO supporters.
 Most inhabitants of the occupied territories are permitted to
 travel abroad, and many thousands do so each year. Exit visas
 are required. Many residents of the West Bank are Jordanian
 citizens and use Jordanian passports for travel to or through
 Jordan. Israel issues laissez-passers to residents of the
 occupied territories to facilitate foreign travel from ports
 and airports in Israel. In some of these cases, restrictions
 are imposed on reentry. Travel bans are also imposed on some
 persons suspected of, but not charged with, antioccupation
 activities.
 Israeli security forces have banned travel by Palestinian
 residents of certain areas and some bans have lasted for more
 than 2 months. Travel bans were imposed on at least 10 West
 Bank towns and villages in 1987. Two-way travel between the
 West Bank and Jordan is permitted, and all members of the
 Jordanian Parliament resident in the West Bank were allowed to
 travbl freely to attend parliamentary sessions. Israeli
 authorities justify travel bans as security measures, but
 Palestinians often perceive these restrictions as a form of
 collective punishment.
 There are no obstacles to emigration. Israel sometimes
 refuses to renew the laissez-passers of West Bank residents
 who study or work abroad, on the ground that they have
 
 
 1197
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 abandoned their residence, even though they may not have
 acquired foreign citizenship. Those who have acquired foreign
 citizenship are ordinarily not allowed to resume residence in
 the West Bank. Persons subject to these restrictions are
 permitted to return to the West Bank as tourists only, and are
 sometimes refused entry entirely. Entry or residency
 permission is frequently denied to spouses, relatives, and
 children, following the emigration of the head of their
 household. Israel also has not permitted the return of many
 former West Bank residents who were not present in the
 territories, for whatever reason, at the time of a 1967 census
 conducted several months after the June war.
 Persons who marry residents of the occupied territories do not
 have the right to take up residency in the occupied
 territories. The majority of those wishing to join their
 families in such cases are refused permission to do so.
 Israel states that such requests are granted for humanitarian
 reasons. However, Palestinians assert that there are over
 10,000 family reunification requests pending, many of them for
 several family members. Israel permitted approximately 1,400
 persons to rejoin Palestinian families in 1987.
 Gazans normally do not need prior approval for travel to the
 West Bank. Under special arrangements concluded between
 Israel and Egypt, thousands of Gazans regularly cross into
 Egypt, particularly to work or visit relatives in the divided
 city of Rafah. Israel permits Golan Heights Druze to return
 after attending school in Syria; it has not, however,
 permitted the return of other Syrians who fled or were
 expelled from the area during and after the 1967 war.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There is no self-government in the territories above the
 municipal level. Palestinians are not represented on the
 Higher Planning Council, the main regional body in charge of
 physical planning. At the municipal level, Arab civil
 servants, institutions, and municipal officials operate under
 the Civil Administration. Most villages retain their
 traditional leadership. No Palestinian political parties or
 overtly political organizations are permitted.
 Municipal elections were last held in 1976. A few elected
 mayors have continued to hold office. Others were dismissed
 and replaced by Israeli officials. In October 1986, Arab
 mayors were appointed to replace Israeli officials in
 Ramallah, El-Bireh, and Hebron. With these appointments, all
 West Bank municipalities now have Arab mayors. Bethlehem and
 Tulkarem are the only major towns governed by elected Arab
 mayors. Arab residents of East Jerusalem are permitted and
 encouraged to vote in Jerusalem municipal elections.
 Approximately 20 percent did so in the 1983 elections.
 Most Palestinian residents of the West Bank are Jordanian
 citizens and as such are represented by 2 senators and 30
 members of the Jordanian Parliament. Although Jordan has held
 elections to fill vacant seats in Parliament, Israel has not
 permitted similar elections in the West Bank since 1967.
 
 
 1198
 
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Many local groups, both Israeli and Palestinian, are concerned
 with human rights issues. Publications qnd statements from
 these groups are allowed to circulate in the occupied
 territories. Arab and Israeli human rights groups continued
 to increase their coordination during 1987.
 Israel normally permits international human rights groups to
 visit the occupied territories and does not interfere with
 their investigations. However, one member of Law in the
 Service of Man, the main West Bank human rights group, was put
 under idministrative arrest on security grounds in 1987. The
 military censor also prohibited the group from publishing
 requests for students who had been arrested to contact the
 organization about their situation.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza are subject to
 pre-occupation Jordanian law as amended by laws and
 regulations of the Israeli military authorities. Jewish
 settlers residing in these areas, however, are subject to the
 same Israeli law, jurisdiction, and administration as applied
 to Israeli nationals residing in Israel. Under this dual
 system, on a broad range of issues, including the right to due
 process, the acquisition and loss of residency, freedom of
 movement, land use, and access to social services,
 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are usually treated
 less favorably than Jewish settlers in the same areas. In
 addition, Jewish settlers involved in security violations have
 generally been treated more leniently by Israeli security
 personnel than Palestinians involved in similar incidents.
 Israel has declared that Israeli law applies to all
 inhabitants of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.
 The use of land by Israeli authorities for military purposes,
 road projects, Israeli settlements, and other purposes which
 restrict access, significantly affects the lives and economic
 activities of Palestinians. Palestinians are excluded from
 the Higher Planning Council, which draws up plans for land use
 in the occupied territories, and exercises certain powers
 transferred from local municipal and village councils in
 1971. Government planning bodies, military officials, and
 Israeli settlers are represented on the Council.
 The authorities have discriminated against the Palestinian
 population in the use of a substantial portion of the land in
 the occupied territories which is under government control.
 Approximately 5 percent of the land to which Palestinian
 access has been restricted has been turned over to Jewish
 Israeli ndtionals for residential, agricultural, or industrial
 use.
 The Government of Israel funds basic services for
 Palestinians, primarily from tax revenues generated in the
 occupied territories. However, Israeli settlements also
 receive large annual subsidies from the Government, and
 individual Israelis may receive inducements to take up
 residence in the occupied territories. Palestinians do not
 receive such assistance.
 
 
 1199
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Palestinians returning from Jordan, as well as other Arabs and
 persons of Arab descent, regardless of citizenship, are subject
 to extensive searches, and many complain of unnecessarily harsh
 or humiliating treatment and harassment.
 The West Bank is served by four universities, one college, one
 community college, and a variety of other educational
 institutions, all established or upgraded since the beginning
 of the Israeli occupation. None of the universities receives
 financial support or other assistance from the occupation'
 authorities. Palestinian teachers in the occupied territories
 must receive certificates from the Israeli authorities, the
 issuance of which is based on security and political criteria
 as well as professional competence.
 The Israeli-occupied portion of the Golan Heights consists of
 1,295 square kilometers, and has an Arab population of about
 15,000, mostly Druze and a small percentage of Alawites.
 Approximately 7,500 Israeli settlers live in some 32
 settlements in the Golan Heights. Druze village councils have
 complained that they do not receive sufficient funding to
 provide minimal municipal services, and a third of the
 estimated 4,000 school children are reported to be studying in
 substandard classrooms.
 There are no legal or administrative prohibitions on the
 employment of women in the occupied territories, although
 traditional cultural mores and family commitments restrict
 most to homemaking. Most Palestinian women holding jobs
 outside their homes reside and work in urban areas.
 Employment of women is concentrated in service industries,
 education, and health services, with a small number working in
 journalism, law, and other professions.
 Although women legally have equal access to public education,
 custom and family pressures limit the number of women in West
 Bank schools. Even so, female school enrollment is quite high
 by Middle Eastern standards. A little over 45 percent of the
 primary and secondary school students are female. While female
 enrollment at the postsecondary level varies from 30 to 45
 percent at coeducational colleges and universities, a number
 of West Bank teacher and vocational training centers are all
 male or all female.
 There is a wide range of women's cooperative groups for health
 care, child care, handicraft production, vocational training,
 and other services. The Society for the Preservation of the
 Family is active throughout the West Bank in supporting
 women's needs.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Working conditions in the West Bank are governed by the
 Jordanian Labor- Law of 1960, which allows a maximum workweek
 of 48 hours, except for certain hotel, food service, and
 cinema employees, whose workweek is 54 hours. There is no
 minimum wage provision. Child labor is not permitted.
 Histadrut, the Israeli National Labor Organization, has taken
 steps to assure that working conditions for Golan Druze and
 residents of East Jerusalem are comparable to those of
 Israelis.
