 FINLAND
 
 Finland is a parliamentary democracy and supports broad
 international human rights objectives, publicly and
 privately. Finland is a signatory of the United
 Nations Convention on Refugees, the Covenant on Eco-
 nomic, Social and Cultural Affairs, and the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
 With respect to the latter, the United Nations Human
 Rights Committee has noted certain structural
 differences between the Finnish legal system and that
 envisaged by the Covenant. Finland made several
 reservations in connection with its ratification of
 the Covenant. The Government of Finland plans to
 bring the legislation into greater conformity with the
 Covenant and to withdraw some of its reservations.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and re-
 spected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is guaranteed by law
 (451)
 
 
 452
 and respected in practice. Finnish law also allows
 that persons accused of certain crimes, such as es-
 pionage, may be tried in secret. This provision is
 rarely employed. When it is, all basic rights
 enjoyed in open trials are scrupulously observed.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 In the field of social justice, Finland's record is
 excellent. The Government is committed to economic
 policies aimed at maximizing employment opportunities
 and the fairest possible distribution of income. A
 comprehensive social welfare policy includes provisions
 for health and medical services, welfare services,
 various family benefits, and disability and unemploy-
 ment insurance.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is full freedom of movement, foreign travel and
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 All other civil and political liberties are respected
 and protected under Finnish law. Basic human rights
 are guaranteed in Chapter II of the Finnish Constitu-
 tion of 1919. Labor is free to organize and the labor
 
 
 453
 movement is well developed and politically influential.
 There are Finnish statutes which, on their face, are
 not wholly consistent with Finland's general position
 of strong commitment to human rights. For example, a
 1948 statute provides a maximum of two years' impri-
 sonment for persons who intentionally and publicly
 defame a foreign state and thereby jeopardize Finland's
 relations with that state. This law, however, has
 never been used.
 Freedom House characterized Finland as "free" in 1977
 with regard to political rights and civil liberties.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Department of State knows of no requests for out-
 side investigation of the human rights situation in
 Finland. For ten years there has been a Finnish
 chapter of Amnesty International, which now has some
 500 members.
