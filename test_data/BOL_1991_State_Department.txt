 BOLIVIA
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president and
 bicameral legislature. Because no presidential candidate
 received an absolute majority of the popular vote in the
 elections of May 7, 1989, the Congress, in a procedure mandated
 by the Constitution, selected Jaime Paz Zamora to succeed
 Victor Paz Estenssoro as President. Government and opposition
 parties agreed in June 1991 to major reforms of the electoral
 and judicial sectors, one result of which was the establishment
 of an impartial electoral court.
 Police security forces and the military are responsible to and
 controlled by the civilian Government. Some members of the
 security forces, however, were involved in human rights abuses.
 Bolivia is rich in minerals, which account for the bulk of its
 export earnings, but is the second poorest country in the
 Western Hemisphere. Its economy only began to show consistent
 growth in 1987-88 after years of severe contraction. The
 Government has emphasized debt reduction, export development,
 foreign investment, and a freer banking system to strengthen
 Bolivia's economic base and accelerate development. There was
 very modest economic growth in 1990--an estimated 2.6 percent,
 only slightly more than population growth.
 Human rights are provided for by the Constitution and are
 generally respected in practice. Human rights abuses in 1991
 included instances of mistreatment of detainees and prisoners,
 substandard prison conditions, an overburdened and sometimes
 corrupt judicial system, prolonged incarceration of detainees,
 societal discrimination and violence against women, and
 discrimination against indigenous people.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN- RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no cases of political or other extrajudicial
 killings in 1991 by government or terrorist groups.
 Following the extrajudicial execution of alleged Peruvian
 terrorist Evaristo Salazar ("Alejandro Escobar"Y on December 5,
 1990, two members of the Bolivian National Police (BNP) were
 charged with negligent homicide and coercion (the use of undue
 force in interrogation), and were dismissed from the police.
 The Government brought criminal charges against the policemen
 and detained them. The judge entered a preliminary ruling of
 guilty. The policemen had claimed that Salazar was shot while
 trying to escape, but the coroner's finding of death by gunfire
 at close range did not corroborate this. The policemen were
 not subject to first-degree murder charges because their
 lawyers.made a convincing case that Salazar was a violent
 terrorist who had threatened the policemen and their families.
 The Permanent Assembly of Human Rights of Bolivia (APDHB),
 argued that the policemen should have faced more serious
 charges because Salazar was killed deliberately.
 On October 11, a court convicted five members of the Armed
 Forces of Liberation-Zarate Willka on charges of conspiracy for
 the 1989 murder of two American Mormon missionaries. Three
 others charged in this case remain at large. Juan Domingo
 Peralta Espinosa, another terrorist connected to the murder,
 
 
 507
 BOLIVIA
 was killed after he fired at policemen during an attempted
 arrest. The ensuing investigation determined that the police
 responded to probable cause and reacted with appropriate force.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known politically motivated disappearances during
 1991.
 Judicial proceedings in the case of General Garcia Meza, who is
 being tried in absentia for involvement in disappearances
 during 1981-82, have entered their fifth year. The trial is
 expected to conclude in, early 1992. The Association of
 Relatives of Those Disappeared and Martyred for Democracy  .
 (ASOFAMD) has 156 registered cases of persons who disappeared
 for political reasons, dating'back to the late 1960's. There
 are several legal proceedings involving cases from 1980 to
 1981, but there were no verdicts in any of these cases as of
 year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruiel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture. However, there have been
 allegations of torture, credible charges of cruelty, and
 degrading treatment of detainees and prisoners by police
 officers and prison personnel. Security personnel are rarely
 tried and punished for such acts. There were credible
 allegations that several terrorists were tortured in late 1990
 by members of army intelligence. However, the army rejected
 the allegations, and no other government element sought to
 investigate them-
 Conditions in some Bolivian jails are very poor. Overcrowding,
 corruption, malnutrition, unsanitary conditions,:and drug and
 alcohol abuse are common. In the San Pedro jail in La Paz,.
 which was constructed to hold no more than 200 inmates, there
 is a population of more than I.3M0. Overcrowding is so seyere
 that five persons may be confined to--a-small cell WitK the
 result that the occupants sleep sitting up because there is not
 enough space to lie down. Approximately 70 children of inmates
 reside at San Pedro because they have no place else to go, but
 they have not been charged with any crime. Some of these
 children may be sexually abused. The new Chonchocoro prison
 will open in 1992. However, the capacity is 300, so it will
 offer little relief to overcrowding at San Pedro,.
 Evidence surfaced in 1989 of serious human rights abuses over a
 period of years at the Espejos rehabilitation farm, in Santa
 Cruz Department. Los Espejos was one in a system of government
 rehabilitation farms for minor offenders. However, it had
 deteriorated into a forced labor camp run' for the financial
 gain of the police. In 1990 the Government closed Los
 Espejos. The ensuing investigation implicated 13 persons. Two
 are in San 'Pedro prison awaiting trial, and one is presumed to
 have died. The others are at large. There is no indication
 that the Espelos abuses are being repeated at other
 rehabilitation facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires a court order for an arrest, and
 detainees must be charged or released within 48 hours. In
 practice, many detainees remain incarcerated in excess of this
 period without being charged. The Constitution also provides
 
 
 508
 BOLIVIA
 for a judicial determination of the legality of detention, and
 prisoners are usually released if a judge rules that they have
 been detained illegally. After the initial detention,
 prisoners may consult a lawyer of their choice. Provisions for
 bail exist, except in certain narcotics cases, and bail is
 generally granted.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitutional right of a fair public trial is adhered to
 in most respects, but with one important exception, namely,
 delays commonly result in trials lasting 3 to 4 years without
 sentencing. As a result, about 80 percent of the prison
 population is unsentenced. Investigations, trials, and appeals
 procddures are so protracted that some prisoners eventually
 serve more time than the maximum sentence for the crime for
 which they are being charged.
 Defendants have the right to an attorney, to confront
 witnesses, to present evidence, and to appeal a judicial
 decision. These rights generally are upheld in practice.
 Although the law provides for a court-appointed defense
 attorney at public expense, if necessary, one may not always be
 provided because of a shortage of funds and qualified personnel.
 Corruption and intimidation in the judicial system remain a
 serious problem. Judges and prosecutors are paid very poorly,
 making them susceptible to bribery. Narcotics traffickers
 often bribe judicial and other officials to release suspected
 traffickers and their aircraft, return captured drugs, and
 purge incriminating files. The Government has taken some steps
 to try to discipline Bolivia's judicial system, establishing,
 for example, three-judge specialized narcotics courts.
 However, the courts established so far continue to be
 overburdened, with poorly qualified personnel and inadequate
 facilities. In May the Government appointed a special
 committee to prepare draft legislation to reform the judicial
 system and the Public Ministry. It was scheduled to conclude
 its findings toward the end of 1991.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens' lives are
 protected by the Constitution and are usually respected in
 practice. However, there have been incidents in which the
 police entered a home or business without obtaining a search
 warrant as required by the Constitution.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are no legal or institutional barriers to freedom of
 speech and the press in Bolivia. Many journalists are paid by
 politicians and other well-connected persons to increase or
 suppress exposure. Also, some journalists who experienced
 repression under former governments claim they still practice
 self-censorship. Both state-owned and private radio and
 television stations operate in Bolivia. All newspapers are
 privately owned.
 The Government has consistently respected academic freedom.
 Public universities enjoy autonomous status by law, and that
 status is respected.
 
 
 509
 BOLIVIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of peaceful assembly and association are provided
 for by law and are respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Citizens are free to practice the religion of their choice.
 Although an estimated 400 other religious groups, mostly
 Protestant, are active, Roman Catholicism predominates in
 Bolivia, and the Constitution recognizes it as the official
 religion. Catholic bishops receive a nominal stipend from the
 State. The Government has designated the Catholic Church as
 the coordinator of all official public ceremonies. Missionary
 groups--usually evangelical Christians--are required to
 register with the Foreign Ministry as nongovernmental
 organizations (NGO's). In 1991 all NGO's, including missionary
 groups, were required to reregister. There is no indication
 that missionary groups have been treated differently from other
 NGO's, and no registrations have been disapproved.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, andRepatriation
 There are no restrictions on travel within Bolivia or abroad.
 The Government does not impede emigration and guarantees
 departing citizens the right to return. Citizenship is not
 revoked for political reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right.of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with art elected president and
 a functioning, independent, bicameral legislature. Opposition
 groups ranging from the far left to the right function freely.
 In 1989 Bolivia held free and fair elections which resulted in
 a peaceful, constitutional change of administration on
 August 6, 1989. Equally successful municipal elections took
 place on December 1, 1991.
 In 1991 Congress began impeachment proceedings against several
 members of the Supreme Court following a court ruling that a
 law passed by Congress that increased the tax onr fees had been
 enacted incorrectly and, therefore, was unenforceable.
 President Paz Zamora refused to accept the ruling, arguing that
 the Court had usurped a legislative function. The Senate
 eventually suspended its trial of the justices, and'on May 16
 the Congress voted to- allow them to resume their places on the
 Court.
 Suffrage has been universal since the 1952 revolution. There
 are no legal impediments to women voting, holding political
 office, or rising to leadership in the government; a woman was
 President in 1979-80. Nevertheless, the number of women who
 have attained prominent positions in politics is still small.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human-Rights
 The Government is sensitive to the opinions of both domestic
 and international human rights organizations and is willing to
 discuss human rights concerns with them. The Congress has
 committees responsible for monitoring the observance of human
 rights. The Catholic Church, APDHB, labor organizations, and
 
 
 510
 BOLIVIA
 the press have been aggressive monitors of human rights and
 comment frequently on relevant issues and developments.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although the law contains a4 advanced family code passed in the
 1970's, Bolivian women do not enjoy a social status equal to
 that of men and are generally unaware of their rights under the
 law. Cultural traditions, social conditions, and limited
 political influence remain major obstacles to advancement for
 women. In rural families, women contribute significantly to
 economic activities and often control the family finances, but
 nonetheless they are considered socially and politically
 subordinate. In urban settings, women are slowly achieving a
 greater role in business and professional life, as their
 participation in cooperatives, community affairs, and education
 increases. In both rural and urban settings, women are more
 likely to be illiterate and employed in low-level or domestic
 jobs.
 There are no reliable or complete statistics indicating the
 extent of violence against women in Bolivia. However, many
 women and some women's rights groups have made credible charges
 that this is a serious problem. Violence against women is a
 criminal offense in Bolivia, and legal sanctions are regularly
 applied when cases come to the attention of the authorities.
 However, women are reluctant to bring charges in cases of
 domestic violence, and the incidence of such abuse as wife
 beating is underreported. Legal counseling is available for
 women on a limited basis through private organizations. An
 organization called the Center for Investigation and
 Development of Women (CIDEM) is working to change the penal
 code to further protect women from violence.
 Although prohibited by the Constitution, discrimination against
 people of indigenous background continues, a fact all political
 leaders acknowledge. The Aymara- and Quechua-speaking Indian
 majority of the population remains at the lower end of the
 country's socioeconomic scale and is disadvantaged in terms of
 health, life expectancy, education, income, literacy, and
 employment. The Government's programs to ease Bolivia's
 economic crisis, including infrastructure projects sponsored by
 the social investment fund such as schools, health clinics, and
 water systems, directly benefit some of the disadvantaged.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Bolivian workers may establish and join organizations of their
 own choosing despite the existing Labor Code which, if
 enforced, would limit the right of association. The Labor Code
 requires previous authorization of the establishment of a trade
 union, restricts more than one union from establishing itself
 at a giveft enterprise, and allows the Government to dissolve
 trade unions by administrative act. However, the Government
 does not enforce these provisions of the law and has used none
 of these powers in recent history. The Labor Code also denies
 civil servants the right to organize and prohibits strikes in
 all public services, including banks and public markets.
 Nevertheless, virtually all government workers are unionized.
 
 
 511
 BOLIVIA
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts
 (COE) repeated in 1991 its previoius criticism of provisions of
 Bolivia's 50-year old Labor Code that would limit the right of
 association if they were enforced.
 Workers in the private sector possess and frequently exercise
 the right to strike. The ILO's COE has criticized the
 requirement in the Labor Code that strike votes require the
 approval of three-fourths of employees actually in service
 instead of a simple majority. Solidarity strikes are illegal,
 but the Government has never prosecuted those responsible for
 solidarity strikes. On January 8, for example, the transport
 workers called a 2-day strike to protest a government-decreed,
 35-percent rise in fuel prices. The Government settled by the
 end of the day, granting fare increases that compensated
 transport workers for the fuel price increase. A solidarity
 strike in support of the transport-workers called by the
 Bolivia Workers Central (COB) was not grounds for prosecution
 by the Government.
 Unions are not truly independent of the Government and
 political parties. All unions are underfinanced and depend on
 outside support from varying sources. The political parties
 all have labor committees that attempt to influence union
 activity, but they have been only partially successful in
 recent years. The Government places no restrictions on a
 union's right to join international labor organizations. The
 COB became an affiliate of the Communist-dominated World
 Federation of Trade Unions in 1988.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Bolivian workers have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The law does not extend this right to government
 workers, but the distinction is largely.ignored in practice, as
 virtually all government workers are organized. Consultations
 between government representatives and labor leaders are common
 but there are no collective bargaining agreements as. the term
 is normally used. In state industries, the union issues'a list
 of demands, and the Government concedes some points. Wage and,
 working condition adjustments in the private sector track what
 happens in the civil service, public services, and state
 industrie6. Private sector employers normally use public
 sector settlements as guidelines for their own adjustments, and
 some private sector employers even exceed what the government
 grants. However, the Government, consciouT of International
 Monetary Fund guidelines, rarely grants wage increases that
 exceed the rate of inflation. As in the public sector, there
 is no real collective bargaining and no signed agreements.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against
 union members and organizers. Complaints are referred to the
 National Labor Court, which often takes a year or more to rule
 on a question. Labor activists say that a problem is often
 moot by the time the Court gives an answer.
 There are no export processing zones in Bolivia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and the law is
 generally complied with and enforced. No cases of forced or
 compulsory labor were reported during 1991.
 
 
 512
 BOLIVIA
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law prohibits the employment of persons under 18 years of
 age in dangerous, unhealthy, or -immoral work. Bolivia's Labor
 Code is ambiguous on the conditions of employment for minors
 from 14 through 17 years of age. Responsibility for enforcing
 child labor provisions lies with the National Office of Minors,
 which is part of the Government's Social Action Group for the
 Presidency. However, the existing legal provisions concerning
 employment of children are not enforced. Young children can be
 found on the streets hawking goods, shining shoes, and
 assisting transport operators. They are not generally employed
 in factories or businesses.
 le. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government, both by statute and presidential decree, has
 established a minimum wage and a system of bonuses and fringe
 benefits. A worker earning only the minimum wage would not be
 able to sustain a decent standard of living for himself, let
 alone support a family. However, most workers earn more than
 the minimum wage. Though the minimum wage is well below the
 prevailing wage in most occupations, the minimum wage-which
 was doubled in February--is significant because certain fringe
 benefits are pegged to it. Approximately 20 percent of the
 urban work force--street vendors, shoe polishers, and lottery
 ticket sellers, for example-are not covered by the minimum
 wage.
 In urban areas, only half the labor force enjoys an 8-hour
 workday and a workweek of 5 or 5-1/2 days. Like many other
 labor laws, the maximum legal workweek of 44 hours is not
 enforced.
 Responsibility for the protection of workers' health and safety
 lies with the Labor Ministry's Bureau of Occupational Safety.
 Labor laws that.provide for the protection of workers' health
 and safety are not adequately enforced. Although the
 state-owned mine corporation COMIBOL has a special office
 charged with mine safety, the mines, often old and operated
 with antiquated equipment, are particularly dangerous and
 unhealthy.
