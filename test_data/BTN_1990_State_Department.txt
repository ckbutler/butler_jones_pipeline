 BHUT.AN*
 The Wangchuck dynasty of hereditary monarchs has ruled Bhutan
 since 1907. Isolated in the Himalayas between India and
 Tibet, the small Kingdom has been able to escape domination by
 any external power since the 10th century. King Jigme Dorji
 Wangchuck (1952-72) took steps to move the Kingdom from
 centuries of medieval seclusion toward a more representative
 political system, a more productive economy, and ties with
 other countries. Although he retained strong executive
 powers, the King created several important institutions,
 including the National Assembly (1953), the Royal Advisory
 Council (1965), and the Council of Ministers (1968), to
 provide broader participation in the Government. Serfdom was
 abolished, land reform introduced, laws codified, and the
 judiciary separated from the executive. There is no written
 constitution or bill of rights. The present monarch, Jigme
 Singye Wangchuck, on the throne since 1974, has continued
 Bhutan's social and political evolution, although progress has
 been seriously handicapped by the Kingdom's limited
 administrative capacity and resources. The ruling Drukpas are
 Buddhists of Tibetan origin; at least a third of the
 population, mostly from the southern districts, is of Nepali
 Hindu ethnic origin.
 Internal security is maintained by the Royal Bhutan Police.
 It is assisted in this function by the Royal Bhutan Army,
 which consists of 8,000 lightly armed men.
 Bhutan remains, at least in terms of national income
 statistics, the poorest country in South Asia, with a
 per capita income half that of India. This figure is
 deceptive, however, since the largely rural population grows
 much of its own food and the ratio of man to land is the
 lowest in South Asia. The large majority of the population is
 iliterate and rural, living on subsistence agriculture and
 pastoral pursuits in a largely barter economy. In March 1990,
 the Governments of India and Bhutan signed a new trade and
 transit treaty even more favorable to Bhutan than the previous
 one. Bhutan continues to restrict access by the outside world
 in the hope of minimizing the spread of foreign influences.
 The number of tourists is limited strictly to 3,000 a year.
 The human rights situation in Bhutan in 1990 showed some
 deterioration. The Government's concern about the dangers of
 ethnic strife led it to take steps to quell a movement of
 ethnic Nepali Bhutanese who were calling for the end of
 discrimination against them and exemption from the policy of
 "driglam namzha" (revival of Bhutanese traditional culture)
 started in 1989. This policy is aimed at ethnic integration
 and "Bhutanizing" the southern districts; it is perceived,
 however, as having a negative impact on the Nepali-origin
 minority. In Nepal and India, groups of ethnic Nepalese who
 had fled Bhutan formed protest movements, accusing the King of
 *Bhutan and the United States.have not exchanged diplomatic
 representatives,-and U.S. officials travel there
 infrequently. Since few scholars have published studies on
 the contemporary Bhutanese polity or society, information on
 Bhutanese practices which bear on human rights is neither
 readily available nor complete.

 "cultural suppression" and his Government of human rights
 Yiolations,-includinj the torture of prisoners. In September
 these groups brganized marches of seieral thousand people from
 India into Bhutan, where they clashed with the Bhutanese
 army:..-Both sides admitted that there were casualties, though
 they disagreed on the number (see Sectibn l.a.). Principal
 human rights problems include denial of the right of citizens
 to change their government, limitations on the right to a fair
 public trial; restrictions on freedoms of speech and press,
 peaceful~association and assembly; and worker rights; and,
 possibly arbitrary arrest'&nd detention.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 In September theNepali-origin Bhutan People's Party (BPP),
 made up of dissidents who fled Bhutan and based themselves in
 northern India, accused the Bhutanese army of.indiscriminately
 killing hundreds of protesters who marched from India into
 southern Bhutan. Bhutanese government officials admitted
 clashes took pladt, but claimed only two deaths resulted.
 -They charged that -the BPP is a terrorist organization, guilty
 of kidnaping, murder, and extortion. There has been no
 independent confirmation of these conflicting claims.
 b. DisapPearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. -Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 There were-no'confirmed reports of cruel, inhuman, or'
 degrading treatment or punishment, although the People's Forum
 for Human Rights (Bhutan) (PFHR), a "prodemocracy"
 organization of Nepali-origin-dissidents based in Nepal,
 informed the United Nations in March that a membdr of their
 organization, Man Bahadur Chhetry, had died in police
 custody. The Government said that Chhetry was under
 investigation for antinational activities by a committee
 headed by the Chief Justice of the High Court and including
 ethnic Nepalese members. Chhetry allegedly hanged-himself
 after confessing to antinational offenses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In November 1989, Tek Nath Rizal, a -ormer ethnic Nepali
 member of the-Bhutan National Assembly and founder of PFHR,
 was abducted from eastern Nepal, where he had fled after
 clashing with the Bhutanese Government over ethnic Nepali
 rights. His abductors, believed to be Bhutanese police, took
 Rizal to Thimpu, where he is now serving a prison sentence for
 conspiracy and treason. No information is available about his
 trial. Forty-two people were also arrested at the end of 1989
 in the Samchi district on charges of treason and antinational
 activities. Thirty-nine have been released and granted
 unconditional amnesty. Three remain in detention and are
 liable, as is Rizal, to capital punishment for their alleged
 crimes under the country's laws, according- to Kuensel, the
 official weekly newspaper.
 
 
 1403
 BHUTAN
 As far as is known, exile is not used as a form of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated
 under an 18th century legal code which was revised in 1957 and
 which applies to all Bhutanese regardless of ethnic origin.
 Judges appointed by and accountable to the King are responsible
 for all aspects of a case, including investigation, filing of
 charges, prosecution, and judgment of the defendant. The
 judicial system consists of local, district, and national
 courts. Appeals to higher courts are permitted, and final
 appeals may be made to the King. The legal system does not
 provide for jury trials or the right to a court-appointed
 defense attorney. Prosecuting and defense attorneys are
 generally not available because the number of lawyers in the
 country is insufficient to serve in these capacities.
 Questions of family law, such as marriage, divorce, and
 adoption, are resolved separately according to the traditional
 Buddhist law for the majority of Bhutanese and Hindu law in
 areas where persons of Nepali origin predominate.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There are no written guarantees of privacy, but cultural
 tradition is highly respectful of personal privacy. At the
 same time, the Government places great emphasis on promoting
 national integration. For example, in 1989, by royal decree,
 the wearing of Drupka national dres- was made compulsory for
 all citizens. Anyone found vioIating the- decree may be fined
 about $10 or sentenced to jail for a week. From all reports,.
 there is a degree of tolerance for noncompliance in urban
 areas, but in other parts, particularly in the south, officials
 appear to enforce the-decree more rigorously.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including-:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With an adult literacy rate of around 12 percent, Bhutan's
 population is relatively unaffected by the print media. The
 Government's weekly newspaper Kuensel is the country's only
 regular publication. Indian and other foreign newspapers and
 publications are distributed without apparent government
 control. Bhutan has no television. Last year, the Government
 ordered the- dismantling of all television 'antennas- to prevent
 the people from watching programs originating outside Bhutan.
 The government radio station broadcasts for 3 hours daily in
 the four major national- languages. Criticism of the King is
 permitted in the National Assembly but not in the public media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No written guarantees of these freedoms exist. Bhutanese may
 engage in peaceful assembly and association for purposes
 approved by the Government. However, political parties are
 discouraged, and there are no private voluntary social,
 communal, or economic associations and no professional or trade
 organizations.
 c; Freedom of Religion
 Buddhism is the state religion of Bhutan. The Government
 subsidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about
 
 
 1404
 
 BHUTAN
 half of-the Kingdom's'12,000 monks. The monastic establishment
 enjoys statutory representation in the National Assembly and
 Royal Advisory Council and is an influential voice on public
 policy. Citizens of Qther faiths, largely Hindus, enjoy
 fredom .of-owor~hip~but may not proselytize-(under Bhutanese
 law, conversions are illegal). The King has declared.major
 Hindu festivals'to be national holidays, and the royal family
 participates in them. Foreign missionaries are not permitted
 to'prbselytize in'the Kingdom, nor were there any resident in
 Bhutan'ir 1990..
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 � Travel, Eniigration, and-Repatriation.
 There is 'freedom of movement within Bhutan for all Bhutanese
 citizens and nobar-on'emiratiori or foreign travel. For many
 years, Bhutanese'traveled little inside or outside the Kingdom,
 but the recent construction of roads and the establishment of
 air rinks with New Delhi, Calcutta, Dhaka, and Kathmandu have
 encouraged travel. Bhutan's southern border with India is
 open, and there is free movement across this border of people
 residing in the immediate areas. Indians from other regions
 who enter Bhutan by airplane or stay in hotels.-must have visas
 and fall under the overall limitation of 3,000 tourists per
 year.
 Since1986, Bhutan has been conducting a drive to identify
 people With6ut w6rk permits. In.this process, about 10,000
 foreign'ers*Ifave been expelled from the Kingdom, mostly
 Nepalee. AlSo, the number of establishments run by Indian
 nationals in Bhutan is gradually declining with the termination
 of their trading licenses.
 Bhutan traditionally has welcomed refugees and exiles from
 other countries in the region. However, doubts about the
 loyalty to Bhutan of Tibetan refugees prompted the Government
 to require that they accept Bhutanese citizenship or face
 expulsion. Many sought refuge in India. Tibetans who accepted
 Bhutanese citizenship have been assured by the Government that
 they willbe free to return to their homeland. It is .
 government policy now not to accept new refugees from-Tibet.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The citizens of Bhutan do not have the right .to change their
 government. Bhutan is a traditional monarchy, with sovereign
 power vested in the King. It is a highly elitist system, with
 decisionmaking centered in the palace and involving only a
 small number of officials in the civil and religious
 establishment. Although the present King and his father have
 endeavored to integrate women and southerners (Nepali ethnics)
 into the body politic, the system is still dominated by the
 male members of an aristocracy of Tibetan Buddhist ancestry.
 Political parties do not exist, and their formation is
 discouraged. Ethnic Nepalese who fled to India have formed the
 Bhutan People's Party (BPP) there. The BPP claims support in
 the predominantly Nepali southern regions of Bhutan, but there
 are no reliable reports on the party's actual numbers.
 The 150-member National Assembly is composed of 105 members
 elected by limited franchise (heads of family in Hindu areas,
 village headmen in Buddhist regions), 12 elected by the
 monastic establishment, and 33 high-level officials of the
 government administration appointed by the King. Its principal
 
 
 1405
 BHUTAN
 functions are to enact laws, approve senior appointments in the
 Government, and advise the King on matters of national
 importance. It also provides a forum for presenting grievances
 and rectifying cases of maladministration. Voting is by secret
 ballot, with a simple majority needed to pass a measure.
 The King cannot formally veto legislation passed by the
 Assembly, but he can refer bills back to it for further
 consideration. The Assembly occasionally has rejected the
 King's recommendations or delayed their implementation, but the
 King has always had enough influence to persuade the Assembly
 to approve any legislation he considers essential or to
 withdraw any proposed legislation he opposes. Government
 officials may be questioned by the body, and ministers can be
 forced to resign by a two-thirds vote of no confidence.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international agency or group is known to have sought entry
 into Bhutan to investigate human rights conditions. No,
 nongovernmental human rights groups are known to exist in
 Bhutan. The PFHR, representing Nepali-origin dissident
 opposition (see Section l.c.1, operates from Nepal. In its
 1990 Report, covering 1989, Amnesty International noted that it
 had expressed its concern to the Bhutanese Government about the
 arrest of a Bhutanese teacher for writing and distributing
 literature on minority rights. The Government responded that
 he had been arrested not solely for his writings but also for
 "antinational activities."
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Potentially the most divisive issue in Bhutan is how to
 accommodate the growing segment, estimated-to be at least a
 third of the population, of Nepali Hindu origin. The country's.
 Buddhist majority has long been concerned about being
 outnumbered by immigrants from Nepal, as occurred in
 neighboring Sikkim. In the past, the Government responded to'
 this concern by tightly limiting immigration and restricting
 residence and employment of the Nepali population to the
 southern part of the country. The Government liberalized
 certain policies toward the Nepali minority by encouraging
 intermarriage, educating some students in regions other than
 their own, and giving priority to economic development of the
 south. In the last decade, the King allocated 2,500 acres of
 land to 1,000 landless households in southern Bhutan, and about
 200 farmers and orange growers have been given special loans,
 according to Bhutanese government sources- By law, southerners
 may own land and establish business in the north, and
 northerners have the same right in the south. Nonetheless it
 is reportedly still difficult for non-Buddhist Bhutanese
 (except government officials) to buy property in Buddhist areas.
 More young Bhutanese of Nepali origin are entering public
 economic and administrative bodies, and laws concerning land
 tenure and taxation in the south are being liberalized.
 Although the language of instruction is English, there is a
 requirement that Dzongkha, the language of the western
 highlands, be taught in all schools, and this requirement is
 saia to disadvantage students from other areas. In addition,
 instruction in Nepali has been terminated throughout the
 country. Nepali protests against "cultural discrimination,"
 
 
 1406
 BHUTAN
 organized by groups based in Nepal and India, gathered force as
 the year progressed. Encouraged by the success of the
 democracy movement in Nepal, protesters increasingly called for
 democratic reforms in Bhutan as-well. -The size of these groups
 and the amount of support they attract-in southern Bhutan are
 not known. Families with ties to the palace and senior levels
 of the Goerninenlcre strongly favored in their access to state
 scholarships'for foreign education., Nevertheless, the King is
 makihga serious effort to send other qualified candidates for
 education overseas as well, drawing particularly from Bhutan's
 prestiliduLs civil"bureaucracy.
 In contrast with some of'its neighbors, Bhutaj has not
 developed either a rigid taste system or customs which
 sequester or disenfranchise women. Family land is divided
 equally between sons and daughters. Bhutanese traditionally
 place-gitls in a lower status than boys, however, and girls
 receive-fooref e'utrition and less medical attention than boys.
 Boys outnumber girls by about two to one in primary school and
 seven to one at secondary level. The Government is conscious
 of the disparity and has taken steps to encourage equal
 treatment-for girls and increased enrollment of girls at
 school. the disparity between the higher mortality rates of
 female versus male infants has resulted in an overall ratioof
 97.2 females per 100 males, one of the lowest in the world.
 The sexes mix relatively freely, marriages can be arranged by
 partners themselves as well as by their parents, and divorce is
 common. A man is allowed by law to have three wives, but
 polyandry is no longer sanctioned. Legislation has been
 enacted in recent years making marriage registration compulsory
 and favoring women in matters of alimony. About 10 percent of
 the persons employed by the various government ministries and
 departments are women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 - a. The Right of Association
 Trade unionism is not permitted and Bhutan has no labor
 unions.' Bhutan is not a member of the International Labor
 Organization. There are no export processing zones.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no collective bargaining or legislation addressing
 labor-related issues pertaining to the small industrial work
 force, which makes up less than 1 percent of the population.
 c. Proibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 As far as is known, there is no law prohibiting forced or
 compulsory labor, but it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There are no laws governing the employment of children.
 Children are not employed in the industrial sector, but many
 assist their families in the traditional economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 As noted above, there is no legislation addressing labor
 issues. There is no legislated minimum wage, standard
 workweek, or health and safety standards. Labor markets are
 
 
 1407
 BHUTAN
 highly segmented by region, and monitoring wage developments is
 inhibited by the preponderance of subsistence agriculture and
 the practice of barter. The largest salaried labor market is
 the government service, which has an administered wage
 structure last revised in 1988. The shortage of labor in
 Bhutan is such that the larger industrial firms, all of which
 were established relatively recently, are organized along
 modern lines and incorporate a considerable amount of
 labor-saving technology. No industrial plant employs more than
 60 to 70 workers. Apart from a few of these larger plants, the
 entire industrial sector consists of home-based handicrafts and
 some 60 privately owned small- or medium-scale factories
 producing consumer goods.
