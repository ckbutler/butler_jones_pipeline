UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND*
 The United Kingdom (UK) of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
 is a constitutional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary
 form of government selected in periodic, multiparty elections.
 As there is no written constitution, human rights are
 "residual," i.e., assumed unless limited by statute.
 Throughout the UK, public order is maintained by civilian
 police forces which are responsive to and controlled by
 elected officials. In Northern Ireland, because of terrorist
 violence, police of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) are
 supported by army units.
 The United Kingdom has a highly developed industrial economy.
 Persons may own property and pursue private economic interests.
 The Government provides comprehensive social welfare services.
 Terrorist bombings and killings carried out by the illegal
 Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) in Northern Ireland
 and Britain, and terrorist acts in Northern Ireland committed
 by Protestant paramilitary groups, constitute the most
 dramatic threat to public order and security in the UK.
 The tensions and long-held grievances between the two
 communities in Northern Ireland have caused some persons,
 Catholic and Protestant, to be denied equality of rights and
 opportunities despite government efforts to redress these
 grievances. The Fair Employment Act, which came into effect
 in early 1990, is designed to strengthen government efforts to
 eliminate employment discrimination.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom fro6:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political killings by the Government. In
 Northern Ireland 76 persons were killed in incidents related
 to terrorism, 10 of whom were killed by security forces acting
 in the line of duty. Several shootings by security forces in
 Northern Ireland prompted allegations that soldiers were
 carrying out a "shoot-to-kill" policy. The Government has
 denied that such a policy exists.
 Security forces in Northern Ireland continued the use of
 plastic baton rounds (PBR's or plastie bullets) for riot
 control; there were no fatalities from PBR's in 1990.
 The PIRA continued to carry out killings in Northern Ireland,
 Great Britain, and continental Europe. Ian Gow, a
 Conservative Member of Parliament, was killed by a PIRA car
 bomb at his home in London on July 30. The PIRA increased its
 "human bomb" attacks against security forces targets. In all
 cases, private citizens were forced to drive vehicles loaded
 with explosives to security forces' checkpoints while PIRA
 gunmen held family members hostage.

 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The Stevens inquiry, an independent police investigation of
 allegations that confidential Northern Ireland security force
 information was leaked to terrorists, was completed in 1990.
 The investigators concluded that, although information had
 been-passed to paramilitary groups who used it to identify
 targets for attack, the practice was neither widespread nor
 institutionalized and Measures already being taken or
 considered should redube the risk of recurrence.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no kncwn disappearances caused by government
 forces. There continued to be instances of persons abducted
 or held hostage in terrorist incidents in Northern Ireland.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 British laws forbid torture and other cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment of prisoners and provide penalties for
 violations of those laws. Confessions obtained by-such
 methods are not admissible as evidence in court. A new code
 of practices designed to bring about greater standardization
 of police interrogation procedures and to strengthen oversight
 requirements came into force in 1990.
 Human rights groups have claimed that conditions in British
 prisons amount to-degrading treatment contrary to the European
 Convention on Human Rights. British courts recognize that
 prison conditions prejudicial to a prisoner's health would be
 unlawful but have not ruled that such conditions exist. The
 Government has begun an extensive, long-term program to
 improve overall prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In instances when reasonable cause to suspect criminal guilt
 exists, police may make arrests without warrants. Those
 arrested without warrant must be released on bail unless
 brought before a magistrate's court within 24 hours.
 Generally, persons charged with nonserious offenses may be
 released on bail. In cases such as crimes of violence,
 however, magistrates have remanded persons for periods of up
 to 18 months before trial.
 Reacting to the violence in Northern Ireland, the Government
 adopted the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Acts of
 1978 and 1987 which are applicable only to Northern Ireland;
 and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of
 1989 (originally enacted in 1974), almost all of which is
 applicable to the entire United Kingdom. Both acts are
 subject to parliamentary review and require periodic renewal
 to remain-in effect.
 Under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act, police
 and military personnel, in dealing with cases of suspected
 terrorism, may enter and search without warrants, and members
 of the Armed Forces on duty may arrest without a warrant any
 person suspected of having committed or being about to commit
 any offense. Such persons may be held for up to 4 hours,
 after which they must be transferred to police custody or
 released.
 The 1989 Prevention of Terrorism Act allows the police to
 arrest,.without warrant, persons anywhere in the UK whom they
 
 
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 reasonably suspect to be involved in terrorism. Such persons
 may be-detained for up to 48 hours without legal representation
 or judicial review. Judicial review may be delayed up to a
 further 5 days on the authority of the Home Secretary or, in
 Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is provided for by law and generally observed in
 practice. An indigent defendant has the right to counsel of
 his choosing. All criminal proceedings must be conducted in
 public, with the exception of juvenile court cases and cases
 involving public decency or security. In a trial under the
 Official Secrets Act, the court may be closed at the judge's
 discretion, but the sentence must be passed in-public.
 In 1989 the Higher Appellate Court overturned the convictions
 of the "Guildford Four," who were convicted of a terrorist
 bombing and imprisoned with life sentences in 1975. The court
 ruled that the convictions had been "wrongfully obtained."
 Rather than try the case again, the Director of Public
 Prosecutions directed that the Government abandon its charges,
 and the four men were released from prison. Investigations
 continue into the behavior of the police officers in the case.
 In 1990 the Home Secretary decided to refer back to the Court
 of Appeal the similar case of the "Birmingham Six" after
 receiving evidence that he said cast doubt on the validity of
 the convictions. The "Birmingham Six" were arrested after 2
 bombs in Birmingham pubs killed 19 and injured 122 persons.
 The prisoners claimed they had been ill-treated and intimidated
 into making confessions which became the main basis for their
 convictions. No final decision in this case had been reached
 by year's end. The West Midlands Serious Crime Squad, which
 handled the "Birmingham Six" case, was disbanded by the Chief
 Constable in 1989 after reports that its members had
 intimidated suspects and fabricated evidence-in other cases.
 The independent Police Complaints Authority is supervising a
 police investigation into the activities of the squad.
 In the case of the "Maguire Seven," who had completed their
 sentences, the Home Secretary ruled that their convictions on
 explosives charges should not be allowed to stand after an
 independent inquiry raised serious doubts about the validity
 of the Government's forensic evidence.
 The majority of criminal prosecutions that come to trial are
 heard by juries. In Northern Ireland, however, the right to
 trial by jury has been suspended for certain terrorist-related
 offenses because of intimidation of the judiciary, jurors, and
 solicitors. In such cases, a "Diplock Court," in which a
 single judge presides over a trial without a jury, is used.
 Under a 1988 change of law, a court may draw whatever inference
 it deems proper, including an inference of guilt, if a subject
 remains silent during questioning. This was to deal with the
 "wall of silence" and "ambush testimony," whereby a suspect
 does not speak until his trial and then presents a surprise
 alibi. The Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights said
 in 1989 that, unless restricted in application, the law could
 lead to a lack of confidence in justice in Northern Ireland.
 Minors convicted of murder may be subjected to indeterminate
 detention. In Northern Ireland, where public attention has
 focused on this issue, 19 persons were serving indeterminate
 
 
 1328
 UNITED KINGDOM OF. GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 sentences at the end of 1990 for murders committed while they
 were under the age of 18.
 :f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right of privacy is well respected in both law and custom.
 Warrants are generally required for a police search of private
 premises. However, under the Northern Ireland (Emergency
 Provisions) Act of 1978, any.member of the armed forces on
 duty or any constable may enter any premises or other place if
 he or sheconsiders it necessary to do so to preserve peace or
 maintain order. Changes in the 1987 Emergency Provisions Act'
 now require a standard of "reasonable grounds of suspicion"
 before a dwelling may be entered without a warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Strongly held tradition, an independent press, and a
 democratic political system combine to secure freedom of
 speech and press. viewpoints independent and critical of the
 Government are vell represented.
 The Government continued to ban broadcasts of live or recorded
 statements.made by representatives of the PIRA br other
 terrorist organizations or of Sinn Fein, the legal political
 arm of the. IRA, or by others who express views that "solicit,
 support, or invite support for such organizations." There are
 no restrictions on reporting their words, and exceptions are
 made for coverage of elections and parliamentary proceedings.
 The measures have been criticized as an infringement on the
 right of free speech and press and are being challenged in the
 domestic courts and under.the European Convention on Human
 Rights. The Government believes that the restrictions have
 been valuable in denying terrorist groups the immediacy and
 impact which direct broadcasting brings.
 The Official Secrets Act of 1989, which imposed criminal
 penalties for disclosure of government information, has been
 criticized by some humin rights groups for going beyond
 restrictions on the right to protect government information
 permitted under the European Convention on Human Rights and
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except in cases of extreme civil disorder, in which public
 safety is judged to be at risk, the authorities do not exercise
 their statutory right to limit the freedom of public assembly.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1989 and the Northern
 Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978 include sections
 prohibiting membership in, or support of, organizations
 involved in terrorism. These organizations are specifically
 listed in the statutes. The lists do not include political
 parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Government policy and general practice ensure freedom of
 religion. While both England and Scotland have established
 churches, the UK Government makes no direct financial
 contribution to them. The Government does, however, provide
 
 
 1329
 
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 funds for the schools of those churches but not those of other
 religions and denominations. In Northern Ireland, the
 Constitution Act of 1973 specifically prohibits discrimination
 by public authorities on the basis of religious belief or
 political opinion. There is no similar law in Great Britain.
 There are no religious bars to holding public office.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 UK citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country and
 in foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation. The
 Prevention of Terrorism Act, however, allows the Home
 Secretary to exclude from mainland Britain anyone connected
 with Northern Ireland terrorism unless that person was born in
 Great Britain or has been resident there for 3 years. Similar
 authority is granted to the Secretary of State for Northern
 Ireland to exclude persons not native to or resident in that
 province. In ordering exclusion, the Secretary of State must
 only be "satisfied" that a person is or has been involved in
 the commission, preparation, or instigation of acts of
 terrorism. Between Noyember 1978 and September 1990, 293
 persons were the subjeots of expulsion orders in the UK.
 Human rights groups have objected to such orders because the
 evidence used is not tested in any court.
 Immigration rules require that all requests for asylum be
 considered by the Home Office in accordance with the 1951
 Refugee Convention. The Home Office is investigating
 allegations that some requests for asylum from Turkish Kurds
 were summarily denied by immigration officers in 1990.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is formed on the basis of a majority of seats
 in the House of Commons, won in elections held at intervals
 not longer than 5 years. Participation in the political
 process is open to all persons and parties, of which there are
 several. All citizens 18 years of age and older may vote.
 Most British dependent territories have small populations,
 under 60,000, and are ruled by appointed governors or
 administrators assisted by executive councils (usually
 appointed) and legislative assemblies or councils (partly
 elected).
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperates fully with international inquiries
 into alleged violations of human rights and usually takes steps
 to rectify its own laws and policies when they are found not
 to be in conformity with the European Convention on Human
 Rights. The Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1989, however,
 retained the 7-day detention power, which continued.the
 Government's temporary derogation from the articles on
 detention of the European Convention on Human Rights and the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The
 United Kingdom is a party to several human rights conventions
 and participates in international and regional human rights
 bodies. A number of international nongovernmental human
 rights organizations, including Amnesty International, are
 based in the UK. In 1973 the Standing Advisory Commission on
 
 
 1330
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Human Rights was established to monitor human rights in
 Northern Ireland.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 British law bars discrimination on the basis of race, color,
 nationality, or national or ethnic origin and outlaws
 incitement to racial hatred. A government-appointed,
 independent Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) supports
 persons taking court action under the Race Relations Act,
 provides guidelines on good practice, and may, in certain
 instances, initiate court action. The CRE mainly issues
 notices requiring that discrimination cease. Such notices are
 believed to provide remedies quicker than court action, which
 is used in only the most serious cases. A CRE code of practice
 on employment issued in 1984 encouraged many private companies
 to adopt equal opportunity policies and some degree of
 voluntary monitoring. Various studies, however, have shown
 higher levels of unemployment, lower educational achievement,
 and disproportionate numbers of persons in legal custody for
 ethnic minorities.
 Equal opportunity for women is provided by law. An equal
 opportunity commission supports women who bring discrimination
 cases, most of which are labor-related, before the courts and
 produces guidelines on good practice for employers. Some
 legal protections for women against discrimination were
 improved after the European Court of Justice, in reviewing
 cases in 1982, 1984, and 1986, found that British law did not
 conform with European Community legislation on equal rights.
 For example, it is illegal to apply different retirement ages
 for men and women, and claims for equal pay for work of equal
 value may be taken to industrial tribunals. Large companies
 have begun to revise job classification and pay structures in
 an effort to achieve parity.
 Following legal changes in 1990, married women pay taxes on an
 equal basis with other taxpayers. Women have equal property
 rights and equal rights in the divorce courts.
 In 1990 the Government advised that police should take a
 greater interest in cases of domestic violence. Offenders are
 prosecuted and may be imprisoned. Women's shelters provide
 refuge for battered wives, and local governments provide
 counseling services. Rape victims receive similar support.
 Convicted rapists are usually imprisoned. New legal ground
 was broken in July when a husband who was not living with his
 wife was jailed for 3 years for attempting to rape her. Before
 then, legal separation or the existence of a nonmolestation
 injunction had been essential for rape-in-marriage convictions.
 There is no evidence of governmental discrimination on
 religious grounds in the United Kingdom. In Northern Ireland,
 however, anti-Catholic discrimination stemming from a complex
 range of historical and social factors persists. The majority
 Protestant community controls much of the local economy and is
 more prosperous than the Catholic community. Since 1972, when
 direct British rule was introduced in Northern Ireland,
 specific measures have been taken to combat religious
 discrimination.
 Within the Northern Ireland civil service, the proportion of
 Catholics under age 35 reflects their proportion in the
 population, but Protestants still dominate in the upper age
 
 
 1331
 
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 groups. Despite an overall increase in employment in Northern
 Ireland, the Catholic male unemployment rate remained 2.5
 times that of Protestant men.
 The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act, approved by
 Parliament in 1989, is intended to end employment
 discrimination and is aimed at outlawing even unintentional or
 "indirect" discrimination. All public sector employers and
 private firms with more than 25 workers must register with the
 Fair Employment Commission, monitor the religious composition
 of their work force, supply annual monitoring reports to the
 commission, and review their overall employment practices at
 least once every 3 years. Employers who fail to comply face
 criminal penalties and loss of government contracts. Although
 the overall majority of companies are in compliance with the
 legislation, small fines have been imposed on some firms for
 violations. No criminal proceedings have been undertaken.
 While the legislation has been criticized by some for not
 proposing "strong and effective provisions for targets and
 timetables," in general it has been praised by leaders of the
 Catholic community. Government efforts to increase recruitment
 of Catholics into the police force and related security fields
 have been hampered by PIRA assassinations and death threats.
 The PIRA terror campaign has been carried out not only against
 police officers but also against persons who provide services
 to the security forces.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely, choose
 representatives, publish journals, openly promote members'
 interests and views, and elect representative assemblies to
 determine union policies and procedures. Unions participate
 freely in international organizations.
 Unions are free from government control but must register
 their accounts with a government-appointed trade union
 certification officer. Senior union officers must be elected
 by secret ballot. The law mandates secret ballots before a
 strike call, prohibits unions from disciplining persons who
 ignore a legal strike call, and allows individual trade union
 members to lodge complaints against their union with a
 government-appointed ombudsman.
 There is no specific statutory "right to strike" in the UK.
 Voluntary cessation of work may be considered a breach of
 contract. A system of legal immunities, however, protects
 unions from prosecution when engaged in legitimate disputes.
 Legislation adopted in the 1980's narrowed these immunities by
 excluding most secondary strikes and those deemed to be
 political. Unions encouraging such strikes are subject to
 fines by the courts and may have their assets seized. The
 1990 employment act made unions liable for all industrial
 actions, including unofficial strikes, unless the unions
 concerned wrote to strikers repudiating their action.
 Unofficial strikers may be legally dismissed. In instances
 where the right to strke is prohibited, e.g., for police
 officers, there are alternative means to resolve differences.
 In 1989 the Trades Union Congress (TUC) lodged a complaint
 with the International Labor Organization (ILO) that aspects
 of British legislation represented unwarranted interference in
 the internal affairs of trade unions and were contrary to
 
 
 1332
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 provisions of ILO Conventions 87 on the freedom of association
 and 98 on the right to organize and bargain collectively. Ihe
 ILO Committee of Experts found that areas of the legislation
 were not compatible with those ILO Conventions. The
 Government disagreed with this finding, and no change in the
 law is contemplated.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is deeply
 rooted in common law. There is no legal obligation for
 employers to bargain with workers' representatives, but
 collect~ve bargaining is extensive, involving over 10.2
 million workers, or approximately 40 percent of the work force.
 It is illegal to deny a worker employment on the grounds that
 he or she is or is not a union member, except in the case of
 the armed forces, the police, or the security services.
 Workers who believe themselves victims of antiunion
 discrimination may seek redress through industrial tribunals.
 Remedies include the payment of indemnities and reinstatement
 by employers found guilty of discriminatory practices,
 although reinstatement rarely occurs. A backlog of tribunal
 cases has developed in recent years.
 Export processing zones do not exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited in the UK and its
 dependent territories and possessions and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 School attendance until the age of 16 is compulsory. Children
 under that age are not permitted to work in an industrial
 enterprise except as part of an educational course.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislated minimum wage. In some low-wage
 industries employing approximately 2 million workers, wage
 councils of employers and trade union members establish
 minimum hourly wages and overtime rates for adult workers.
 Provisions are legally enforced by a team of 60-70 inspectors.
 Minimum wage rates vary from industry to industry, but all are
 substantially below the national average earnings figure (e.g.,
 the wage council's minimum wage set for agricultural workers
 in 1990 was $2.32 per hour for a 40-hour week; average manual
 worker earnings in manufacturing in 1989 were $3.36 per hour).
 The UK does not have a law limiting daily or weekly working
 hours.
 The Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 requires that the
 health and safety of employees not be placed at risk. A
 Health and Safety Executive (HSE) enforces health and safety
 regulations and may initiate criminal proceedings. In 1990,
 following a number of accidents, responsibility for railway
 safety was transferred to the HSE. A health and safety
 commission submits regulatory proposals to the Government,
 appoints investigatory committees, and encourages research and
 training. The UK system of occupational health and safety is
 viewed as efficiently managed and operates  ith the full
 involvement of workers' representatives.
