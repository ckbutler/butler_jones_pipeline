 HONG KONG
 Hong Kong, a small, densely populated British dependency, is a free society with
 legally protected rights but without a broad democratic base. Its constitutional ar-
 rangements are defined by the Letters Patent and Royal Instructions. Executive
 powers are vested in a British Crown-appointed Governor who holds extensive au-
 thority. The judiciary is an independent body adhering to English common law with
 certain variations. Fundaments rights ultimately rest on oversight by the British
 Parliament. In practice, however, Hong Kong largely controls its own internal af-
 fairs.
 A well-organized civilian police force maintains public order and respects the
 human rights of the populace.
 Hong Kong's free market economy is among the world's most important shipping,
 marketing, and finance centers. It serves as an investment center for trade with
 China and as a communication and transportation hub for Asia. Annual per capita
 gross domestic product increased by 5.5 percent in 1993 to a projected $18,948
 The Bill of Rights, passed in June 1991, continued to make an impact on legisla-
 tive process and criminal law. Hong Kong political leaders and human rights groups
 have criticized the Government for not conforming Hong Kong laws to the Bill of
 Rights. The Legislative Council is expected to consider measures aimed at further
 reconciliation during the 1993-494 session. The principal human rights problem is
 the inability of citizens to change their government. China strongly criticized and
 opposed the Governor's 1992 proposed measures to broaden the political franchise
 before the colony reverts to China in 1997. In ongoing political talks, the United
 Kingdom (U.K.) and China have not reached agreement on these proposals. Dis-
 crimination and violence against women are continuing human rights concerns.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no instances of deaths
 in police custody or as a result of using force in restraining unarmed persons during
 arrest.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of any disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other extreme forms of abuse are forbidden by law and subject to pun-
 ishment. Individual acts of police brutality occurred. From January to July 1993,
 996 allegations of police assault were lodged. The total number of complaints
 against the police during this period numbered about 2,000. As of July, 34 cases
 were substantiated, none of which resulted in death. End of year figures were not
 available. Disciplinary action can range from criminal proceedings to dismissal or
 warnings. Complaints are investigated by an internal police unit, subject to outside
 review. The authorities continued to reject calls from some legislators that inves-
 tigations should be conducted by an independent body.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-British legal protections and common law
 traditions govern the process of arrest and detention and ensure substantial and ef-
 fective legal protections against arbitrary arrest or detention. Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Hong Kong's judicial and legal systems are orga-
 nized according to principles of British constitutional law and legal precedent and
 feature, inter alia, an independent judiciary and trial by jury. The right to a fair
 public trial is guaranteed and respected in practice.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right of privacy is generally respected and provided for by law. The Independent
 Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is vested with powers which are normally
 exercised only by   a judicial officer. Amendments to ordinances governing
 ICACdeprived it of its independent authority to issue arrest or search warrants (it
 must now go to the courts), but it still operates on the assumption that any exces-
 sive, unexplainable assets held by civil servants are considered ill-gotten until prov-
 en otherwise.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There is a tradition of free speech and press
 as practiced in Great Britain. However, the admission by China's Ministry of Public
 Security that it has been gathering information on Hong Kong residents who are
 "against the Chinese Government* has had some chilling effect on free speech. Nu-
 merous views and opinions, including those independent or critical of the British
 and Hong Kong Governments, are aired in the mass media, in public forums and
 by political groups. International media organizations operate freely in Hong Kong.
 Although rarely imposed, several ordinances permit restrictions of the press.
 Journalists report that self-censorship is on the increase as Hong Kong-based
 media organizations which are expanding their commercial ties in China, seek to
 avoid giving offense to the Chinese Government. Following Chinese objections to a
 Hong Kong government proposal to "corporatize" the government-owne Radio Tele-
 vision Hong Kong (RTHK), there have been no further efforts by the Hong Kong
 Government to do so. The Government continues to refuse to consider freedom of
 information legislation proposed by Hong Kong civil liberties groups.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associatio.-These freedoms are practiced
 without significant hindrance alt ough the amended Societies Ordinance requires
 officeholders to notify the Police Commissioner (who is the Registrar of Societies)
 of the formation of a society. The Ordinance permits the Registrar to refuse to reg-
 ister an organization that is found to be "incompatible with eace, welfare, or good
 order" or is affiliated with a political organization abroad. There were no instances
 of this provision being applied arbitrarily in 1993.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Government policy and general practice ensure freedom
 of religon.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Travel documents are obtainable freely and easily, subject to neither
 arbitrary nor discriminatory practices. There is freedom of movement within Hong
 Kong.
 By 1991 more than 200,000 Vietnamese had arrived in Hong Kong seeking refu-
 gee status. Hong Kong has never refused to accept, or pushed off, Vietnamese boat
 people. Prior to June 1988, they were automatically accorded refugee status. There-
 after, they were screened to determine their status and were held in prison-like de-
 tention centers awaiting resettlement in other countries or repatriation to Vietnam.
 As of November 1993, only 67 Vietnamese had arrived Hong Kong since agreement
 was reached in late 1991 by the U.K. and Vietnam The agreement provided for the
 immediate screening of new arrivals, mandatory repatriation to Vietnam of those
 whom the authorities determined not to be refugees, and the decision by the U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to cease providing a reintegration sub-
 sistence allowance to new arrivals.
 A trial of 13 Vietnamese accused of murdering 24 fellow detainees, who burned
 to death in a February 1992 riot when their hut was barricaded and set afire, is
 expected to continue until mid-1994. In addition to the 13 defendants, 2 key defense
 witnesses were prevented from returning to Vietnam-despite volunteering to re-
 turn home-until they have testified in the case. Gang violence continues to be a
 problem in the camps, and women are often raped. On September 1, the UNHCR
 began cutting nonessential services in the detention centers. The move, which elimi-
 nated adult education, community and recreational activities in the camps, and cut
 back employment opportunities and some medical facilities, was criticized by some
 nongovernmental human rights organizations.
 The Hong Kong Government has said it hopes to have all initial screening of Viet-
 namese asylum seekers completed by January 1994. Reintegration assistance pro-
 grams inside Vietnam funded by the European community, the Hong Kong Govern-
 ment, and the United States provided an incentive for those not eligible for third
 country resettlement to return to Vietnam. In order to spur voluntary repatriation
 of those not recognized as refugees, the Government slashed the assistance package
 available to those returning home by a third, effective November 1. Anyone who vol-
 unteered before that time could still receive the full amount. Those who have not
 completed the screening process by the deadline will have 90 days to make a deci-
 sion for voluntary repatriation before benefits are cut. Of those found ineligible for
 resettlement or not yct screened, more than 10,000 persons had voluntarily returned
 to Vietnam by year's end and more than 34,000 since the agreement on the Com-
 prehensive Plan of Action in 1989.
 On May 12, 1992, the Hong Kong government reached agreement with Vietnam-
 ese authorities on an Orderly Return Program (ORP) for screened-out nonrefugees
 in Hong Kong detention centers. Under the program, people are randomly chosen
 from among the nonrefugee camp population and are moved to a separate location
 several days before the flight's scheduled departure. Hong Kong government secu-
 
 
 1134
 
 rity officers then escort all those being mandatorily returned on to the plane and
 accompany the flight to Vietnam. Security officials have used limited force in the
 past when some nonrefugees resisted repatriation. To date the Government has re-
 turned 730 persons aboard 14 ORP f1igts.
 The Government maintained its policy of deporting illegal Chinese immigrants to
 China, except in rare instances in which a person qualified as a refugee within the
 meaning of the U.N. Protocol on the Status of Refugees. In 1992 an everage of 130
 illegal immigrants, mostly young men, were arrested every day and returned to
 China. Over 2,400 ethnic Vietnamese living in China fled to Hong Kong during
 1992. Called Ex-China Vietnamese Illegal Immigrants (EVCIIS) by the Government,
 they were not recognized as refugees by UNHCR or local authorities and were re-
 turned to China. Following China's expulsion of Han Dongang, a Chinese labor or-
 ganizer, when he returnedito China in August, the Hong Kong Government has re-
 peatedly renewed Han's permission to remain in the colony while he has continued
 efforts to obtain Chinese permission to return to his homeland.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 While Hong Kong is a free society, with most individual freedoms and rights pro.
 tected by law and custom, citizens of the territory do not have the right to change
 their government. The Governor is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the
 Crown. He is advised on policy by an executive council which he appoints.
 Legislation is enacted and funds are provided by the Legislative Council which
 also debates policy and questions the administration. Although the legislature has
 virtually no power to initiate legislation, it has become more assertive since the Sep-
 tember 1991 direct elections for some seats. The Governor has ultimate control of
 the administration of Hong Kong but, by convention, he rarely exercises his full
 powers. In practice, decisions reached through consensus. Political parties and inde-
 pendent candidates are free to contest seats in free and fair elections. Representa-
 tive government employing universal franchise, however, does not exist. Only 18 of
 60 legislators were elected by universal suffrage. Of the rest, 21 were either ap-
 pointed by the Governor or are themselves government officials. Another 21 were
 elected by functional groupings, such as lawyers, industrialists, teachers, laborers,
 and accountants. Functional constituencies disproportionately represent the eco-
 nomic and professional elites and, moreover, violate the concept of one person-one
 vote, since voters in functional constituencies may vote both in a functional and a
 geographic constituency.
 In his first policy address in October 1992, the Governor introduced several pro-
 posals intended to make the 1995 legislature more democratic. As originally pro-
 posed, the measures would give all eligible voters in the workingpopulation of 2.7
 million a second vote in one of 30 functional constituencies. Furthermore, the elec-
 tion committee which would elect 10 legislators would draw all or most of its mem-
 bers from the local district boards, which the overnor proposed to be entirely di-
 rectly elected, rather than one-third appointed, as is the case now. Even these meas-
 ures, however, would not result in a fully representative, democratically elected gov-
 ernment. The Chinese Government, claiming it had not been consulted on these pro-
 posals, denounced them and warned that any changes which did not "converge" with
 the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution, would be revoked when China
 resumes its exercise of sovereignty in 1997. Since April 1993, Chinese and British
 negotiators have been discussingethe procedures for the 1995 Legislative Council
 elections, although progress has been negligible. However both the British and Chi-
 nese Governments earlier agreed that the number of legislators to be elected by uni-
 versal suffrage in 1995 will increase to 20.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although the Government to date has interposed no official barriers to the forma-
 tion of local human rights groups, some human rights monitors believe that provi-
 sions of the Societies Ordinance provide the legal means whereby a future govern-
 ment could do so. The Government has consistently cooperated with international
 and nongovernmental organizations on human rihts issues. The UNHCR and non-
 governmental human rights organizations have fIl access to Hong Kong's camps for
 Vietnamese boat people.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Chinese language has equal status with English in many government oper-
 ations. The Government is continuing efforts to place Hong Kong Chinese in senior
 positions. In September the Government announced the appointment of several lo-
 
 
 1135
 
 cally born Hong Kong civil servants (mostly Chinese, but one locally born Indian)
 to key positions. For the first time a Hong Kong Chinese was appointed to the top
 civil service position. Overall, however, progress remains slow in replacing expatri-
 ats serving in other policy-related positions. Expatriates remain in key positions
 in the legal snd police departments as well as the judiciary.
 Complicating the Government's localization efforts have been expatriate govern-
 ment workers on local contracts who threaten legal action against the Government
 if they are not allowed to convert to regular civil service status. The Government's
 decision to allow long-resident expatriates with appropriat job qualifications to con-
 vert has drawn charges from local civil servant organizations that the Government
 has reneged on its localization policy. As of September, the Government's decision
 to allow expatriates to convert remained in effect although some members of the
 Legislative Council threatened to overturn it in the 1993-94 legislative session.
 Women.-Violence sod discrimination against women remain significant prob-
 lems. The only legislation to protect the rights of battered women is the 1987 Do-
 mestic Violence Ordinance, which enables a woman to seek a 3-month injunction
 against her husband. This may be extended to 6 months. In addition, domestic vio-
 lenc may be prosecuted as common assault under existing criminal statutes. The
 Government enforces these laws and prosecutes violators. Nevertheless, women's ac-
 tion groups continue to press for better legal and government provisions for battered
 wives. They call for public housing to house women as soon as they leave their vio-
 lent husbands. Harmony House, a private voluntary agency, and the Social Welfare
 Department operate two homes which offer refuge to a small number of women.
 Harmony House also has conducted training programs for police personnel on how
 to deal with domestic violence. Many instances of domestic violence, however, are
 not reported, owing partly to cultural factors which frown on exposing family crises
 to the public eye but also to a lack of well-publicized information about the assist-
 ance and resources available.
 Women face discrimination in areas of employment, salary, welfare, and pro.
 motion. While a number of women hold senior appointive government positions, only
 two were elected to the legislature.
 Children.-The Government supports child welfare programs including custody,
 protection, day care, foster care, shelters, and small group homes. Assistance is also
 provided to families. Child abuse and exploitation are not widespread problems in
 Hong Kong. The Government remains committed to the human rights and welfare
 of children.
 People with Disabilities.-Organizations and individuals representing the inter-
 ests of the disabled claim that discrimination against the physically and mentally
 disabled exists in employment, education, and the provision of some state services.
 Access to public buildings and transportation remain problems for the physically im-
 paired. Advocate groups have urged the Government to do more to encourage great-
 er public tolerance of the mentally disabled. Harassment of and discrimination
 against families with mentally disabled children, for example, have occurred in some
 housing projects. There also has been criticism that mentally disabled children are
 not allowed oppo rtunities to "mainstream" into iublic school programs. The Govern-
 ment is generally receptive and sympathetic to these concerns; it encourages greater
 employment for the disabled and seeks improved access to public facilities for those
 physically impaired. However, there is as yet no law mandating accessibility provi-
 sions for disabled persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of association and the right of workers to
 establish and join organizations of their own choosing are guaranteed under local
 law. Trade unions must be registered under the Trade Unions Ordinance. The basic
 precondition for registration is a minimum of seven persons who serve in the same
 occupation. The Government does not discourage or impede the formation of unions.
 During 1992, 11 new unions were registered. However, only about 525,000 workers
 (or 18.5 percent) out of a total labor force of 2.84 million beong to one of the 522
 registered unions, most of which belong to one of three major trade union federa-
 tions.
 Work stoppages and strikes are permitted. However, there are some restrictions
 on this right for civil servants. Even though the Employment Ordinance recognizes
 the right to strike, in practice most workers must sign employment contracts which
 typically state that walking off the job is a breach of contract and can lead to sum-
 mary dismissal. The Employment Ordinance also permits firms to discharge or de-
 duct wages from staff who are absent on account of a labor dispute.
 HongK ong a or unions may form federations, confederations, and affiliate with
 internationalbodies. Any affiliation with foreign labor unions requires the consent
 
 
 1136
 of the Government. All such requests have been granted. As a dependent territory
 of the U. K., Hong Kong is not a member in its own right of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). The U.K. makes declarations on behalf of Hong Kong concern-
 ing the latter's obligations regarding the various ILO conventions. To Zte, Hong
 Kong has implemented provisions applying 29 conventions in full and 18 other with
 modifications. In the Basic Law, China undertook to continue to adhere to these
 conventions after 1997.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivey.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is guaranteed by law. Hong Kong laws pertaining to collective
 bargaining cover mainly the shipping, textile, public transport, public utility, and
 carpentry trades, and the catering, construction, public service, and teaching profes-
 sions. Wages are determined by market factors. While collective bargaining does
 take place, it is not widely practiced, and in general there are no mechanisms spe-
 cifically to encourage it. Unions generally are not powerful enough to force manage-
 ment to engage in collective bargaining. The Government does not encourage it,
 since the Government itself does not engage in collective bargaining with civil serv-
 ants' unions but merely "consults" with them. Free conciliation services are afforded
 by the Labor Relations Division of the Department of Labor (DOL) to employers and
 employees involved in disputes dealing with arrears of wages, wages in lieu of no-
 tice, severance pay, and breaches of contractual employment terms. The DOL is
 charged with finding a mutually acceptable settlement, although it does not have
 the authority to impose a solution. The DOL is not required by law to allow unions
 to represent employees in these proceedings. Instead, union representation depends
 upon the mutual consent of both the employee and the employer.
 Workers are protected against antiunion discrimination under Hong Kong legisla-
 tion. Employees who allege such discrimination have the right to have their cases
 heard by the DOL's Labor Relations Division. Employers who attempt to prevent
 or deter an employee from joining a labor union, or who terminate an employee for
 joining a labor union, are liable to a fine of approximately $650. However, the em-
 ployers are not required to reinstate the employee or to compensate him.
 The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) is highly critical
 of the inadequacy of Hong Kong's labor legislation, with its failure to protect the
 right to strike, and provisions allowing dismissals and disciplinary action against
 trade unionists going on strike. The ICFTU cites as an example the 17-day strike
 by the Flight Attendant's Union at Cathay Pacific at the beginning of 1993 in which
 striking workers were threatened with disciplinary action and dismissal. individual
 labor claims are also adjudicated by the Labor Tribunal, a part of the judicial
 branch, which is supposed to provide quick and inexpensive machinery for resolving
 certain types of disputes. The Tribunal complements the conciliation service pro-
 vided by the Labor Relations Division. Union leaders complain, however, that the
 Tribunal takes too long-an average of 133 days-to hear workers' cases.
 There are no export processing zones in Hong Kong.
 c. Prohibition oForced or Compulsory Labor.-Existing labor legislation prohibits
 forced labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Employment of Children Reg-
 ulations prohibit the employment of children under age 15 in any industrial estab-
 lishment. Children aged 13 and 14 may be employed in certain nonindustrial estab-
 lishments, subject to conditions aimed at ensuring a minimum of 9 years' education
 and protecting their safety, health, and welfare. During 1992, 9 campaigns against
 the employment of children covered about 26,100 establishments and found 18 chil-
 dren working in violation of the law, according to the annual report of the Commis-
 sioner for Labor. A number of these cases were successfully prosecuted and fines
 of around $200 were levied.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage except for foreign
 domestic workers.
 Aside from a small number of trades and industries where a uniform wage struc-
 ture exists, wage levels are customarily fixed by individual agreement between em-
 ployer and empoyee and are determined by supply and demand. In view of contin-
 ued tightness in Hong Kong's labor market (unemployment averaged about 2.1 per-
 cent for 1993), wage increases were given to most workers, particularly those in the
 construction industry and service sectors. Many employees also receive a year-end
 bonus of a month's pay or more. Some employers in the manufacturing sector pro-
 vide workers with various kinds of allowances, free medical treatment, and free or
 subsidized transort.
 There are no legal restrictions on hours of work for men. The Women and Young
 Persons (Industry) Regulations under the Employment Ordinance control hours and
 conditions of work for women and young people aged between 15 and 17. Work
 hours are limited to 8 per day and 48 per week between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. (be-
 
 
 1137
 
 tween 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. only for women, however, this provision is very loosely en-
 forced) for persons age 16 or over. Overtime is restricted to 2 hours per day and
 200 days per year for women and is prohibited for all persons under 18 in industrial
 establishments. The regulations also prohibit women and young persons from work-
 ing underground or, with the exception of males aged 16 and 17, in dangerous
 trades. The Labor Inspectorate conducts workplace inspections to ensure compliance
 with these regulations. During 1992 it carried out 198,748 inspections of approxi-
 mately 190,000 establishments in industrial and nonindustria sectors, whic  re-
 sultedin 3,624 prosecutions of employers and a wide range of fines depending on
 the seriousness of the violation. The employment of underaged workers is generally
 not a serious problem.
 The DOL Factory Inspectorate sets basic occupational safety and health stand-
 ards, provides education and publicity, and follows up with enforcement and inspec-
 tion in accordance with the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance and
 subsidiary regulations. The Inspectorate pays particular attention to safety in high-
 risk areas of factories and construction sites, with routine visits to factories and con-
 struction sites. During 1992 inspectors visited 63,135 factories and 15,229 construc-
 tion sites and issued 2,811 summons. As part of a complementary effort, the DOL
 Occupational Health Division investigates claims of occupational diseases and inju-
 ries at work, conducts environmental testing in the workplace, and provides medical
 examinations to employees in occupations that involve the handling of hazardous
 materials. The small number of irnspectors-about 200-and the inability of workers
 to elect their own safety representatives weaken the enforcement of safety and
 health standards at the workplace. There is no specific legal provision allowing
 workers to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to
 continued employment.
