 GUYANA
 Guyana is a small, poor country dominated by President Forbes
 Burnham and his People's National Congress (PNC) party. The
 PNC came to power in the British-supervised elections of 1964,
 the last unquestionably free elections held in Guyana.
 Constitutionally, Guyana is a republic with an executive
 president, parliament, independent judiciary and a multi-party
 system. Since independence in May 1966, President Burnham and
 his party have increasingly consolidated political power
 through elections in 1968, 1973 and 1980, which many Guyanese
 believe were tainted by fraud and the intimidation of
 political opponents.
 Guyana is a multi-racial society where, for the most part,
 ethnic groups live in tolerance and harmony. Nevertheless,
 race has played a significant role in determining affiliation
 with political parties. Party affiliation has tended to be
 based more on race than on ideology. Although many members of
 the Indo-Guyanese community claim that the Government
 discriminates against them on racial grounds, Indo-Guyanese
 continue to dominate the commercial life of the country. The
 PNC has drawn its support primarily from Afro-Guyanese, who
 comprise about forty-three percent of the population and are
 largely urban dwelling.
 The PNC, declaring itself a socialist party based on Marxist
 principles, claims it wants to make Guyana a non-aligned,
 socialist, cooperative republic. In 1974 President Burnham
 declared the supremacy of his party over all other Guyanese
 institutions.
 The main opposition party, the People's Progressive Party
 (PPP), is an orthodox, pro-Moscow Marxist-Leninist party. The
 PPP, headed by former premier Dr. Cheddi Jagan, draws its
 support from Indo-Guyanese, who comprise fifty-one percent of
 the population. Although its appeal may have lessened, given
 a chance to compete fully and freely with the PNC in fair
 elections, the PPP could still be a force to be reckoned with
 in Guyana.
 The United Force (UF) and the Democratic Labour Movement (DLM)
 are small parties espousing democracy and free enterprise.
 The Working People' Alliance (WPA) is a small multi-ethnic
 opposition political party which *aspires to be
 Marxist-Leninst." It has not yet opted to participate in
 elections which it claims would be rigged in favor of the PNC.
 In 1984, the Government showed some degree of heightened
 sensitivity to human rights when government media commented on
 the 1983 Country Report on Human Rights Practices' in
 Guyana. These comments were primarily critical of the
 report. Another new development was that several members of
 the police force were charged with the killing of suspects
 held in police custody. Off-setting these improvements were
 continued infringements on the freedoms of press and assembly
 and harassment of the opposition.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No politically motivated killings occurred in 1984. However,
 opponents of the Government have charged that at least sixteen
 individuals, including some escaped prisoners and wanted men,
 were killed in confrontations with the police in 1984. The
 police claim to have shot them in self-defense. Political
 opponents of the PNC called for police to hold inquests into
 these deaths but have not claimed that these killings were
 politically motivated. In April 1984, two members of the
 police force were charged with manslaughter in the death of a
 young man who died of injuries sustained while in police
 custody. Another policeman was charged with murder in the
 shooting death of a 24 year old man in July 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no politically motivated disappearances,
 clandestine detentions, or abductions in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 Although mistreatment of suspected criminals by police
 continued in 1984, there is no evidence to suggest that senior
 officers condone these pactices, and torture is not used as a
 deliberate tool of political control. However, authorities
 have not responded publicly to allegations that torture and
 mistreatment take place, and the frequency and detail of the
 allegations suggest a serious decline in discipline and
 standards in the Guyana police force, which has been conceded
 by senior officials. The Guyana Human Rights Association
 alleged for example that in April 1984, while being held in
 police custody in Mabaruma in connection with the theft of
 some smuggled goods, an Amerindian was subjected to *electric
 torture and an especially severe beating after which he
 collapsed.* The report did not suggest that Government
 authorities condoned the conduct of the police, nor did it
 assert that the case was politically motivated. However,
 another report by the Association concerning detainees who
 were questioned about an alleged plot against President
 Burnham stated that the detainees claimed to have been
 transferred to various detention centers blindfolded, never
 being allowed to see the persons in charge of them or those
 who interrogated them or brought them food. Several of the
 detainees further alleged that they were *physically
 assaulted' by the police and that they were the victims of
 "psychological torture,' their heads being covered by cloth
 bags while a gun was fired close to their ears.
 Physical conditions within prisons have deteriorated in recent
 years. Jails are said to be filthy and overcrowded. Prison
 diets are alleged to be inadequate.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile
 The National Security Act authorizes searches without a
 warrant and preventive detention for up to three months
 without charges. Both ordinary citizens and members of the
 
 
 560
 GUYANA
 political opposition have been detained for brief periods
 without charges being stated or on charges of doubtful
 validity. The ensuing litigation is time-consuming and
 expensive. Although courts frequently dismiss charges with
 obvious political motivations, the Government tries to use the
 legal system, including the police, for political purposes.
 The arrest of Paul Nehru Tennassee, President of the
 Democratic Labor Movement, a minor political party, at the
 Timehri International Airport is a graphic example of such
 efforts. Tennassee was eventually convicted of failing to
 list forty Guyana dollars (US$ 11) on his currency
 declaration. However, during the five days he was held by
 police (until the hearing on a writ of habeas corpus)
 Tennassee was questioned about an alleged plot to assassinate
 or overthrow President Burnham.
 According to the Guyana Human Rights Association, early in
 1984, five unidentified Guyanese were detained for up to a
 week without their whereabouts being made known to relatives
 or lawyers. All were questioned about an alleged plot against
 President Burnham. They were released without any charges
 being filed against them.
 There have been no summary exiles from Guyana. The right of
 habeas corpus is provided in the Guyana Constitution. In
 practice, it is effective if and when it can be employed
 through access by a detainee to friendly parties.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As a former British Colony, Guyana maintains a British common
 law system and legal procedures, and almost all of the members
 of Guyanese judiciary were trained in the United Kingdom.
 Guyana has a functioning bail system, and defendants are
 accorded fair public trials and are represented by counsel.
 Timely charges are usually presented and appeals can be made
 to higher courts. There are no special courts for political
 security cases nor any political prisoners. In general,
 judges of high personal integritysit on the bench. Despite
 insinuations by the opposition about the independence of the
 judiciary, less partisan lawyers regard the judiciary as
 fairly independent. It is possible to win in court against
 the Government. Opponents of the Government complain that
 some magistrates have been too zealous in enforcing the
 Government's economic policies, particularly those involving
 banned food imports. They charge that magistrates often hand
 out harsher sentences to individuals found guilty of these
 *economic crimes' than to individuals guilty of violent crimes
 against persons and property. Magistrate Vernon Persaud was
 dismissed for refusing to sentence persons guilty of
 possessing contraband wheat flour. Wheat is not grown in
 Guyana, and by law it cannot be commercially imported.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Wiretaps, mail interception and physical surveillance are used
 to monitor and intimidate political opponents of the
 Government. Public sector employees, who constitute 51
 percent of the work force, are frequently required to attend
 certain ruling party functions and allegedly coerced into
 working at Hope Estate, a government-owned coconut plantation,
 in order to keep their jobs. The Government's emphasis on
 agriculture in the schools has led to small school children
 doing physical labor in school agriculture plots.
 
 
 561
 GUYANA
 Critics charge that authorities at Timehri International
 Airport are engaged in illegal random "body searches, of
 travelers, on suspicion of their violating foreign currency
 control regulations. The Guyana Human Rights Association has
 stated that this practice has no legal basis because,
 according to Guyana's exchange control legislation, police
 must have *reasonable grounds for suspicion.' Police
 practices of searching an entire planeload of people or
 conducting *spot checks" may violate the law, but the
 constitutionality of body searches at exit points in Guyana
 has not been challenged in court.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutionally, the Government affirms freedom of speech and
 press but in fact, it controls the media both directly through
 ownership and indirectly through control of the importation of
 newsprint. The Government presents its views in the
 government-owned 'Guyana Chronicle" and the ruling party's
 'New Nation.' Opposition viewpoints are freely expressed
 without prior censorship in the several weekly papers
 published by opponents of the Burnham Government. However,
 the Government allocates to its papers a disproportionate
 amount of the scarce newsprint imported into the country, and
 disallows increased importation of paper, even if no foreign
 exchange is required. It has also used libel suits against
 opposition newspapers which are drawn out over an extended
 period to intimidate them.
 Guyanese can receive printed materials from abroad, but
 foreign exchange is generally not-available for subscriptions
 to foreign publications. "The Caribbean Contact,' a monthly
 regional newspaper which is published in Barbados and which is
 generally hostile to the Burnham Government, is sold locally
 without any restrictions.
 The Government owns the country's only radio station, the
 Guyana Broadcasting Corporation, which broadcasts the BBC
 World News Service twice daily. Foreign stations can be heard
 on shortwave or mediumwave. Some radio interview programs
 allow public criticism of the Government.
 The Government asserts that state-owned media should serve
 'developmental' needs. As a result, the government media
 seldom run items unfavorable to it and news gathering efforts
 are limited by journalistic self-censorship. Objective
 reporting has occasionally cost journalists jobs within the
 government-owned media.
 The Guyana News Agency (GNA) edits items which the government
 media receives from wire services. However, since the Soviet
 news agency 'TASS' installed a teletype machine at the
 headquarters of the 'Guyana Chronicle" and GNA, much of what
 has appeared in the government-owned press has been actual
 TASS and Cuban Prensa Latina wire service articles. This
 extends even to articles about U.S. domestic affairs.
 The Government record on academic freedom is mixed. Several
 opposition Working People's Alliance leaders teach at the
 University of Guyana, and opposition parties have organized
 student groups there. However, some teachers critical of the
 Government's educational policies have been summarily fired
 without explanation.

 GUYANA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and
 association. In general, individuals can freely associate,
 although under the Public Order Act, police permits are
 required for public political meetings. At his discretion,
 the police commissioner can refuse permission for a meeting
 without any apparent legal requirement for him to state a
 reason for refusal. Opposition political parties have
 occasionally been denied permission to hold public meetings,
 particularly in Linden, the center of the bauxite mining
 industry. Both the Peoples Progressive Party and the Working
 Peoples Alliance have had meetings disrupted by the police or
 by thugs believed connected to the ruling party.
 Workers in Guyana are free to join unions. During 1984, a
 number of unions in Guyana exercised the right to strike,
 predominately in the government-owned sugar industry.
 Although the Government has the authority to declare any
 strike "political or illegal' it has not exercised that right
 since 1977, but the mere existence of the authority has an
 intimidating effect upon independent trade union activity.
 The Trade Union Congress (TUC) is the umbrella organization
 for the Guyana labor movement with responsibility for
 centralized collective bargaining. Until recently, a majority
 of the unions in the TUC were pro-Government, and these unions
 have had disproportionate voting power in electing the
 executive board of the TUC. However, at the 1984 annual TUC
 conference in October, independent and opposition union
 leaders defeated the pro-government slate of candidates and
 elected a number of their leaders to key TUC positions. The
 election also left the TUC, which had been given far reaching
 powers to bargain collectively for all unions by the Labour
 Amendment Act of March 1984, in the hands of union leaders who
 were generally opposed to the legislation. In November 1984,
 President Burnham weakened the new leadership by pre-empting
 TUC negotiations for wage increases of public sector employees
 when he unilaterally determined and announced an increase in
 wages. That same month, pro-government unions walked out of
 the TUC annual delegate conference.
 The 1984 Labour Amendment Act presents a significant challenge
 to the traditional rights of trade unions to bargain
 collectively on behalf of their members. The Act made
 collective agreements binding in law; agreement between the
 Government and the TUC were made binding on all public sector
 employees, and on member unions, whether the respective unions
 were in favor of the.agreement or not. The Act rendered void
 the appeals court decision which required the Government to
 pay back-wages to sugar workers by amending the Constitution
 to exclude 'wages' from the definition of fundamental property
 rights protected by the Constitution. The constitutionality
 of the Labour Act is currently being challenged in court;
 arguments have been heard, and a decision is now awaited in
 the case.
 Unions, trade assocations, private associations, and
 professional bodies are permitted freely to maintain relations
 with recognized international bodies in their fields, both
 public and private.

 GUYANA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no religious restrictions in Guyana; 57 percent of
 the population is Christian, 33 percent Hindu, and 9 percent
 Muslim. The Constitution guarantees freedom of thought and
 religion. There is no favored state religion, and foreign
 missionaries are permitted to enter the country to
 proselytize. Adherence to a particular faith does not confer
 any advantages in civil, political, economic, military or
 other secular status.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Guyana is guaranteed by the
 Constitution and is, in practice, usually permitted. However,
 since the colonial period, travel to certain Amerindian areas
 has required government permission. Sometimes permission has
 been withheld from opposition political figures, Catholic
 missiondries, foreign diplomats, and scholars, apparently on
 political grounds.
 Although Guyanese are free to travel abroad, to emigrate, and
 to return to Guyana, opposition politicians have been stopped
 and searched at police roadblocks and upon entering or leaving
 the international airport. On October 25, 1983, the
 Government issued a directive that public servants would not
 be allowed to spend their leave overseas for reasons related
 to foreign currency shortages. Although these reasons may
 have been valid, some public servants saw the move as
 political--to halt the "brain drain." After a flurry of
 resignation letters, the directive was rescinded on November 1,
 1983.
 During 1984, no Guyanese had his citizenship revoked or his
 passport taken away for political reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 President Forbes Burnham and a small group of senior officials
 rule Guyana, meeting in Cabinet sessions or in closed meetings
 of the ruling People's National Congress inner circle. In
 almost all matters, the President himself makes the final
 decision. The Burnham Government has ruled Guyana for twenty
 years, preserving the facade of parliamentary democracy
 without the substance. The Party has employed the government
 apparatus to advance its aims and to maintain political power
 in the hands of a ruling elite. Party loyalty is the road to
 advancement. Since the public sector employs over half the
 work force in Guyana, civil servants are reluctant publicly to
 criticize the Government, although most Guyanese freely voice
 their opinions in private.
 Guyanese who are not members of the ruling party elite have
 been effectively denied meaningful participation in the
 decision-making processes of the state. Every election since
 1964 has been marred by fraud and intimidation of the
 opponents of the PeoplesNational Congress Party. Opposition
 parties are able, albeit with some difficulty, to hold public
 political rallies, to organize, and to publish their
 newspapers. However, the majority of the people lack any
 effective means to register their support for political and
 
 
 564
 GUYANA
 economic changes. Many Guyanese perceive voting in general
 elections as a waste of time since results seem to be
 predetermined in favor of the PNC.
 The opposition, though weak, fragmented, and largely
 ineffectual, has (with the exception of the Peoples
 Progressive Party) formed a loosely organized coalition to
 press the Government to hold free and fair elections under
 international supervision. However, there has been no sign
 that the Burnham Government would accept neutral international
 observers to witness the holding of general elections which
 constitutionally must be called in 1985.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Burnham Government does not publicly admit to any human
 rights violations and regards outside criticism of its human
 rights practices as interference in its internal affairs.
 However, in 1984 Government media engaged in a critique of
 last year's edition of this Report as it related to Guyana.
 Guyanese comments ranged from outright denunciation to more
 moderate discussions of the Report's contents and conclusion.
 Although visits by international human rights organizations
 have not been encouraged, they have been permitted. In 1982,
 Amnesty International sent observers to the trials of Donald.
 Rodney, accused in the death of his brother, the leader of
 the Working People's Alliance, and of Ivan Sookram, a member
 Of the Working Peoples Alliance, accused of training and
 arming a group for the overthrow of the Government. Rodney
 was convicted, and his case is pending further appeal.
 Meanwhile he has been granted political asylum in the United
 Kingdom. Sookram's case was dismissed by the courts and
 subsequently reinstitututed several times before he was
 finally acquitted.
 The Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) is a
 non-governmental organization formed in late 1979 with support
 from trade unions, professional organizations and churches.
 The GHRA monitors human rights practices in Guyana and
 publishes periodic press releases and an annual report on
 human rights observance in Guyana. It gathers information
 from members, victims of human rights abuses, trade unionists,
 churchmen, other interested parties, official documents and
 newspapers. The Association has been quite effective in
 drawing international and regional attention to the human
 rights situation in Guyana. The GHRA claims that to preserve
 its objectivity, political activists are discouraged from
 holding executive positions. However, the government media
 have denounced the GHRA as an opposition entity, and the
 Government clearly is irritated by the GHRA's reporting.
 There has been no physical violence against human rights
 activists in Guyana. However, one prominent non-Guyanese
 member was fired from a teaching job at the University of
 Guyana without explanation.
 Guyana has generally not been active in international human
 rights forums but has paid considerable attention to human
 rights in South Africa, and is a member of the 'Committee on
 the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian
 People."
 
 
 565
 GUYANA
 In its 1983-84 Report, Freedom House rated Guyana as "partly
 free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Guyana has a population of 794,000, estimated to be growing at
 the rate of 0.4 percent per year, although many observers
 believe that it is actually declining as a result of
 emigration. The Guyanese economy is comprised of public,
 private, and cooperative sectors, with the public sector
 dominating. Agriculture and mining are the most productive
 activities with sugar, rice, and bauxite accounting for over
 80 percent of export earnings.
 Currently the economic outlook for Guyana is bleak. Declining
 production, obsolete plant and equipment, emigration of
 skilled personnel, deteriorating social services, and the
 Government's tight control of the economy along with its
 self-proclaimed socialist policies have all contributed to the
 current economic malaise. The Guyanese economy experienced no
 growth during 1982 or 1983, the GNP declining ten percent a
 year in-both years. Lower world market prices for Guyana's
 principal exports, relatively higher prices for essential
 imported goods such as petroleum, adverse weather conditions
 affecting rice and sugar production, and ineffective
 management have resulted in a continuing decline of Guyana's
 foreign exchange earnings and a reduction of the standard of
 living for most Guyanese. Guyana's dwindling foreign exchange
 earnings will decrease the country's capacity to import
 necessary raw materials, equipment, spare parts, fertilizers
 and insecticides, thereby further reducing production. In
 addition, business credit facilities have been closed off to
 local businessmen, as commercial and official debts remain
 unserviced. Unemployment is estimated at 25-30 percent.
 Inflation is estimated at 35 percent.
 The Government is taking various actions to cope with the
 severe economic crisis. It has instituted a system of foreign
 exchange allocations, whereby certain private and public
 corporations can retain a portion of their hard currency
 earnings in order to purchase raw materials and equipment.
 During 1984, the Government devalued the Guyanese dollar twice
 and announced that in the future it would use the exchange
 rate more flexibly as an instrument of economic policy.
 Negotiations to reach an agreement with the International
 Monetary Fund on a standby facility have occurred
 intermittently without success.
 The deterioration in the provision of essential services such
 as water, electrity, santitation, and health care has not been
 reversed in 1984. Although Guyanese have a life expectancy at
 birth of 70 years, the infant mortality rate is 33.6 per 1000
 live births.
 The Government has not allocated sufficient funds to maintain
 the standards of what was previously the best educational
 system in the region. Many school buildings are in poor
 condition, text books and exercise books are in short supply,
 and the number of teachers has declined. In 1980, the
 adjusted primary school enrollment rate was 103 percent for
 males and 105 percent for females. In 1970, Guyana had an
 estimated adult literacy rate of 91.6 percent. Since 1975 the
 
 
 566
 GUYANA
 Government has had a formal policy of providing free education
 from nursery school to university, although it has proven too
 costly to fully fund.
 The Government has been accused of politicizing education,
 which critics cite as a principal cause of declining
 educational standards. In a December 1984 edition of the
 Chronicle entitled *Moulding Students From an Early Age," the
 most important objectives of the future President's College
 were cited as 'productive work habits, the cooperative ethic
 and an ideological commitment to socialism." Some teachers
 already selected to work at the school will undergo 'special
 orientation and training' in Cuba.
 Racially, the Guyanese population is divided into 51 percent
 East Indian, 43 percent African and mixed Africans, 4 percent
 Amerindian, and 2 percent European and Chinese. Despite
 complaints that the Government discriminates against
 nonsupporters of the ruling party, social services and
 employment in the public sector appear to be open to all in a
 nondiscriminatory fashion. However, in late 1984, Government
 raids of private business firms accused by the Government of
 selling illegally imported goods prompted some Indo-Guyanese
 to conclude that the raids were racially motivated.
 The Burnham Government has emphasized the role of women in
 development and, in general, has acted to protect and promote
 women's rights. In 1983, the Government passed legislation to
 erase the stigma of illegitimacy in Guyanese society and to
 accord certain legal rights to the children of unwed mothers.
 President Burnham has appointed many women to governmental and
 party posts. Guyanese women are serving as government
 ministers, judges, magistrates, lawyers, doctors, teachers,
 diplomats and businesswomen. A woman was the Government's
 preferred candidate for the presidency of the Trade Union
 Congress. Afro-Guyanese women are among the principal
 supporters of the ruling party. Nevertheless, most women
 continue to occupy their traditional role as homemakers, and
 Guyana remains a male-dominated society.
 Guyana's foreign exchange shortage has forced the Government
 to sharply curtail imports of many food items. The ban on
 imports of wheat flour and split peas, basic items in Guyanese
 diets, has been particularly unpopular. Since adequate
 supplies of substitute foods at reasonable prices are not
 readily available, this policy may have caused nutritional and
 dietary problems. Opponents allege that the Government's
 policy has resulted in an increase in child mortality from
 malnutrition-related causes. The Guyana Human Rights
 Association asserts that during the first seven months of
 1984, 96 of the 176 children admitted to the Public Hospital
 Georgetown died, allegedly suffering from malnutrition. In
 general, defenders of the Government's food self-sufficiency
 policy argue that although there admittedly is a food
 distribution problem there is no shortage of food. Results of
 a 1982 international study on the extent of malnutrition in
 Guyana have not yet been processed and tabulated.
