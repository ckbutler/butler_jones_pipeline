 BAHRAIN
 The extended family of the Al Khalifa has ruled Bahrain since the late 18th cen-
 tury and dominates its society and government. The Constitution confirms the Amir
 as hereditary ruler. The current Amir, Shaikh Isa bin Sulman Al Khalifa, governs
 Bahrain with the assistance of his brother, the Prime Minister, his son, the Crown
 Prince; and an appointed Cabinet of Ministers. The Government has suspended
 some provisions of Bahrain's 1973 Constitution, including those articles relating to
 the National Assembly, which the Government disbanded in 1975. There are few ju-
 dicial checks on the Amir and the actions of his Government.
 Bahrain's is a relatively heterogeneous society in which social ties and inter-
 personal associations sre formed in a complex web of family, tribal, economic, and
 religious affiliations. Bahrainis belong to the Shi'a and Sunni sects of Islam, with
 the Shi'a comprising over two-thirds of the indigenouip population. There are impor-
 tant sectarian and ethnic divisions among the Shi'a. Despite their minority status,
 the Sunnis predomiKinth because the ruling family, supported by the armed forces,
 the security service, and powerful merchant families, is Sunni.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security. Under its auspices, the
 police force and the extensive and highly effective Security Service are responsible
 for maintaining internal order and preventing sectarian violence and terrorist ac-
 tions. According to the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, total military
 expenditures for 1989 were $196 million. Defense spending decreased somewhat
 over last year and willprobably remain constant for the near future.
 Bahrain has a mixed economy, with government ownership of many basic indus-
 tries, including the important oil and aluminum industries. Possessing limited oil
 reserves, Bahrain is intensifying efforts to diversify its economic base and has at-
 tracted companies doing business in financial services, petrochemicals, and light
 manufacturing. It has used its oil revenues to build an advanced infrastructure in
 transportation and telecommunications and has become a leading regional financial
 center.
 There was little formal change in the human rights situation, although some gov-
 ernment restrictions on speech and assembly were informally relaxed. Over a third
 of all political prisoners and detainees were released by Amiri decree, an amnesty
 was decreed for Bahraini exiles living abroad, and a new legislative council (majlis
 al-shura) was initiated with the right to question ministers and initiate legilation.
 Civil liberties, however, remained circumscribed. Principal human rights concerns
 continue to include the occasional practice of arbitrary and incommunicado deten-
 tion; the absence of impartial inspection of detention and prison facilities; restric-
 
 
 tions on the right to a fair public trial, especially in the Security Court; and restric-
 tions on freedom of speech and press, freedom of assembly and association, women's
 rights, and worker rights. Citizens do not have the right to change their govern-
 ment.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited by law, and there were no credible reports of torture in 1992.
 Little is known about what happens inside Bahrain's prisons, since nonofficial visits
 are generally prohibited. However, Bahrain's small size and social structure would
 make it extremely difficult for the Government to conceal abuses if they were fre-
 quent or systematic.
 The Government continues to deny that torture takes place, but it has not imple-
 mented procedural safeguards consistent with international norms that would help
 deter such practices, nor has it been willing to allow inspection of detention facilities
 by impartial international organizations. Allegations of torture, however invalid, are
 lent credence by government regulations permitting the practice of incommunicado
 detention and detention without trial. There were no known instances in 1992 of
 authorities being punished for human rights abuses committed in previous years.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were two known cases of arbitrary
 arrest and detention without trial in 1992. In both cases, the detainees were re-
 leased after 3 months. Political activity is strictly controlled by the Government.
 Under provisions of security law, most often applied to those suspected of
 antiregime activity, persons may be detained and arrested for attempting to exercise
 the rights of free speech, association, or other rights. However, in 1992 there was
 some loosening of control on activities previously considered "subversive.*
 Activities that could lead to detention, questioning, warning, or arrest include:
 membership in illegal organizations or those      deemed   subversive; painting
 antiregime slogans on walls; joining antigovernment demonstrations; possessing or
 circulating antiregime writings; preaching sermons with an extreme antiregime po-
 litical tone; or harboring or associating with persons committing such acts.
 Under the State Security Act of 1974, persons accused of subversive or antiregime
 acts may be detained without trial for a period not to exceed 3 years. Detainees
 have the right to appeal such detentions after a period of 3 months and, if the ap-
 peal is denied, every 6 months thereafter from the date of the original detention.
 Abdullah Fakhroo, detained in April, is believed to be the only person detained in
 1992 under the provisions of the 1974 Act. Mr. Fakhroo, who reportedly had also
 been charged with offenses under the 1976 Penal Code, was released from prison
 following his initial 3-month detention.
 The Government is not believed currently to be holding any prisoners without
 charge.
 The Ministry of Interior, in addition to overseeing the Security Service and police,
 also controls the office of the Public Prosecutor, whose officers initially determine
 if sufficient evidence exists to continue to hold a prisoner in "investigatory deten-
 tion." The Ministry is responsible for all aspects of prison administration. In the
 early stages of detention, prisoners and their attorneys have no recourse to any au-
 thority outside the Ministry of Interior.
 In the 1980's, following the Iranian revolution, there were confirmed reports that
 young Bahraini men suspected of antigvernment activity were forced to reside out-
 side Bahrain without benefit of trial. There were no such reports in 1992.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-A person arrested may be tried in an ordinary
 criminal court or, if required by the prosecution, in the Security Court. Ordinary
 civil or criminal trials provide procedural guarantees for an open trial, right to coun-
 sel (with legal aid available when necessary), and right to appeal.
 Procedures in Bahrain's Security Court do not meet international fair trial stand-
 ards. Security cases are tried directly by the Supreme Court of Appeal, sitting as
 the Security Court. The Security Court is exempted from adhering to the procedural
 guarantees of the Penal Code. Proceedings are held in secret, and there is no right
 to judicial review of the legality of arrests. Although there were no such reports in
 1992, in the past there have been credible allegations that convictions in the Secu-
 rity Court have been based solely on confessions obtained while in official custody
 and possibly elicited under duress. Of 11 Bahraini citizens who were tried by the
 Security Court in 1992, 8 were acquitted, 1 was released, 1 received a 2-year sen-
 
 
 986
 tence and 1 a 4-year sentence. Bahraini attorneys are appointed by the Ministry of
 Justice and Islamic Affairs to act as counsel. Some defense attorneys report that in
 the past they have been denied access to "secret information" upon which accusa-
 tions against their clients were based. Sentences imposed by the Security Court
 may, at the discretion of the Court or the request of the defendant's family, be re-
 ferred to the Amir for clemency. The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) maintains a sep-
 arate court system for military personnel accused of offenses under the Military
 Code. Military courts do not review cases involving civilian criminal or security of-
 fenses.
 The number of political prisoners in Bahrain cannot be determined because the
 Government does not release data on security cases, such cases are not tried in open
 court, and prisoners convicted of security offenses are not always allowed visits. Be-
 tween 220 and 270 persons are believed to be held in Bahraini prisons, some of
 whom may be political prisoners.
 Credible sources indicate that, while the number of prisoners has decreased in the
 past year, between 40 and 70 persons convicted in trials in previous years for
 antiregime activity remain in Bahraini jails. The conduct of these trials did not
 meet generally accepted international norms. The Government continued to release
 a small number of prisoners following Ramadan, but it is not known if this included
 po!itical prisoners. On December 30, the Government released 30 additional political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Accord-
 ing to Bahraini law, the Minist  of Interior is empowered to authorize entry into
 private premises without specific judicial intervention although the Ministry is
 thought to use such power infrequently. Telephone cals and correspondence are
 subject to monitoring. Police informer networks are extensive and sophisticated.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution provides for the right
 "to express and propagate opinions," Bahrainis are not, in practice, free publicly to
 challenge the legitimacy of, or even express opposition to the regime in speech or
 writing. Political meetings are not permitted. Gatherings that might take on a polit-
 ical tone frequently are monitored. However, the informal relaxation of some gov-
 ernmental restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly begun in 1991 continued
 in 1992, and private discussion of political issues was more widespread.
 The Information Ministry exercises broad authority over local media. AD news-
 papers are privately owned but routinely exercise self-censorship of stories on sen-
 sitive topics. The Government does not condone unfavorable coverage of its domestic
 affairs by the international media and in the past has occasionally revoked the press
 credentials of offending journalists. Since the Ministry also sponsors the journalists'
 residence permits, this action can lead to deportation.
 The State owns and operates all radio and television stations. Iranian radio and
 television broadcasts (in Arabic and Farsi) can be received. Many senior government
 officials, ruling family members, and major hotels use satellite dishes to watch
 international broadcasts, and more private citizens are using dishes to pull in tele-
 vision signals from outside Bahrain, although this is still theoretically illegal. Cable
 News Network (CNN) is now broadcast 3 hours a day on a local television channel
 without censorship and may soon be available on a 24-hour basis by subscription.
 The British Broadcasting Corporation's World News Service is carried on a local
 channel 24 hours a day, free of charge and uncensored. U.S. Armed Forces Radio
 is also available in a limited area of Manama, the capital.
 Although the Government has no formal regulations regarding limitations on aca-
 demic freedom, as a practical matter, academia tries to avoid contentious political
 issues. In general, there is greater latitude to discuss politics in an academic set-
 ting. Nevertheless, strict limits apply, and research, publications, and discussions
 critical of the Government are at best infrequent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution af-
 firms the right of free assembly, all public political demonstrations or meetings are
 prohibited. Political organizations are also prohibited, but many social and sports
 clubs have traditionally served as forums for discreet political discussion, although
 even these are closely monitored by the Government. Informal discussion of political
 issues is tolerated more now than in the past, but organized discussions and meet-
 ings are discouraged.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The population is overwhelmingly Muslim, and Islam is
 the state religion. However, Christians and other non-Muslims, including Jews, Hin-
 dus, and Baha'is, enjoy considerable freedom to practice their religion and build
 places of worship. Bibles and other Christian publications are displayed and sold
 openly in local bookshops, which also sell Islamic and other religious literature. Ad-
 
 
 987
 herents of faiths other than Islam also maintain places of worship; some small
 groups worship in their homes. Religious tracts of all Islamic sects, cassettes of ser-
 mons delivered by Muslim preachers from other countries, and publications of other
 religions are readily available.
 Proselytizing by non-Muslims is not encouraged and anti-Islamic writings are pro-
 hibited, but conversions from Islam to other religions are tolerated. Both Sunni and
 Shi'a sects are subject to government control and monitoring, but there is no inter-
 ference with routine worship, preaching, or religious activities. Public religious
 events, most notably commemorative marches by the Shi'a, are permitted but are
 closely watched by the police. There are no restrictions on the number of Bahrainis
 permitted to make pilgrimages to Shi'a shrines and holy sites in Iraq. However,
 owing to conditions inside Iraq, only a very few Bahrainis currently make suchpil-
 grimages. Religious study in, and pilgrimages to, Iran were strongly discourage in
 the past. Bahrainis are now free to visit Iran, although the Government continues
 to monitor such travel and scutinizes carefully those who choose to pursue religious
 study there.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Bahrainis are free to move within the country and change their place
 of residence or work. Passports, however, may be denied on political grounds. At
 least 3 to 5 percent of the indigenous Bahraini population, mostly Persian-origin
 Shi'a, do not have passports and cannot readily obtain them. Bahrainis living
 abroad who are suspected of political or criminal offenses may face arrest and trial
 u pon return to Bahrain. Shaikh Abdul Latif al-Mahmoud, a professor at Bahrain
 University, was briefly detained at Bahrain International Airport on December 14,
 1991, after arriving from Kuwait where he had participated in a debate in which
 he criticized the lack of democracy in the region. Al-Mahmoud was released on Jan-
 uary 1. Bahraini authorities reportedly banned him from delivering sermons at Fri-
 day prayer services.
 In 1992 the Government initiated an amnesty program to allow the return of cer-
 tain persons who, because of their known opposition to the Government, have re-
 sided outside of Bahrain since 1980. A total of 121 persons and several hundred
 family members were given permission to return to Bahrain, and the Government
 waived charges against them for disrupting the security of the State and violating
 passport andimmigration laws. A few amnestied dissidents have been picked up for
 resuming their activities, but all were released into the custody of their families
 after having been warned by the authorities.
 Generally, Bahrain does not accept refugees. However, in practice refugees are not
 repatriated to countries from which they have fled. Some Iranian emigres who fled
 Iran since 1979 have permission to remain in Bahrain, but they have not been
 granted citizenship. A similar group of 3 000 to 5,000 Persian-origin, Shi'a Bah-
 rainis, commonly known as Bidoon, enjoy less than full citizenship under the Bah-
 raini Citizenship Act of 1963. The law does not address the citizenship rights of per-
 sons who were not registered with Bahraini authorities prior to 1959, creating a
 legal lacuna for such persons and their descendants.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right or ability peacefully to change their government
 or their political system. Since the 1975 dissolution of the National Assembly, there
 have been no formal democratic institutions, and neither political parties nor opposi-
 tion organizations are permitted. All government positions are appointive. About
 one-third of the Cabinet ministers are Shi'a, although they do not hold security-re-
 lated offices. The ordinary Bahraini can attempt to influence government decisions
 through submission of written petitions and informal contact with senior officials,
 including appeals to the Amir and other officials at their regularly scheduled public
 audiences, called majlises. The Government on December 16 created an all-appoint-
 ive, 30-member consultative council, known as a majlis al-shura. This body will be
 drawn from Bahrain's Sunni and Shi'a business, religious, and professional commu-
 nities.
 In a manifestation of dissatisfaction in some circles with the slow pace of political
 change in Bahrain, a 1992 petition, which the Government allowed to circulate
 without hindrance, called upon the Amir to reinstate the elected National Assembly
 dissolved in 1975.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Because of the restrictions on freedom of association and expression in Bahrain,
 any independent, domestically based investigation and public criticism of the Gov-
 
 
 988
 ernment's human rights policies would face major obstacles. The Government has
 consistently characterized as baseless charges of torture and denial of access to de-
 tainees. The Government's formal invitation to Amnesty International had not re-
 sulted in arrangements for a visit by year's end.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Although there are notable exceptions, Sunni Muslims enjoy a favored status in
 Bahrain in comparison with the Shi'a. Sunnis generally receive preference for em-
 ployment in sensitive government positions, including the Bahraini Defense Force
 and managerial ranks in the civil service. Shi'a, however, occupy most of the senior
 positions in the major government-owned industries. In gener  emloyment oppor-
 tunities for Shi'a are more restricted than for Sunnis, an Shi's tndto be emp oyed
 in lower paid, less skilled jobs. Social and municipal services in most Shi'a neighbor-
 hoods, particularly in rural villages, are inferior to those found in Sunni urban com-
 munities. In an effort to remedy social discrimination, improve living conditions for
 the Shi'a, and encourage integration, the Government has built numerous sub-
 sidized housing complexes open to all Bahrainis on the basis of financial need.
 Islamic law (Shari's) governs the legal rights of Bahraini women. Specific rights
 vary according to Shi'a or Sunni interpretations of Islamic law, as determined by
 the person's faith or the court in which various contracts, including marriage, have
 been made. Bahraini labor law does not discriminate against women; however some
 women's groups complain about informal discrimination in the workplace, including
 inequalit of wages and denial of opportunity for advancement.
 While reth Shi'a and Sunni women have the right to initiate a divorce, the court
 may refuse their request. Shi'a women seeking divorce often must travel outside of
 Bahrain, as the Ja'afari sect courts in Bahrain are said to lack a religious scholar
 of sufficient rank to grant a divorce. Women of either sect may own and inherit
 property and may represent themselves in all public and legal matters. In the ab.
 sence of a direct male heir, Shi'a women may inherit all property; in contrast, Sunni
 women-in the absence of a direct male heir-inherit only a portion with the bal-
 ance being divided among uncles and male cousins of the deceased. In the event of
 divorce, the courts routinely grant Sunni women custody of daughters until mar-
 riage and custody of sons until puberty. Shi'a women are allowed custody of daugh-
 ters until the age of 9, and sons under age 7. In all circumstances except mental
 incapacitation, the father, regardless of custody, retains the right to make certain
 legal decisions for his children. A non-Bahraini woman automatically loses custody
 o her children if she divorces their Bahraini father. Women may obtain passports
 and leave the country without the permission of a male head of the household. Bah-
 raini women are free to wear the clothing of their choice (a large percentage wear
 Western dress outside the home), to work outside the home, and to drive a car with-
 out an escort. As the Bahraini economy has developed, women have increasingly
 taken jobs previously reserved for men.
 Women now constitute over 20 percent of the Bahraini work force. The Govern-
 ment has encouraged the hiring of women, enacted special laws to promote female
 entry into the work force, and is a leading employer of women. Generally, women
 work outside the home during the years between secondary school or university and
 marriage. Women make up the majority of students at Bahrain's universities. There
 are women's organizations which seek to improve the status of women under both
 civil and Islamic law.
 Some women have begun to express the view that, despite increasing female par-
 ticipation in the work force, women in Bahrain are not significantly advancing their
 rights and that much of their lack of progress is due to the influence of Islamic reli-
 ious traditionalists, especially in the government-run school system and in the
 Shari'a courts. Some women, however, desire a return to more traditional religious
 values and support calls for a return to Islamic patterns of social behavior.
 Violence against women is known to occur, but knowledge of incidents is usually
 kept within the family in this traditional society, and it is difficult to judge its ex-
 tent. In general, there is virtually no public attention to, or discussion of, violence
 against women and no government policies that address it. Women's groups and
 health care professionals state that spouse abuse is relatively common, particularily
 in poorer communities. There are very few known instances of Bahraini women
 seeking legal redress for violence, and anecdotal evidence suggests that the courts
 are not receptive to such cases.
 More evidence exists regarding violence against foreign women working as domes-
 tics in Bahrain. Infrequent cases of domestics being beaten and sexually abused
 have been reported to local embassies and the police. Most victims are too intimi-
 dated to sue their employers. Those who do, however, appear to be received sympa-
 thetically in the courts.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Constitution recognizes the right of
 workers to organize, there are no trade unions; their formation is actively discour-
 aged by the Government. In response to labor unrest in the mid.1950's and in 1965
 and 1974, the Government encouraged-and now closely ontrols-the formation of
 elected workers' ommittees in major omnpanies. Since 1982, when the Government
 granted permission to form the first joint labor-management consultative committee
 (.1CC), 12JCC's have been established in the major state-owned industries. The
 JCC's, composed of equal numbers of management and worker representatives and
 serving in a purely av   y role, over close to 70 percent of the island's indigenous
 industrial workers (but not foreign workers). Nonindustrial foreign workers, who
 comprise about 60 percent of the overall work force are denied participation even
 in these limited rights. The General Committee of Bahraini Workers (GCBW), estab-
 lished in 1983 by law, is a quasi-independent tripartite organization, controlled by
 its government and management representatives, that oversees and coordinates the
 work of the JCC's. The Committee also hears complaints from workers, Bahraini
 and foreign alike, and assists them in bringing their complaints to the attention of
 the Ministry of Labor or the courts. In March 1992, the ILO Committee on Freedom
 of Association reported that a Bahraini worker who had been incarcerated while
 serving as chairman of the GBCW in 1987 had been released and amnestied by the
 Bahramni authorities.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Bahraini law does not grant
 workers the right to organize and bargain collectively, and, in the absence of legiti-
 mate trade unions, there are no collective bargaining entities or collective agree-
 ments. While the JCC's described above are empowered to discuss labor disputes,
 organize workers' services, and discuss wages, working conditions, and productivity,
 the workers have no independent, recognized vehicle for representing their interests
 on these or other labor-related issues.
 Minimum wage rates are established by Council of Ministers' decree. Increases in
 wages above the minimum are set by management, with government salaries for
 comparable work serving as an informal guide.
 There are two export processing zones, but labor law and practice are the same
 in these zones as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is le-
 gally prohibited, and the Labor Ministry is charged with enforcing the law. The
 press has reported instances in which private sector employers occasionally com-
 pelled foreign workers from developing nations to perform work not specified in
 their contracts. Once a complaint has been lodged by a worker, the Labor Ministry
 opens an investigation and often takes appropriate remedial action. Many abuses,
 however, undoubtedly go unreported (see Section 6.e.).
 d. Minimum A~e for Employment of Children.-Juveniles under the age of 16 may
 not be employed in hazardous conditions or at night and may not work over 6 hours
 per day or on a piecework basis. Child labor laws are effectively enforced by Min-
 istry of Labor inspectors in the industrial sector, but child labor outside that sector
 is less well monitored.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wage scales, set by government de-
 cree, exist for both private and public sector employees and generally afford a decent
 standard of living for workers and their families. For foreign workers, employers
 consider benefits such as annual repatriation and housing and education bonuses
 part of the salary.
 In practice, however, foreign workers, particularly those from developing coun-
 tries, are disadvantaged by the requirement that all foreign workers be sponsored
 by Bahrainis or Bahrain-based institutions and companies. Sponsors are able to can-
 cel the residence permit of any person under their sponsorship and thereby blacklist
 them so that they cannot obtain entry or residence visas from another sponsor.
 Thus, foreign workers are ofen unwilling to report abuses for fear of forced repatri-
 ation. Instances of foreign workers being denied their guaranteed holidays, days off,
 and vacations without compensation have been reported by the English-language
 daily newspaper, which serves as an unofficial ombudsman for the foreign commu-
 nity.
 Bahrain's Labor Law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, man-
 dates acceptable conditions of work for all adult workers, including adequate stand-
 ards regarding hours of work (maximum 48 hours per week) and occupational safety
 and health.
 Bahrain's Labor Law does not recognize the concept of equal pay for equal work.
 Asian workers are paid lower wages than their Bahraini counterparts (excluding
 housing and educational allowances). Western expatriates and Bahraini workers are
 paid comparable wages; women are generally paid less than men.
 
 
 990
 Women are entitled to 60 days of paid maternity leave, nursing periods during
 the day, and up to 1 year of unpaid maternity leave.
