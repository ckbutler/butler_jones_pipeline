 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Constitution provides for a popularly elected President and a bicameral Con-
 gres. In ractice, the distribution of power has favored the executive branch. Fol-
 lowing a ree and fair presidential election in which political parties across the ideo-
 logical spectrum participated, Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Liberation Party
 assumed the presidency August 16. He replaced Joaquin Balaguer, who served as
 president for 22 of the past 30 years. The Government began an overhaul of the
 nominally independent judiciary, which was highly politicized in the past.
 The security forces are the National Police (IN), the National Department of In-
 vestigations (DNI), the National Drug Control Directorate (DNCD), and the military
 (army, air force, and navy). The PN is under the Secretary of the Interior and Po-
 lice; the military is under the Secretary of the Armed Forces; and the DNI and
 DNCD, which have personnel from both the police and the military, report directly
 to the President. The security forces are generally responsive to civilian executive
 branch authority. However, some members of the security forces continued to com-
 mit human rights abuses, sometimes with the tacit acquiescence of the civil authori-
 ties.
 The economy, once heavily dependent on sugar and other agricultural exports, has
 diversified; tourism and Free Trade Zones (FTZ's) are now major sources of income
 and employment. Remittances from abroad provide an estimated 10 percent of gross
 domestic product, which is about $1,572 per capita. State-owned firms such as the
 State Sugar Council (CEA), the Corporation for State Enterprises, and the Domini-
 can Electricity Corporation have impeded economic growth because of financial and
 administrative ineptitude.
 Principal human rights problems include continuing instances of extrajudicial
 killings by police, arbitrary detention and beatings of suspects, security services' re-
 fusal to obey judicial orders, interference with the judiciary, judicial corruption, mal-
 administration of the courts, poor prison conditions, detention of suspects relatives,
 
 
 abuses of Haitian migrants, compulsory labor, and impediments to free association.
 Workers in the state-owned sugar plantations and mills continued to work under
 deplorable conditions. Discrimination, violence against women, and prostitution are
 also serious problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KillingsThere were no reports of political
 killings, but there were 85 reports of extrajudicial killings by the security forces.
 These were usually committed by police pursuing suspects. In February an army pa-
 trol killed a child and wounded four others in the city of Santiago when it fired upon
 a vehicle which did not obey orders to stop. The officials were dismissed. In another
 incident, a pregnant 19-year-old woman died in police custody, allegedly from beat-
 ing during interrogation. In another incident, according to the press and human
 rights activists, a police officer entered a private home and shot a 17-year-old while
 he slept with his infant child. Although police dispute the killer was actually a police
 officer, human rights activists report the alleged killer has since been promoted.
 Military courts try military personnel charged with extrajudicial killings. Police
 tribunals have on occasion tried, convicted, and sentenced personnel charged with
 extrajudicial killings. According to press reports, police referred two cases of
 extrajudicial killings to civilian criminal courts in 1996.
 b. Disappearance.There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The case of Narciso Gonzalez, a university professor and critic of the Balaguer
 government, who disappeared in May 1994, continued to languish in the court sys-
 tem. The case came before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
 (IACHR) in October. The Fernandez Government then reopened the case. The police
 gave the Attorney General a detailed report of their findings, and the investigating
 judge interviewed dozens of people. Although there have been no indictments, the
 authorities appeared to be pursuing the case seriously and submitted a response to
 the IACHR in November.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other forms of physical abuse are illegal, but instances of security serv-
 ice personnel physically abusing detainees continued. Lack of supervision, training,
 and accountability throughout the law enforcement and corrections systems exacer-
 bate the problem of physical abuse. Human rights gups and the press reported
 numerous incidents of physical abuse of detainees while in custody. Such incidents
 included the reported beating of four accused car thieves while they were suspended
 by their wrists for several hours. In December the Attorney General publicly ac-
 cused the DNCD of practicing torture and called upon its director to stop the prac-
 tice. The authorities usually order little or no punishment for perpetrators of such
 abuse. Although punishment may range up to 5 years' incarceration for serious
 cases of abuse, as a rule judges have sentenced convicted officials to sentences rang-
 ing from a 1-month suspension to 6 months' incarceration.
 Prison conditions are poor. Prisons are grossly overcrowded, and health and sani-
 tary conditions are substandard. Conditions at the largest prison, La Victoria, pose
 a serious threat to life and health. Suspects awaiting trial are kept with convicts
 serving their sentences. The Government estimated that in September there were
 500 prisoners awaiting trial at La Victoria who have been jailed longer than the
 maximum sentence for their crime.
 Juveniles are at times held with adult offenders. The Attorney General in Septem-
 ber estimated that as many as 300 minors were in custody in La Victoria prison.
 Some prison personnel reportedly engage in extortion and other corrupt activities,
 and most prisoners find it necessary to rely on relatives or their own finances to
 be fed adequately. Medical care suffers from a lack of supplies and available physi-
 cians.
 Shortly after the new Government took office, inmates rioted in several prisons,
 including three times at La Victoria. The Government responded with an overhaul
 of the penal system in conjunction with its program of judicial reform. The authori-
 ties took a census of all the prisons, and the Attorney General's office began a case-
 by-case review of all prisoners. The authorities segregated minors, the infirm, and
 the mentally ill from other prisoners. They began a renovation program, starting at
 La Victoria, and sent medical teams to visit the prisons. Prisoners are now allowed
 access to telephones and recreation programs are under consideration.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that authori-
 ties may detain suspects for a maximum of 48 hours before arraignment, after
 which they must charge or release them. However, in special circumstances, sus-
 
 
 pts may be detained for longer periods with the approval of the prosecutor's office.
 rity forces continued to violate constitutional provisions by detaining suspects
 for 'investigation" or "interrogation" beyond the prescribed 48-hour limit. Security
 forces traditionally detain all suspects and witnesses in a crime and use the inves-
 tigative process to determine which ones are innocent and merit release and which
 ones they should continue to hold. Under the new Government, police commanders
 must report the previous day's arrests to the local prosecutor to preclude abuse of
 the 48-hour limit.
 The DNCD and National Police continued to engage in indiscriminate roundups
 of people in poorer neighborhoods. The security forces also continued to detain rel-
 atives and friends of suspected criminals with the aim of forcing the surrender of
 suspects. Civil authorities have not acted to curb these abuses.
 While the law does not prohibit exile, there are no known cases of citizens in
 forced exile. Before the June 30 presidential election, a former prosecutor, who while
 abroad charged that senior Dominican officials were involved in corruption and drug
 trafficking, was not allowed to return. The IACHR heard the case but has not re-
 leased any findings. After the election, she entered the country without incident.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tral.-Although the Constitution stipulates an independ-
 ent judiciary, in practice, interference from other public and private entities, includ-
 ing the executive branch, substantially undermines judicial independence.
 The judicial system was in flux during the second half of the year. In August the
 National Judicial Council (CNM) was finally named after being mandated by the
 1994 constitutional reforms. The seven-member CNM includes the President and
 legislators from both houses of Congress, the president of the Supreme Court, and
 a second supreme court justice. Beginning in September, the council held its first
 meetings, which dealt with procedural matters. Historically the Senate chose all
 judges, but the constitutional reforms ended the Senate's exclusive role in appoint-
 ing judges and provide for a professional career service for judges, including lifelong
 appointments. The CNM is to appoint justices of the Supreme Court, and they will
 name judges to the lower courts. At year's end, the CNM had not named the justices
 for the new Supreme Court. The autonomy of the judiciary remains in question.
 The Constitution provides for public trial. The courts normally appoint lawyers at
 public expense for indigent defendants in felony cases but rarely in criminal mis-
 iemeanor cases. The judicial system is plagued by chronic delays. Many suspects
 suffer long pretrial detention; nearly 86 percent of the prison population is awaiting
 trial. There are also perennial accusations of corruption. The judicial system pro-
 vides for bail. However, cases in which bail is posted rarely come to trial, cir-
 cumventing the intended purpose of bail.
 Military or police courts have jurisdiction over members of the security forces, but
 a military or police board frequently remands cases involving capital crimes (mur-
 der, rape, etc.) to civilian courts for review after dishonorable discharge.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Gen-
 erally, the Government does not arbitrarily use wiretapping or other surreptitious
 methods to interfere with the private lives of persons or families and observes con-
 stitutional provisions against invasion of the home. The authorities may only search
 a residence in the presence of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, or in cases
 of "hot pursuit," or where there is reason to believe that a crime is in progress.
 The security forces continued to detain relatives and friends of suspects to try to
 compel suspects to surrender (see Section 1.d.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these freedoms, and the
 Government usually respects them in practice. During the presidential campaign,
 a court tried a journalist, Juan Bolivar Diaz, in absentia and sentenced him to 6
 months' imprisonment for libel for a book that set forth the case for fraud in the
 1994 elections. The incident provoked vigorous public protest; Diaz appealed the
 sentence and remained free at year's end.
 Citizens of all political persuasions exercise freedom of speech. The numerous pri-
 vately owned radio and television stations broadcast all political points of view. A
 1971 law prohibits foreign-language broadcasts.
 The Government controls one television station but no major newspapers. News-
 papers freely reflect independent and opposition points of view. Although journalists
 operate in a relatively tolerant environment, some self-censorship exists for fear of
 retaliation, ranging from loss of influence to loss of employment.
 Public and private universities enjoy broad academic freedom. The main public
 university, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, with approximately
 35,000 students, has no restrictions on enrollment and maintains a policy of non-
 
 
 intervention (other than curriculum development) in classroom affairs. The Govern-
 ment exerts no control over private universities, except for the preservation of
 standards, and teachers are free to espouse their own theories without government
 oversight.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these freedoms, which the Government commonly respects in practice. Outdoor pub-
 lic marches and meetings require permits, which the Government usually grants.
 Political parties freely affiliate with their foreign counterpart organizations. Profes-
 sional organizations of lawyers, doctors, teachers, and others function freely and can
 maintain relations with counterpart international bodies of diverse political philoso-
 phies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination on religious
 grounds, and the Government does not interfere with the practice of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriatlon.-Citizens face no unusual legal restrictions on travel within or outside
 the country.
 Haitians continue to come to the Dominican Republic, some legally but most un-
 documented, in search of economic opportunity. Throughout the year, security
 forces, particularly the army, repatriated undocumented Haitian nationals believed
 to be in the country illegally. The expulsions occurred in various regions of the coun-
 try. Thousands were expelled immediately prior to the May 16 presidential election,
 but there was no noticeable upsurge in expulsions prior to the June 30 runoff elec-
 tion or since. According to international and Dominican human rights groups and
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), during the first few
 months of the year, Haitian deportees were humiliated by having their heads
 shaved and painted and being left without their belongings far from where they live
 in the country. The UNHR reported that there were 607 Haitian refugees.
 According to a 1984 law, an applicant for refugee status must be referred to the
 National Committee for Refugees by the National Office of Refugee Affairs, which
 has not been established. Instead, the Department of Immigration issues docu-
 mentation to UNHCR-certified refugees. While these documents are accepted by the
 police and immigration officials, the process by which they are issued does not coi-
 ply  with the law.
 TeGovernment cooperates with the UNH-CR and other humanitarian organiza-
 tions in assisting refugees. The Government provides fwrst asylum and reettiement.
 The Government provided documentation in 14 asylum cases in 1996; there were
 no resettlements. There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country
 where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy. The President, all 150
 members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, and the mayors and city council
 members of more than 100 municipaities are freely elected every 4 years by _secret
 ballot and universal adult suffrage. Active duty police and military personnel may
 not vote. The President appoints the governors of the 29 provinces. Opposition
 groups of the left, right, andcenter operate openly.
 Presidential elections were held on May 16 with a runoff election between the two
 top contenders on June 30. A new system of voting was used to reduce opportunities
 for fraud. There were accusations from all sides of attempted fraud and other irreg-
 ularities, including vote suppression through buying or confiscating voter identifica-
 tion cards. In spite of these accusations, international and Dominican observers
 praised the  o e   t   e cleanest elections in the country's history; the losing can-
 dates accepted the results; and power wastranfrred pe ascefully and smoothly.
 The nation has a functioning multiparty system. In practice the Presient can
 dominate public policy formulation and implementation. He can exercise his author-
 ity through the use of the veto, discretion to act by decree, and influence asthe
 leader of his party. Traditionally, the President has predominant power in the Gov-
 ernment, effectively making many important decisions by decree.
 Congress had limited power under the previous government. The two main opposi-
 tion parties and their allies combined hold 88 and 96 percent of the lower and upper
 houses, respectively, leaving President Fernandez's party with scant congressional
 presence. The Congress also provides an open forum for the free exchange of views
 and debate.
 Women and minorities confront no serious legal impediments to political partici-
 pation. Women hold 14 seats in the 120-member House of Deputies and 1 seat in
 the 30-membor Senate. Women continue to have representation in appointed posi-
 
 
 tions, albeit limited. One of the 15 Cabinet secretaries is a woman, and women hold
 3 of 29 provincial governorships.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental human rights organizations operate freely without govern-
 mental interference. In addition to the Dominican Human Rights Committee, sev-
 eral other Haitian, church, and labor groups exist.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race and sex. Such discrimination ex-
 ists in society, but the Government has not acknowledged its existence or made ef-
 forts to combat it.
 Women.-Domestic violence and sexual harassment are widespread. There are no
 laws protecting citizens from abuse by their spouses, and victims rarely report such
 abuse.
 The Government does not vigorously enforce prostitution laws. Sex tourism is a
 growing industry, particularly in the north coast resort city of Sosua. The Govern-
 ment has no program in the area to educate prostitutes about the dangers of sexu-
 ally transmitted diseases. Dominican women are also victims of rings that smuggle
 third-world women to Europe to work as prostitutes in conditions rife with exploi-
 tation and mistreatment. Corruption and a reluctance to restrict emigration hinder
 enforcement of the law.
 Divorce is easily obtainable by either spouse, and women can hold property in
 their own names apart from their husbands. Traditionally, women have not shared
 al social and economic status or opportunit with men, and men hold the over-
 welming majority of leadership positions in a sectors. In many instances women
 are paid less than men in jobs of equal content and equal skill level. Some employ-
 ers in industry reportedly give pregnancy tests to women before hiring them, as part
 of a medical examination. Some employers have stated, and workers confirm, that
 pregnant women are not hired.
 Children.-The former government did not support its professed commitment to
 child welfare with financial and human resources. Despite the existence of govern-
 ment institutions dedicated to child welfare, private social and religious organiza-
 tions carry the principal burden. The private institutions receive no government fi-
 nancig. In September at a gathering of children celebrating National Children's
 RightsDay, President Fernandez promised the Government's full support to the en-
 tities charged with implementing the 1994 Minor's Code. The law requires only 6
 years of formal education.
 The most serious abuse involving children is the failure of the judicial system o
 protect the status of minors in criminal cases. The authorities somei mes treated
 minors as adults and incarcerated them in prison rather than juvenile detention
 centers. Courts for minors, mandated by the code, have not been established.
 The unimplementd Minor's Code contains provisions against child abuse, includ-
 ing physical and emotional mistreatment, sexual exploitation, and child labor. It
 also provides for removal of a mistreated or delinquent child to a protective environ-
 ment. However, according to local monitors, instances of child abuse were under-
 reported because of traditional beliefs that family problems should be dealt with in-
 side the family. Some in the tourist industry have provided or facilitated sexual ex-
 ploitation of children. Tours are marketed overseas with the understanding that
 bosand girls can be found for sex partners.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled persons encounter discrimination in employ-
 ment and provision of other services. Although the law contains provisions for phys-
 ical access for the disabled to all new puleiic and private buildings, the authorities
 have not uniformly enforced this law.
 National/Racil/ Ethnic Minorities.-Domiicans are strongly prejudiced against
 Haitians, many of whom are illegal imiants and constitute a significant percent-
 age of the unskilled manual labor force. The.Government has not acknowledged the
 existence of this discrimination nor made any efforts to ombat it. Darker-skined
 Dominicans also face informal barriers to social and economic advancement.
 Credible sources charge that the Government at times refuses to recognize indi-
 viduals of Haitian ancestry born in the country as Dominican citizens. Lack of docu-
 mentation also sometimes hinders the ability of children of Haitian descent to at-
 tend school where there is one available; some parents fail to seek documentation
 for fear of being deported.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the freedom to orga-
 nize labor unions and also for the right of workers to strike (and for private sector
 employers to lock out workers). All workers, except the military and police, are free
 to organize, and workers in all sectors exercise this right.
 Requirements for calling a strike include the support of an absolute majority of
 the workers of the company, a prior attempt to resolve the conflict through arbitra-
 tion, written notification to the labor secretariat, and a 10-day waiting period follow-
 ing notification before proceeding with a strike. The Government respects associa-
 tion rights and places no obstacles to union registration, affiliation, or the ability
 to en gage in legal strikes.
 The Labor Code specifies in detail the steps legally required to establish a union,
 federation, and confederation. The code calls for automatic recognition of a union
 if the Government has not acted on its application within a specific time. Inprac-
 tice, the Government has readily facilitated recognition of labor organizations. Orga-
 nized labor represents little more than 10 percent of the work force and is divided
 among three major confederations, four minor confederations, and a number of inde-
 pendent unions. Unions are independent of the Government and political parties.
 There were two instances of union members being fired without cause. The unions
 have brought these cases to court, and the cases were still under consideration at
 year's end. Widespread discreet intimidation of union activity was reported. For ex-
 ample, union members in free trade zones (FTZ's) report that they hesitate to dis-
 cuss union activity at work, even during break time, for fear of losing their jobs.
 Labor unions can and do freely affiliate regionally and internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is law-
 ful and may take place in firms in which a union has gained the support of an abso-
 lute majority of the workers. Only a minority of companies has collective bargaining
 pacts. The Labor Code stipulates that workers cannot be dismissed because of their
 trade union membership or activities.
 The Labor Code establishes a system of labor courts for dealing with disputes, but
 their effectiveness is limited by lack of resources and political-judges. Some labor
 courts enjoy reputations for honesty, depending on the presiding judge. Labor courts
 exist in five jurisdictions, but the prob ems that the courts were established to ad-
 dress still prevail in the rest of the country
 The Labor Code applies in the 32 established FTZ's, which employ a pproximately
 170,000 workers, mostly women. Workplace regulations and their enforcement in
 the FTZ's do not differ from those in the country at large, although working condi-
 tions are sometimes better. Some FTZ companies have a history of discharging
 workers who attempt to organize unions. Although there are approximately 70
 unions in the FTZ's, many exist only on paper. The majority are affiliated with the
 National Federation of Free Trade Zone Workers.
 The State Sugar Council (CEA) employs workers from more than 100 unions. Do-
 minican workers predominate in most of the unions, although two unions are Hai-
 tian-dominated. The CEA has long maintained a negative attitude toward additional
 organizing efforts.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor.
 There were numerous credible reports of forced or coerced overtime in factories.
 Employers particularly in the FTZ's, sometime locked the exit doors of factories at
 the normal closing time so that workers could not leave. There have been reports
 of workers being fired for refusing to work overtime, and both employers and work-
 ers state that newly hired workers are not informed that overtime is optional.
 Haitian sugar cane workers continued to encounter restrictions on their freedom
 of movement. These include armed guards on the plantations who try to find depart-
 ing workers before they leave company lands. While pay is still low and living condi-
 tions harsh, experts from NGO's and unionists agree that working and living condi-
 tions among Haitian cane workers have improved in the past 5 years.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code prohibits employ-
 ment of children under 14 years of age and places restrictions on the employment
 of children under the age of 16. These restrictions include a limitation of no more
 than 6 hours of daily work, no employment in dangerous occupations or establish-
 ments serving alcohol, and limitations on nighttime work. The law requires 6 years
 of formal education.
 The high level of unemployment and lack of a social safety net create pressures
 on families to allow children to earn supplemental income. Tens of thousands of
 children work selling newspapers, shining shoes, or cleaning cars, often during
 school hours. The Government has proposed a fine for the parents of truant chil-
 dren.
 
 
 There were no reports of child labor among cane cutters.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution provides the Government
 with legal authority to set minimum wage levels and the Labor Code assigns this
 task to a National Salary Committee. Congress may also enact minimum wage leg-
 islation. The minimum wage is approximately $75 (1,014 pesos) per month. This
 covers only a fraction of the living costs of a family in Santo Domingo, but many
 workers receive only the minimum wage. For example, 60 percent of government
 employees earn only the minimum wage.
 The Labor Code establishes a standard work period of 8 hours per day and 44
 hours per week. The code also stipulates that all workers are entitled to 36 hours
 of uninterrupted rest each week. In practice, a typical workweek is Monday through
 Friday plus a half a day on Saturday, but longer hours are not unusual. The code
 grants workers a 35 percent differential for work over 44 hours up to 68 hours per
 week and double time for any hours above 68 hours per week.
 The Dominican Social Security Institute (IDSS) sets workplace safety and health
 conditions. The existing social security system does not apply to all workers and is
 underfunded. Both the IDSS and the Labor Secretariat have small corps of inspec-
 tors charged with enforcing standards. Inspector positions are customarily filed
 through political patronage. In practice, workers cannot remove themselves from
 hazardous workplace situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
 Conditions for agricultural workers are in general much worse, especially in the
 sugar industry. On many sugar plantations, cane cutters are paid by the weight of
 cane cut rather than hours worked. Many cane cutters earn approximately $3.70 (50
 pesos) per day. Many worker villages have high rates of disease and lack schools,
 medical facilities, running water, and sewage systems.
