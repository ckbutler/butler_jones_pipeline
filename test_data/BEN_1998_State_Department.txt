 BENIN
 The Republic of Benin is a constitutional democracy headed by President Mathieu
 Kerekou, who was inaugurated on April 4, 1996, after elections that were generally
 viewed as free and fair. President Kerekou, who ruled Benin as a Socialist military
 dictator from 1972 to 1989, succeeded his democratically elected predecessor and
 continued the civilian, democratic rule begun in the 1990-1991 constitutional proc-
 ess that ended his previous reign. There are 18 political parties represented in the
 unicameral, 82-member National Assembly; no party or political grouping com-
 mands a majority of seats. The Government respects the constitutional provision for
 an independent judiciary; however, the judiciary is inefficient and susceptible to cor-
 ruption.
 The civilian-controlled security forces consist of the armed forces, headed by the
 Minister Delegate for Defense Matters in the office of the President, and the police
 force under the Interior Minister. The two Ministers also share authority over the
 gendarmerie, which exercises police functions in rural areas. The armed forces con-
 tinued to play an apolitical role in government affairs despite concerns about morale
 within its ranks and its ethnic imbalance.
 An extremely poor country with average yearly per capita income below $450, the
 country's economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, re-
 gional trade (including transshipment of goods to neighboring countries), and small-
 scale offshore oil production. The port of Cotonou serves as a major conduit for goods
 entering neighboring Nigeria legally and illegally. The Kerekou Administration con-
 tinued, and in some cases stepped up, the austerity program begun by its prede-
 cessor; privatized state-owned enterprises; reduced fiscal expenditures; and deregu-
 lated trade. In spite of its bloated and inefficient bureaucracy, high debt servicing
 costs, and widespread unemployment, Benin's economic recovery continued under
 liberal economic policies instituted since the return to democracy. Although the
 economy expanded, real growth was lower than in previous years, primarily because
 of an extended electricity crisis that began in February and had still not been re-
 solved fully by year's end. Real growth was estimated at between 4 and 5 percent;
 inflation was also higher than in previous years, estimated at between 3 and 5 per-
 cent because of the electricity crisis.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. The major
 human rights problems continued to be the failure of police forces to curtail acts
 of vigilantism and mob justice; serious administrative delays in processing ordinary
 criminal cases with attendant denial of timely, fair trials; judicial corruption; harsh
 and unhealthy prison conditions; societal discrimination and violence against
 women; and the trafficking in and abuse of children. The practice of female genital
 mutilation (FGM) is also a problem. The Constitutional Court continued to dem-
 onstrate independence. On several occasions during the year, the court ruled that
 legislation proposed by the Government and approved by the National Assembly
 was defective. On each occasion the legislation was redrafted to satisfy the coures
 objections, then reapproved by the legislature before promulgation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government officials. However, as in previous years,
 
 
 incidents of mob justice were reported by the media. These were most often cases
 of suspected criminals being killed or severely injured, particularly thieves caught
 in the act. Although a number of these incidents took place in urban areas and were
 publicized in the press, the Government apparently made no concerted attempt to
 investigate -or prosecute anyone involved. Some press accounts suggested that the
 police deliberately ignored vigilante attacks.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices and there were no reports that officials
 employed them. The Government continued to make payments to victims of torture
 under the military regime that ruled from 1972 to 1989.
 Prison conditions continued to be extremely harsh. Extensive overcrowding and
 lack of proper sanitation and medical facilities posed a risk to prisoners' health. The
 prison diet is seriously inadequate; malnutrition and disease are common. Prisoners
 are allowed to meet with visitors such as family members, lawyers, and others.
 Some progress was made during the year -with the opening of three modern facili-
 ties in the departments (provinces) of Borgou, Mono, and Atacora with funding from
 the French Government. The prisons provide, for the first time, separate units for
 men, women, and minors. The Government is expected to continue its plan for pris-
 on renovation, rehabilitation, and construction with assistance from foreign do-
 nors-both governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's).
 -The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile; however, at times the authorities arbitrarily arrested and
 detained persons. The Constitution prohibits detention for more than 48 hours with-
 out a hearing by a magistrate whose order is required for continued detention. How-
 ever, there were credible reports that authorities exceeded this 48-hour limit in
 many cases, sometimes by as long-as 1 week, using the accepted practice of holding
 a person without specified time limit "at the disposition of' the public prosecutor's
 office before presenting the case to a magistrate. Approximately 75 percent of per-
 sons in prison are pretrial detainees. Arbitrary arrest is not routine but does occur
 occasionally.
 The Constitution prohibits forced exile of citizens. Many citizens who went into
 exile prior to the establishment of democratic rule have returned.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. However,
 the executive-has important powers in regard to the judiciary.
 The President appoints career magistrates as judges in civil courts, and the Con-
 stitution gives the Ministry of Justice administrative authority over judges, includ-
 ing the power to transfer them. Inadequate facilities, poorly trained staff, and over-
 crowded dockets result in slow administration of justice. The low salaries of mag-
 istrates and clerks have a demoralizing effect on their commitment to efficient and
 timely justice and make them susceptible to corruption.
 The legal system is based on French civil law and local customary law. The Con-
 stitution provides for the right to a fair public trial. A defendant enjoys the pre-
 sumption of innocence and has the right to be present at trial and to representation
 by an attorney, at public expense if necessary. In practice the court provides indi-
 gent defendants with court-appointed counsel upon request. A defendant also has
 the right to confront witnesses and to have access to government-held evidence.
 Trials are open to the public, but in exceptional circumstances the president of the
 court may decide to restrict access to preserve public order or to protect the parties.
 A civilian court system operates on the national and provincial levels. Military
 disciplinary councils deal with minor offenses by members of the military services,
 but have no jurisdiction over civilians. There is only one court of appeals. The Su-
 preme Court is the court of last resort in all administrative and judicial matters.
 The Constitutional Court is charged with passing on the constitutionality of laws
 and disputes between the President and the National Assembly and with resolving
 disputes regarding presidential and National Assembly elections. Its rulings against
 both the executive and legislative branches indicated its independence from both
 these branches of Government. The Constitution also provides for a High Court of
 Justice to convene in the event of crimes committed by the President or government
 ministers against the State. Implementing legislation to create the High Court of
 Justice was passed in 1996. Although the legislation was passed, the Constitutional
 Court later found some of its provisions to be unconstitutional. As of year's end, the
 legislature had sent the revised bill again to the Constitutional Court for an advi-
 sory opinion before final promulgation.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, and government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions in practice. Police are required to obtain a judicial warrant before
 entering a private home, and they usually observed this requirement in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. The govern-
 ment entity with oversight responsibility for media operations is the High Authority
 for Audio-visual Media and Communications (HAAC), which requires broadcasters
 to submit weekly lists of planned programs and requires publishers to deposit copies
 of all publications with it. However, this requirement is not observed by the media
 in practice.
 There is a large and active privately owned press consisting of about a dozen
 newspapers. These publications criticize the Government freely and -often, but their
 effect on public opinion is limited because of their urban concentration. The majority
 of Beninese are illiterate and live in rural areas.
 New privately owned radio and television stations began broadcasting in Decem-
 ber 1997. Throughout the year, they broadcast programs that criticized the Govern-
 ment without interference. It is unclear what impact the private electronic media
 have on public opinion; however, an increase in the number of "call-in" and panel
 shows has contributed to greater public involvement in political affairs and a height-
 ened awareness of important national problems.
 The Government, however, continued to own and operate the media most influen-
 tial in reaching the public. Until December 1997, it owned the only radio stations
 that transmitted locally. The Benin Office of Radio and Television (ORTB) transmits
 on the F.M. and A-M. bands and by short wave, in French and local languages.
 Radio France International (RFI) also transmits on a local F.M. band under an
 agreement with the Government. Five rural radio stations governed by local com-
 mittees broadcast several hours a day exclusively in local languages. These stations
 receive support from ORTB. Radio is probably the most important information me-
 dium.
 A similar arrangement is in place for television transmissions: ORTB broadcasts
 5 hours per day on a signal that is easily received in urban areas. Approximately
 80 percent of ORTB's television programming is in French. TV5, a commercial ven-
 ture with investments by television broadcasting organizations in France, Canada,
 Belgium, and Switzerland, broadcasts locally 24 hours per day entirely in French
 under an agreement with the Government. A new privately owned television sta-
 tion, LC-2, began broadcasting during the year. LC-2, which also broadcasts 24
 hours per day, is owned entirely by a local businessman and features light enter-
 tainment. Although neither television station broadcasts partisan programs in sup-
 port of or unduly critical of the Government, the vast majority of news programming
 centers on government officials' activities.
 The Government does not censor works by foreign journalists, authors, or artists.
 HAAC regulations govern satellite reception equipment and movie and video
 clubs. There is little enforcement of these regulations.
 In general academic freedom is respected. University professors are permitted to
 lecture freely, conduct research, and publish their work.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice. The Govern-
 ment requires permits for use of public places for demonstrations and requires asso-
 ciations to register. It routinely grants such permits and registrations. The Govern-
 ment did not take any actions against nonregistered organizations for failure or re-
 fusal to register.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 pauatriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erlyrespects them in practice. However, the presence of police, gendarmes, and
 ilegal roadblocks impedes domestic movement. Although ostensibly meant to en-
 force automotive safety and customs regulations, many of these checkpoints serve
 as a means for officials to exact bribes from travelers. The Government maintained
 previously implemented measures to combat such petty corruption at roadblocks.
 The Government's policy toward transhumance allows migratory Fulani herdsmen
 from other countries to enter freely; it does not enforce designated entry points.
 The Government does not restrict international travel for political reasons, and
 those who travel abroad may return without hindrance.
 
 
 Historically, the Government has cooperated closely with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in as-
 sisting refugees, including those in need of first asylum. The Government provided
 first asylum to up to 200,000 citizens of Togo during the 1993 political violence in
 that country. While most have returned to Togo, the UNHCR estimates that some
 700 remain. Despite severe economic pressures that limit its ability to provide edu-
 cation for its children, the Government has allowed these Togolese to enroll their
 children in local schools and to participate in some economic activities.
 In contrast, the UNHCR estimates that 714 Ogoni refugees from Nigeria, dis-
 advantaged because they do not speak French, cannot work in Benin, nor can their
 children attend Beninese schools. UNHCR officials have warned them to remain
 within the confines of the refugee camp.
 In addition there are refugees from Nigeria, Algeria, Burundi, Cameroon, the Cen-
 tral African Republic, Chad, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the
 Congo, Ethiopia, Niger, Liberia, Rwanda, Sudan, and Sierra Leone.
 There were no reports of forced expulsion of persons having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully. Citizens exercised this right in legislative elections in 1991 and 1995,
 and in presidential elections in 1991 and 1996, all of which are considered free and
 fair. The Constitution provides for a 5-year term of office for the President (who is
 limited to two terms) and 4-year terms for National Assembly members (who may
 serve an unlimited number of terms).
 On December 17, the President issued a decree under which certain preparatory
 tasks for the Spring 1999 legislative elections, including the finalization of an up-
 dated voters list, were assigned to the Interior Ministry. If implemented, the decree
 could have undermined the authority of the autonomous National Electoral Commis-
 sion which under the Constitution has primary responsibility for most electoral mat-
 ters. Opposition political parties, the independent media, and the Beninese Human
 Rights Commission immediately criticized the decree, calling it unconstitutional and
 accused the President of trying to manipulate the electoral process to his benefit.
 On December 28, the Council of Ministers issued a statement abrogating the presi-
 dential decree.
 Women participate actively in the political parties but are underrepresented in
 government positions. After a Cabinet reshuffle in May, there are 3 women in the
 18-member Cabinet. The previous Cabinet of 19 members had 1 woman. There are
 6 female deputies, including the leader of the opposition, in the 82-member unicam-
 eral National Assembly. The President of the Constitutional Court is a woman; the
 HAAC and the Economic and Social Council have female members.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups, both domestic and international, operate with-
 out government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human
 rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their
 views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, and religion, but so-
 cietal discrimination against women continued.
 Women.-While no statistics are available, violence against women, including wife
 beating, occured. The press sometimes reports incidents of abuse of women, but
 judges and police are reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes, considering such
 disputes a family matter.
 Although the Constitution provides for equality for women in the political, eco-
 nomic, and social spheres, women experience extensive societal discrimination, espe-
 cially in rural areas where they occupy a subordinate role and are responsible for
 much of the hard labor on subsistence farms. In urban areas, women dominate the
 trading sector in the open-air markets. By law women have equal inheritance and
 property rights, but local custom in some areas prevents them from inheriting real
 property. Women do not enjoy the same educational opportunities as men, and fe-
 male literacy is about 16 percent (compared with 32 percent for males). However,
 elementary school pass rates in 1998 highlighted significant progress by girls in lit-
 eracy and scholastic achievement.
 
 
 There are active women's rights groups that have been effective in drafting a fam-
 ily code that would improve the status of women and children under the law. The
 draft code was scheduled for review by the National Assembly during the year, but
 it was never discussed. Many observers believe that consideration of the aft' was
 postponed because of provisions that would threaten male prerogatives, a highly
 volatile political issue. Action on the draft code is not anticipated until a new legis-
 lature convenes in the Spring of 1999.
 Children.-The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is responsible for the protec-
 tion of children's rights, primarily in the areas of education and health. In particu-
 lar the Government is trying to boost primary school enrollment, which is only
 about 66 percent. In some parts of the country, girls receive no formal education.
 Some traditional practices inflict hardship and violence on children, including
 most prominently the custom of "vidomegon," whereby poor, often rural, families
 place a child, primarily a daughter, in the home of a more wealthy family. In July
 the Ministry of Justice launched a nationwide publicity campaign to alert parents
 regarding the risks of placing their children in 'vidomegon" and to inform adults
 with "vidomegon" children of their responsibilities and of the children's rights.
 There were no reports of any action in the case of the official detained for beating
 a 12-year-old maid to death in 1996.
 Other traditional practices include the killing of deformed babies, breech babies,
 and one of two newborn twins (all of whom are thought to be sorcerers in some rural
 areas). There is also a tradition in which a groom abducts and rapes his prospective
 child (under 14 years of age) bride. Criminal courts mete out stiff sentences to crimi-
 nals convicted of crimes against children, but many such crimes never reach the
 courts.
 Trafficking in children, always a problem, was the subject of considerable media
 coverage. Most victims are abducted or leave home with traffickers who promise
 educational opportunities or other incentives. They are taken to places in foreign
 countries (according to the press, principally located in Nigeria, Cameroon, and
 Gabon) and sold into servitude in agriculture, as domestics, or as prostitutes (see
 Section 6.c.).
 The media reported during the year that gendarmes and police intercepted a
 number of traffickers trying to smuggle children into and out of the country and ar-
 rested those responsible. The Justice Minister stated that in 3 years a total of 1,363
 children had been intercepted and returned to their parents.
 The Government, in concert with NGO's, made serious efforts to combat child
 abuse and trafficking in children, including media campaigns, programs to assist
 street children, and greater border surveillance. Despite such efforts, the abuse of
 children is a serious human eights problem.
 The Government has been less successful in combating female genital mutilation
 (FGM), which is not illegal. FGM is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. FGM, or excision, is
 practiced on females ranging from infancy through 30 years of age. Studies vary
 widely and suggest that as few as 5 percent or as many as 50 percent of women
 are affected by this practice, mostly in the northern provinces. The actual incidence
 probably falls between these estimates. A prominent NGO, the Benin chapter of the
 Inter-African Committee, has made progress in raising awareness of the dangers of
 the practice; the Government has cooperated with its efforts. According to recent re-
 search, there is a strong profit motive in the continued practice of FGM by those
 who perform the operation, usually older women.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the Constitution provides that the State look
 after people with disabilities, the Government does not mandate accessibility for
 them. It operated a number of social centers for disabled persons to assist their so-
 cial integration. Nonetheless, many are unable to find employment and must resort
 to begging to support themselves.
 In January a new Labor Code was promulgated that includes provisions to protect
 the rights of disabled workers.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There is a long history of regional rivalries.
 Although Southerners dominate the Government's senior ranks, Northerners domi-
 nate the military services. The South has enjoyed more advanced economic develop-
 ment, a larger population, and has traditionally held favored status. In the 1996
 elections, a Norterner was elected President.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides workers with the freedom
 to organize, join unions, meet, and strike, and the Government usually respects
 these rights in practice. A new Labor Code went into effect on January 8. The code
 was approved after long discussions between the Government, labor unions, and the
 
 
 National Assembly. The labor force of about 2 million is primarily engaged in sub-
 sistence agriculture and other primary sector activities, with less than 2 percent of
 the population engaged in the modem (wage) sector.
 Approximately 75 percent of the wage earners belong to labor unions. There are
 four union confederations, and unions are generally independent of government and
 political parties. The Economic and Social Council, a constitutionally mandated body
 established in 1994, includes four union representatives.
 There were no significant strike actions during the year, probably due to the en-
 ergy crisis that began in March and triggered temporary layoffs and fears of job
 loss. Several public service unions threatened strikes against the Government to
 protest legislation creating a merit-based promotion system for the civil service;
 however, these strikes either did not materialize or went unnoticed.
 There were no known instances of efforts by the Government to retaliate against
 union activity. Laws prohibit employer retaliation against strikers, and the Govern-
 ment enforces them effectively.
 Unions may freely form or join federations or confederations and affiliate with
 international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining, and workers freely exercised these rights. Wages in the pri-
 vate sector are set in negotiations between unions and employers.
 The new Labor Code permits unions to become affiliated with international orga-
 nizations. It also includes a section on the rights of disabled workers. The Govern-
 ment sets wages in the public sector by law and regulation.
 The Labor Code prohibits employers from taking union membership or activity
 into account regarding hiring, work distribution, professional or vocational training,
 or dismissal. The Government levies substantial penalties against employers who
 refuse to rehire workers dismissed for lawful union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. Forced and bonded labor by children is specifically prohibited.
 However, some financially desperate parents indenture their children to "agents" re-
 cruiting farm hands or domestic workers, often on the understanding that money
 paid to the children would be sent to the parents. According to press reports, in
 some cases, unscrupulous individuals take the children to neighboring countries (see
 Section 5). The Government has taken steps to educate parents and to prevent such
 kidnapings of children. Also many rural children are sent to cities to live with rel-
 atives or family friends, often on the understanding that in return for performing
 domestic chores, they will be given an education. Host families do not always honor
 their part of the bargain, and abuse of child domestic servants occurs. The Govern-
 ment has taken steps to curb abuses.
 In January gendarmes in Togo arrested three traffickers who were transporting
 22 children from Tchaoudjo prefecture in Togo into Benin, from which they were to
 be taken to Nigeria. In March police arrested four traffickers of Beninese minors
 in Tohoun, Togo. These traffickers were taking 22 Beninese children to Cote d'Ivoire
 via Togo.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code prohibits the employment or apprenticeship of children under 14 years
 of age in any enterprise. However, the Ministry of Labor enforces the code in only
 a limited manner (and then only in the modern sector), due to the lack of inspectors.
 To help support their families, children continue to work on rural family farms, in
 small businesses, on construction sites in urban areas, and as domestic servants.
 Children also commonly work as street vendors.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children but is unable to
 enforce these prohibitions except in the modern sector (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively sets mini-
 mum wage scales for a number of occupations. In April 1997, the Government in-
 creased the minimum wage by 8 percent from $36.25 (cfa francs 20,300) per month
 to $39.15 (cfa francs 21,924). The decision was made in consultation with trade
 unions. However, this increase is not sufficient to cover the costs for food and hous-
 ing even of a single worker. Many workers must supplement their wages by subsist-
 ence farming or informal sector trade. Most workers in the wage sector, however,
 earn more than the minimum wage.
 The Labor Code establishes a workweek of from 40 to 46 hours, depending on the
 type of work, and provides for at least one 24-hour rest period per week. The au-
 thorities generally enforce legal limits on workweeks in the modern sector. The code
 establishes health and safety standards, but the Ministry of Labor does not enforce
 them effectively. The code does not provide workers with the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment
 
 
 The Ministry of Labor has the authority to require employers to remedy dangerous
 work conditions but does not do so effectively.
