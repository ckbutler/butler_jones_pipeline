 MADAGASCAR
 Madagascar is governed by a president and a parliament (the
 National Popular Assembly), both elected by direct universal
 suffrage, which together choose the Supreme Revolutionary
 Council. President Didier Ratsiraka has broad constitutional
 powers, and his position is further strengthened by the
 influential role played by his political party, AREMA, which
 holds an overwhelming majority in the National Popular
 Assembly. Elections are actively contested within the
 controlled political framework sanctioned by the Government.
 This framework permits political activity only by the seven
 parties making up the National Front for the Defense of the
 Revolution. The political orientation of the seven parties
 ranges from moderate and pro-Western to pro-Soviet. The
 President chairs the Supreme Revolutionary Council, composed
 of political and regional leaders and representatives of the
 military forces. The Council approves basic policy and
 guidelines, convenes and adjourns the National Popular
 Assembly, and passes laws when the Assembly is not sitting.
 The Malagasy internal security forces are composed of the
 urban police force and the National Gendarmerie, the latter
 has jurisdiction in the provinces. On occasion, the National
 People's Army has also been used for internal security
 purposes.
 In 1987 continuing vigorous debate in the Assembly over the
 recurrent stagnation of the economy and consequent unrest led
 four of the parties within the National Front to form an
 opposition alliance. This alliance, in an unprecedented move,
 voted against the national budget in the 1986 session, lending
 further credence that a genuine opposition in Malagasy
 politics may be evolving.
 The Malagasy Constitution adopted in 1975 made "socialism" the
 State's political philosophy. This led to the nationalization
 of a major portion of the economy. The private sector was
 reduced to a secondary, albeit still important, role. The
 economy Lubsequently deteriorated as production declined,
 foreign debt rose, and unemployment grew, especially among the
 youth (60 percent of the population is under age 25). In
 recent years, however, the Government has taken steps toward
 liberalizing the economy. Reform measures in the production
 and marketing of rice have, for example, begun to show
 positive results.
 Although fundamental liberties and individual rights are
 guaranteed by the Constitution, several of these rights, such
 as freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, are
 restricted in practice or are subject to exclusionary clauses
 in most laws. Rights such as the inviolability of the home
 and due process may also be disregarded in cases involving
 state security.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 While there were recurring rumors of politically motivated
 killings, there has been no conclusive evidence to
 substantiate such rumors. For instance, in May 1986, the
 Minister of Defense, his Secretary General, and the Director
 
 
 164
 MADAGASCAR
 of OMNIS (the Military Office of Strategic Industries) were
 killed in a plane crash along with eight other people. While
 there is no evidence that the plane was sabotaged, the
 Government launched an official inquiry into the matter, the
 findings of which have yet to be published. Amnesty
 International in its 1986 Report (covering 1985) called on the
 authorities to investigate the death of Father Sergio Sorgone,
 a Roman Catholic priest, who may have been killed for political
 reasons by members of the TTS, a paramilitary youth group which
 supports the Government, as well as the deaths of four other
 priests who may have been victims of political killings. More
 recently, the near fatal stabbing in September of a senior
 opposition party official and member of the Supreme
 Revolutionary Council, Dr. Radio Celestin, has once again
 stirred rumors of political crime.
 In 1987 there was no further violence involving members of the
 TTS and the "kung-fu" movement. Following street fighting in
 1984, the victorious kung-fu groups began to play a vigilante
 role in Antananarivo's poorer districts and thus represented a
 threat to the State. The ensuing clashes in August 1985
 between the military and the kung-fu adherents resulted in,
 according to the official count, 20 dead, 31 wounded, and 208
 arrested. In their suppression of the kung-fu threat, the
 military entered some homes without court orders and ransacked
 them, shot some suspects on sight, and arrested others without
 formal charges.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed cases of politically motivated
 disappearance in 1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 While there were no documented cases of physical torture
 occurring in Madagascar, some organizations in the security
 apparatus, notably the state secret police, have a reputation
 for ruthless methods. The kung-fu prisoners have allegedly
 suffered from very cruel treatment while in detention. There
 have also been credible reports of the alleged use of torture
 by the armed forces in the Government's campaign against
 outlaw bandits in Madagascar's southwest.
 Malagasy prisons are increasingly inhumane in terms of living
 conditions. Some prisoners are not fed regularly, medical
 care is not provided, infections are commonplace, prisoners
 rarely have the opportunity to wash, and clothing is not
 provided. The death toll rises significantly among prisoners
 during the cold winter months.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Persons suspected of activity against the State may be legally
 detained incommunicado for 15 days, subject to indefinite
 extension if considered necessary by the Government.
 Indefinite extension is frequently deemed necessary. In the
 past, certain defendants involved in security cases were
 detained without being brought to trial for periods ranging
 from 20 months to over 5 years. Such extended periods of
 pretrial detention are exceptions and are usually limited to
 cases involving national security.
 
 
 165
 MADAGASCAR
 In a normal criminal case, the accused must be charged or
 released within 3 days of arrest. Defendants in ordinary
 criminal/civil cases are generally charged formally within the
 specified time frame, and upon being charged, are permitted
 legal counsel. Counsel is readily available, and court-
 appointed counsel is provided for indigents.
 Thirty-seven of the kung-fu adherents, including one woman,
 have been imprisoned without trial since August 1985 at
 Arivonimamo prison. At the end of 1987, no trial had been
 scheduled, and they had not been charged. In its 1987 Report
 (covering 1986), Amnesty International expressed concern about
 these detentions, and stated that some may be "prisoners of
 conscience."
 Forced labor is not practiced in Madagascar.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Malagasy Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary. In practice, the judiciary seams to function
 without outside influence from the executive.
 The judiciary has three levels of trial courts: lower courts
 for civil and criminal cases in which limited sentences may be
 levied, a Court of Appeals which includes a Criminal Court for
 cases in which sentences of 5 years or more may be imposed,
 and a.Supreme Court.- The judiciary also has a number of
 special courts designed to handle specific kinds of cases
 under the jurisdiction of the higher courts. A High
 Constitutional'Court, with a totally separate and autonomous
 status, watches over the constitutionality of laws, decrees,
 and ordinances and ensures the legality of elections. A High
 Court of Justice, charged with prosecuting malfeasance in the
 Government, is provided for in the Constitution but has never
 come into existence. A Military Court has jurisdiction over
 all cases involving national security. The trial for the
 kung-fu adherents could take place in either the Military
 Court or the Criminal Court of the Court of Appeals.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence-
 The State does not generally intervene in nonpolitical aspects
 of the lives of the people. The home is inviolable under
 Malagasy law, and intrusions 'into an individual's residence,
 except in political or sensitive cases, must be made under the
 authority of a search warrant. However, in their suppression
 of kung-fu gangs, the military entered some homes without
 court orders and ransacked the.
 Although government economic policies limit the choices,
 Malagasy citizens may make their own decisions, without
 government coercion or interference, in such matters as
 changing jobs or residence, marriage, having children, and
 joining permitted political parties or social organizations.
 pection 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Private citizens have limited freedom to criticize government
 officials and policies without fear of arrest by the local
 authorities, but such criticism must be carefully worded.
 
 
 166
 MADAGASCAR
 Direct criticism of the President or the "Socialist
 revolution" is not tolerated.
 Madagascar has one of the highest literacy rates in Africa,
 and Malagasy citizens attach great importance to the press.
 What is printed in the newspaper often has an impact on the
 nation's policymaking apparatus. Critical examination of a
 range of policy issues such as economic management,
 transportation, and education can be found in the printed
 press. However, censorship is prescribed by the Government
 and executed by the Ministry of Interior. Copies of the daily
 newspapers are submitted to the censors prior to printing.
 When censorship is enforced, the newspaper leaves blank those
 columns where the offending articles would have appeared. In
 instances of violations of censorship, the Ministry has and
 occasionally uses its administrative authority to suspend
 publication. There is one goverrment-owned newspaper. The
 two major independently owned newspapers are Madagascar Matin
 and Midi Madagasikara. Several other dailies and weeklies are
 published by party groups and independent publishers, including
 the outspoken and candid Catholic newspaper, Lakroa.
 The Government owns the radio and television stations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of assembly and association are restricted.
 Permits are required to hold public meetings and can be denied
 by the Government if officials believe that the meeting poses
 a threat to the State or endangers national unity. Persons
 and groups belonging to parties of the National Front are
 permitted to organize and assemble. Nevertheless, since
 political activity by groups outside the National Front is
 prohibited, dissenting political opinion is limited.
 The first half of 1987 witnessed a resurgence of major student
 unrest in the form of massive, violent demonstrations and
 student strikes sparked by student opposition to educational
 reform measures announced by the Government in late 1986.
 Although the right to organize labor unions is recognized,
 unions are not important either politically or economically.
 The labor force, about 4.9 million workers, is mostly agrarian
 (85 percent). Union labor accounts for less than 5 percent of
 the total. Unions are permitted to strike and conduct wage
 negotiations, but because of the depressed economy, strikes
 have been few, and trade unions relatively quiescent. Most
 unions are affiliated with National Front parties.
 Madagascar is an active member of the Madagascar delegation to
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) and was a
 participant in discussions regarding the rights of seamen to
 organize trade unions at the 74th annual meeting of the ILO in
 September 1987. Unions are affiliated with regional and
 international labor bodies such as the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions and World Federation of
 Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government is secular, and there is no official religion.
 There is no discrimination on the basis of religious
 affiliation, and persons are free to follow the faith of their
 choice. Missionaries and clergy are generally permitted to
 operate freely, and the Government has so far made no effort
 
 
 167
 MADAGASCAR
 to restrain those Christian churches which have become more
 active in criticizing government policies. Over half of the
 population is either Catholic or Protestant, with the remainder
 following traditional Malagasy religious beliefs or other
 faiths.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government has imposed no restriction on travel within the
 country. Official approval must be obtained for trips outside
 the country, .but there has been only one known instance in
 which approval was denied due to the person's political
 views. -Foreign travel is impeded by the difficulty in
 obtaining.foreign currency. The Malagasy franc is not
 convertible abroad, and the Government limits the amount of
 hard currency that can be obtained for foreign travel. There
 is no refugee population in Madagascar.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The electorate's choice is constrained by the nature of the
 political system, since the only political parties allowed to
 operate in Madagascar are those which are members of the
 National Front. However, there.exists a range of ideological
 and policy views among the seven Front parties, and there are
 viewpoints within this spectrum which are at odds with the
 policies of the administration. Thus, the electoral process
 provides the voters.a chance to choose among candidates
 expressing differing views in local and regional elections, as-
 well as in the Assembly and presidential campaigns. The 137
 members of the National Popular Assembly are elected by
 universal suffrage for 5-year terms. The last election was in
 1983. (The: Supreme Revolutionary Council, in October,
 extended the terms of Assembly deputies by 9 months, according
 to official reports, for economic reasons.) The President is
 elected to a 7-year term with the next election falling due in
 1989. The electoral process, although not completely free
 from irregularities, has been essentially straightforward in
 recent elections. The political system in Madagascar also
 reflects a considerable degree of regional balance.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not cooperated with groups wishing to
 investigate alleged human rights violations and has denied
 visas to Amnesty International representatives. When the
 President's opponent in the 1982 election campaign called for
 supervision of the elections by Amnesty International, the
 President rejected the proposal as being derogatory to
 national sovereignty. In the absence of private human rights
 groups, the Christian churches in the country have taken the
 lead in advocating human rights. Although the Government is
 sensitive to criticism emanating from this quarter, it has not
 officially responded to questions or criticisms from the
 churches or any other group.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While there appears to be no customary practice of
 institutional or systematic discrimination on the basis of
 
 
 168
 MADAGASCAR
 ethnic grouping in Madagascar, a serious outbreak of violence
 and plunder of Indian-owned property across Madagascar
 occurred in March. This prosperous community estimated at
 some 18,000 persons of Indian origin, referred to locally as
 "karana," is essentially engaged in commerce. The "karana"
 are generally considered by the Malagasy as not prone to
 integration due to a variety of religious and cultural
 reasons. While no Indians were killed in these riots, several
 looters were killed, many wounded, and property damage was
 great. The looting reportedly began when allegations
 circulated that Indian retailers were involved in rice
 speculation and illegal transactions in scarce items such as
 cooking oil and sugar. The simultaneous outbreak of these
 riots in cities across the island and limited damage outside
 the Indian community have fueled rumors that these incidents
 were carefully coordinated and organized. The Chinese and
 French communities also have experienced some resentment from
 the Malagasy mainly because of their success in commerce.
 These groups have occasionally been the target of local
 government policies favoring Malagasy nationals.
 Madagascar has what is essentially a matriarchal society. A
 highly visible role for women has long been recognized as an
 integral part of the country's sociological framework. Women
 have a lengthy tradition of involvement in high-level
 political activity, and currently women are members of the
 Cabinet, the Supreme Revolutionary Council, and the Assembly.
 Women are also active and play major roles in the various
 political parties. Women have a prominent role in the
 business and economic life of the country, with many of them
 managing or owning business concerns or filling management
 positions in state industries. Education at all levels is
 open to women. However, women in rural areas and among the
 poor face a greater degree of hardship. In addition to the
 responsibilities associated with child rearing and household
 management, economic necessity forces these women to engage in
 farm labor or other similar activities. These conditions stem
 more from socioeconomic factors than from a discriminatory
 bias against women in Malagasy society.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Malagasy Work Code and its enforcing legislation set forth
 the working conditions required for employees. The Work Code
 describes a child as any person, regardless of gender, under
 the age of 18. The minimum age for employment is 14, but the
 use of child labor is prohibited in those areas where there is
 apparent and imminent danger. There is a 44-hour workweek in
 nonagricultural and service industries. There are also
 provisions for holiday pay, sick and maternity leave, and
 insurance. Malagasy law distinguishes between agricultural
 and nonagricultural work. The average minimum wage is about
 15 cents per hour. The Work Code has rules concerning
 building safety, machinery and moving engines, operational
 safety, and sanitation standards. It appears that in
 practice, the rules and regulations of the Code are adhered to
 by employers and are enforced by the authorities. Labor
 inspectors carry out regular visits to industrial work sites.
 Violations of safety, sanitary, operational, and other work
 code provisions are the subject of reports by these
 inspectors. If the violations are not remedied within a
 specified time frame, the violators are legally charged and
 subject to various penalties.
