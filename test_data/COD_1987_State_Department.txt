 ZAIRE
 President Mobutu Sese Seko, who came to power in 1965, heads
 both t e Government of Zaire and its only legal party, the
 Popular'Movement of the Revolution (MPR). The President has
 the constitutional power to promulgate laws by decree. In
 theory, authority is shared with the popularly elected
 Legislative Council (unicameral parliament). In practice, the
 Parliament rarely disagrbes with presidential decisions,
 although decrees are usually preceded by consultations with
 party leaders and legislators. The single legal party
 automatically includes all Zairian citizens as~members. The
 Executive Council (Prime Minister and Council of Ministers),
 the Legislative Council, the judiciary, and the only labor
 union (National Union of Zairian Workers) are all organs of
 the party. Political association is limited to the party and
 its affiliates. The Government allows nonpolitical
 association, but in principle authorities must be notified of
 all activities.
 A complex of security organizations, notably the civilian
 National Documentation Agency, the paramilitary gendarmerie
 and civil guard, and the armed.forces share responsibility-,for
 identifying and controlling potential internal and external
 threats to Zaire and the Government. Their broad powers and-
 influence have resulte6 in arbitrary harassment, physical.
 mistreatment, and detention of'ordinary citizens as well as
 suspected political opponents of the Government. The military
 security service, Military Intelligence and Action Service
 (SRMA), which reportedly had been involved in human rights
 abuses, was disbanded in 1986. Its responsibilities have been
 taken over by other security services, and a number of its
 members have been transferred to these other units.
 Zaire has a mixed'economy. Though major mining and
 transportation activities are state owned, private enterprise
 is the rdle in the other'sectors, with the State often holding
 a minority equity position in larger firms. In October 1986,
 Zaire temporaily departd'Erom its 3-year-old stabilization
 program and iscussed a- moratorium on foreign debt payments,
 price controls, and fixed exchange rates. These policies were
 never implemented, but large increases in government spending
 swelled the money supply, and by early 1987, the economy had
 declined dramatically, with inflation skyrocketing and foreign
 exchange in critical supply. In May 1987, the Government
 concluded a new standby arrangement with the International
 Monetary Fund. Though the new program has the same long-term
 goals as the 1983 program, economic stability and growth, the
 dramatic rise in the cost of living which followed the 1986
 reflation policy has made life exceedingly difficult for the
 average Zairian. A positive development for the Zairian
 economy at the end of 1987 was the increase in the world price
 of copper.
 Human rights in Zaire continued to be circumscribed in 1987,
 including in such important areas as speech, press, and
 assembly. Compulsory party membership is reinforced by
 liaison offices in all government agencies and at the
 neighborhood level that try to ensure party discipline and
 political orthodoxy. In 1987 the Government prevailed upon a
 group of political dissidents, many of whom had been held in
 internal exile, to join the MPR, giving some of them seats on
 the Central Committee. At the same time, the Government took
 several potentially important steps to advance human rights.
 These included Zire's participation in international human
 rights forums, cooperation with human rights organizations,
 
 
 340
 ZAIRE
 and an announced willingness to confront human rights abuses
 through new oversight institutions. In particular, the new
 Department (ministry) of Citizens' Rights and Liberties (DCRL)
 began operations. It is tasked with examining and resolving
 citizen complaints of civil rights violations. In addition,
 the new (1986) Judicial Council (a superministry of justice)
 sought to improve conditions in Zaire's judicial and penal
 systems. The efficacy of these new organizations had yet to
 be demonstrated by the end of 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political killings
 There were no confirmed cases of political killing in 1987.
 b. Disappearance
 There was one credible report of a disappearance. Kindemoko
 Louis, a former government official in Bas Zaire, was
 reportedly arrested in September 1986 on suspicion of trying
 to create a political party. He was placed in a high-security
 detention facility, where he remained for 6 months. Since
 that time, all efforts by his family and friends to find him
 have been unsuccessful.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and physical mistreatment of detainees is common in
 most Zairian places of detention. There are frequent reports
 of beatings. Amnesty International also reports the use of
 electric shocks on detainees. Reports of unsanitary
 facilities, lack of medical care, and malnutrition and
 starvation among prisoners emanate regularly from Zaire's
 prisons. A lack of concern at senior levels, incompetence,
 corruption, and limited funding all contribute to these
 problems.
 The Government claims that it does not condone torture and
 denies allegations that torture is administered by its
 officials. In 1987 the Government, under the new President of
 the Judicial Council, stepped up its efforts to improve
 Zaire's penal and judicial systems. In this campaign, the
 Government released 165 detainees held without charges,
 arrested several magistrates and midlevel government officials
 for corruption, disciplined officials found to have beaten or
 mistreated prisoners, appointed a new director at the main
 prison in Kinshasa, and assigned inspectors to visit detention
 centers 3 times a week to ensure that no persons were held in
 excess of 48 hours without a hearing.
 Despite this positive beginning, credible sources reported
 that bureaucratic inefficiency, ingrained corruption, and the
 Judicial Council's limited authority and funding had begun to
 blunt the effectiveness of these measures by the end of 1987.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 In spite of the efforts noted above, arbitrary arrest and
 prolonged detention without charge -remain common occurrences,
 affecting many people who come into contact with the criminal
 
 
 341
 ZAIRE
 justice system. By law, those arrested must be brought before
 a magistrate to hear charges within 48 hours of arrest. The
 magistrate may order bail or pretrial detention for up to 15
 days. In turn, a public prosecutor is required to bring a
 defendant before a judge within 5 days of the defendant's
 imprisonment (or pretrial detention). Only in exceptional
 cases may these periods of detention be extended. In
 practice, however, suspects are often arrested and held
 incommunicado for months without a hearing. Detainees with
 financial resources are known to buy their way out of
 detention without charges ever being filed.
 Most persons detained for political reasons are held by means
 of nonjudicial sanctions which range from administrative
 incommunicado detention to internal exile to villages of.
 origin and restriction of movement and travel. They are not
 formally charged or tried, remaining in detention or internal
 exile until the President arbitrarily chooses to release
 them. Such arrests and banishments are made openly, and the
 whereabouts of detainees usually are known, although sometimes
 not acknowledged by the Government.
 Estimates of the number of people detained or sentenced for
 essentially nonviolent expression of political beliefs vary
 greatly and are often out of date as detainees are released or
 others arrested, often for short periods of time. Estimates
 at the beginning of 1987 were 80 to 90 detainees and internal
 exiles. With the release of members of the internal
 opposition group, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress
 (UDPS) from internal exile, the number of persons being held
 simply for holding nonviolent political beliefs dropped
 substantially. The Government maintains that it holds no
 political prisoners. There are, however, a number of persons
 being held witliout trial, apparently on national security
 grounds. Their status and the charges against them have never
 been made public. They may be political detainees. The best
 estimate of the number of such prisoners is between 25 and 50.
 A small number of opponents of the Government live in
 self-imposed exile in Europe. There were no known cases of
 exile or expulsion of Zairians from the country in 1987.
 Zairian legislation provides for compulsory civilian service
 for graduates from pedagogical and technical institutes, and a
 Government ordinance authorizes imprisonment with compulsory
 labor for tax defaulters. There are no known instances in
 which tax defaulters have actually been sentenced to
 compulsory labor, although imprisonment at hard labor is a
 common sentence for those convicted of crimes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Zaire's highly centralized Government includes control over
 the judiciary, principally through the Judicial Council. The
 legal system is a mixture of Belgian and customary law. The
 modern court system includes a Supreme Court, a Court of
 Appeals in each region, a Court of Grand Instance in each city
 and subregion, a court of First Instance in each rural and
 urban zone, and a Court of State Security.
 Defendants are assured the right to a public trial and defense
 counsel by the Constitution. In practice, however, most
 citizens are not in a position to avail themselves of the
 right to counsel. There are insufficient lawyers in Zaire to
 provide adequate counsel to most defendants. When available,
 
 
 342
 ZAIRE
 defense lawyers generally function freely and without coercion
 from the Government in nonpolitical cases. Most defendants
 who are aware of their rights avail themselves of the right to
 appeal.
 Decisions of the Court of State Security involving national
 security, armed robbery, and smuggling are not subject to
 appeal, although all other procedural protections of the
 criminal code do apply. Military court procedures also do not
 provide for appeal. While military courts generally try only
 cases involving military personnel, in time of emergency or
 during military operations the President can suspend civilian
 courts and transfer jurisdiction over all cases to military
 couxts.
 There is criticism of the judicial process on two levels. At
 the political level, all judges are subject to party
 discipline. The result is that, while judges in fact perform
 their function without political interference in the great
 majority of cases, in sensitive or highly politicized cases
 they operate under implicit or explicit constraints from the
 executive or security forces. At the daily operational level,
 in addition to the security authorities harassing citizens,
 some poorly paid magistrates also seek bribes and apply the
 full rigor of the law only to those who are unable to pay the
 bribes.
 The Department of Citizens' Rights and Liberties, established
 in October 1986, began operation on July 1, 1987. The role of
 the new Department in the judicial system is not clear.
 However, the Department will have representatives throughout
 the country at local government levels and in major
 enterprises, both public and private. Its principal
 responsibility is to investigate the complaints of Zairians
 who feel that their legal rights have been abridged by
 administrative, military, or judicial agents. In cases where
 such abuses are identified, the DCRL may offer redress to
 victims. Complaints filed in 1987 involved seizures of land
 and goods, arbitrary arrests, physical mistreatment, pension
 problems, and illegal firings. By the end of 1987, the DCRL
 was still in a start-up phase, and the effectiveness of the
 new organization had not been tested.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Party and state security organizations extend to the
 neighborhood level, and both maintain liaison offices in all
 Government agencies (including, for example, military units,
 universities, the Legislative Council, and ministries). Party
 officials, civil servants, armed forces personnel,
 parliamentarians, and employees of state enterprises pay an
 obligatory tax to support the activities of the party's major
 organs (cadre training, mobilization, propaganda, and youth).
 These party cadres are also required to attend the party's
 training institute. The party can reprimand and suspend those
 who do not attend. Government employees, market vendors, and
 blue-collar workers are often required to participate in
 public events, such as parades and official arrival and
 departure ceremonies, or risk suspension from their jobs. In
 line with its ideology of "Zairian authenticity," the
 party-state forbids Zairian men to wear ties and forbids all
 Zairians, in principle, to use non-African names.
 
 
 343
 ZAIRE
 Judicial warrants are required by law before the police are
 permittdd to search a home, except in cases of threats to
 national-'security. In practice, however, police and security
 authorities entek ard search homes without warrants. Security
 services sometimes open mail and tap telephones, and
 Government informers monitor places of residence as well as of
 work.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a.' Freedom of Speech'and Press
 The Constitution.stipulates'the right of all citizens to
 express freely their opinions and feelings, either orally or
 in writing, but subordinates this ard all other rights to the
 need to ensure "public order and good conduct." All Zairians
 are atit6matically members of the sole politic'al party, the
 Popufar Mdvement of the Revolution (MPR). The ideology of the
 MPR, which is the only acceptable public profession of
 political thought, comprises the views and policies of the
 party's President and founder, President Mobutu Sese Seko. As
 in many one-party states, the theater, songs, and
 all-pervasive street gossip are important forums for
 communicating popular opinions-and news.
 Radio and television are owned and operated by the State. The
 major newspapers'are privately owned but are believed to
 depend u5on .ignificant Government subsidies for survival. In
 additioi, they receive most of fheir news frbm the Zairian
 National Press Agency (AZAP), a state organizatlbn.  The media
 are expected to promote the ideals and' rinbiples of the MPR.
 Generally; jiblisheri' and editors are "active party members.
 Commentary on politically sensitive internal issues as well as
 on foreign policy options is discouraged, and direct criticism
 of the President forbidden. While journalists are circumspect
 in their criticism of other high officials as well, criticism
 of certain government practices, in'adequate services, and
 corruption frequently apliears iinpiint.
 Media censorship tends to be self-imposed, but'in certain
 situations'political authorities restrict the scope of
 journalistic inquiry by both Zairians and foreign
 journaliAsts. All foreign journalists wishing to visit Zaire
 must receive prior permission from the Ministry of
 Information. Zairian journalists must be members of the press
 union in order to practice their profession. The threat of
 being ousted from the union and consequent loss of livelihood
 are strong inducements toward self-censorship. There are
 several clandestine presses which operate sporadically,
 printing flyer's and handbills critical of the Government and
 various Zairian leaders.
 Artistic and academic freedom of expression are subject to the
 same restrictions and self-censorship as the press. Mandatory
 membership in professional organizations and well-developed
 informer networks discourage dissent. From time to time,
 books, films, and certain issues of newspapers and magazines
 are banned. Imported publications, including books and
 periodicals, are subject to censorship'if they are critical of
 Zaire or its Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Only the MPR and its affiliates may hold public meetings. The
 Government permits the existence of nonpolitical associations,
 
 
 344
 ZAIRE
 but in principle they must notify authorities when they plan
 meetings or activities involving more than five people. In
 practice, this is rarely enforced. The Government can also
 prohibit meetings which continue after 9 p.m. Meetings of
 nonofficial organizations have been disrupted on occasion by
 Government agents because of suspected political activities.
 The labor movement in Zaire is limited to one national union,
 the National Union of Zairian Workers (UNTZA), which is an
 integral unit of the sole political party. The Secretary
 General of UNTZA is a member of the party's general committee,
 and union officials at the regional level serve on regional
 party committees. UNTZA has the right to bargain collectively
 with employers, and it provides significant social and
 educational services to members and their families. It works
 with the Government to improve worker benefits. However, it
 is unable to promote worker interests or defend worker rights
 which run counter to Government policies. The right to strike
 is included in the labor law, but because the law establishes
 lengthy and mandatory arbitration and appeal procedures which
 result in the resolution of most labor disputes, in practice
 lawful strikes do not occur.
 Membership in UNTZA is compulsory for civil servants,
 employees of state enterprises, and employees of private firms
 with at least 20 employees. The union claims over 1 million
 workers as dues-paying members. However, the overwhelming
 majority of the work force is self-employed, either in the
 unofficial sector or in subsistence agriculture, which is not
 covered by the union. UNTZA participates actively in the
 International Labor Organization and the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity and maintains ties with a number of
 foreign labor confederations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is recognized in the Constitution, and the
 Government officially sanctions most of the major world
 religions. However, new churches must obtain government
 recognition to operate freely, and that recognition has been
 difficult for lesser-known churches to obtain. Traditional
 African religious groups are tolerated but not officially
 recognized. The Government banned the Jehovah's Witnesses and
 a number of other sects and religious groups in 1986 on
 charges of fraud or subversive activities, and the ban
 remained in effect in 1987.
 The three major religions in Zaire are Catholicism--50
 percent, Protestantism (including kimbanguism)--36 percent,
 and Islam--5 percent. Officially recognized religions are
 free to establish places of worship and to train clergy. Most
 churches maintain active links with coreligionists outside the
 country, and expatriate missionaries are allowed to
 proselytize and to serve both Zairian and expatriate
 congregations. Affiliation with a recognized religion confers
 neither advantage nor disadvantage with respect to secular
 status. Adherents to some sects that are not recognized by
 the Government, however, are subject to harassment by local
 officials, such as arrests, physical mistreatment, seizure of
 property, and demands for bribes.
 
 
 345
 ZAIRE -
 d, Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government at times imposes special documentation
 requirements for travel to areas of unrest or security
 concern. As noted .in Section l.d., the Government also
 restricts some dissidents to villages of origin. All
 citizens, refugees, and permanent residents must carry
 government-issued identity cards, and police and military
 personnel often set-up checkpoints along major roads to
 inspect papers. -Those whose papers are not in order must pay
 a fine or spend time in jail. Undisciplined and underpaid
 police and military personnel often abuse their authority to
 harass and extort money from civilians, including refugees. -
 In principle, any Zairian citizen may obtain a passport and
 exit visa, although on occasion government and security'
 officials have impeded issuance in order to prevent or disrupt
 travel of-persons suspected of political opposition to the
 Government. A married woman must have her husband's
 permission-before obtaining a passport.
 As of 1987, the number of officially registered Zairians
 living as displaced persons or refugees in neighboring
 countries remains around 53,000. This figure includes over
 10,000 supporters of the National-Front for the Liberation of
 Congo (FLNC) who remain in Angola. A small number of
 political refugees also reside in the Congo., A few
 asylum-seeking-refugees are in Europe, particularly in Belgium.
 Past experience indicates that many Zairian displaced persons
 could return, to Zaire if they wished. In 1986 and 1987, as
 many as 4,-000 Zairian refugees returned to Shaba from Angola.
 These persons, who-had fled in the wake of the failed 1977 and
 1978 invasions of Shaba by the Angolan-based Katangan
 gendarmes, returned as individuals rather than as group
 returnees. To the extent known, these returnees have been
 treated equitably by Zairian authorities, who bave allowed
 them to resettle without restrictions.- In addition, there are
 ongoing discussions with Angola for the voluntary repatriation
 of 3,000 former FLNC fighters and their dependents who wish to
 return to Zaire. Political opponents of the Government living
 in self-imposed exile in Europe probably could not return
 safely to Zaire without renouncing their political views.
 By mid-1987, Zaire was host to approximately 300,900 refugees;
 290,000 being Angolan refugees. These persons are generally
 allowed to pass freely into Zaire. The Government provides
 land for resettlement.and camps. Outside agencies, especially
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
 provide food, housing, transportation, and medical care. Upon
 entering Zaire, refugees are processed by Zairian army and
 state security officials. Refugees are sometimes detained or
 closely monitored on suspicion of illegal political activity.
 Forced repatriation is contrary to official government policy
 and rarely occurs. The UNHCR is aware of no cases of forced
 repatriation from Zaire in 1987. A voluntary repatriation of
 Ugandan refugees from Haut-Zaire ended in June. Since the
 beginning of this movement of voluntary repatriation in July
 1983, a total of 49,081 Ugandans returned to their country
 through the sponsorship of the UNHCR. Approximately 300
 Ugandans refused to accept voluntary repatriation and remain
 in Zaire.
 
 
 346
 ZAIRE
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Existing institutions do not give citizens the right to change
 their government. Political power in Zaire is highly
 centralized and controlled by the President, who makes all
 important decisions. Under Zaire's Constitution, the State is
 essentially the executive organ of the country's sole
 political party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution.
 Party congresses meet every 5 years under the guidance of the
 President to set national political guidelines, which are then
 supplemented by resolutions of the party's Central Committee.
 These policies are implemented by the Prime Minister and
 Cabinet, both appointed by the President. Advocacy of a
 multiparty system or opposition to the party-state arQ both
 unconstitutional and illegal, as are actions which question
 the authority of the President and the political system.
 Suffrage is universal over age 18, and voting is mandatory,
 enforced in theory by penalties including fines or arrest.
 The national Parliament, municipal councils, and rural and
 urban zone councils are chosen by direct popular elections
 which take place every 5 years. All candidates are screened
 by party committees at the appropriate level, but voters
 generally have a choice of several candidates. President
 Mobutu was reelected with no opposition in 1984 to a third
 7-year term in office.
 Municipal, rural, and parliamentary elections were held this
 year in June, July, and September. The MPR Central Committee
 voided the local elections in August, because of election
 fraud and irregularities, reportedly due to poor planning,
 bureaucratic incompetence, and maneuvering by local officials
 to influence election results. The party set new elections
 for March 1988. Parliamentary elections, held September 6,
 were allowed to stand in spite of claims of the same fraud and
 irregularities which plagued the municipal and rural
 elections. An average of 5 candidates ran for each of the 210
 parliamentary seats. Of the 210 parliamentarians, 142 are
 first-term members and 68 are incumbents.
 Since 1980 members of the UDPS (see Section l.d.) have tried
 to establish a second political party. Their efforts have
 been rebuffed by the MPR and by the President; they have
 suffered arrest and detention at various times over the past 7
 years. UDPS leaders were released in June 1987 after almost 1
 year in internal exile. Several UDPS militants in Kinshasa
 were rearrested on October 5 and held for 5 days.
 Subsequently, in early November, the Government announced that
 the group had agreed to join the MPR, and 5 prominent UDPS
 figures had been appointed to high-level party and government
 positions. Although the precise terms of that agreement have
 not been made public, UDPS figures maintain that it will
 permit them to have an independent voice in debating public
 policies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains that Zaire has nothing to hide in
 terms of human rights policies and denies charges of
 systematic and serious violations. The Government's attitude
 towards external investigations has-been mixed in the past,
 but in 1987 the Government generally responded to human rights
 
 
 347
 ZAIRE
 inquiries. Late in 1986, the Government appointed a
 distinguished Zairian jurist to investigate and answer all
 international inquiries- in the human rights area. This effort
 continued in 1987 when Zaire sent a spokesman from the DCRL to
 represent Zaire at the 43rd session of the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission (UNHRC). The Government has promised to report
 steps it has taken to improve specific human right abuses
 cited by the UNHRC and is considering appointing a permanent
 spokesman to represent Zaire at the UNHRC in Geneva.
 In 1987 the Government also extended an invitation to Amnesty
 International to visit Zaire to discuss human rights issues.
 The Amnesty International team made a 10-day visit to Zaire in
 October to make preliminary contact with the Government, but
 did not'pursue specific cases.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross has been allowed
 to maintain a permanent-office in Zaire since 1978, although
 at times its access to prisoners has been restricted.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Home to approximately 300 disparate ethnic groups, most of
 which have their own tribal languages, Zaire has a population
 of over 33 million. The Government has sought to defuse
 disputes based on linguistic or ethnic diversity by adopting
 French as the official language of Government and education.
 Four vehicular languages--Lingala, Swahili, Tshiluba, and
 Kikongo--also serve to bridge the communication gap with
 smaller tribal groups. Many urban Zairians speak Lingala, the
 language used in both the army and the capital city, or
 Swahili, used in the east of the country. However, the fact
 that many rural people are unacquainted with these languages
 complicates their. ealings with government and military
 officials.
 The Government strives to counter ethnic divisions by
 recruiting ministers and other high government officials from
 all regions and major ethnic -groups. One hallmark of the
 Mobutu Government is an emphasis on the primacy of a Zairian
 national identity. At the local level, the Government
 recognizes group differences by giving tribal elders and
 customary chiefs authority in many local matters.
 Custom, tradition, and existing law continue to constrain
 women from attaining a position of equality in society,
 especially in the vast rural areas. Even in the modern urban
 areas, women generally hold lower positions and earn less than
 their male counterparts in the same jobs.
 Nevertheless, with government encouragement, a growing number
 of women work in the professions, the universities, and
 government service and hold high positions. Zaire's Foreign
 Minister, for example is a woman, and 10 women were elected to
 parliamentdry seats in the 1987 elections. In 1987 three
 women graduated from the Zairian Armed Forces' Command and
 Staff College. The role of women in Zairian society is given
 great emphasis in party doctrine and in some laws, e.g., the
 right to own property. The Ministry of Women's Affairs seeks
 to promote greater respect for, and participation by women in
 the nation's economic, social, and political life.
 In an important 1987 development, the Government promulgated a
 new family code in August which, combining elements of
 
 
 348
 ZAIRE
 traditional and Western jurisprudence, addresses many social
 issues including divorce, property, and inheritance. For
 example, through the code, women have gained the right to a
 property settlement upon divorce. In a departure from
 traditional practices, where a deceased man's property was
 often left to the disposition of his father and brothers, the
 family code places wives and children in the first two
 categories of succession. However, the code retains
 provisions requiring a married woman to obey her husband and
 obtain his permission for all legal transactions, such as
 opening a bank account, accepting a job, obtaining a passport,
 and renting or selling real estate.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Working conditions are regulated by law; the minimum age for
 employment is 14, and working hours are limited to 48 hours a
 week. Workers are entitled to a minimum wage, paid holidays,
 and vacations. Their fringe benefits often include a housing
 allowance, medical care, uniforms, transportation, and a
 midday meal. The Government has established minimum safety
 and health standards. Most organized workers in the modern
 sector of the economy know their rights, and UNTZA monitors
 employer compliance with labor laws.
 The majority of the population is engaged in subsistence
 agriculture and small-scale commerce outside the modern
 sector. In recent years all incomes, including wages, have
 failed to keep up with inflation, as depressed commodity
 prices have eroded national income. Wages alone are generally
 insufficient to meet the basic needs of the worker and the
 many dependents that he often must support. Private sector
 fringe benefits, which are not subject to income tax and often
 make up more than half the total wage package, enable workers
 to maintain only a very modest standard of living. In the
 construction industry, for example, the lowest category of
 laborer earns approximately $30 per month, of which only about
 a third is basic salary. In the public sector, where
 remuneration is lower, workers often resort to corruption or
 take on second jobs in the unofficial sector.
 The effectiveness of national labor laws and standards is
 limited. High levels of unemployment and underemployment, as
 well as limited employment in the public and formal private
 sectors, force a large percentage of the population to work in
 the unregulated informal sector. In this sector, many
 children under 14 years of age work to supplement family
 income, and minimum wage, safety, and health standards are not
 observed.
