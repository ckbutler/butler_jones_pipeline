 NIGERIA
 Nigeria is ruled by a military regime;.the Federal Military
 Government (FMG), headed by President Ibrahim Babangida, who
 came to power following a 1985 coup. A 19-member Armed Forces
 Ruling Council (AFRC) is the country's main decisionmaking
 organ, and its decisions, promulgated by decree, are the
 supreme law of the land. A 25-member, mixed military-civilian
 cabinet presides over executive functions. President.Babangida
 controls both the AFRC and the Cabinet.. Military governors
 head each of the 21 states, and a minister heads the federal
 capital territory, Abuja. During 1990 the FMG took specific
 measures toward returning Nigeria to democratic, civilian rule
 by 1992. Nigeria's two .political parties (newly created by
 the FMG) elected their own local,, state, and:national officials
 and held national conventions in July. In October the FMG
 issued a decree changing the effective date of the new
 Constitution from October 1992 to May 1989. Whether the
 provisions of the new Constitution guaranteeing fundamental
 civil liberties are suspended; as was the.case with similar
 provisions in the 1979 constitution, will apparently not be
 known unless the issue is .taken to -court.
 The FMG enforces its authority through the federal security
 system--the-military, the State Security Service (SSS), and
 the national police--andtthrough the courts. Some police and
 security services officials have been responsible for human
 rights violations: arbitrary arrests, detention without
 trial, and excessive use of force by law enforcement officers,
 sometimes leading to deaths of persons in official custody.
 There were no known instances of authorities being punished
 for such abuses.
 Most of Nigeria's population of over 100 million is rural,
 engaging in small-scale agriculture. Unemployment is
 widespread, and underemployment is high in urban areas. The
 country depends on oil revenues (90 percent of export earnings)
 to pay for 80 percent of its budgetary expenses. Government
 efforts to address economic problems, exacerbated by the fall
 in oil revenues which began in 1981, have had mixed results.
 While industrial output has declined sharply, there have been
 some improvements in the agricultural sector. Inflation,
 while rising, remained in check during the year.
 Notwithstanding the FMG's firm measures to implement a
 democratic system from the top, human rights remained
 circumscribed in 1990, especially after a failed coup attempt
 on April 22 when scores of persons were jailed without being
 given due process and some newspapers and journals were closed
 for short periods. There were persistent but unconfirmed
 reports that summary executions of rebel soldiers took place
 after the coup attempt. Sixty-nine alleged coup plotters were
 convicted and executed following closed-judicial proceedings
 in July and September. Police brutality-(including the use of
 torture); deaths of prisoners due to poor prison conditions;
 arbitrary detentions, especially of journalists; lack of fair
 trials (notably by special tribunals); and restrictions on the
 rights of women and labor remained problems. The Government
 granted amnesty-to more than 5,000 persons in 1990 in an effort
 to reduce overcrowding in-jails, and in.January it amended
 Decree Two, the State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree of
 1984, shortening the allowable time of detention without charge
 from 6 months to 6 weeks. Two-party local government elections
 went smoothly on December 8, with the Social Democratic Party
 (SDP) winning a majority of the contested offices.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were unconfirmed reports of summary executions of rebel
 soldiers while the April 22 coup attempt was under way or
 immediately afterward. It is not known to what extent high-
 level FMG officials may have had knowledge of the alleged
 executions. However, ths FMG stated that only those who were
 tried and found guilty by special tribunals were executed.
 According to credible human rights activists, use of excessive
 force by police officials--sometimes resulting in death-
 increased during the year. Shootings sometimes occurred at
 police checkpoints located throughout Lagos, particularly in
 the aftermath of the attempted coup. There are credible
 reports that some criminal suspects were killed in police
 custody. Human rights activists claimed at least a dozen
 criminal suspects were shot and killed at a Lagos police
 station in June and July. There have been no reported
 government investigations or officers disciplined for these
 alleged offenses.
 b. Disappearance
 Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti, president of the Committee for the
 Defense of Human Rights and attorney Femi Falana, chairman of
 the National Association of Democratic Lawyers, were abducted
 in early April by persons identifying themselves as State
 Security Service (SSS) officers, but they managed to escape
 after several hours. The abductors did not mention any
 criminal charges or take the captives to an SSS or police
 station. There have been frequent but unsubstantiated reports
 that many soldiers and a few civilians disappeared after the
 coup attempt. The Government stated that it had detained
 approximately 300 persons, civilian and military, in connection
 with the coup, and that it was still investigating some of
 them. No list of names had been issued by the end of 1990.
 c. Torture, and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The May 1989 Constitution, as did its predecessor, outlaws
 torture and mistreatment of prisoners, and Nigerian law
 provides penalties for such excesses. However, there were
 widespread, credible reports that police regularly beat
 suspects to extract criminal confessions. Torture of
 prisoners, men and women, by prison guards and security
 officials is also believed to have occurred. A recent study
 by a legal research institution reported that over 80 percent
 of lawyers interviewed stated that their clients complained
 about torture and mistreatment while incarcerated. All
 leading human rights groups report incidents of torture,
 including inmates beating other inmates at the behest of, or
 with the consent of, prison officials or guards. Some courts
 acknowledged the existence of torture by quashing confessions
 where torture was alleged. There have been no known government
 investigations or efforts to punish those responsible. In the
 aftermath of the April 22 coup attempt, a few journalists
 claimed they were flogged while under detention. It is
 believed that rebel soldiers were held incommunicado and dealt
 with brutally after the coup attempt.
 
 
 285
 NIGERIA
 Conditions in Nigerian prisons are very bad. The Civil
 Liberties Organization, one of Nigeria's leading human rights
 groups, reported that the lack of food and potable water in
 prisons is universal (approximately 55 cents per day is spent
 on each prisoner for food). Severe overcrowding in cells
 forces prisoners to sleep in rows or in shifts.  Prisoners
 are sometimes manacled, and they are permitted minimal time
 outside their cells for exercise. Most cells are filthy, with
 no toilets or water and poor ventilation; vermin-is rampant.
 Most long-term prisoners suffer respiratory ailments, and
 medical care is inadequate. One credible source indicates
 that pregnant women prisoners may deliver in prison with
 little medical care or help. Prison-born children may remain
 there for some time, without adequate nutrition or medical
 attention. Family and friends are allowed to visit most
 prisoners, although there are reports of difficulties,
 especially with guards demanding bribes. Persons desiring to
 visit some detainees held under Decree Two for state security
 reasons cited particular difficulty in arranging visits.
 The press and human rights groups reported that, in April 7 of
 29 robbery suspects died in prison in Ibadan, Nigeria's second
 largest city, while awaiting pretrial appearance before a
 criminal court judge. A leading human rights group estimates
 that in Lagos' Kirikiri maximum security prison alone, three
 prisoners per week die due to illness. The FMG, acknowledging
 faults in the prison system, established in August the
 National Committee on Prison Reforms, charged with reporting
 on prison conditions and recommending improvements to the
 Attorney General. Attorney General Bola Ajibola publicly
 admitted that convicted prisoners are treated better than
 detainees. He said that the Ministry of Justice would soon
 issue minimal standards for treatment of detainees and
 conditions of detention, although by year's end no guidelines
 were made public.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The 1989 Constitution provides for trial within 3 months for
 the criminally accused. However, inefficient administrative
 procedures and bureaucratic inertia resulted in many detainees
 being held for protracted periods without charge or trial. A
 police officer is empowered to make an arrest without a
 warrant if he reasonably suspects a person of committing an
 offense, witnesses the commission of an offense, or if the
 person "has no ostensible means of subsistence and cannot give
 a satisfactory accounting of himself." These provisions give
 police officers wide discretion, which is frequently abused.
 Under the law, the arresting officer must inform the accused
 of the charges at the time of arrest and take the person to
 the station for processing within a reasonable time. Police
 must also give the suspect the opportunity to engage counsel
 and to apply for bail. Credible reports indicate that police
 often did not strictly adhere to these procedural safeguards
 and held suspects incommunicado for extended periods without
 informing them of their rights or of the charges.
 Arbitrary detentions of ordinary citizens occurred throughout
 1990, according to human rights observers. Although the crime
 of "wandering," akin to vagrancy, was abolished in 1989, police
 detained persons and groups under this charge in 1990.
 Motorists stopped at police checkpoints were sometimes jailed
 for purposes of extortion. In some instances, following
 unsuccessful searches for criminal suspects, police detained,
 usually temporarily, the suspect's relatives.
 
 
 286
 NIGERIA
 Decree Two of 1984, the State Security (Detention of Persons)
 Decree, provides that the FMG may detain, without charge,
 persons suspected of acts prejudicial to state security or
 harmful to the economic well-being of the country. When
 invoked, Decree Two suspends many constitutional rights such
 as due process and the freedoms of expression and assembly.
 Decree Two also contains a "judicial ouster" clause,
 apparently intended to prohibit judicial scrutiny of acts
 under its purview.
 In January the FMG amended Decree Two, shortening the time a
 person may be detained without charge from 6 months to 6
 weeks; it named the Chief of the General Staff (CGS) as the
 only authorized signatory of detention orders and created a
 review panel to make recommendations for the release or
 continued detention of detainees. Ministry of Justice
 officials stated that Decree 24, issued in late 1990,
 transferred those authorizing powers to the civilian vice
 presidency, the office that replaced the CGS in August. The
 Decree had not been made public at year's end, causing some
 civil rights attorneys to criticize its issuance as an effort
 to sidetrack wrongful detention suits pending against the
 FMG. Modifications notwithstanding, many Nigerians still
 consider Decree Two a threat to their basic freedoms because
 the Decree's judicial ouster clause encourages arbitrary
 detention, with impunity for the arresting officers.
 Additionally, there are widespread credible reports that the
 provisions of Decree Two were not always followed by police
 and security officers. Police and security officials
 routinely forged detention orders. In the aftermath of the
 April 22 coup attempt, it is probable that the FMG detained
 more than 100 civilians for statements critical of the
 Government or for possible association with suspected coup
 plotters. Some were detained under Decree Two, others without
 being charged. Among the prominent detainees were attorney
 and former presidential candidate Tunji Braithwaite, Christian
 Association of Nigeria (CAN) vice president Jolly Tanko Yusuf,
 former Minister of Mines, Power and Steel Paul Unongo, and
 several university professors and student leaders. Their
 periods of detention ranged from a few days to over 3 months
 for Professor Obaro Ikime. The postcoup detentions under
 Decree Two reaffirmed the fact that the FMG accounts to no
 institution or court for Decree Two cases.
 Attorneys were detained by security forces because they filed
 wrongful imprisonment suits on behalf of clients. In the most
 publicized case, attorney Tunji Braithwaite was detained on
 April 25 after publicly stating the coup attempt brought to
 the surface ethnoreligious tensions that the Government should
 address. He immediately filed suit, and the court granted his
 motion for a writ of habeas corpus, i.e., to bring Braithwaite
 before the court to enable the judge to question him about the
 detention. The FMG refused to comply with the writ, claiming
 the court lacked jurisdiction because Braithwaite was detained
 pursuant to Decree Two. On May 22, Braithwaite requested the
 dismissal of his suit, claiming it was futile to proceed after
 the Government invoked Decree Two. He was not released until
 June 25. On June 1, the SSS arrested Chief Olu Onuguruwa for
 failing to drop a wrongful detention suit filed by his client,
 Paul Unongo. Onuguruwa was released from jail on June 14. By
 early August, all well-known persons detained after April 22
 were released. Yet, detentions of less prominent persons
 remained a problem. Many criminal suspects are arbitrarily
 held under Decree Two. A credible report alleged that over 50
 
 
 NIGERIA
 such criminal suspects were being held in Kirikiri prison in
 Lagos alone.
 The FMG occasionally publicized the release of some persons
 detained after the coup attempt, the largest group numbering
 61 in May. Additionally, the Decree Two review panel convened
 several times. The FMG stated that it released numerous
 detainees based on the panel's recommendations. Many question
 the Government's figures because usually only the numbers and
 not the names of those released were given.
 During 1990, there were no instances of forced exile as a
 means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Decree One of 1984, the Basic Constitution (Modification and
 Suspension) Decree, left the institutional framework of the
 judiciary relatively intact, but set up a parallel system by
 transferring substantive jurisdiction over certain major
 criminal offenses from the courts to special military
 tribunals, thereby weakening the regular court system. The
 independence of the judiciary has been seriously challenged by
 the AFRC's role as final arbiter and the use of decrees that
 prohibit judicial intervention in political and security cases.
 The regular court system is composed of both federal and state
 trial courts, state appeal courts, the Federal Court of
 Appeal, and the Federal Supreme Court. Courts of first
 instance under the 1989 Constitution include magistrate or
 district courts, customary or area courts, religious or
 Shari'a (Islamic) courts, and, for some specified cases, the
 state high courts. The nature of the case usually determines
 which court has jurisdiction. In principle, customary and
 Shari'a courts have jurisdiction only if both plaintiff and
 defendant agree to it, though in practice feat of legal costs,
 delay, and distance to alternative courts encourage many
 litigants to use these courts! Under the 1989 Constitution,
 Shari'a courts are limited to followers of Islam and to the 11
 northern states of Nigeria.
 Trials in the regular court system are public and respect
 constitutionally guaranteed individual rights. These include
 a presumption of innocence, the right to be present at a
 public trial, to confront witnesses and present evidence, and
 to be represented by legal counsel. In capital cases, the
 Government provides counsel f6r indigent defendants. In other
 cases, indigents must rely for counsel on the Nigerian Legal
 Aid Council, which has limited resources. There is legal
 provision for bail, though the Nigerian Bar Association
 charges that bail is underutilized, with the result that many
 accused persons remain in jail while awaiting trial for petty
 offenses. Bail is denied to those charged with murder or
 armed robbery.
 The AFRC has weakened the regular court system through decrees
 that transfer to special military tribunals jurisdiction over
 cases involving corruption, currency violations, armed
 robbery, and a variety of miscellaneous offenses, such as drug
 trafficking and illegal oil sales, and also for cases
 prejudicing the political transition program (see Section 3).
 In these cases, those charged have access to legal assistance,
 bail (except in the case of armed robbery), and the right to
 appeal (except in the case of armed robbery and conviction
 under the civil disturbances decree). Civilian judges now
 
 
 288
 NIGERIA
 chair all special tribunals, but military and police officers
 sit as coequals with the judges. Sentences handed down by
 these special tribunals are generally severe. Convictions for
 armed robbery carry the death sentence with no right of
 appeal, although the sentence must be confirmed by the state's
 military governor before it is carried out. Conviction under
 the Treason and Other Offenses Tribunal (formed in 1986) also
 carries the death sentence and provides for appeal only to the
 Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose recommendations cannot be
 appealed but are subject to AFRC confirmation. Legal
 observers remain particularly critical of the mandatory death
 penalty without right of .appeal, especially for cases
 involving armed robbers who have been sentenced to death for
 stealing small sums of money.
 Persons accused of plotting the April 22 coup were tried by a
 military tribunal constituted under Decree One (Special
 Military Tribunal) of 1986. Because the proceedings were not
 public, it cannot be determined whether the defendants were
 afforded minimal due process, i.e., fair evidentiary standards
 as well as the opportunity to be heard and confront opposing
 witnesses. Tribunal members were all high-ranking military
 officers; the accused were denied use of civilian counsel of
 their choice; and appeals could only be to the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff, not to a civilian appellate court. Based on tribunal
 findings, the AFRC ordered the execution of 42 convicted coup
 participants on July 27. An additional 27 were executed in
 September. They had been retried after being sentenced to
 prison terms during the first court-martial, according to some
 legal observers. Four others received substantial prison
 sentences during the second trial. Human rights groups
 protested against the retrial because it was also secretly
 held and because of the perception of double jeopardy
 surrounding the retrial.
 There are widespread but unsubstantiated claims that some
 judges seek the Government's advice before deciding cases
 where the Government is a litigant; courts frequently grant
 long adjournments in cases in which the Government is a
 defendant. Also, many attorneys privately complain that some
 judges are corrupt and open to improper influence.
 Additionally, there are credible reports that the security
 services have pressured people into dropping lawsuits against
 the FMG or state governments. Very few released detainees
 have filed and pursued suits against the FMG.
 Nevertheless, within a complex judicial system, in which the
 AFRC has encroached on the jurisdiction of the judiciary,
 Nigeria's courts have an established legal tradition, and a
 number of judges seek to uphold it. For example, in a 1990
 case, in which the FMG argued that Decree Two's ouster clause
 barred the court from hearing a wrongful imprisonment suit
 filed by two detained university professors, the presiding
 Lagos State High Court judge ruled in July that the Court
 indeed had jurisdiction to determine whether detention was
 ordered in accordance with the Decree. The Government
 appealed the Court's decision but meanwhile released the
 professors in August. Some legal experts believe this
 judicial decision contradicts an earlier 1990 opinion in which
 the Nigerian Supreme Court held that judicial ouster clauses,
 if explicitly intended by the AFRC, eliminate court
 jurisdiction over any issue in a case. The FMG issued Decree
 Nine in June, which grants immunity from civil and criminal
 liability for acts taken while in public office for certain
 members of the FMG, including the President, the Chief of the
 
 
 NIGERIA
 General Staff, and military state governors. It is not clear
 if the Decree allows for limited, official liability for
 official acts and personal liability for nonofficial acts, or
 absolves the officials from both personal and official
 liability for any acts. The Civil Liberties Organization
 filed suit against the FMG to determine the scope of the
 Decree; the suit was still pending at year's end.
 Some observers claim that there are political prisoners in
 Nigerian jails, but can give no numbers and often make no
 distinction between those detainees held without charge and
 those convicted of political offenses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Nigerian society is generally free of arbitrary interference
 by the State in the private lives of its citizens. Provisions
 of the 1979 constitution still in force guarantee the rights
 of privacy in the home, correspondence, and oral electronic
 communications. While there have been isolated instances of
 unauthorized forced entry by security elements, the State does
 not carry out general surveillance of the population.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The 1989 Constitution provides for freedom of speech and the
 press, but there were significant restrictions in practice.
 In 1990 federal and state governments continued to arrest,
 interrogate, and detain persons who made or were preparing to
 make public statements the Government considered threatening,
 such as the arrests of Professor Obaro Ikime and attorney
 Tunji Braithwaite (see Section l.d.).
 The Constitution reserves for the federal and state
 governments the exclusive right to own and operate radio and
 television stations. Radio and television programs rarely air
 points of view expressly critical of the FMG and never on
 issues thought sensitive to the Government.
 There are no restrictions on ownership of print media, and
 Nigeria has a lively press. Among the many Nigerian daily
 newspapers are seven privately owned national dailies with
 large circulations, one daily owned by the Federal Government,
 and another in which the.Federal Government owns a majority
 share. In some states privately owned dailies compete with
 state papers. Six weekly newsmagazines vie for national
 readership. Criticism of the Government is tolerated to a
 degree, and there is open discussion of political, social, and
 economic issues. However, officials frequently caution
 journalists, both publicly and privately, on their
 responsibility and the limits of press activity.
 Although there are no published guidelines or decrees directly
 limiting freedom of speech and the press, Decree Two's
 prohibitions against acts prejudicial to state security or
 economic stability cast an expansive shadow, and most
 journalists make a well-considered decision before publishing
 sensitive news articles. The issues considered most sensitive
 by the Government continue to be identifying top government
 officials involved in corruption, publication of subjects the
 Government believes are incitements to riot or undermine state
 security, and subjects "disrupting the transition to civilian
 
 
 NIGERIA
 rule program." Journalists maintain that as a result
 self-censorship is common.
 Journalists who did not exercise self-censorship were targeted
 during the postcoup crackdown. At least 10 well-known
 journalists were arrested or detained in the wake of the
 attempted coup. An official of the newspaper Punch was
 detained on April 27 and held for 6 weeks after publishing
 articles regarding the coup attempt; Punch was closed for 3
 weeks after the articles appeared. On June 8, security forces
 detained the publisher of the magazine Newbreed and closed the
 magazine and other businesses owned by the publisher after the
 magazine published a letter purportedly from the civilian
 accused of financing the coup attempt. The editor, Chris
 Okolie, subsequently filed four lawsuits against the FMG,
 alleging approximately $4 million in losses based on his
 detention and the closure of the magazine and his other
 businesses. The editor of the Daily Champion was arrested and
 charged with sedition for articles criticizing the Lagos state
 government's handling of a violent disturbance at a major
 local marketplace. The sedition charge was later dropped, and
 the editor released. Journalists from the Vanguard newspaper
 and some broadcast journalists were also detained. The Daily
 Champion and the Vanguard were closed temporarily, as was the
 TSM magazine. On June 11, the Bar Association urged the FMG
 to release all detained journalists and to reopen all
 publications. By late July, all known detained journalists
 had been released, and the publications allowed to reopen.
 The Government and journalists continue to differ on the Media
 Council Decree of 1988 which has not been put into effect
 because private journalists refuse to participate in the Media
 Council as contemplated under the Decree. The Decree
 establishes licensing and educational requirements for
 journalists. It also empowers the Media Council, to be
 comprised of government officials and journalists from both
 government-operated and private media, to subpoena journalists
 and require them to divulge sources of news articles.
 Academic freedom is generally respected by the FMG. There
 were no reports of censorship of books or other academic
 publications in 1990 or of intimidation of university
 faculty. Some observers allege that the SSS maintains an
 active undercover presence on university campuses and reports
 directly to the Government on acts or attitudes deemed to
 threaten state security. The National Association of Nigerian
 Students remains banned for what the Government considered to
 be radical activities. However, the FMG removed the ban on
 the Academic Staff Union of Universities in August and has
 tolerated formation of new organs of student government on
 individual campuses. University vice-chancellors are held
 directly responsible for the maintenance of public order on
 campuses and are given broad authority to close universities.
 University closures occurred in the first half of the year as
 students at several universities protested a proposed $120-
 million World Bank loan to Nigerian universities because of
 widely circulated rumors that the loan was conditioned on a
 substantial reduction of university staff. The three
 university professors who were released from detention under
 Decree Two in August were involuntarily and retroactively
 retired from university employment by the Minister of
 Education. This action has been challenged in court, and the
 professors have been reinstated pending the outcome of the
 case.

 NIGERIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Nigeria's 1989 Constitution assures all citizens the right to
 assemble freely and to associate with others in political
 parties, trade unions, or other special interest groups.
 Permits are not normally required for public meetings
 indoors. Permits are required in many areas for outdoor
 gatherings, but the requirement is routinely ignored by both
 the authorities and organizations holding meetings or rallies.
 In a few instances in 1990, security forces disbanded public
 meetings when the subject matter of the meetings was
 objectionable to the Government. In most states, open-air
 religious services outside a church or mosque continue to be
 prohibited in order, according to the Government, to prevent
 their use for political purposes. In early September, a
 conference, organized by human rights advocates and government
 critics, to discuss important national issues, such as the
 country's ethnoreligious situation and the transition to
 civilian rule program, was aborted when conference
 participants were locked out of the conference site by the
 police, presumably by order of the FMG. The Minister of
 Justice warned organizers the day before the conference was to
 convene that opening the conference might violate Decree 19 of
 1987 which prohibits acts prejudicial to the transition to
 civilian rule program and carries a 5-year maximum prison
 sentence. None of the organizers was arrested or charged
 under Decree 19; however, the passport of one of the
 organizers was seized by SSS agents in late August and had not
 been returned by years's end.
 Following religious disturbances in March 1987, the Government
 required that religious groups be sanctioned by either the
 Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) or the Supreme Council
 for Islamic Affairs. Six Christian leaders in Kaduna were
 arrested on charges of unlawful assembly, following
 demonstrations in May. Three of the six surrendered to the
 police in order to resolve the issue of the right to peaceful
 assembly. They were released on June 21 without being tried.
 Hundreds of present and former officials and politicians
 remain banned from running for elective office in the state
 and national elections scheduled for 1991 and 1992, as they
 were for the local elections in 1990. Nevertheless, the FMG
 continues to turn a blind eye to-their presence at political
 events, provided they remain discreet and do not openly
 challenge the banning decree.
 Nigerians form and participate in a wide variety of special
 interest organizations, including religious groups, trade
 groups, women's organizations, and professional associations.
 Organizations are not required to register with the Government
 and are generally permitted free association with other
 national and international bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nigeria's 1989 Constitution prohibits the federal and state
 governments from adopting any state religion. This prohibition
 is adhered to in practice, though some Christians maintain
 that adherence to Islam provides a political advantage and
 have called on the FMG to state publicly that Nigeria is not a
 member of the Islamic Conference. Christians staged
 demonstrations early in the year in northern Nigeria to express
 
 
 292
 NIGERIA
 their concern that Christians were underrepresented in the
 FMG, particularly after the cabinet shuffle in late December.
 Constitutional provisions guaranteeing freedom of religious
 belief, religious practice, and religious education are
 generally respected. Nonetheless, reports are common that
 various ethnic groups (including local and state officials
 belonging to that group) discriminate against minorities (both
 ethnic and religious). Such actions often take the form of
 employment discrimination and bureaucratic obstacles to church
 or mosque construction that delay projects, sometimes
 indefinitely. Local authorities in Sokoto, a northern,
 predominantly Muslim state, ordered the demolition of nine
 Christian churches, ostensibly for lacking proper occupancy
 certification. Christian leaders allege that other religious
 buildings without proper certification, including mosques,
 were not threatened and that two of the demolished churches
 had proper certificates of occupancy.
 There are no restrictions on the numbers of clergy trained or
 on contacts with coreligionists in other countries. Religious
 travel, including the hajj, is permitted and is even
 subsidized by'the Federal Government. Publications in Arabic
 and the teaching of Arabic are freely allowed, even in
 predominantly Christian areas. Missionaries and foreign
 clergy, though limited by quotas, are permitted work in
 Nigeria and have not encountered official harassment or
 mistreatment. The Government places no obstacles in the way
 of Nigerian missionaries working in other countries.
 Tensions between the Muslim and Christian communities remain
 high in some parts of the country, particularly the north.
 There are sporadic demonstrations and disturbances in these
 areas. The postcoup crackdown increased these tensions. The
 vast majority of suspected coup plotters were Christian.
 Christian leaders such as Professor Obaro Ikime and several
 CAN officials, including the organization's vice-president,
 were detained. Christian schools in Bauchi state were
 attacked in May and June, presumably by groups of Muslims,
 reportedly killing 2 and injuring about 40. However, the
 religious disturbances never approximated the scale of the
 rioting which affected the northern state of Kaduna in 1987.
 In the wake of those 1987 disturbances, the Government
 instituted a ban, still in effect, on all religious
 organizations on postprimary campuses, while reaffirming the
 right of individual students to practice their religion in
 recognized places of worship. Publication of advertisements
 paid for by religious organizations remains banned, although
 the ban is not strictly enforced, and such advertisements
 occasionally appear in the press. Religious programming on
 radio and television, both government controlled, remains
 limited in some areas. The 1982 ban on the Maitatsine Muslim
 sect, the source of bloody disturbances in 1982, remains in
 effect. The group still exists but is closely monitored by
 the police.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Nigeria's Constitution entitles its citizens to move freely
 throughout Nigeria and reside and work where they wish. The
 Constitution also prohibits expulsion from Nigeria or the
 denial of exit or entry to any Nigerian citizen. Nigerians
 travel abroad in large numbers, and many thousands study
 overseas  Passports of some human rights activists were

 seized in 1990 to prevent them from traveling abroad after
 making statements or engaging in activities offensive to the
 Government. Also, under Nigerian law, wives--including
 expatriates--must have the permission of their husbands to take
 their children out of Nigeria. Security officials in the past
 have prevented wives from leaving with children, but there were
 no known instances of such interference in 1990. Citizenship
 cannot be revoked for any reason. No known penalties have been
 levied against the thousands of Nigerians who have emigrated,
 settled abroad, or acquired another nationality. However,
 Nigeria does not recognize dual nationality; naturalization in
 another country does provide exemptions from Nigerian laws.
 There were instances of forced resettlement during 1990. After
 posting a 7-day notice to leave the area, the Lagos state
 government demolished the slum of Maroko in July, evicting an
 estimated 300,000 inhabitants in the process, despite legal
 challenges to stop eviction filed by human rights activists.
 The evictions were carried out without a judicial determination
 of the property ownership or rights of possession of the
 inhabitants. According to many human rights observers,
 resettlement was marked by confusion as most of the buildings
 the evacuees moved to were not ready for occupancy and suffered
 from the same inadequacies cited to justify Maroko's
 destruction. Additionally, sufficient resettlement housing
 was not available, forcing many Maroko residents to leave
 Lagos altogether.
 Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge and asylum
 in Nigeria for political refugees from other countries.
 Nigeria supports and fully cooperates with the Lagos office of
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 1990
 several hundred Chadian refugees were voluntarily repatriated,
 continuing a practice from previous years. No refugees were
 expelled in 1990. As part of an exodus brought about by the
 civil war in Liberia, some 1,400 Liberian refugees entered
 Nigeria in 1990 and are receiving some assistance from the
 Government.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The 19-member AFRC headed by President Babangida is the
 highest political authority in the land. There is no elected
 legislative body. In 1990 citizens did not have the right to
 change their national or state governments through the
 electoral process. During the year, however, the FMG
 continued the program of political transition to civilian
 government. In implementing the prescribed two-party system,
 the FMG issued a schedule of local, state, and national
 elections. President Babangida initiated further changes,
 including establishment of a civilian vice president,
 appointment of civilian deputy governors in all 21 states, and
 removal of military officers as heads of public corporations
 and government commissions. The FMG also provided party
 manifestos, constitutions, and financing for the two political
 parties it created.
 Party delegates were chosen at the local, state, and national
 levels for both the National Republican Convention (NRC), the
 party "slightly to the right," and the Social Democratic Party
 (SDP), the party "slightly to the left." Local level
 delegates were chosen through a system wherein party members
 cast open ballot votes by standing in line behind photographs
 of their preferred candidates. These elections were
 
 
 294
 NIGERIA
 relatively trouble free. However, some human rights activists
 claim that the open ballot system subjected voters to coercion
 and social pressure, particularly in rural areas.
 In July both parties held conventions to select national
 committee officials. In September the FMG approved the
 amended policy manifestos of both parties and authorized them
 to begin campaigning for the open ballot, local general
 elections that were held December 8. However, as the parties
 began fleshing out their organization and programs, many
 activists and political aspirants, who in the Nigerian context
 were more than "slightly to the left or right" on the
 political spectrum, called publicly and privately for an
 unstaged, multiparty system. These statements occasionally
 provoked public criticism from the Government, but no one was
 reported detained for making them.
 Local general elections under the two-party system created by
 the FMG were held December 8 under an open ballot system, with
 the voter turnout estimated roughly at well under 20 percent
 nationwide. The SDP won about 53 percent of the local
 government chairmanships and local councillor positions.
 Traditionally, Nigerian politics have been male dominated,
 though women face no legal impediments to political
 participation or voting. During the party elections, women in
 various parts of Nigeria, including the traditionally
 conservative north, won positions in both the NRC and SDP.
 For example, the Lagos state chairpersons of both parties are
 women. A number of women openly aspire to local, state and
 national offices, and some were candidates (a few successful)
 in the December elections. However, financial limitations and
 traditional familial obligations are serious hurdles to
 increased participation of women in Nigerian politics.
 Thousands of former Nigerian government officials, both
 civilian and military, are prohibited from participating fully
 in the transition process, though still eligible to vote.
 Under the provisions of the ban, these persons, including
 President Babangida himself, will be barred from contesting
 any election until the transition is completed in 1992.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Human Rights Committee of the Nigerian Bar Association
 (NBA) monitors the domestic human rights situation and
 occasionally speaks out against human rights abuses. At least
 five other major local groups are active in human rights
 matters: the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
 (CDHR), led by a prominent Lagos physician; the Nigerian
 Council for Human Rights, chaired by a leading Senior Advocate
 of Nigeria; Human Rights Africa, led by a prominent Lagos
 lawyer and president of the Nigerian Trial Lawyers
 Association; the Civil Liberties Organization (CLO), led by
 several Lagos attorneys and a prominent journalist; and the
 National Association of Democratic Lawyers. The NBA, Nobel
 laureate writer Wole Soyinka, and leaders of all five human
 rights groups-made strong public statements in 1990 criticizing
 continued use of Decree Two, notwithstanding the amendments
 enacted in January, and against other forms of detention
 without charge. A former president of the NBA, who also served
 as the chairman of its Human Rights Committee, continues to
 hold the post of Attorney General and Minister of Justice. He
 
 
 295
 NIGERIA
 has been severely criticized by human rights activists for his
 defense of Decree Two.
 While most human rights monitors were able to work with little
 or no government interference in 1989, two CLO officers were
 briefly detained and questioned by police in May 1990 about
 CLO legal representation of persons detained after the coup
 attempt. No action was taken against the CLO members. CDHR
 meetings were disrupted by security forces in May, and its
 president was instructed to report his activities to the
 security service for several weeks. Security officials
 conducted a search without a warrant of a CDHR meetingplace
 and confiscated tha documents which have not been returned.
 The CDHR president was detained for 2 days in November and
 then released without charge. Amnesty International visited
 Nigeria in 1990 to evaluate the human rights climate and was
 allowed to conduct its investigation free of interference.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no official policy of discrimination against any of
 Nigeria's 250 ethnic groups, and laws do not favor one group
 over another. The 1989 Constitution requires that
 governmental employment and the provision of government
 services reflect a "federal character," i.e., a proportioning
 of government employment and provision of government services
 based on the ethnic and regional distribution of the country's
 population. The FMG generally makes a conscious effort to
 strike a balance among different groups in its decisionmaking
 and in appointments to key government positions. Ethnic and
 regional hiring quotas are observed in most public sector
 employment. However, tradition continues to impose
 considerable pressure on individual government officials to
 favor their own ethnic or religious group. Religious and
 ethnic favoritism or harassment persist. Persons not
 indigenous to their state of residence frequently experience
 difficulties, e.g., inr finding employment and in enrolling
 their children in school.
 Women have always had some economic power and have exerted
 influence in Nigerian society, through women's councils, family
 connections, and, to a much lesser extent, mainstream social,
 economic, or political organizations. As primary school
 enrollment increases, and traditional impediments weaken,
 girls and young women are gaining greater access to
 education. There has been a dramatic increase in the number
 of women obtaining university degrees and becoming
 professionals, including teachers, lawyers, doctors, judges,
 senior government officials, media figures, and business
 executives. However, despite some economic independence,
 women suffer societal discrimination in employment and other
 areas, and experience social prejudice. The pattern of
 discrimination against women varies according to the ethnic
 and religious diversity of Nigeria's vast population. In some
 states, husbands can prevent their wives from obtaining
 employment or passports. In many states, a woman may not own
 property in her own right and as a widow may not inherit her
 husband's property, which in the absence of children usually
 reverts to the husband's family. Women do not receive equal
 pay for equal work, and male professionals receive fringe
 benefits not extended to their female counterparts. Women
 find it extremely difficult to acquire commercial credit or
 obtain tax deductions or rebates as heads of households.
 
 
 296
 NIGERIA
 While violence against women, especially wife beating, exists,
 there are no statistical data to help determine the extent of
 the problem. The Government had neither actively addressed
 nor sanctioned this practice, which is subject to the
 provisions of criminal law if brought to the courts. Police
 do not normally intervene in domestic disputes. Reports of
 wife beating are common in rural areas where women are
 generally uneducated and are unlikely to use the legal system
 due to traditional pressures and ignorance of the law.
 Moreover, in more traditional areas, it is questionable
 whether the courts would actively intervene to protect a woman
 who has formally accused her husband, if the level of alleged
 abuse does not exceed customary norms.  The Government
 publicly.opposes the practice of female circumcision, which
 reportedly affects close to 50 percent of the female
 population. The most dangerous form, infibulation, is still
 practiced in some areas. However, because of the deep
 cultural roots of this practice, the Government has relied
 primarily on education through women's and public health
 organizations to help induce a change in attitudes, rather
 than on trying to criminalize the practice. Public education
 has had some effect, but change has been slow. The Government
 also tries to discourage the sale of young girls for marriage
 by poor rural families, again primarily through educational
 means. There are no estimates on the extent to which this
 practice is carried out.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Nigerian workers, except for members of the armed forces and
 employees of government services designated essential by the
 FMG, may join trade unions. In February the FMG dissolved the
 Customs, Excise and Immigration Staff Union and added its
 members to the list of essential occupations. The Nigeria
 Labour Congress (NLC) has called on the FMG to reinstate the
 Union. Employers are obliged by law to recognize
 trade unions and must pay a dues checkoff for employees who
 are members of a registered trade union. In 1981 organized
 labor claimed 3 million members out of a total work force of
 30 million. Since then, the available work force has
 increased as the population has grown, while trade union
 membership has probably declined due to low economic growth.
 While the trade union movement has had, within limits,
 considerable latitude for action, it has been subject to
 government oversight, particularly during the past 3 years.
 Despite provisions in the 1989 Constitution and Nigeria's
 ratification of 29 International Labor Organization (ILO)
 conventions, government decrees and policy continue to
 restrict labor freedoms. A 1978 decree established a single
 central labor body, the NLC, created 42 (now 41) industrial
 unions through forced mergers and deregistered all other
 unions. The Government has not acted upon an ILO Committee of
 Experts' finding, first enunciated in 1979 and subsequently
 repeated, that this 1978 decree violates ILO Convention 87 on
 freedom of association and, to which Nigeria is a party. In
 recent years the Government has publicly announced its
 intention to merge the present 41 unions into 19. During the
 past year the Government has said little on the subject, while
 the NLC is considering its own merger plan (which would
 reportedly result in 21 unions), aimed, in its view, at
 strengthening the labor movement.
 
 
 NIGERIA
 In December 1988, 10 months of direct government administration
 of the NLC concluded with electiods to NLC national and state
 councils. The Government permitted only a single slate of
 candidates acceptable to it, comprised of members of the two
 major NLC factions, to run in the national council elections.
 The report by the government-appointed administrator made a
 number of recommendations, including a law requiring
 constituent unions to pay their dues to the NLC and changing
 the NLC general secretary from an appointive to-an elective
 position. The FMG accepted these recommendations and added a
 requirement that the NLC deposit copies of its budget with the
 registrar of trade unions. The NLC has objected to this
 requirement and to several of the report's recommendations.
 Since 1975 Government policy has permitted international labor
 affiliation only with the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and affiliated pan-African labor federations. In
 December 1989, the FMG took the policy a step further,
 decreeing it into law and providing for the fine and
 imprisonment of individuals, and proscription for unions, which
 violate the ban. This led to widespread international
 criticism and to indications from the Government that the ban
 would be lifted. However, no action had been taken by year's
 end.   Eleven senior employees of the National Electric Power
 Authority, whose life sentence had already been reduced to 10
 years for conspiracy in connection with the October 1988
 disruption of the national electrical power grid, were
 pardoned and released from prison in November.
 The right to strike is recognized by law, except in the case
 of essential services; the application of this exception is,
 in practice, at the discretion of the Government. During the
 past year strikes were relatively few and of short duration
 and focused primarily on pay and benefits. In early 1990, 10
 workers at one bank, who had been involved in a strike and had
 consequently been dismissed, were ordered reinstated by the
 Industrial Arbitration Panel (IAP). The dockworkers' union
 struck briefly for greater fringe benefits; the case was
 referred to the IAP for decision. In September fuel truck
 drivers struck for several days and won a substantial pay
 increase. In December 1989 the NLC threatened a general
 strike over the minimum wage level, then withdrew its
 ultimatum several days before the deadline in the face of
 government pressure. The Government challenged the right Pf
 the NLC, as a central labor body rather than an individual
 union, to call a strike; that issue has not been settled.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The labor laws of Nigeria permit both the right to organize
 and the right to bargain collectively between management and
 trade unionsi Collective bargaining is, in fact, common in
 many sectors of the economy. Nigerian law further protects
 workers against retaliation by employers for labor activity
 through an independent arm of the judiciary, the Nigerian
 Industrial Court. The FMG, however, retains broad authority
 over labor matters. In many areas of contention, the unions
 often take their demands directly to FMG authorities rather
 than to their employers. At the same time, the FMG can
 intervene forcefully to end debate on issues that it feels
 contravene the Government's essential political or economic
 programs, e.g., the dispersal of the labor-organized
 conference on alternatives to the Structural Adjustment
 Program, which led to the arrest of Chief Gani Fawehinmi in
 1989. Moreover, decisions that have a major impact on labor
 
 
 298
 NIGERIA
 are often taken unilaterally. NLC chairman Paschal Bafyau
 complained, for example, that his organization was excluded
 from the formulation of the 1989 budget, which included a
 variety of cost-cutting measures of concern to the unions.
 There are no export processing zones in Nigeria.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Nigeria's 1989 Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory
 labor, and this prohibition is generally observed. The ILO
 Committee of Experts (COE) noted again in 1990 that various
 provisions of the Labor Decree of 1974, the Merchant Shipping
 Act, and the Trade Disputes Decree of 1976 impose sanctions
 that obligate work for breaches of labor discipline or for
 taking part in a strike. The COE has urged the Government to
 adopt the necessary measures to bring these laws into
 compliance with ILO Convention 105 on forced labor, to which
 Nigeria is a party.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children
 Nigeria's 1974 labor decree prohibits employment of children
 under 15 years of age in commerce and industry and restricts
 other child labor to home-based agricultural or domestic
 work. The labor decree does allow the apprenticeship of
 youths aged 13 to 15 but only under specific conditions.
 Apprenticeship exists in a wide range of crafts, trades, and
 state enterprises. With respect to apprentices over the age
 of 15, their activity is not specifically regulated by the
 Government. These laws are enforced only sporadically by the
 Ministry of Employment, Labour, and Productivity, particularly
 in the rural areas where most Nigerians live.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Nigeria's 1974 labor decree also established a 40-hour
 workweek, prescribed 2 to 4 weeks of annual leave, and set a
 minimum wage for commerce and industry of nearly $200 per
 month at the time of enactment, but now worth only about $14
 per month at the current official rate of exchange. This wage
 is now sufficient only for the most minimal standard of living
 in the cities, and the NLC called on the Government to
 increase it. In January 1991, the Government announced an
 increase in the minimum wage to approximately $28 per month.
 Expressing disappointment, labor leaders said the new figure
 did not represent a real increase since it included many
 allowances which were previously granted in addition to the
 basic wage. The 1974 decree contains general health and
 safety provisions, some aimed specifically at youth and female
 workers, enforceable by the Ministry of Employment, Labour,
 and Productivity. Employers must compensate injured workers
 and dependent survivors of those killed in industrial
 accidents. The ineffectiveness of the Ministry in enforcing
 these laws in the workplace is regularly criticized by labor
 unions.
