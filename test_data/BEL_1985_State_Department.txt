 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional
 monarchy. Its Council of Ministers (Cabinet), responsible for
 governmental decisions, is led by the Prime Minister and holds
 office as long as it retains the confidence of the Parliament.
 Direct popular elections for Parliamentary seats (excluding 76
 of the 182 Senate seats apportioned by other means) are held
 at least every 4 years under a system of universal suffrage,
 obligatory voting, and proportional representation.
 Domestic security in Belgium is the responsibility of the
 National Paramilitary Gendarmerie, the judicial police, and a
 host of municipal police forces. The armed forces play no
 role in domestic law enforcement.
 Beginning in October 1984, Belgium found itself the target of
 terrorist attacks from a variety of sources, with groups
 claiming to be Belgian taking responsibility. Some 20
 terrorist actions have occurred since then, claiming 2 lives
 and causing substantial property damage. Terrorism on their
 own soil is an unaccustomed phenomenon for Belgians. Added to
 this was the trauma caused when 38 football fans were crushed
 in the wake of nonpolitical disturbances at a Brussels
 football stadium last May. These events have increasingly led
 Belgians to question their personal security and the
 effectiveness of the forces that are supposed to insure it.
 Respect for human rights in Belgium is guaranteed in the
 Constitution and laws and was observed in practice throughout
 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither the Belgian authorities nor officially sanctioned
 groups engage in killings for political motives. Two firemen
 died in May 1985 after a car-bomb exploded in front of the
 headquarters of the Belgian Employers Federation. The attack
 was claimed by the Communist Combat Cells (CCC), a group of
 apparently Belgian membership that first came to public
 awareness with the bombing of the offices of an American
 multinational corporation in October 1984. Although the CCC
 claimed the deaths were accidental--the police had failed to
 alert the firemen that the vehicle contained a bomb--terrorist
 attacks have become an anxious topic for Belgians and their
 Government.
 The CCC and as many as four other groups state that they have
 targeted NATO and police installations, companies doing
 business with the military, and other political groups or
 private businesses for attack. After bombing a Brussels gas
 company on October 8, 1985, the CCC urged voters to void their
 ballots in the parliamentary elections to follow 5 days
 later. Security forces, principally the Gendarmerie, have
 captured evidence that seems to link French terrorists with
 local groups.

 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, or clandestine detentions by
 official or quasi-official security forces contravene Belgian
 law and are unknown in practice.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Penal Code's prohibition on the deliberate mistreatment or
 injury of another is applicable to the actions of both
 officials and private individuals. Although crowded and aging
 prisons are an issue in Belgium, torture and other inhuman
 punishment are unknown in practice. 'There are no differences
 in the conditions of confinement based on race, sex, religion,
 or social class.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. Arrested persons must be
 brought before a judge within 24 hours or released. Belgian
 law provides for pretrial confinement only under special
 circumstances: when a person is apprehended in the commission
 of a criminal act; when there is a risk that the suspect will
 prove a danger to the community; when there is a risk that he
 will flee the jurisdiction; and when the case involves one of
 a number of serious offenses specified by law. The
 justification for such confinement is subject to periodic
 review by a panel of judges.
 In practice, there is growing concern among local human rights
 groups and parliamentarians that pretrial detention is
 sometimes abused. Bail exists in principle under Belgian law
 but in practice is rarely granted. There is no limit on how
 long an accused may be held prior to coming to trial. The
 Belgian Attorney General, in a speech marking the beginning of
 the 1984-85 session of the Supreme Court, said that in
 numerous cases judges fail to limit pretrial detention to
 those cases that truly meet the standards of public safety and
 the likelihood of flight. He also warned judges that pretrial
 detention should not be used to punish an accused before trial.
 Forced labor is legally prohibited and is unknown in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial, including the right to counsel, is
 guaranteed by law and honored in practice. A suspect is
 charged, if the evidence so warrants, when the preliminary
 judicial investigatory phase is completed. Charges are
 clearly and formally stated. No one is imprisoned because of
 his political beliefs.
 Belgium was the subject of a 1984 decision by the European
 Court of Human Rights which condemned legal proceedings
 against a man whose prosecutor when he was first arrested
 later became one of his judges. In 1985, the European
 Commission on Human Rights accepted a similar case for review
 involving the independence of the judiciary and prosecution.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy by the State
 is guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Participation
 in the political process and enjoyment of civil and personal
 liberties are not inhibited. The Constitution specifically
 guarantees the inviolability of the home, except in cases
 specifically regulatedtby law.. The law-forbids searches of
 private homes at night, except in-special circumstances.
 Warrants issued by a judge are required unless the inhabitants
 of the.domicile agree to the search. The-Penal Code provides
 penalties for all violations of the home by officials as well
 as by private persons. Monitoring of telephones and
 interference with-mail are strictly prohibited.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Varying political, religious, philosophical, and
 artistic views are permitted free public expression, and there
 is no political censorship of the media. There are, however,
 prohibitions on publications and productions held to undermine
 "public order" (e.g., extreme pornography and incitement to
 violence). There are laws against libel, provisions for a.
 citizen's right of reply to media criticism, and restrictions
 on criticism of government policies by civil servants.
 Belgium has-istate-owned radio and television programs which
 are supervised by boards of directors representing the main
 currents of opinion. The Government has a representative on
 the boards but no control or veto power. "Free" (not
 state-owned) radio stations operate openly, although their
 -legal status is ambiguous. Most urban homes also have access
 to foreign television from neighboring countries via cable.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Subject to regulations to preserve public order, political,
 civic, religious, artistic, social, and special interest
 groups are permitted free public assembly; Groups protesting
 government policies or actions and labor unions are free from
 harassment and persecution, although permits are required for
 open-air assemblies.
 The right to organize, strike, and bargain collectively is
 recognized and exercised freely. Government austerity
 measures sometimes limit or alter the results of collective
 bargaining. This was the basis of a 1983 complaint to the
 International Labor Organization by one of Belgium's two major
 labor confederations. The degree of union organization is one
 of the highest in the world--approximately 70 percent of the
 work force. Labor unions are strong and independent of the
 government but have important informal links with and
 influence on many of the major political parties. The unions
 do not allow their leaders to hold political office.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Belgium has a long tradition of religious tolerance. The
 Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religions are accorded
 "recognized" status in law, which includes a government
 
 
 924
 BELGIUM
 subsidy. "Nonrecognized" religions enjoy full freedom to
 practice and are not subject to harassment or persecution.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Belgian citizens enjoy freedom of travel within the country
 and internationally, including the right of voluntary
 repatriation. A law took effect in May 1985 that gives six
 municipalities in the greater Brussels region the right to
 refuse to register new foreigners--defined as citizens of
 non-European Economic Community countries--as residents. Such
 registration is required of all persons residing in Belgium,
 with some exceptions. To date all six municipalities have
 taken advantage of the new law, whose effect is to limit the
 freedom of foreigners to decide where in Belgium they may
 reside. On the other hand, anyone arriving in Belgium may
 claim political asylum, and will be allowed to stay in Belgium
 long enough to pursue that claim. Belgium automatically
 grants the right of political asylum to those foreign
 nationals who are recommended by the local office of the U.N.
 High Commission for Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The last elections were held on October 13, 1985 when Prime
 Minister Martens' center-right coalition emerged with an
 enhanced majority. Participation in the political system is
 open to all citizens. Suffrage is universal for all adults
 (18 and over), secret, and compulsory. Unweighted voting (one
 person/one vote) has been in effect since 1919 for men and
 since 1949 for women. There are 13 parties currently
 represented in the Parliament. Opposition parties are free,
 under law and in practice, to operate without constraints or
 repression.
 The existence of Dutch- and French-speaking regions poses
 significant problems for the Belgian State. All major
 institutions, including political parties, are divided along
 linguistic lines. There are special provisions for Dutch-,
 French-, and German-speaking councils at the community level.
 Regional and linguistic needs are taken into account in
 national decisions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Belgian Government has been active in the United Nations
 and other international forums concerned with human rights and
 has promoted independent investigation of'alleged human rights
 violations. No requests have been made for outside
 investigation of the human rights situation in Belgium. There
 are several active independent human rights groups in Belgium,
 and they consider the Government open to discussion of any
 human rights question.-
 Amnesty International did not mention Belgium in its 1985
 Report. Freedom House rated Belgium "free."

 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Belgium's population in 1985 was 9,885,000 and was growing at
 the rate of only one-tenth of one percent annually. Per
 capita gross national product was $9,150 in 1983. In 1985
 -Belgium's economy continued to suffer from slow growth and
 -high unemployment, the latter at slightly less than 14
 percent. According to the World Bank, governmental policies
 to increase employment and an extensive system of unemployment
 compensation and other social benefits have helped to minimize
 individual financial hardship.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion. :The literacy rate is 98
 percent. In 1985 life expectancy was 73.6 years, with the
 infant mortality rate 10 per 1,000 live births. In 1982,
 nearly 99 percent of the.children.eligible for primary
 education were enrolled. School attendance is mandatory until
 age 18 for both sexes.
 The minimum age for employment of children is 16, and children
 can work and study part time from age 16 to 18. Belgian
 working hours, mandated by law and collective agreement, are
 the shortest in Europe, averaging 37 hours a week. There are
 generous legal provisions for minimum wages (currently almost
 $600 a month for full-time work for those over 21 years of
 age, with a slightly lower youth minimum), vacations, and
 unemployment benefits. Adequate health and safety legislation
 exists, supplemented-by collective bargaining agreements, and
 health and safety committees are mandated by law at
 enterprises with more than 50 employees.
 Belgium is active in the area of women's rights. The
 Consultative Commission for the Condition of Women, attached
 to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, advises the Government on
 international women's issues. Within the country there are
 several other commissions on women's rights which deal with
 oversight of women's education and working conditions. There
 are numerous women members of the Senate and Chamber of
 .Representatives, and there are two women in Cabinet posts.
 Belgium is a culturally active, pluralistic society in which
 individual differences in general are respected, and
 linguistic rights in particular are protected. Some 57
 percent of Belgians are native Dutch speakers living primarily
 in the northern provinces that constitute Flanders, 42 percent
 are French speakers living in the capital, Brussels, and the
 southern provinces called Wallonia, and the rest are German
 speakers living along the eastern border. These language
 differences have been the subject of hundreds of laws over the
 last century, leading to a fairly rigid structure designed to
 protect each language group from cultural, economic, or
 political dominance by the others.
 Nearly 1 out of every 10 persons living in Belgium is
 foreign-born. Some 25 percent of the residents of Brussels
 are foreigners, resulting from a concentration of primarily
 north African immigrants who have a profound effect on the
 social and economic mix. The immigrant population tends to be
 poorer, less skilled, and less educated than the average, and
 increasingly the focus of public debate.
