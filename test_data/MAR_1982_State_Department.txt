 MOROCCO*
 Morocco, which has existed as a political entity for some 1,200
 years, is a constitutional monarchy ruled by Hassan II. The
 Constitution confirms the King as head of state and religious
 leader of Morocco, with extensive powers. He dominates the
 Moroccan political system. The Constitution also provides for
 a multiparty system with a Prime Minister appointed by the King
 to be head of government; a unicameral parliament (264 members
 elected for six year terms, two thirds directly elected by
 universal suffrage of those over 20 years; the remaining
 one-third indirectly elected by community councils and by
 business, labor and farmer groups); and an independent judicial
 structure, of which the highest court is the Supreme Court,
 whose judges are appointed by the Crown. Civil and criminal
 codes combine both French and traditional Islamic law.
 The Treaty of Fez (1912) made central Morocco a protectorate of
 France; Spain assumed a protectorate over zones in the north
 and south. The Kingdom of Morocco recovered its political inde-
 pendence from France on March 2, 1956. Hassan II succeeded his
 father, Mohammed V, to the throne in 1961. Spanish zones were
 restored incrementally to Morocco in 1956, 1958, and 1969; two
 northern enclaves now remain under Spanish control.
 In what most Moroccans saw as a continuation of this process,
 Spain ceded control of the Western Sahara to Morocco and
 Mauritania in the Madrid Accords of November 1975, and Morocco
 occupied the northern part of the territory. Morocco occupied
 the remainder of the territory following Mauritania's
 renunciation of its claims in 1979.
 Saharan nationalists of the Polisario Front rejected Moroccan
 and Mauritanian control' and in February 1976 declared the
 territory's independence as the Saharan Arab Democratic
 Republic. The Polisario, with direct material support
 principally from Algeria and Libya, has been at war with
 Morocco since then. A ceasefire and referendum were agreed
 upon in August 1981 at an Organization of African Unity summit
 in Nairobi, but details of this settlement remain to be worked
 out and the fighting has continued intermittently. The
 Moroccan Government's completion of a defensive barrier around
 the main populated areas in 1982 significantly reduced
 Polisario ability to strike at them. Areas of the Western
 Sahara under government control have been integrated into the
 Moroccan polity, and their inhabitants participated in
 elections in 1977 and 1981 on the same basis as inhabitants of
 Morocco proper.
 During its 26 years of modern independence, Morocco has con-
 fronted major challenges in building national political,
 economic, and social structures on its colonial and tribal
 infrastructure. This has been especially true in encouraging
 development of political institutions, in providing for basic
 educational, housing, and health needs, and in training the
 necessary manpower to manage its bureaucracy and private
 sector. Despite its moderately good quality of life, the costs
 of Morocco's efforts to assert control over the Western Sahara,
 together with rising imported energy and food costs, as well as
 constricting export markets, remain an economic drain on
 resources that otherwise might be applied to further developing
 the economyand to instituting additional social programs.
 During the past two years, the Government has also cut back
 subsidies on basic staples for budgetary reasons, a

 end of this report.

 move which helped to spark serious unrest in Casablanca and
 other urban areas during 1981.
 More than half of Morocco's Arab-Berber population of 21
 million is under the age of 20. Arabic is the official
 language of the Kingdom; Berber is spoken by some 40 percent of
 the population; French and Spanish are widely spoken. Islam,
 which serves as the guide for the nation's traditional social
 system, is the established state religion.
 The coastal plains, containing nearly all of Morocco's major
 cities and 40 percent of its population, are the most densely
 populated and economically advanced part of the country. The
 nation is still largely rural, with an agricultural economy
 despite an accelerating influx of people to the cities.
 Moroccan society has traditionally been politically
 fragmented. Immediately following the removal of the political
 controls of the Protectorate at independence, the country
 experienced rural rebellions, border clashes with neighboring
 states, two attempted military coups, the promulgation of
 several constitutions, and the evocation of a *state of
 exception' following civil unrest. Recently, there have been
 elections for local councils (1975) and for the national
 legislature (1977) in accordance with the Constitution approved
 by national referendum in 1972. There were elections for
 vacant parliamentary seats and for local councils during 1981,
 as well as elections of some 80 members to a newly formed
 consultative council for the Sahara. Public positioning by the
 political parties has already begun in anticipation of the
 parliamentary elections scheduled for 1983.
 Moroccans enjoy considerable civil liberties and freedom of
 expression. The Constitution is unusual in that it forbids the
 establishment of a single-party system. In addition to nine
 political parties, including two key opposition parties (the
 Socialist and the Communist), three trade union federations,
 two student unions, seven daily newspapers of varying political
 persuasion, and two human rights organizations operate in the
 country. The Moroccan Parliament and local municipal councils,
 since they assumed their functions in 1976 and 1977, have
 strengthened democratic institutions in the country.
 At the urging of international financial bodies, the Government
 in 1981 raised the prices of heavily subsidized basic
 foodstuffs by up to 75 percent. In consequence, the Union of
 Moroccan workers and Democratic Labor Confederation (the latter
 linked to the Socialist Party) called general strikes. The
 latter's work stoppage in June 1981 degenerated into civil
 disorder in Casablanca and, to a lesser extent, in Rabat.
 Government forces restored order. Many demonstrators were
 killed, some reports alleging as many as several hundred.
 Numerous arrests followed, together with trials of those
 accused of fomenting or taking part in the disturbances. A
 number of those implicated have now been released from
 detention, and the Confederation shows signs of rejuvenation;
 almost all its regional offices have reopened.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There is no evidence of killing for political motives either by
 the Government or opposition political organizations. There
 have been no credible allegations of such politically-motivated
 murders.
 
 
 1220
 b. Disappearance
 Pretrial detention is common. Amnesty International has
 alleged that there have been abductions, detentions, and secret
 arrests by official and semi-official government forces, but
 such charges have not been proven. Also, there were
 allegations but no proof of Moroccan Government involvement in
 the Paris kidnapping of antiregime activist Khadiji Bourequat
 during the fall of 1982. Bourequat, a French citizen,
 reappeared approximately one week after her abduction.
 c. Torture
 As in previous years, in 1982 there were sporadic charges that
 Moroccan prisoners were beaten and tortured, but there was no
 corroboration of instances of such abuses. In a special 1982
 report on Morocco, Amnesty International concluded that
 ill-treatment and torture in Moroccan police detention centers
 have "frequently taken place and may be occurring routinely.*
 Freedom House, in its annual report for 1982, said, "In the
 past, torture has been quite common and may continue."
 Although there continue to be intermittent reports of harsh
 interrogation methods by local law-enforcement officials, the
 Moroccan Government does not condone such methods. Despite the
 large numbers of arrests which took place after the June 20,
 1981 disturbances in Casablanca and Rabat, no substantiated
 accusations of torture of these detainees were registered.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Following a hunger strike in one Moroccan prison and an effort
 by Moroccan and European human rights activists to bring prison
 conditions and the state of health of some detainees to the
 attention of the Government, the Prime Minister and Minister of
 Justice in 1980 ordered an investigation of sanitary and health
 conditions at several Moroccan prisons. Subsequently, the
 Government announced the release of about 140 prisoners in
 March and July of 1980. While expressing the view that medical
 care in Moroccan prisons 'could be greatly improved" in certain
 areas, Amnesty International's May 1982 report on Morocco
 described living conditions in Kenitra Central Prison, where
 most prisoners of conscience are held, as "reasonably good."
 There were no allegations of discrimination among prisoners
 based on sex, race, or nationality.
 Since 1973-1974, when approximately 30 persons were tried and
 executed for high treason and crimes against the state, no
 persons have been executed for crimes against the state.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Several thousand Moroccans were arrested or detained after the
 coup attempts of 1971 and 1972 and the disturbances of early
 1973. Most of those accused in the coup attempts were military
 personnel tried in military tribunals. Some were summarily
 executed. Approximately 100 military personnel were sentenced
 to prison terms, of whom a few who were sentenced to one or two
 year terms in 1971 were released after completing their
 sentences. Most of these military prisoners have been held
 incommunicado since 1973. Amnesty International's special 1982
 report on Morocco stated that these prisoners have been held
 under 'inhuman' conditions and that as many as fifteen of them
 have died in custody, partly as a result of extremely unhealthy
 conditions and lack of medical care. The Government has not
 disclosed the location of those prisoners and does not permit
 them to communicate with their families. As of 1982, at least
 40 who had completed their sentences -- some as many as eight
 years earlier -- had not yet been released. There may be a
 
 
 1221
 small number of others who have never been tried. Many of the
 civilians implicated in the 1973 disturbances were held for
 prolonged periods without trial. However, the number of
 detainees was significantly reduced by trials, releases, and
 amnesties subsequent to 1973. After the June 20, 1981, civil
 disorders in Casablanca and Rabat, 1,100 persons were
 reportedly arrested in Casablanca, nearly 100 in Rabat, and
 scores of others around the country. Included in these numbers
 were members of the Socialist Party and the Democratic Labor
 Confederation charged with inciting to riot. The large
 majority of those arrested have been tried in open court. For
 those convicted, the sentences ranged principally between one
 month and one year; in many cases the sentences were
 suspended. There were numerous allegations, especially from
 French socialist sources, that the party and confederation
 members (especially those absent from the scene of the rioting
 and from Casablanca and Rabat) were the subject of
 politically-motivated arrest and prosecution. On the other
 hand, the Moroccan Government maintained, in many instances
 with the concurrence of the courts, that persons in these
 categories charged with inciting to riot had been active in
 planning and/or creating the atmosphere in which the riots took
 place.
 Another approximately 100 young Moroccans were arrested and
 detained without trial in the spring of 1977 on charges of
 taking part in clandestine and subversive leftist activities.
 All but 14 have since been released, and the 14 have undergone
 trial.
 Arrests under government regulations predating the present
 Constitution in connection with April 1979 strikes were
 strongly criticized by the political opposition.
 In September 1981, the five active members of the Socialist
 Party politburo were arrested after publishing a tract critical
 of the King's acceptance of the Nairobi II resolutions on the
 Western Sahara, to which the Moroccan Government had acceded.
 Several, including Socialist Party Secretary-General Abderrahim
 Bouabid, were arrested by police officials without the required
 warrants. The Government charged the five socialist leaders
 with disturbing public order. They were found guilty at a
 public trial fully covered by local and foreign journalists but
 with foreign human rights group observers excluded. Two
 received sentences of one year in prison; the other three
 received suspended sentences. In March 1982, King Hassan
 pardoned those leaders convicted of publishing the communique
 and those detained were released.
 There are probably between 200 and 300 prisoners in Morocco who
 have been convicted of political crimes, approximately the same
 number as at the end of 1981. Included in this number were
 members of the Socialist Party and Democratic Labor
 Confederation who received prison sentences without having been
 shown to be physically proximate to the June 1981 disturbances
 in Casablanca and Rabat. Not included in this number are the
 bulk of those detained consequent to the disturbances, against
 whom there was evidence of actual involvement in the
 disorders. About half of the present political prisoners were
 convicted in the highly publicized Casablanca trials of 1977,
 at which outside observers were present.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Moroccan criminal court system operates basically on the
 French model. The defendant has the right to counsel of his
 choice. He is charged in the initial stages of the
 proceedings; and charges, generally speaking, are formally and
 
 
 1222
 clearly stated. Some foreign observers have complained that
 charges are not always clear. Civil tribunals have
 responsibility for hearing cases lodged against civilians.
 Avenues of appeal are well-established and may extend as high
 as the Moroccan Supreme Court and the King.
 With the principal exception of some of the roughly 100 young
 persons arrested in June 1977, most of whom have been released,
 persons detained for anti-government activities since 1972 have
 been tried in open court. In the case of the July 1981 trials
 resulting from the June 20, 1981 riots and the Socialist Party
 politburo trials, there is general if not unanimous agreement
 that normal Moroccan courtroom procedures were in the main
 followed, although there is less unanimity on the substantive
 aspects of the proceedings. A report of the International
 Commission of Jurists on one of the 1981 riot-related trials
 commented that the mass trial of 73 defendants fell short of
 international standards in many ways and criticized the length
 of pre-trial detention, the "doubtful validity" of police
 statements, the lack of time available for each individual
 case, the court's refusal to permit witnesses for the defense,
 and "the general climate of repression and violence surrounding
 the trial.* Similar complaints were made by Amnesty
 International in its special 1982 report on Morocco.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 There have been sporadic press reports of intrusions into
 private homes by officials without observance of legal
 safeguards protecting individuals from arbitrary searches, but
 there is no evidence of pervasive abuse. It is clear, however,
 that the Socialist Party Secretary-General Bouabid was arrested
 in his home in 1981 without a proper warrant.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed under the 1972 Constitution.
 Internal press censorship was lifted in 1977. Criticism by the
 media of the administration, social conditions, and all insti-
 tutions (with the notable exceptions of the monarchy, Islam,
 and Morocco's claims to sovereignty over the Western Sahara) is
 commonplace. While advance censorship is forbidden, the
 distribution of publications containing articles critical of
 the monarchy has been occasionally prevented. Also, in the
 wake of the June 20, 1981 disorders, publication of the
 Socialist Party's two organs ('Al-Moharrir' and 'Liberation')
 was suspended because of their alleged incitement to violence.
 The two newspapers of the Communist Party (Party of Progress
 and Socialism) continue to be published daily and provide
 trenchant criticism of government policies with which they
 disagree.
 While foreign journals are available, they are occasionally
 withheld from wide distribution, and the Government has
 apparently prevented or inhibited the distribution of certain
 critical academic and artistic works, including "Amazigh,' a
 periodical edited by Mahjoubi Aherdane, son of the Moroccan
 Minister of Cooperation, which was designed to popularize
 Berber language and customs. Apparently fearing that the
 purpose of the review was to foster Berber nationalism, the
 Government suspended its publication after the appearance of
 the first issue in June 1982.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In November 1978 a six year old ban on the National Union of
 Moroccan Students was lifted and that organization became
 
 
 1223
 active again. The union returned to relative inactivity after
 student demonstrations were quelled on various university
 campuses, including Mohammed V University in Rabat, during
 December 1981. Approximately 100 students, including the core
 of the leadership of the Union, were detained, and, in a series
 of trials during the first half of 1982, those convicted
 received sentences of up to three years. Professional,
 academic, and scientific groups are numerous.
 The Constitution guarantees citizens the right to join trade
 unions and unions the right to strike. The Moroccan
 Confederation of Trade Unions is one of the oldest and largest
 labor movements in Africa. Several other union confedera-
 tions are involved in labor activities in competition with this
 confederation.
 While several activist members of the Socialist Party were
 prevented from representing the Democratic Labor Confederation
 at an international labor conference in Madrid in the spring of
 1982, the Government has adopted a more permissive attitude
 toward the Confederation in recent months, and the union shows
 signs of revitalization. The Confederation now seems more
 hampered by internal divisions than by government hostility.
 The Constitution repeatedly affirms the equality of all
 Moroccans before the law and specifically provides that 'men
 and women enjoy equal political rights' and that 'every
 citizen, male and female, has the right to vote.' While men
 and women in this Islamic society constitute largely separate
 subcultures, French educational traditions have opened some
 doors to Moroccan women, mostly in urban areas, while the role
 of, women in the predominantly rural and traditional Muslim
 environment remains restricted, as it has been over the
 centuries. No woman has ever held a cabinet position in
 Morocco, nor is there any woman in the 264-member Parliament.
 Women were, however, elected to the Saharan Consultative
 Council in voting in the Western Sahara in August 1981.
 Furthermore, a magazine dealing exclusively with women's issues
 began publication in 1982.
 The Government has also supported labor and family planning
 projects designed to improve the lot of women, with growing
 success.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution states that "Islam is the religion of the
 state. The state guarantees the individual's freedom of
 worship.* Islam does not differentiate church from state;
 political, social, economic, and religious attitudes are
 intertwined. While religious freedom is guaranteed, prosely-
 tizing by non-Muslims is not permitted. Despite Morocco's
 history of religious toleration, large numbers of its Jewish
 community voluntarily left the country after the 1967 and 1973
 Arab-Israeli wars; about 20,000 remain in the country, and the
 Government has urged others to return. Relations with
 Christian churches and especially the Roman Catholic church,
 which ministers to some 100,000 foreign residents, are cordial.
 While these churches are not permitted to proselytize, they
 have been encouraged to operate schools, hospitals, and other
 institutions. Roman Catholic archdioceses are centered in
 Rabat and Tangier. There are also Anglican and Protestant
 churches operating freely within the country.
 There were isolated reports in 1982 of harassment of Jews in
 Morocco, e.g., in August, officials at Casablanca were
 reportedly delaying the processing of persons of Moroccan
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 78
 
 
 1224
 Jewish extraction who had French passports. However, the
 Moroccan Government has made it clear that it is opposed to any
 discrimination against the Jewish community in Morocco. There
 has been no recurrence of such reports since last August, and
 none of them dealt specifically with Jews of current Moroccan
 nationality.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco, but not
 in those areas of the Western Sahara contested militarily.
 Foreign travel for political reasons was sometimes restricted
 in years past, but was not in 1982. However, persons without
 means or other influence frequently encounter delays in
 obtaining passports. Also, the difficulty of obtaining foreign
 currency imposes significant practical limitations on would-be
 travelers. There are no formal restrictions on emigration.
 Morocco encourages voluntary repatriation in two important
 instances. Members of the Moroccan Jewish community who
 voluntarily departed the country following the 1967 and 1973
 Arab-Israeli wars have frequently been encouraged to return to
 Morocco. Those members of the Sahrawi population who migrated
 to Algeria following the 1975 Saharan evacuation of the Western
 Sahara have also been encouraged to return. The Government
 has a policy of accepting refugees, although no large scale
 refugee problem exists in Morocco. The Moroccan policy on
 political asylum follows West European practices.
 The Government does not use exile as a punishment, but some
 political dissidents live in self-imposed exile. In August
 1980, on the anniversary of Mohammed V's departure for exile,
 clemency was accorded to twenty-four Moroccans residing outside
 the country who were under sentence or for whom warrants had
 been issued. Two members of the Socialist Party - Union
 Socialiste Des Forces Populaires - were outside Morocco in
 September 1981 when the remaining active members of the party
 politburo were arrested, tried, and sentenced. Their return to
 Morocco has not been hindered; one of these, Abderrahman
 Youssoufi, is currently active in Union Socialiste Des Forces
 Populaires and Democratic Labor Confederation politics in
 Morocco.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All major parties, from Communist to Royalist, have representa-
 tives elected to the legislature and to municipal councils, and
 a large number of parties participated actively in two national
 referenda held in 1980. Likewise, elections to a consultative
 council were held in the Western Sahara in May 1981, with wide
 suffrage and 285 candidates for 81 available seats. Freedom
 House, in its report for 1982, describes recent Moroccan
 elections as "fair and well-contested' but said that "results
 of the 1980 referendums were more questionable.'
 There is considerable opportunity for meaningful participation
 in Morocco's political life. Diverse and well-organized groups
 are now functioning. Suffrage is universal. Five major
 political parties plus smaller groups have elected
 representatives in the national legislature: the Government
 coalition parties -- the Constitutional Democrats, the
 nationalist Istiqlal (Independence), and the Berber-centered
 Popular Movement; two long-time opposition parties (the
 socialist and the Communist Party); and the royalist National
 Grouping of Independents, which is officially designated as an
 opposition group but tends to support the Government. The
 Socialist Party, which joined the October 1981 session of
 
 
 1225
 parliament under protest and on A limited basis, is no longer
 refusing en bloc to participate fully. One of its deputies has
 been elected an officer of parliament in the current session.
 Because of government harrassment for its involvement in the
 June 20, 1981 general strike call and its thinly veiled attack
 on the monarchy over the handling of the Western Sahara, the
 Socialist Party's voice has been somewhat muted over the past
 year. The Moroccan Communist Party, however, openly and
 vigorously continues to criticize the government's policies in
 Parliament, in local municipal councils and in its press. The
 1980 national referendum, which extended by two years the term
 of the legislature and extended the tenure of the presidency of
 the legislature from one to three years, was hotly contested by
 opposition parties hoping to gain seats in the national
 elections scheduled for 1981. The measure, however, passed
 easily.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There were no known incidents from 1974 to 1982 in which
 Morocco refused to permit outside groups into the country to
 investigate alleged human rights violations. Amnesty
 International and other civil and human rights groups have been
 permitted to send observers to trials, and these observers have
 been received by officials of the Moroccan Government. In
 January 1978, the Minister of Justice publicly invited Amnesty7
 International or any other humanitarian organization to send
 impartial observers to visit Moroccan courts and prisons. In
 1979, the Prime Minister offered to a visiting Western European
 legislator to make any prison available for inspection by
 appropriate persons.
 The Moroccan Government allowed attendance by foreign observers
 interested in human rights at the trials in July 1981 growing
 out of the June 20, 1981 civil disturbances in Casablanca and
 Rabat. However, the Government expelled five lawyers,
 including a representative of the International Commission of
 Jurists, who had arrived to observe the trials. In the
 September 1981 trials of the five Socialist Party politburo
 members, American, French, and Spanish observers were unable to
 gain access to the proceedings. There were no reports,
 however, that local or foreign journalists were refused access
 to either the trials stemming from the June 20 disturbances or
 to the Socialist Party politburo proceedings.
 Visits by human rights activists to Morocco noticeably
 decreased in the last half of 1982. In January 1982 two
 Belgian human rights advocates were requested to leave the
 country after they publicly proclaimed on their arrival that
 they had been deputized by the World Labor Federation to
 examine human rights violations in Morocco.
 The Moroccan Government reacted vituperatively to a May 1982
 report of Amnesty International on Morocco which said that
 Moroccan authorities are breaking their own laws and
 international agreements by holding prisoners incommunicado for
 months or years; torturing many prisoners; failing to account
 for hundreds of other prisoners, some of whom had died in
 "appalling' and "inhuman' prison conditions; and imprisoning
 many people for exercising their right to free expression.
 Government defenses against the specific charges tended toward
 reiteration of legal protections and statutory norms which the
 Government of Morocco guarantees in writing. However, the
 general outline of the charges leveled by Amnesty were broadly
 disseminated within the kingdom and debated by press and
 
 
 1226
 public. Freedom House, in its 1982 assessment, categorized
 Morocco as "partly free."
 Two human rights associations, the League for the Defense of
 Human Rights (affiliated with the Istiqlal Party) and the
 Association for Human Rights (affiliated with the Socialists),
 now operate in Morocco. Partially due to the efforts of these
 two organizations, the Government undertook an investigation of
 health and sanitary conditions at several Moroccan prisons in
 1980 and subsequently released some 140 prisoners. The two
 organizations have consistently condemned all forms of human
 rights violations, and have repeatedly called for the
 observance of rights defined in the Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Aware of social tensions after several years of decreased real
 economic growth and sharply reduced public spending, Morocco's
 parliamentarians approved a moderately stimulative 1981-85
 Five-Year Plan designed to foster renewed economic growth and
 an improved standard of living for the country's citizens.
 Although off to a feeble start, the new plan still envisages a
 6.5 percent real GDP growth rate, the creation of more than
 900,000 jobs and an increase in per capita income from $870 in
 1981 to $926 (in 1981 dollars) by 1985. In addition to job
 creation.-- Morocco's restrictively defined unemployment rate
 may currently be as high as 13 percent -- the plan's
 development targets include (1) a concerted effort to reduce
 socioeconomic disparities and improve the quality of rural life
 through increased focus on agricultural development and social
 services and (2) an economic decentralization scheme designed
 to attract labor-intensive small and medium-sized industries to
 provinces suffering from a dearth of jobs and economic products.
 The Moroccan economy registered negative growth in 1981, and it
 now appears doubtful that many of the plan's targets can be
 met. The worst drought in recent memory drastically curtailed
 agricultural yields in 1981/82, forcing Morocco to divert large
 amounts of scarce financial resources from planned development
 projects to pay for abnormally large amounts of imported
 grain. Since then, a sharp drop in the world price for
 phosphates has meant a 28 percent loss in valuable foreign
 exchange earnings for Morocco's principal export. At the same
 time, Moroccan financial managers have been forced to expend
 greater amounts for imported energy and debt service, both of
 which are payable in sharply appreciated U.S. dollars. All of
 this has resulted in an increasingly bleak economic outlook
 likely to force reductions in many social programs at a time
 when popular expectations for a better living standard are
 rising.
 Nonetheless, the Government moved quickly and effectively
 within its means to combat the most serious socioeconomic
 effects of the current economic downturn. Morocco imported and
 distributed sufficient grain in 1981 and early 1982 to ensure
 adequate food at subsidized prices. The government also
 allocated some $260 million in credits to rural municipalities
 for small irrigation and social infrastructure projects, many
 of which would not have been initiated until much later in the
 Five Year Plan. These projects provided temporary employment
 for bankrupt farmers and newly-unemployed agricultural
 dayworkers, permitting them to stay on the land for the next
 planting season instead of flocking to the already overcrowded
 cities.
 Serious maldistribution of income remains a problem. Although
 per capita income was $870, a full 40 percent of the population
 -- predominantly in rural areas -- lives at or below
 subsistence income levels.
 
 
 1227
 The Government continues to build new educational facilities
 throughout the country, particularly vocational institutes in
 the cities and primary schools in rural areas. Enrollment in
 primary schools has increased over the last year, and secondary
 enrollment is growing faster than that in the lower grades.
 The most recent literacy rate estimate is 28 percent in 1975,
 compared to 21 percent in 1970. An estimated 90 percent of
 boys and 54 percent of girls attend primary school for at least
 some period, a considerable improvement over the 67 and 36
 percent figures in 1970.
 The infant mortality rate in 1980 was 107.2 per 1,000 live
 births, and average life expectancy was 56.5 years. The
 population was growing at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in
 1980. In 1970 51 percent of the population had access to safe
 water. Several public health centers are under construction in
 rural areas, and a large modern university medical complex is
 being built in Casablanca. At the end of 1980, Morocco had
 approximately 23,000 hospital beds, or one for every 790
 people. Both educational and health service programs, however,
 are hampered by inadequate professional and administrative
 staff. The Government is endeavoring to rectify this problem
 in conjunction with major bilateral and multilateral donors.
 To ensure adequate nutrition for the average Moroccan, the
 Government subsidizes such basic staples as flour, bread,
 butter, cooking oils, and sugar. Caloric intake in 1980 was
 105 percent of requirements, but the diet of the average
 Moroccan is heavily weighted to carbohydrates and rather low in
 protein.
 Women continue to make measurable strides in this conservative
 Islamic society. Overall enrollment of girls and women in the
 nation's educational institutions continues to grow rapidly,
 and females make up 30 percent of all primary school students,
 more than 40 percent of those in secondary school, and 25
 percent of university students. The enrollment of women and
 girls in rural areas remain an exception, however. Although
 the Government has made educational facilities available to a
 large percentage of rural females, traditional attitudes and
 religious precepts work against government efforts in this
 field. Employment opportunities for women, while remaining
 limited, continue to expand, at least in the modern sector, and
 the Government makes particular efforts to train female workers.
 Western Sahara
 In modern times the former Spanish Sahara has been under
 Moroccan administration since the Madrid Accords of 1975 and
 Mauritania's renunciation of its claims and withdrawal from the
 southern third of the territory in 1979. Municipal,
 provincial, and parliamentary elections were held in the
 Moroccan-controlled portion in 1977, when polling took place
 throughout Morocco. Full communal elections were held in Oued
 Eddahab (the southern one-third of the Sahara) on May 8, 1981.
 By-elections were held for vacant parliamentary seats on May
 19, 1981, and the level of voter participation for the four
 contested Saharan seats ranged from 76 to 93 percent. The
 native Moroccan Saharans occupying the ten seats in parliament
 allotted to the four Saharan provinces include the present
 Secretary of State (Junior Minister) for Saharan Affairs and
 two Vice Presidents of Parliament. There are at least three
 other Saharans in parliament: two directly elected from Tan
 Tan Province just north of the former Spanish Sahara, one of
 whom is President of Parliament, and one indirectly elected as
 a Trade Union Representative.

 Three of the royally-appointed provincial governors are Sahara
 natives. In consultation with the elected municipal and
 provincial councils, the four governors administer their
 Saharan provinces in the same manner Morocco's 36 other
 provinces are governed. Most village and civil servants are
 also locally recruited Saharans. The royal armed foces, a
 sizeable portion of which are stationed near Saharan towns,
 play no direct role in civil administration. The governors are
 primarily concerned with the accelerated development of
 economic infrastructure and delivery of social services in the
 Sahara. Massive public works projects continued in the Sahara
 in 1982, providing more schools, hospitals, and public services
 to a long-impoverished area. Elections were also held in
 August 1981 for an 80-member consultative council for the
 Sahara. The council, some of whose members are women, held its
 first session in late 1981 and continued to function in 1982.
 Agreement was reached at the summit of the Organization of
 African Unity held at Nairobi in August 1981 on the general
 outlines of measures leading to a peaceful settlement of the
 Sahara problem. Under the terms of this agreement, Morocco
 agreed to the negotiation of a ceasefire under the
 organization's auspices and to international supervision of a
 referendum to be held in the Sahara through which the Saharans
 would choose between independence and integration into
 Morocco. Implementation of the agreement remains to be worked
 out in the Organization, the UN, and between the parties to the
 conflict.
 In the portion of the Western Sahara under Moroccan control, no
 reports of violations of human rights have been received during
 1982. All population centers are behind the berm (defensive
 sand barrier) and have been protected from the attacks of
 Polisario insurgents by Moroccan military forces. The bulk of
 the Moroccan forces are in isolated locations defending the
 berm and do not interact directly with the population except as
 a positive economic force. The overall level of military
 activity in the Western Sahara in 1982 has been at its lowest
 since 1975. Opportunities for obtaining information on or
 evaluating the human rights practices of the Polisario have
 been non-existent.
