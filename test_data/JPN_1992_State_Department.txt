 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy based on a constitution adopted in 1947. Sov-
 ereignty is vested in the people, and the Emperor is defined as the symbol of state.
 On the national level, power is divided among executive, legislative, and judicial
 branches. Executive power is vested in a cabinet, composed of a prime minister and
 ministers of state, responsible to the Diet-composed of the House of Representa-
 tives (lower house) and the House of Councilors (upper house). The Diet, elected by
 universal suffrage and secret ballot, designates the prime minister, who must be a
 member of that body. Nearly 70 percent of the electorate usually votes in general
 elections, contested by six political parties covering a broad ideological spectrum.
 For the last 37 years the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has held a par-
 liamentary majority. The judicial system has several layers of courts, with the Su-
 preme Court as final authority.
 A well-organized and disciplined police force generally respects the human rights
 of the populace, but there continued to be reports of harsh treatment of suspects
 in custody. The police force is firmly under the control of the civil authorities. The
 Civil Liberties Bureau in the Ministry of Justice and the Human Rights and Refu-
 gee Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs monitor problems relating to human
 rights practices in Japan.
 Japan's free market economy has the world's second largest gross national prod-
 uct. In 1992 Japan experienced an economic slowdown, with a correspondingly nega-
 tive effect on employment.
 The Constitution states: "All of the people are equal under the law and there shall
 be no discrimination in political, economic, or social relations because of race, creed,
 sex, social status, or family origin." While the human rights provisions of the Con-
 stitution and Bill of Rights are secured by a just and efficient legal system, women,
 the "Burakumin" (a group traditionally treated as outcasts), the Ainu (Japan's indig-
 enous people), and alien residents experience varying degrees of discrimination. En-
 forcement of current laws against such discrimination is hampered because these
 laws contain virtually no penalties for offenders.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known cases of politi-
 cal or other extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known cases of abductions, secret arrests, clan-
 destine detention, or hostage holding by security forces or any other organization.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment is
 provided for in the Constitution. According to credible reorts by prisoners and oth-
 ers, police sometimes use physical violence, including ikiing and beatings, as well
 as psychological intimidation, including threats and name calling to obtain confes-
 sions from suspects in custody. Foreign media coverage of specic cases involving
 foreign prisoners drew attention to this issue. In Japan, confession is regarded as
 the first step in the rehabilitative process. Roughly 85 percent of all criminal cases
 going to trial include confessions, reflecting the priority that the police place on ad-
 missions of guilt. Several court cases have overturned convictions obtained by forced
 confession, but abuse of prisoners to obtain confessions remains a problem. Confes-
 sions, although signed by the accused, are normally written statements by interro-
 gators summarizing and reflecting on the accused's statement and not verbatim
 transcripts.
 The issue of the rights of psychiatric patients received attention in Japan as the
 International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) conducted its third study mission to
 Japan in April 1992 to review the 1988 Mental Health Law. Although Japan was
 redited with effo rts to encourage community-based care for psychiatric patients the
 ICJ report pointed out that a shortage of facilities prevents about 30 percent of pa-
 tients in hospitals from being discharged and handled as outpatients. It also nom
 that a large number of patients who are voluntarily admitted are kept in locked
 wards.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest or impris-
 onment is provided for in the onstitution and respected in practice. Japanese law
 provides for judicial determination of the legality of detention. Persons may not be
 detained without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be prepared to dem-
 onstrate before trial that probable cause exists to detain the accused. Under the
 Criminal Procedure Code, a suspect may be held in police custody for up to 72 hours
 without representation by defense counsel. A judge may extend this period for up
 to 25 days if necessar.. If an indictment follows, the suspect is transferred to a
 criminal detention facility.
 In some cases, the period of reidictment detention may be extended further
 using a procedure known as "beken taiho," or arrest on a separate charge. The po-
 lice may arrest a suspect on a minor or secondary charge and then use the 23-day
 detention period to investigate a separate, primary charge. After termination of the
 initial period of detention, the prisoner may be rearrested on yet another charge,
 thus initiating a separate and additional 23-day detention period. The system was
 used to investigate, and hold without access to legal counsel, three American citi-
 zens in 1992. The law prohibits the police from arresting a person on a charge they
 have no intention of prosecuting, but "bekken taiho" may be used for minor offenses
 such as immigration violations. Bail is rarely available.
 Another concern is the potential for abuse deriving from the practice of "sub-
 stitute detention." While Japanese law stipulates that suspects should be held in
 "houses of detention" between arrest and sentencing, a police cell may be sub-
 stituted. This provision was added to cover a shortage of detention facilities in
 Japan. Critics charge that allowing suspects to be detained by the same authorities
 that interrogate them heightens the potential for prisoner abuse and coercion.
 The length of time before a suspect is brought to trial depends on the nature of
 the crime but rarely exceeds 2 months; the average is 1 to 2 months. By law there
 is no right to legal representation during interrogation. While the Ministry of Jus-
 tice has stipulated that a detained person should be able to meet with counsel with-
 in 48 hours of the accused's request, the Code of Criminal Procedure grants the
 prsecutor's office and the investigating police officials the power to limit access to
 attorneys when deemed ncessa9'/for the sake of the investigation. In practice, the
 48-hour time limit is sometimes ignored, and preindictmnt attorney visits are typi-
 caly restricted to 15 to 30 minutes. As a court-appointd attorney is not provided
 until after indictment, suasiets must rely on their own resources to hire an attorney
 for preindictment counsehig. Some local bar associations provide detainees with a
 free counseling session prior to indictment. In practice, suspects able to afford pri-
 vate counsel may typically consult with an attorney more than once during the
 preinditment detention period, sometimes without private access. Counsel is pro-
 
 
 vided at government expense after indictment when the arrested person cannot af-
 ford one.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the right to a speedy
 and public trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases, and this right is re-
 spected in practice. However, appeals to the Supreme Court have been known to
 take years with one appeal case still pending after almost 9 years. The defendant
 is informed of charges upon arrest and assured a public trial by an independent ci-
 vilian court with defense counsel and the right to cross-examination. The Constitu-
 tion assures defendants the right not to be compelled to testify against themselves
 as well as free and private access to counsel, although the right to such access is
 sometimes abridged in practice. Defendants are also protected from the retroactive
 application of laws and have the right of access to incriminating evidence after a
 formal indictment has been made. However, Japanese law does not require full dis-
 closure by the prosecutor, and material which will not be used in court by the pros-
 ecution may be suppressed.
 Judges are appointed by the Cabinet for a 10-year term which can be renewed
 until the age of 65. Justices of the Supreme Court can serve until the age of 70 but
 face periodic review through popular referendum. A defendant who is dissatisfied
 with the decision of a trial court of first instance may within the period prescribed
 by law, appeal to a higher court. There are several levels of courts, with the Su-
 lreme Court serving as the highest judicial authority. There is no trial by jury in
 Japan.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made upon separate warrant is-
 sued by a judicial officer. Standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard against
 arbitrary searches. There are no reports that the Government or any other organiza-
 tion arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Rights, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution, an independent press and ju-
 diciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of
 speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shintoism remain the two mAjor re-
 ligions, there are many others, including several Christian denominations. Foreign
 missionaries are welcome.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Japanese citizens have the right to travel freely, both within Japan and
 abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily.
 Japanese nationality can be lost by naturalization in a foreign country or failure to
 elect Japanese nationality at the proper age.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Japanese citizens have the right and ability peacefully to change their govern-
 ment. A parliamentary democracy, Japan is ruled by the political party or parties
 able to form a majority in the lower house of its bicameral Diet. The Liberal Demo-
 cratic Party (LDP) has been in power on the national level-through control of the
 lower house--continuously since its establishment in 1955. The political system is
 open, however. The LDP owes its longevity primarily to pragmatic and effective gov-
 ernance and to the fragmentation of the opposition parties. Local and prefectural
 governments are often controlled by coalitions. Elections on all levels are held fre-
 quently, suffrage is universal, and ballots are secret. Indigenous people and ethnic
 minorities are free to participate in the political process, although their influence
 and numbers in government and politics are limited, due in part to social stereo-
 tyling and stigmatization.
 pulation movements since the 1946 Constitution have left some parliamentary
 electoral districts disproportionately large; some districts have mere than three
 times the population of others. The Supreme Court has called for greater equality
 in the value of votes, but the lack of a nonpartisan mechanism to make such
 changes has slowed the process of adjustment.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of local human rights organizations exist. They do not face any govern-
 mental restrictions or impediments to their work. The Government does not obstruct
 
 
 583
 or inhibit the investigative activities of international nongovernmental organiza-
 tions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Reigion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, creed, sex, social status,
 or family origin. Children are beneficiaries of equal protection, and the Constitution
 prohibits exploitation of children. The Government backs up the intent of the Con-
 stitution with various laws.
 The position of women in society and the home, although significantly improved
 during the last few decades, continues to reflect deep-seated traditional values
 which assign women a subordinate role. In this environment, violence against
 women, particularly domestic violence, often goes unreported due to social and cul-
 tural concerns about shaming one's family or endangering the reputation of one's
 souse or offspring. Typically, victimized women more often return to the home of
 their parents rather than file reports with authorities. Therefore, Ministry of Justice
 statistics on violence against women undoubtedly understate the scope of the cur-
 rent problem. Many local governments are responding to a need for confidential as-
 sistance by establishing special women's consultation departments in police and pr-
 fectural o ices.
 Although discrimination by private employers against women is prohibited by the
 Constitution, it persists. Women comprise over 40 percent of the employed popu-
 lation. Legislation over the past 30 years has been adjusted to accord them the same
 legal status as men. The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Law of 1986 was
 aimed at eliminating sex discrimination in suc  areas as recruitment, pay, and
 working hours. The law does not expressly, forbid discrimination; it merely states
 that "employers should endeavor" to avoid it. Under this law and other regulations,
 the Ministry of Labor attempts to encourage corporate compliance with its objectives
 by positive inducements, including subsidies; it does not enforce compliance through
 fines or other punitive measures. The EEO Law and other laws dealing with wom-
 en's employment are scheduled for periodic review and some groups are calling for
 the inclusion of penalties.
 Under the current laws, significant disparities in pay and access to managerial
 positions persist. In March nine working married women filed lawsuits with the
 Tokyo District Court, citing discrimination in wages and promotions. Other pending
 cases question management's use of Japan's two-track (general versus administra-
 tive) system of hiring women employees. Initially desifned to create a "career" track
 for employees while maintaiin a separate "clerical track, the system, observers
 say, is used to discriminate against women. Both statistical and anecdotal evidence
 suggests that the current retrenchment in the work force is falling most heavily on
 women seeking entry level nonclerical positions in private firms.
 There are 7 women in the 512-member House of Representatives and 13 in the
 252-member House of Counciors. Diet member Mayumi Moriyama was appointed
 Minister of Education in December 1992. With this appointment, Ms. Moriyama be-
 comes the frst woman to have held two Cabinet positions, having served as Japan's
 first woman Chief Cabinet Secretary in 1989. Women make up nearly 20 percent
 of all government workers but less than 1 percent of top (section chief and higher)
 government posts.The stereotyping of jobs and abilities and to demands and expec-
 tations of family and society impede full participation.
 Public awareness of discrimination against women and of sexual harassment in
 the workplace has increased. An Fuuoka District Court landmark rulingin April
 found an employer guilty of violating the rights of a female worker who a  om-
 plained of verbal sexual harassment by a male superior. The employer, who spread
 rumors that his colleague was promiscuous, was ordered to pay $12,700 in damages.
 Another highlvisible sexual harassment case involved a female Prefectural Assem-
 bly member whio filed assault charges against a male Prefectural Assembly member
 who sexually harassed her. The assailant was released without punishment because
 the attack took place while he was under the influence of alcohol. The case received
 wide coverage both domestically and abroad. An increasing number of government
 entities are establishing hotlines and designating ombudsmen to handle complaints
 of discrimination and sexual harassment. Despite the increased media and public
 attention given to sex discrimination and the growing presence of women i the
 work force, sexual stereotyping and discrimination continue.
 The exclusive nature ofJapanese societ, reinfored by cultural and ethnic homo-
 geneity and a history of isolation from other cultures, has impeded the integration
 of minority groups. Dspite improvements in Japan's legal system, Korean perma-
 nent residents (most of whom were born, raised, and educated in Japan) and the
 Burakumin (descendants of feudal-era outcasts who practiced so-called "unclean"
 prfessions such as butchering and undertaking) are frequently the victims of en-
 
 
 584
 trenched social discrimination which has restricted the access of both groups to pri.
 vate housing, employment and marriage opportunities. The Ainu, descendants of
 the original inhabitants of Japan, are as subject to discrimination, especially re-
 garding employment opporumties.
 Beginning in 1969, the Government introduced a number of social, economic, and
 legal prorams designed to improve conditions for the Burakumin and hasten their
 assimlation into mainstream Japanese society. In 1992 the Government extended
 basiclegislation to provide funding for Burakumin programs for another 5 years.
 The Burakumin continued to lobbyfor a new law that would expand programs.
 The Ainu community continued to seek revisions to existing Jaanese law to af-
 ford greater protection of Ainu rights and improve the status of Ainus. In the July
 1992 upper house elections, Japan Socialist Party (JSP) proportional seat candidate
 Shigeru Kayano, an Ainu, ran for the Diet but was narrowly defeated. Under Diet
 rules, he could become Japan's first Ainu Diet member should an existing JSP pro-
 portional roll member vacate his seat prematurely.
 The legal obligations to carry an alien registration card and to be fingerprinted
 have been leading concerns among permanent resident aliens residing in Japan,
 particularly secondand third-generation Korean residents who constitute 82 percent
 of all such aliens. In response to continued appeals from the Republic of Korea, the
 Government will end the fingerprinting of permanent foreign residents, including
 Koreans. The Government will replace the fingerprint system with a family registry
 system that uses the resident's picture and signature and contains information on
 parents and spouses living in Japan, a system similar to that used by Japanese na-
 tionals. Some within the Korean community continue to oppose these proposed
 changes as discriminatory to nonpermanent resident foreigners. It also leaves intact
 the requirement that all foreign residents must carry alien registration certificates
 at all times.
 In addition, Korean permanent residents are subject to various forms of en-
 trenched social discrimination. In recent years the Government has enacted several
 laws and regulations extending to permanent resident aliens equal access to public
 housing and loans, social security pensions for those qualified, and certain public
 employment rights. As a result of the January 1991 memorandum between the Jap-
 anese and South Korean governments, employment rights were extended to local
 government positions, giving each locality the authority to decide which jobs may
 be held by non-Japanese nationals. (Japanese nationality is required for civil serv-
 ants who participate in the exercise of public power or in public decisionmaking.)
 Observers report that prefectures and metropolitan areas such as Tokyo, Osaka, and
 p arts of Kanagawa Prefecture are expanding opportunities for the employment of
 Korean residents in local government. Local governments are also being urged by
 the Government to allow Korean residents to take the teacher entrance exams and
 to employ them on a full-time basis. Observers so far report no substantial increase
 in the numbers of Korean residents hired as regular teachers. Private sector em-
 ployment and social discrimination are still common. Antidiscrimination laws affect-
 ing Korean residents were initiated as government guidance and are not backed up
 by penalty provisions.
 According to law, aliens with 5 years' continuous residence are eligible for natu-
 ralization and the simultaneous acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right
 to vote. In fact, however most eligible aliens do not apply for citizenship, in part
 due to fears that their cuitural identity would be diminished.
 Immigrants reportedly face police harassment and discrimination in obtaining
 housing, jobs, and health care. In recognition of the difficulties faced by foreigners
 in these areas, Tokyo City recently issued a law to prevent housing discrimination
 against foreigners, and there have been efforts by the Government and by local gov-
 ernments to disseminate information on health insurance plans to enroll foreigners
 into the system. Some communities are using existing social welfare programs to
 cover emergency medical expenses incurred by uninsured foreign visitors.
 The Justice Ministry's Immigration Bureau estimates that as of May 1992, there
 were 278,892 illegal foreign nationals in Japan. Many are illegal workers from
 Southeast Asia, the Republic of Korea, and Iran. The number of illegal Iranian
 workers is expected to decline sharply because the Government suspended, as of
 April 15, 1992, a visa waiver agreement it had with Iran for short-term visitors.
 While many in Japan's illegal foreign population came in search of better paying
 manufacturing and construction jobs created by Japan's labor shortages, there are
 indications that these opportunities are disappearing with the economic slowdown,
 leaving more workers unemployed or marginally employed. Human rights groups
 claim that, with little or no knowledge of the Japanese language or their legal
 rights, foreign workers can easily be discriminated against by employers. Some ille-
 gal alien workers have suffered exploitive treatment, but there is no evidence that
 
 
 585
 this is common. The Government has tried to restrict the inflow of illegal foreign
 workers by prosecuting employers under recent revisions of the Immigration Law,
 by assessing penalties on employers of undocumented foreign workers and by deny-
 ing entry on grounds of passport, visa, and entry application irregiarities to for-
 eigners believed trying to enter Japan to look for work. The Government continues
 to study the foreign worker issue in special committee. Several citizens' groups work
 with illegal foreign workers to improve their access to information about worker
 ri t.                                                                      .
 iere continue to be credible reports of Chinese officials in Japan engaging in
 harassment and intimidation tactics against Chinese prodemocracy students resi-
 dent in Japan. Japan has been criticized for failure to protect adequately Chinese
 dissidents in Japan by extending the visas of those who fear persecution or by pre-
 venting intimidation by Chinese officials. There were reports that Chinese students
 seeking to extend their visas are meeting with greater flexibility from Japanese offi-
 cials.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of workers to organize, bargain, and act
 collectively is assured by the Constitution. Approximately 25 percent of the active
 work force belongs to unions. Unions are free of government control and influence.
 The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), which represents 8 million Japa-
 nese worker, was formed in 1969 through the merger of several confederations and
 is Japan's largest labor organization. There is no requirement for a single trade
 union structure, and there are no restrictions on who may be a union official.
 Member. of the armed forme, police, and firefighters are not permitted to form
 unions or to organize. The International Labor Organization in 1991 criticized Ja-
 pan's denial of the right of firefighter to organize as unwarranted. The Government
 and union representatives initiated talks to address this issue. Japanese law allows
 unions to lobby anto o make political campaign contributions, and most unions are
 involved in political ativity as well as labor relations. Rngo and other labor groups
 are active in supporting political parties and individual candidates and promoting
 their poitia an  socia  nda.
 Organized labor generally supports the opposition political parties and prvides
 key funds and manpower. Unions are active in international bodies, most notably
 the Internationl Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and maintain extensive
 international contacts.
 The right to strike is implicit in the Constitution, and it is exercised frequently.
 A disproportionately large number of strikes take p lace during the spring wage of-
 fensive. Public employes however, do not have the right to strike, althugh they
 do have recourse to mediation and arbitration in order to anolve disputes. In ex-
 chanie for a ban on their right to strike, government employees' pay raises are de-
 termined by the Government based on a recommendation by the independent Na-
 tional Personnel Authority.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Conectivey.-The Constitution states that
 unions have the right to organize, bargain, and act collectively and these rights are
 exercised in practice. Collective bargaining is widely practiced. The annual spring
 wage offensive,' in which individual unions in each industry conduct negotiations
 simultaneously with their firms, attracts national attention. Japanese man ment
 usually conslte closely with unions on issues. However, trade unions are independ-
 ent of managem    nt and aggressively pursue the interests of their workera.
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law and in practice does not take place.
 There are no export processing zones.
 . Prohibition of Fored or Compulsory Labor.cThe Labor Standards Law pro-
 hibits the use of forced labor, and ther are no known cades of forced or compulsory
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chldren.-Under the Labor Standards Law,
 minors under 15 years of age may not be employed as workers, and those under
 the age of 18 years may not be employed in dangerous or harmful work. Child labor
 laws are rigorously enforced by the Labor Inspection Division of the Ministry of
 Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wor.-Minimum wages are administratively deter-
 mined by the Minister of Labor or the Director of the Prefectural Labor Standards
 Office based usually on the recommendation of the tripartite Minimum Wage Coun-
 cil. Minimum wage rates vary by industry and region. These wage rates are suffi-
 cient to provide workers and their families with a decent living. The Labor Stand-
 ards Law provides for the phased reduction of maximum working hours from the
 present 44-hour, 6-day workweek to 40 hours over a several year period.
 
 
 586
 The Ministry of Labor effectively administers various laws and regulations gv.
 erning occupational health and safety principal among which is the Industrial Safe-
 ty and Health Law of 1972. Standards are set by the Ministry of Labor and issued
 after consultation with the Standing Committee on Safety and Health of the tri-
 partite Labor Standards Commission. Labor inspectors have the authority to sus-
 pend unsafe operations immediately, and the law provides for workers to voice con-
 cerns over occupational safety and to remove themselves from unsafe working condi-
 tions without jeopardizing their continued employment.
