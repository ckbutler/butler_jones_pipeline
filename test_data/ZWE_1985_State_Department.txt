 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe has a parliamentary system based on the British
 Westminster model. Its Government is controlled by the
 Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU)--led by Prime Minister
 Robert Mugabe--which won an outright majority (64 of 80
 "African" seats) in Zimbabwe's first general elections since
 independence, held in July 1985. The voting was largely free
 and fair, but ZANU harassment and mistreatment of minority
 party supporters and violence associated with the activities
 of the ruling party was a common occurrence both before the
 election campaign opened and after election results were
 announced. Under Prime Minister Mugabe, ZANU has stated its
 intention to transform Zimbabwe into a one-party state, with
 an ideology broad enough to encompass a diversity of opinions.
 Born of a 15-year civil war, Zimbabwe came to independence in
 1980 with a heritage of white rule based on institutionalized
 racial, social, and economic discrimination against the
 majority black population. At the same time, independent
 Zimbabwe also inherited the strongest and most complete
 economic infrastructure in black Africa--mineral resources, a
 strong agricultural base, and a diversified manufacturing
 sector--all with significant capacity for growth and for
 amelioration of economic imbalances. In 1985, the economy
 rebounded from 3 years of drought, and Zimbabwe produced its
 largest corn harvest to date. The economy remains troubled by
 internal security problems and by the increasing instability
 in South Africa, its largest trading partner.
 The security apparatus has three branches: the police and its
 Criminal Investigation Department, which are responsible for
 general criminal cases; the Central Intelligence Organization
 (CIO), which is responsible for investigating security
 matters; and the armed forces, which have sometimes been
 assigned responsibility for enforcing internal security,
 especially in dissident-affected areas. All three branches
 have violated human rights to some degree during 1985. Most
 of these abuses were aimed at ZAPU, the ruling party's primary
 opposition, and its largely Ndebele-speaking supporters.
 The human rights climate in Zimbabwe in 1985 continued to be
 clouded by internal security problems. Political killings and
 disappearances increased in 1985. The present Government
 respects the 1980 Constitution's provisions that preserve
 multiracial democracy and the rights of property but maintains
 the legal state of emergency, proclaimed in 1960, in force.
 The Government has made full use of its emergency powers to
 override constitutional guarantees of several basic human
 rights, such as freedom from arbitrary arrest and the right to
 a prompt and fair trial. The emergency powers have also been
 used to detain without trial opponents of the Government,
 poss-ibly as many as 3,000 in 1985, including 5 ZAPU members of
 Parliament and several ZAPU Bulawayo city councilors.
 Government efforts to control dissident activity and banditry,
 concentrated primarily in Ndebele-speaking areas in the
 southwestern part of the country, and ZANU zealots' harassment
 of minority party members have strained relations between the
 two major black parties--ZANU and ZAPU--and elicited
 international attention due to the substantial violations of
 human rights that resulted on both sides. The judicial system
 functions independently, frequently ruling against the State
 on sensitive issues and defending human rights through the
 rule of law.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killings increased in 1985. Two main factors are
 responsible for this trend: government efforts to stamp out
 dissident activity and the tensions that emerged among various
 political party supporters during the preelection period.
 Dissident-related killings by security forces are extremely
 difficult to quantify. However, evidence suggests that some
 summary executions have occurred in reprisals against rural
 populations (primarily in Ndebele-speaking areas) believed to
 have harbored dissident bands. While it is commonly alleged
 that this practice is widespread, supporting evidence is
 difficult to obtain, and cases where security forces have been
 brought to trial are extremely rare. No adequate mechanism
 exists to ensure that the police investigate crimes that the
 security forces are alleged to have committed.
 Dissident attacks on civilians continued during the year and
 on a somewhat larger scale than in 1984. The Government has
 estimated that dissidents killed over 100 civilians, including
 many local ZANU party officials. There was a clear pattern of
 targeting of these officials for elimination or harassment by
 dissidents of uncertain origin. Credible theories as to the
 identity of the criminals have ranged from ZAPU militants to
 South African-backed elements to government troops
 masquerading as dissidents. The Government has made no formal
 comment on allegations that members of its security forces
 have posed as dissidents. ZANU members of Parliament have
 repeatedly denied such charges.
 Youth members of ZANU, the ruling party, have been responsible
 for between 150-200 deaths over the past year, according to
 the estimates of knowledgeable sources. Victims were, with
 the exception of two individuals, members of minority parties.
 On several occasions, senior ZANU officials, including
 government officials of cabinet rank, were responsible for
 inciting party youth through incendiary speeches. As in 1984,
 reliable sources report that these officials helped to
 transport party youth to demonstration sites. In most
 instances, senior party officials have condemned party youth
 violence, yet their comments have often come too late to halt
 the violence. After results of the general elections were
 announced, for example, ZANU youth attacked and killed several
 minority party members in high-density suburbs in Harare over
 a period of several days before government and party officials
 spoke out against such violence. There is strong evidence
 that police have occasionally been instructed to stand aside
 during politically motivated violence. Only a very small
 proportion of the ruling party youth who were picked up by
 police for their alleged involvement in antiminority party
 violence have appeared in court.
 b. Disappearance
 Between 300 and 400 civilians in Matabeleland disappeared
 earlier this year, and there has been no word on the fate of
 the large majority of them. Twelve of them who later surfaced
 were in custody of the Central Intelligence Organization
 
 
 391
 ZIMBABWE
 (CIO). Many well-placed sources indicate that government
 security forces were responsible for most of these
 disappearances. Other sources report that at least some of
 those who disappeared fled the country to ayoid being abducted.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Informed sources report that government security forces,
 including the police, the military and the CIO, have been
 responsible for a broad range of mistreatment of suspected
 dissidents, suspected dissident sympathizers, and minority
 party members at various government installations. Types of
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment which have been alleged
 include repeated beatings, rape, and torture involving
 electric shock equipment and water suffocation. Cases
 involving confinement in crowded cells with little or no
 ventilation and detention for several days in open-air cages
 have also been well documented.
 Informed sources report that the use of torture is routine in
 a few government facilities, particularly during interrogation
 of suspected dissidents and dissident sympathizers. The bulk
 of these abuses reportedly take place in Stops Camp, a police
 holding center in Bulawayo. Information on the number of
 persons tortured and on the number of deaths that have
 resulted from torture is difficult to obtain. However,
 reliable sources indicate that some deaths have occurred.
 Sources close to the judiciary point out that persons who have
 suffered or witnessed torture are frequently unwilling to
 bring charges or testify in court for fear of reprisals
 against themselves or their families. Nevertheless, several
 court cases involving specific charges of torture by security
 forces are now pending.
 In 1985, the Government completed its investigation of
 allegations of abuses during the security crackdown in
 Matabeleland North in 1983. So far, the Government has not
 made the report public as promised by the Prime Minister.
 While some members of the military have been brought to trial
 for their alleged mistreatment of civilians, government
 ministers have so far failed to address claims by minority
 party Members of Parliament that security forces are
 systematically mistreating civilians.
 Prison conditions in Zimbabwe vary widely. In maximum
 security facilities, conditions are Spartan. Diet, clothing,
 and exercise are governed by regulation, and deprivation of
 necessities is not used as a disciplinary measure. Living
 conditions are sometimes crowded, with as many as 100
 prisoners sharing a large room. Medical services are
 generally available. Many prisoners are required to do manual
 or farm labor at prison facilities.
 Much less is known of conditions and treatment in CIO and
 police holding centers, where mistreatment and torture are
 alleged to have occurred. According to well-placed sources,
 the major CIO/police holding facility in dissident-affected
 Matabeleland features large, open-air cages where prisoners
 sleep on the ground. Sanitary facilities are minimal and,
 according to reliable reports, some detainees have been denied
 medical care. The Government has not publicly acknowledged
 the existence of this center despite the fact that hundreds of
 detainees have passed through it.
 
 
 392
 ZIMBABWE
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Emergency powers have been in effect since 1960. The
 Emergency Powers Act empowers the Home Affairs Minister and
 any police or Central Intelligence Organization official to
 detain any person in the interest of public order and safety.
 "Undesirable inhabitants" may be deported under orders of the
 Home Affairs Minister. A tribunal of independent jurists must
 review all detention orders within 30 days. Given the large
 number of detainees the Government has dealt with over the
 past year, coupled with a dearth of qualified tribunal
 members, there have been many delays. If the tribunal finds
 no merit to the case, the detainee is to be released, but the
 Government can override the tribunal's decision. If
 recommended by the tribunal, detention continues until revoked
 by the Minister or until the time of indictment. The tribunal
 must review all standing detention orders every 180 days. The
 Government generally has tried to adhere to these legal
 formalities, but reliable sources indicate that in some
 instances the Government has held some civilians without
 issuing detention orders.
 A detainee is entitled to hear the reasons for his detention
 not later than 7 days after arrest. The detainee is also
 entitled to see an attorney and is entitled to compensation
 for unlawful arrest and/or detention. Zimbabwean law provides
 that an arrested person may demand in court that evidence
 leading to his arrest be presented. In the case of detention
 orders, however, the writ of detention issued by the Home
 Affairs Minister has been deemed sufficient to meet the
 requirements for evidence.
 Approximately 3,000 people are believed to have been detained
 during the past year, mostly in Matabeleland and Midlands
 provinces. At any given time, the number of detainees during
 1985 probably averaged between 800 and 1,200. Most of the
 detainees were never formally charged and were released within
 a few weeks without their detentions being publicized. On the
 other hand, other cases, such as the case involving five ZAPU
 members of Parliament, six black ZAPU Bulawayo city
 councilors, and the former mayor of Bulawayo, received
 considerable international attention. As of December 1985,
 four of the town councilors remained in detention while the
 former mayor was released.
 Approximately 20 people were redetained in 1985 after being
 acquitted in court. Most of them were Ndebele-speakers who
 had been tried in court in Matabeleland. Judicial sources
 report that access to political prisoners is often difficult.
 Police and security officials frequently disclaim any
 knowledge of persons believed to be in their custody. In
 addition, detainees are frequently transferred from one
 facility-to another, making it difficult to locate them and
 costly for lawyers to follow their cases.
 Zimbabwe law forbids the use of forced labor, and forced labor
 is not practiced in Zimbabwe.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitutional guarantees of a "fair hearing within a
 reasonable time by an independent and impartial court" remain
 in effect. Due to a shortage of legal experts, however, many
 cases are delayed. The Government is sensitive to this
 
 
 393
 ZIMBABWE
 problem but so far has been unable to correct it. Most major
 trials are held in open court, but some trials involving
 sensitive security matters are held in private.
 The judiciary continues to function independently of the
 Government and frequently rules against the State on sensitive
 issues. In addition, the Government has made an effort to
 appoint well-qualified and experienced judges, even if this
 has meant recruiting expatriate judges or those with links to
 minority parties. Several judges have emphasized their
 freedom from government interference in those cases over which
 they have presided.
 Approximately 500 people were tried for "political" crimes in
 1985. The bulk of them were convicted. Most had been charged
 under the Emergency Powers Law and Order Maintenance Act for
 their alleged involvement with dissident groups. No more than
 10 percent of them were represented by counsel.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution protects citizens from arbitrary search or
 entry. Under the emergency powers regulations, however, any
 police officer may stop and search any person or enter any
 area without a warrant where he has "reasonable grounds" for
 believing evidence of a crime may exist. He may also seize
 the evidence. There have been credible allegations of
 arbitrary intrusion into homes and interference with privacy
 by government authorities. Some of the allegations relate to
 the conduct of the security forces in operations against
 dissident groups in Matabeleland, but others appear to have no
 explanation other than simple harassment of members of
 minority parties.
 Reliable, well-placed sources have reported an increased
 number of cases where either security force personnel or youth
 and women from the ruling party have used coercive tactics to
 persuade non-ZANU members to join. Such cases were widely
 reported both before and after Zimbabwe's first
 postindependence general elections in July 1985.
 Some Zimbabweans, including members of the ruling party, have
 alleged that their phones are tapped. In addition, many
 Zimbabwean citizens have repeatedly claimed that authorities
 have opened or confiscated mail.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Zimbabwe's Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, and
 the right to free speech is widely exercised. However,
 control of the mass media rests with the Government. Major
 daily newspapers are controlled by the Mass Media Trust in
 which the Government has a controlling interest. The Zimbabwe
 Broadcasting Corporation, which operates the nation's three
 radio stations and the sole television station, is wholly
 government-owned. While there is no evidence of systematic
 government meddling in the editorial policies of these media,
 senior media officials tend either to be strong exponents of
 the ruling party/government line or to practice a high degree
 of self-censorship. The editor of one of the nation's
 leading--and one of the more balanced--newspapers was
 
 
 394
 ZIMBABWE
 dismissed from his post in 1985, apparently for failure to
 meet these criteria. While articles and broadcasts that
 question government actions do appear from time to time, they
 usually focus on incidents of official corruption or
 mismanagement. Criticism of overall policy orientations is
 generally avoided. Only limited press coverage is given to
 opposition political views or to security issues.
 In Parliament, opposition viewpoints continue to be expressed
 freely but are only infrequently reported in full by the
 media. Similarly, criticism of the Government and government
 policies was an important feature of the legislative election
 campaign in 1985, but media coverage of this criticism was
 scanty. Press treatment of the 1985 elections demonstrates
 the extent to which access to Zimbabwe's mass media is largely
 a matter of government largesse.
 Zimbabwe continues to apply the "Kadoma Declaration," which
 bans entry into the country of journalists based in South
 Africa. There is no evidence that this ban has significantly
 reduced the number of foreign journalists traveling to
 Zimbabwe.
 Academic freedom is generally respected in Zimbabwe.
 University administrators and faculty members retain a large
 degree of autonomy in selection of course content and
 pedagogic methods. The faculty appointment board, however, is
 placing increasing importance on candidates' identification
 with the ruling party's goals and philosophy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of assembly and association is guaranteed by the
 1980 Constitution, applies to both political and nonpolitical
 organizations, and protects a broad spectrum of economic,
 professional, social, and recreational activities. In
 practice, however, there are obstacles to the full exercise of
 this right.
 Police permits are required for public meetings and political
 rallies. All opposition parties complained repeatedly in 1985
 of government abuse of this rule. Numerous opposition
 political meetings were banned during the year, with public
 safety most often cited as the reason. There were far fewer
 instances during the same period where the Government
 prohibited meetings or demonstrations of the ruling ZANU
 party. Moreover, in the first half of 1985, several legal
 opposition rallies were attacked and broken up by gangs of
 thugs. Evidence strongly suggests that most of these attacks
 were carried out by the ZANU youth wing. While the Government
 has disclaimed responsibility for this political violence,
 police on several occasions either failed to intervene or
 intervened only after the violence had run its course. After
 the July election, for example, suspected government opponents
 and ZAPU supporters were attacked by mobs during several days
 of rioting inHarare's high-density suburbs. Numerous
 injuries and several deaths resulted. These attacks have
 fueled a cycle of political violence which acts as a powerful
 de facto disincentive to the full exercise of the right of
 assembly and association.
 In the past year, minority party members have found that their
 political associations have carried an increasing number of
 liabilities. Reliable sources have reported that minority
 
 
 395
 ZIMBABWE
 party members and/or their family members have been subjected
 to repeated harassment by persons affiliated with the ruling
 party. In addition, hundreds of homes were damaged or
 destroyed by groups of ZANU youths. There have also been
 instances where minority party members have been arbitrarily
 denied access to a variety of public services, such as health
 care or public transportation, or have found employment
 opportunities limited.
 Persons with nonpolitical associations experienced few
 comparable problems in 1985. While there have been reports in
 the past year from various private and professional
 organizations complaining of governmental interference in
 their affairs, the evidence does not suggest an organized or
 systematic government drive to control associative activity.
 In February, the Zimbabwean Parliament approved the
 Government's new strong and comprehensive labor relations
 legislation, which was promulgated in late 1985. Among other
 things, the new law guarantees the right of association and
 the right to organize and bargain collectively. Approximately
 I million people work in the modern economy out of a
 population of around 8 million. Of the 1 million, about 17
 percent are unionized. With Zimbabwe achieving independence
 only in 1980, the unions are young and still relatively weak.
 They are striving hard to build up their resources and the new
 reformist union leadership should be much more effective in
 this regard. The new labor act permits the formation of
 worker committees which could serve the purpose of shop floor
 stewards to industry and in mines. Realizing that these
 committees could usurp their power, the unions are monitoring
 their development very closely and intend to incorporate them
 into the union structure. The umbrella organization for the
 Zimbabwean unions is the Zimbabwe Confederation of Trade
 Unions (ZCTU).
 Zimbabwe is a member of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO), and the ZCTU is a member of the Organization of Africa
 Trade Union Unity (ATUU). Although the charter of ATUU
 prohibits African unions from affiliating officially with
 non-African unions, the ZCTU enjoys excellent relations with
 Western unions. By far the largest part of foreign financial
 and technical assistance has come from the West. The
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the
 AFL-CIO's African Labor Center, and the Commonwealth Trade
 Union Congress have been the largest contributors, with
 additional support coming from France, The Federal Republic of
 Germany, and the Netherlands. The ZCTU also has contacts with
 trade unions in Yugoslavia and the Soviet bloc, particularly
 the German Democratic Republic, but Soviet bloc assistance has
 so far been limited to a small number of scholarships and
 small quantities of office equipment and building materials.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is fully respected in Zimbabwe. There is
 no state religion, and denominations are permitted to worship
 openly, pursue social and charitable activities, and maintain
 ties to affiliates and coreligionists abroad. Several minor
 infringements of this right occurred in 1985.. On several
 occasions, church services in rural areas were disrupted by
 gangs associated with the ZANU youth movement, and worshipers
 were forced to attend a political rally. There were also
 several reports of threats directed against individual
 
 
 396
 ZIMBABWE
 ministers or churches for alleged support of opposition or
 dissident elements. Although potentially serious, these
 incidents do not appear to constitute a pattern of officially
 organized harassment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no formal restrictions against travel or
 resettlement within Zimbabwe. In an effort to manage
 in-country migration, however, the Government throughout 1985
 forcibly removed large numbers of illegal squatters from
 several urban areas. There have been forced removals of
 squatters from certain rural areas as well.
 Travel abroad is not subject to official restrictions,
 although individuals have on several occasions in 1985 been
 dissuaded from foreign travel when it was believed they might
 criticize the Government before foreign audiences. This
 practice does not appear to be widespread. A more serious
 practical obstacle to foreign travel is presented by currency
 controls that limit to about $220 the amount nationals can
 carry out of the country.
 Government policy is to welcome the repatriation of former
 residents so long as they bring back the amount of hard
 currency they carried with them when they departed.
 Increasing numbers of white Zimbabweans (former Rhodesians)
 returned from abroad in 1985. Repatriates are expected to
 demonstrate that they possess assets or skills needed by the
 Zimbabwean economy, and most white returnees appear to meet
 these criteria. Regulations concerning repatriation are
 subject to change at short notice, however, and as the
 Government begins to implement the law that outlaws dual
 citizenship in Zimbabwe, it could undercut the upturn in white
 repatriation.
 Precise figures are difficult to obtain on the number of black
 Zimbabweans in self-imposed exile in Zambia and Botswana. As
 a result of political violence in Matabeleland, a significant
 number of Ndebele-speakers are living in a United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees-sponsored camp in Botswana and in
 several Botswanan towns close to the border with Zimbabwe.
 The Government views the camp as a staging base for dissidents
 and "bandits" operating in Matebeleland and has urged the
 Botswana Government to be more active in policing the sector
 and to turn over suspected dissidents to Zimbabwean
 authorities. An improvement in the political climate in
 Matabeleland could result in the return to Zimbabwe of many of
 these exiles.
 Migration of persons from Mozambique into Zimbabwe continued
 in 1985. An estimated 6,000 Mozambicans are now located in
 camps along the border. The flow is due partly to political
 instability in areas of Mozambique and partly to expectations
 of better economic opportunities in Zimbabwe. With few
 exceptions, the Zimbabwean Government does not consider these
 temporary residents to be "refugees" as defined by the U.N.
 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. There is no
 indication at this time that the Government is considering the
 forcible repatriation of these temporary immigrants.
 
 
 397
 ZIMBABWE
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Zimbabwe is a multiparty, parliamentary-style democracy
 fashioned after the Westminster model. Members of Parliament
 represent electoral districts and are chosen by direct,
 universal suffrage. The Prime Minister is elected by a
 parliamentary majority and is responsible to Parliament.
 Prime Minister Mugabe has pledged to transform Zimbabwe into a
 one-party state--an action that, if carried out, would
 fundamentally alter the political landscape and possibly
 deprive Zimbabweans of many of the political rights they now
 enjoy.
 Zimbabwe's first general election since independence was held
 in July 1985. The Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), led
 by Prime Minister Mugabe, enlarged its existing parliamentary
 majority by winning 64 of the 80 seats reserved under the 1980
 Lancaster House agreement for representatives of the black
 electorate. ZANU support came from the Shona-speaking
 majority, which is concentrated in northern and central
 Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwe African Peoples' Union (ZAPU), led by
 Joshua Nkomo, captured 15 parliamentary seats in largely
 Ndebele-speaking areas in the south and west. A splinter
 party, ZANU-S, won one seat in the predominantly Ndau tribal
 region in the southeast.
 On the white electoral roll, former Prime Minister Ian Smith's
 Conservative Alliance for Zimbabwe (CAZ) won 15 of the 20
 available seats. The Independent Zimbabwe Group (IZG),
 representing whites seeking accommodation and cooperation with
 the current Government, won the other five seats. Voter
 turnout was heavy nationwide.
 In postelection statements, Prime Minister Mugabe interpreted
 his party's victory as a mandate to proceed toward
 establishment of a one-party state. It is not clear, however,
 whether all those who voted for ZANU share Mugabe's
 interpretation. Mugabe also castigated whites who voted for
 Ian Smith's CAZ, vowing to eliminate the separate electoral
 roll for whites as soon as possible. Under the Constitution,
 however, the white roll cannot be abolished before 1987.
 Thereafter, abolishment of the special white roll would
 require a 7/10 majority vote in parliament. ZANU, with 64
 parliamentary seats, is six votes short of the necessary
 majority.
 Institution of a one-party state cannot occur legally before
 1990 unless Parliament votes unanimously to amend the
 Constitution. Despite obvious impatience on both these
 issues, Prime Minister Mugabe has not set a specific timetable
 for attaining ZANU goals. He has indicated that he will follow
 constitutional guidelines on revising Zimbabwe's political
 system.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 The Zimbabwe Government is very sensitive to criticism of its
 human rights practices. It has failed to publish a report
 from a government-appointed commission of inquiry that was
 created in 1983 to investigate alleged human rights violations
 in Matabeleland earlier that year, despite assurances by Prime
 
 
 398
 ZIMBABWE
 Minister Mugabe that such a report would be made public. In
 addition, the Government has refused to create a second
 commission to investigate allegations of continuing human
 rights abuses in that part of the country. The Government has
 also failed to respond to repeated queries on alleged human
 rights violations from nongovernmental organizations and
 private citizens.
 In November 1985, Amnesty International issued a report that
 charged that arrests and torture of suspected government
 opponents have increased sharply since the general elections
 in July. Amnesty International said it informed Prime
 Minister Mugabe of its findings and urged him to take
 immediate steps to stop torture. Zimbabwe has rejected the
 charges, saying that the Amnesty International report
 contained sweeping and false allegations. In response, the
 organization said it was ready to send representatives to
 Zimbabwe to present evidence that could help the Government
 investigate the allegations.
 Within Zimbabwe, the most notable organization monitoring the
 human rights environment is the Catholic Commission for
 Justice and Peace, which has been in existence for nearly 20
 years. The Commission has been careful over the years to
 speak out about all violations, whether they concern whites or
 blacks, Government supporters or dissidents. It draws its
 information from both Catholic clergy and from members of the
 Catholic church throughout the country but also receives
 information from persons outside the church. The Commission
 is careful to work within the law.
 The continuation of security problems and of human rights
 abuses in Matebeleland has led other church and
 nongovernmental organizations to focus on human rights
 concerns and to question the Government regarding them. The
 Government has failed repeatedly to address requests by
 private citizens and other locally based nongovernmental
 organizations to investigate a variety of alleged human rights
 problems. Freedom House rates Zimbabwe "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government of Zimbabwe has tried to correct the
 substantial imbalance between black and white standards of
 living that existed before independence by providing greater
 opportunities and services to the black population. Whites
 comprise around 100,000 of the total population of 8,700,000,
 which is growing at the rate of 3.5 percent a year. Economic
 and financial constraints have slowed government
 implementation of a number of programs, notably land
 resettlement, but the expansion of health care and universal
 primary education for all Zimbabweans and the reduction in
 income disparities have proceeded steadily. Higher prices
 paid to farmers and greater extension of services have been
 particularly effective in boosting output and incomes of black
 farmers who now participate in the commercial farm sector.
 Gross domestic income per capita was roughly $740 in 1983.
 This comparatively high level for Africa reflects Zimbabwe's
 wide range of mineral resources, a well-developed
 manufacturing sector, and a strong agricultural base.
 Available health care varies widely between urban and rural
 areas. Despite considerable emigration of skilled medical
 personnel since independence, hospitals and clinics in the
 urban areas still provide relatively good service. The rural
 
 
 399
 ZIMBABWE
 population has less access to basic medical care, primarily
 because Zimbabwe still lacks sufficent personnel and
 infrastructure to reach all areas of a country as large as
 Montana. The Government's program to expand rural clinics,
 while it has grown rapidly, is several years short of meeting
 health needs in all remote areas. The average life expectancy
 at birth (1985) is 56.68 years, up from 54.41 at
 independence. The infant mortality rate in 1985 was 77 per
 1,000 live births.
 Zimbabwe has traditionally been one of the few countries in
 sub-saharan Africa able to feed itself. After 3 years of
 major drought Zimbabwe is again in a position to export
 maize. The nutritional balance is skewed in favor of urban
 dwellers, but barring drought, even the rural population has
 access to an adequate diet. It was estimated in 1977 that
 caloric intake as a percentage of requirements was 84 percent
 for the nation as a whole; no more recent figures are
 available. There were no substantiated reports of deaths as a
 result of drought relief shortages.
 The adult literacy rate was 69 percent in 1980 (male 77
 percent, female 63 percent) and has probably increased since
 then due to government efforts to expand education. The
 primary school enrollment ratio in 1983 was 149 percent--154
 male and 146 female. (These figures exceed 100 percent due to
 overage children attending primary school.)
 The 1985 labor relations legislation guarantees a 24-hour rest
 period sometime during the workweek. The workweek can range
 up to 60 hours. The new law also calls for strict enforcement
 of acceptable standards of health and safety. By Zimbabwe
 law, the working age for the formalized economy is 18, but it
 is possible to begin an apprenticeship at age 16.
 The law also codifies the Government's right to set minimum
 wage standards. However, the Government's constant
 adjustments of minimum wage levels have become a bone of
 contention with both the unions and the business/farming
 community. Since a large share of unionized workers are paid
 the minimum wage, the unions complained that the Government
 usurped their main bargaining power by its continual
 adjustments of the minimum wage. Business and farming
 interests, on the other hand, feared that the Government's
 recent decision--now partly overturned--to double the minimum
 wage for agro-industrial and plantation workers (e.g., in the
 sugar, citrus, tea, coffee, timber, and poultry industries)
 threatened 40,000 jobs, and could have resulted in lost export
 revenues and some liquidations of businesses.
 Despite efforts to clarify and modernize the situation, the
 legal status of women in Zimbabwean society remains
 ambiguous. In 1980, the Government passed the Legal Age of
 Majority Act which gave all women over the age of 18 equal
 legal rights, including the right to arrange their own
 marriages and to own property apart from their husbands. On
 the other hand, the system of "Lobola," or bride price, is
 still the social norm, and the reality of equal rights remains
 elusive. A recent ruling by the Supreme Court found that
 fathers may no longer sue for "seduction damages" from a male
 suitor who has impregnated a daughter over the age of 18; the
 woman herself may sue, however. The widespread public
 reaction against this ruling is indicative of the power of
 traditional norms in a society whose Government seeks greater
 equality of the sexes.
