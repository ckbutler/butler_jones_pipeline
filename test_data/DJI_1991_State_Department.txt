 DJIBOUTI
 Djibouti is a one-party state ruled since independence in 1977
 by President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and his People's Assembly
 for Progress (RPP), which has been the only lawful political
 party since 1981. Public life in Djibouti is dominated by two
 ethnic 1groups, the politically predominant Issa (the Somali-
 origin tribe of the President) and the Afar (who are also
 numerous in Ethiopia). The Afar are the largest single tribe,
 but they are outnumbered by the combined Somali ethnic elements
 in Djibouti, among whom the Issa are the largest and most
 influential component. The Presidency is considered reserved
 for an Issa, and the Prime Ministry for an Afar. The various
 ethnic groups are represented proportionally in the Cabinet and
 political bodies, yet the result is a dominant role for the
 Issa in civil service, party, and armed forces.
 Djibouti's security services include three police agencies:
 the National Security Force (FNS) and the National Police, both
 under the Ministry of the Interior, and the Gendarmerie
 (military police), under the Ministry of Defense. The security
 services and the Gendarmerie in particular have earned a
 reputation for using torture and other abusive treatment of
 detainees which continued undiminished in 1991. France assures
 Djibouti's external security and maintains a force of some
 3,800 military personnel (ground, air, and naval) in Djibouti.
 Djibouti's arid soil is unproductive, and there is no industry;
 commerce and services for the 10,000 expatriate (mostly French)
 residents and operation of the seaport and airport account for
 most of the gross domestic product. Although the State is the
 largest employer, persons are free to pursue private business
 interests and to hold personal and real property.
 The human rights climate in Djibouti-deteriorated significantly
 during 1991. In addition to continuing use of torture and
 restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and
 association, an RPP congress rejected political pluralism, and
 the Government detained a number of persons demonstrating
 peacefully in favor of multiparty democracy. In January,
 following an armed rebel attack in the north, security forces
 engaged in mass arrests of Afar, many of whom were tortured
 during interrogations. At the end of the year, ethnic unrest
 in the north deteriorated'into a civil war between an Afar
 rebel coalition called the Front for the-Restoration of Unity
 and Democracy (FRUD) and government forces. In December
 secarity forces opened fire on Afar civilians in the city of
 Djibouti who refused to cooperate with government searches of
 their homes, killing 40 and wounding an additional 50.
 Mistreatment of illegal immigrants and refugees bygendarmes
 resulted in the death of at least 10 by suffocation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no incidents of targeted political or extrajudicial
 killing during 1991. However, on December 18, security forces
 opened fire on Afars who refused to cooperate with government
 searches of their homes in the city of Djibouti, resulting in
 40 dead and 50 wounded.

 DJIBOUTI
 Throughout 1991 the security forces frequently and harshly
 mistreated refugees fleeing conflict in Somalia and Ethiopia.
 In one egregious incident in September, following an indiscrim-
 inate roundup of Ethiopians, Somalis, and Djiboutians, the
 gendarmes placed 58 detainees in two tiny, almost airless
 prison rooms. The inhumane conditions resulted in at least
 10 persons-the official count-dying through suffocation. The
 Government's investigation of the incident resulted in minor
 disciplinary actions, including the dismissal of two officers
 and the razing of the prison where the 10 died.
 b. Disappearance
 A group of 16 persons, who were arrested after the January
 attack and subsequently released, complained to the judicial
 authorities that as many as 400 people, mostly Afars,
 disappeared in January, without any official explanation.
 Most were subsequently released.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The law requires officials to "respect the moral and physical
 dignity of the prisoner." Nevertheless, there were frequent
 reports of torture in 1991, including the documentation of many
 cases. In particular, the security forces use harsh
 interrogation methods, including the use of severe beatings in
 handling detainees, especially political/security suspects and
 undocumented aliens. The practice continues both.because of
 official indifference and inadequate training of the security
 forces c6ncerning citizens' rights.
 Following an attack in January by Afar rebels on the military
 barracks in Tadjourah, security forces repeatedly raided the
 Afar community, arresting hundreds and torturing many. Most,
 were subsequently released. However, a letter from 16 detainees
 implicated 22 officers of the FNS and Gendarmerie, accusing
 them of being agents of torture. They said the methods of
 torture included spinning the victim until he becomes
 unconscious, forced ingestion of water, sodomization with glass
 bottles, electric shocks administered to the genitals of men
 an? to the breasts of women, suspension by feet and by hands,
 and "shark fishing" in which a bound victim is towed-behind a
 powerboat in the open sea. The Government did not undertake an
 investigation of the Tadjourah incident, and no one was
 punished for the many extralegal abuses.
 Prison conditions are harsh, especially in remote desert
 regions, where political detainees and prisoners were
 frequently sent in 1991.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 By law, a person may be detained no more than 48 hours without
 an examining magistrate's formal charge. In practice, this
 deadline is'ignored ih cases ofpolitical interest. An accused
 has the right to counsel, which in theory is provided by the
 State if the'accused is destitute. An accused person awaiting
 trial may, by ajudge's order, be released on bail or personal
 recognizance, or be jailed pending the verdict.
 Close to 70 persons, mainly Afars, were detained follo1ing the
 January attack. Among those arrested in January on grounds of
 state security were Ali Aref Bourhan, his nephew Aref Mohamed
 Aref, and Mohamed Daoud Chehem, formerly director of finance.
 
 
 104
 DJIBOUTI
 In the National Assembly, the Prime Minister's chief of staff
 accused the entire Aref family of attempting to overthrow the
 State, participating in assassinations, and associating with
 wrongdoers.
 Omar Daoud, leader of a small armed Afar opposition group,
 remained in prison awaiting trial at year's end. He was
 arrested in June 1990.
 Another notable case of arbitrary detention occurred in April
 when Mohamed Moussa "Tour-Tour" was arrested after
 demonstrating peacefully in favor of multiparty democracy.
 Whereas the Aref prisoners are of the minority Afar tribe,
 Tour-Tour is an Issa and a former director of planning for the
 President. The Ministry of Justice acknowledged the illegality
 of his imprisonment, but the Ministry of Interior did not
 relent until September 8, when Tour-Tour was released without
 explanation for his 5 months of detention.
 The Government does not use political exile as a means of
 punishment. There are, however, several opposition figures in
 self-exile in France.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Djibouti's legal system is a mixture of Djiboutian legislation
 and executive decrees, French codified law adopted at
 independence, Shari'a (Islamic law), and traditions of the
 native nomadic peoples. Crimes in urban areas are dealt with
 according to French-inspired law and judicial practice in the
 regular courts. Civil actions may be brought in the regular
 courts, or in traditional court according to tribal customs.
 Shari'a courts handle only family matters (marriage, divorce,
 inheritance, etc.). Decisions of all three court systems may
 be appealed to the Supreme Court. Proceedings in all courts
 except the State Security Court are open to the public. The
 judiciary is especially susceptible to government influence in
 cases of political interest. Many of the magistrates and
 judges are political appointees with little or no legal
 training.
 The special State Security Court may hear in closed session
 cases of espionage, treason, and acts threatening the public
 order or the "interest of the Republic." Extensive delays are
 typical in such cases due to their political sensitivity. This
 Court convened on December 22 to hear the case of Ali Aref and
 other Afars accused of coup plotting, but it postponed the
 trial at the defense's request-until July 1992. In the
 meantime the defendants remain jailed.
 Opposition figures challenge the legitimacy of the State
 Security Court and the legality of the executive order which
 established it, claiming the Court exists primarily to
 "adjudicate" the cases of political prisoners held according to
 the wishes of the President and his security apparatus. The
 Government has responded positively to domestic and
 international suggestions for judicial reform. The State
 Security Court is now subject to the appeal process before the
 Supreme Court, and while the December session was not open to
 the public, journalists and family members, as well as
 diplomats, were allowed to attend.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family4 Home, or
 Correspondence
 Security forces in the city of Djibouti recommenced periodic
 roundups during which the FNS and the Gendarmerie
 indiscriminately incarcerate loiterers, many of whom are
 undocumented refugees. The Gendarmerie typically refuses to
 respond to family inquiries regarding people who disappear
 during these roundups. There were no known instances of
 arbitrary interference with correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are seriously restricted. Those who express
 public views that are critical of or perceived as. threatening
 to the Government face prosecution for common crimes or
 detention without charge for short periods. During 1991,
 unprecedentedly frank discussions took place within the party
 over political reform (see Section 3). Despite the ban-on free
 political expression, critics of the regime have published
 clandestine tracts and manifestos that circulate widely in
 Djibouti.
 Djibouti's radio and television stations and one newspaper (a-
 French-langiage weekly) are all government owned and operated.
 The Government's avowed policy is to coordinate the'
 dissemination of infqrmation "in the interest of national
 development.'" The news media do report on social and national
 development.problems in Djibouti, such as the acquired
 immun6deficiency syndrome (AIDS) problem and female
 circumcision,'but the Government itself and its policies are
 not criticized. The media avoid domestic politics and ethnic
 strife in neighboring Somalia and Ethiopia, although the
 collapse of the Mengistu regime in Ethiopia and the Siad Barre
 regime in Somalia received significant coverage.
 Foreign journalists (e.g., British Broadcasting Corporation
 Somali Service) or members of international organizations,
 including-from the staff of the United Nations High'
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in Djibouti were expelled.
 during 1991 for discussing ethnic tensions. Copies of one
 issue of a Paris daily newspaper were temporarily held off
 newsstands in July because of an article criticizing Djibouti's
 treatment of"Ethiopian escapees in May and June. Issues of the
 monthly Tribune of the Opposition, and those of the Paris
 weekly, the Indian Ocean Newsletter, are also banned. People
 found in possession of these periodicals may be arrested.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government effectively bans political protest by selective
 enforcement of public assembly permit laws. Permits for
 political meetings are not issued outside party -auspices.
 Prodemocracy demonstrations in April followed a March RPP
 decision not to accept political pluralism. The leader of the
 first demonstration, Mohamed Moussa Tour Tour, was arrested and
 detained in the remote military outpost of Moulehoule where he
 was confined for several months until released following a
 hunger strike. Four other prodemocracy demonstrators were
 arrested on April 23 for their political activities (namely,
 demanding Tour-Tour's release); they were released 2 weeks
 later.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 Djibouti respects freedom of religion for all faiths.
 Virtually the entire population is Sunni Muslim, but the
 Government imposes no sanctions on those who choose to ignore
 Islamic teachings on such matters as diet, alcohol consumption,
 and religious fasting.
 The expatriate community supports Roman Catholic, French
 Protestant, Greek Orthodox, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches.
 Less than I percent of the native population belongs to these
 Christian congregations. Foreign clergy and missionaries may
 perform, charitable works, but proselytizing is a highly
 sensitive issue and, while not illegal, is discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Djiboutians travel freely within Djibouti and may live and work
 where they choose. Djiboutians leave for, and return from,
 foreign countries without restriction or interference, except
 for travel to Israel or South Africa. The passports of members
 of the Aref family were withheld in January prior to their
 detainment.
 Djibouti cooperates with the UNHCR to assist the approximately
 1,500 registered Ethiopian refugees in the country, many of
 whom returned to Ethiopia in August. Following the collapse of
 the Mengistu regime in neighboring Ethiopia, Djibouti faced a
 massive influx of fleeing Ethiopian army personnel and their
 families. With the assistance of the French military, most of
 these soldiers were stopped or were forced back across the
 border. Many refugees were returned to Ethiopia without UNHCR
 supervision to certify that their repatriation was voluntary.
 Those that refused to return were not accorded refugee status
 but received better treatment than Somali refugees.
 As a matter of policy the Government does not recognize as
 refugees the approximately 94,000 Somali nationals who have
 fled the Somali civil war. The Government has an informal
 agreement with UNHCR that these refugees will not be forcibly
 repatriated if they do not "cause trouble," but UNHCR in fact
 has limited ability to extend protection to these persons, and
 the Government's policy has resulted in inadequate water
 supplies and medical care as well as malnutrition for the
 Somalis.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All legal political activity is conducted within Djibouti's
 single party, the People's Assembly for Progress (RPP). As in
 most Djiboutian institutions, the Issa have a dominant role in
 the RPP, which has had a monopoly of power since the rival
 Djiboutian People's Movement (MPD) was outlawed in 1981. The
 party chooses the candidates for the Presidency and the
 65-member National Assembly, a legislative body with limited
 power. Presidential elections are held every 7 years, and
 elections for the National Assembly every 5 years. Citizens
 are encouraged to vote, but affirmative and negative ballots
 must be cast in different boxes, making it obvious who votes
 against the party.
 In early 1991, the RPP held a congress which was marked by some
 of the most open political debate in years. Several
 
 
 DJIBOUTI
 participants called for the end of the single party system and
 a move to multipartyism. The RPP rejected this proposal but
 has now accepted the principle of political pluralism for the
 elections to take place in May 1992. The impetus for change
 has been the armed insurgency led by the FRUD coalition. The
 Government has made its democratization pledge contingent on
 the cessation of hostilities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not responded to repeated attempts by two
 independent groups of Djiboutians to formally register a
 "Djiboutian. League for Human Rights." A third group has
 complied with all the laws concerning Djiboutian associations
 but has thus far failed to secure official sanction. The
 International Committee, of the Red Cross and Amnesty
 International have had limited access to visit some, but not
 all, of Djibouti's political prisoners. The Government has
 also permitted inspection of prison facilities by foreign
 diplomats. ,However, three UNHCR workers were expelled from
 Djibouti, one of whom had been incarcerated for 7 hours.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Issa control the party, the civil service, and the military
 as a result of the President's policy of assigning positions of
 authority to members of'his tribal grouping and in particular
 his subclan, the Mamma~an. Although other government positions
 are apportioned according to relative tribal numbers, the
 arrangement is, suspect as no census figures have ever been
 released. Perquisites and corruption have created a class of
 wealthy bureaucrats who live far beyond the means of the
 ordinary Djiboutian..
 Women in Djibouti legally possess full civil rights but
 traditionally play a secondary role in public life. Women are
 active in small trade, as well as in the clerical and
 secretarial fields. There are only a few women in the
 professions (civil service, judiciary, teaching, and medicine)
 and security-services.
 According to medical personnel, violence against women-
 including rape and wife beating-occur. While data are
 limited, such violence is still considered a relatively
 infrequent occurrence. Neither the Government nor the
 party-affiliated Djiboutian National Women's Union (UNFDY has
 addressed the issue. Most domestic and community violence is
 considered a family or clan matter, dealt with accordingly, and
 therefore rarely brought to the attention of authorities. The
 UNFD began a government-supported educational campaign against
 female circumcision in 1988, but the campaign appears to, have
 had marginal impact, particularly in the northern districts,
 where nomadic traditions of genital mutilation of young girls
 (e.g., clitoral excision and the most dangerous form,
 infibulation) are widely practiced. Recent judicial reforms
 have stipulated that anyone found responsible for circumcision
 of young girls that results in genital mutilation could face
 5 years in prison and a $6,000 fine. By implication, circum-
 cisions that are well Rerformed are legal.

 DJIBOUTI
 Section 6 Workers Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to join or not join unions as they choose, but
 less than 20 percent of persons in the wage economy are union
 members. LAbor unions thus play a minimal role in Djibouti.
 Many unions represent employees of only a single private or
 state-owned enterprise. The Government exerts control over
 individual unions through the single, state-
 organized labor central, the General Union of Djiboutian
 Workers (UGTD). Although there is no legal bar to other labor
 centrals, none exist, and the UGTD has no affiliations beyond
 its membership in the continentwide official trade union body,
 the Organization of African Trade Union Unity. Unions are free
 to maintain relations and exchange programs with unions and
 labor organizations in other countries.
 Workers are free to strike, but there were no strikes in 1991.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although the law recognizes labor's right to organize and
 bargain collectively, in practice, collective bargaining
 virtually does not exist. Relations between employers and
 workers are informal and paternalistic. Wages are in practice
 established unilaterally by employers on the basis of Ministry
 of Labor guidelines. When disputes about wages or health and
 safety issues arise, the Ministry of Labor encourages direct,
 ad hoc resolution by labor representatives and employers.
 Either workers or employers may initiate a formal
 administrative hearing mediated by the labor inspection service
 of the Ministry of Labor.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 By law there is neither forced nor compulsory labor in
 Djibouti, and there are no reports that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age of 14 years is generally respected;
 however, the paucity of inspectors from the Ministry of Labor
 makes it unlikely that investigations are ever carried out,
 according to union sources. Children may and do work in
 family-owned businesses such as restaurants and smal shops,
 including at night. Children are not emplbyed unaer hazardous
 conditions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wage rates are specified by government regulations
 according to occupational categories and are enforced by the
 Ministry of Labor. Last increased in 1980, minimum wages cover
 a broad range of jobs. Many workers also receive housing or
 housing allowances and transportation and food allowances, in
 addition to mandatory seniority bonuses. In reality, wages are
 lower than the official minimum. Families supplement their
 incomes with second jobs or assistance from relatives.
 By law the maximum workweek is 40 hours, often spread over
 6 days. Overtime pay regulations are in effect. Workers are
 
 
 109
 DJIBOUTI
 guaranteed daily and weekly rest periods and paid annual
 vacations. ,7he Ministry of Labor is responsible for
 occupational health and safety standards, wages, and work
 hours. Enforcement of these standards, however, is
 ineffective. Workers face hazardous working conditions,
 particularly in the port where they are exposed to toxic
 chemicals and are not properly clothed to handle these
 materials. Workers in the electric company face equal hazards
 and often work in temperatures exceeding 60 degrees Celsius.
 Workers do not protest,..as they fear being replaced by others
 williig to accept the risks.
