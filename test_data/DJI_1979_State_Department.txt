 DJIBOUTI
 The Republic of Djibouti has been independent since 1977.
 About half of its 300,000 citizens, living in the capital and
 the south, are ethnic Somalis; more than 40 percent are
 Afars, a primarily nomadic group indigenous to Ethiopia and
 southern Eritrea as well as the northern deserts of Djibouti.
 The distribution of power between these two groups is the
 country's dominant internal political issue. The Ethiopian-
 Somali conflict has raged throughout the period of Djibouti's
 independence, threatening its railway lifeline and economic
 raison d'etre as a port to the Ethiopian hinterland, causing
 an inflow of refugees which now amounts to 10 percent of its
 population, and sorely testing the loyalties of its two
 principal ethnic groups. Djibouti is a less developed
 country, economically dependent on its port, and lacking a
 long tradition of civil administration and respect for
 individual rights.
 Djibouti does not yet have a formal constitution, and con-
 tinues to be governed by pre-independence legislation.
 Power is shared between Somalis and Afars through a tacit
 arrangement in which the President is a Somali, the Prime
 Minister an Afar, and cabinet positions are roughly equally
 divided. The concern of certain Afar leaders about the lack
 of powers in the Prime Minister's office and imbalances in
 admissions to the career civil service and military service
 have led to two cabinet crises and changes of Prime Minister
 since independence. There have been seven terrorist incidents
 led by Afars from Ethiopia, and after each of these the
 rounding up and questioning of witnesses and suspects has
 given rise to opposition charges of human rights violations.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law. However, some persons arrested
 for involvement with various terrorist attacks were mistreated
 by authorities. Opposition elements have made detailed
 allegations of torture, including beatings, water tortures,
 and electric shock.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 All alleged violators of civil and criminal codes are treated
 the same even if their motives were political. Prison
 conditions are adequate; access is permitted to family
 members and counsel, and health conditions are overseen by
 public health and medical services.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The current system of justice has been carried over from
 French colonial rule. There is no habeas corpus and preven-
 tive detention is permitted. Prosecutors, however, are
 required to file charges in an expedient fashion and this
 requirement has generally been adhered to. However, a number
 of persons charged with terrorist crimes were imprisoned for
 long periods without trial. Persons arrested in December
 (58)
 
 
 1977 in connection with the bombing of the Palmier en Zinc,
 Which led to eight deaths, were imprisoned until April and
 May 1979, when they were tried, convicted of various crimes,
 and then released during the next few weeks.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most recent legal actions have taken place in the newly
 created State Security Court, which follows normal Djibouti
 legal procedures, based on the French legal system, and
 permits access to family members and legal counsel, although
 not the general public.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Following local anti-government incidents, there have been
 widespread searches of private residences, apparently
 without search warrants. Opposition leaders have protested
 this, as did the country's first Prime Minister, Ahmed Dini,
 who resigned over this issue in December 1977.
 2. Government Policies Relations to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Within the limits of its slender resources and its free
 market economy, the Government of Djibouti is committed to
 an improvement of the living standards of its citizens.
 Nutrition is a serious problem, but when food supplies were
 cut off in June 1977 by the fighting in the Ogaden, the
 Government moved aggressively to establish a countrywide
 system of emergency distribution of food. With American
 assistance, the government is seeking to improve nutrition
 and income through a fisheries project. The government has
 sought and obtained an African Development Bank loan to
 improve the sewage system of the capital city, and thus the
 health and living standards of its inhabitants. Living
 standards in the city are higher than in the interior. The
 government has sought to deal with this problem. It has
 recently opened a water bottling plant in the Afar town of
 Tadjoura, and announced plans to decentralize the country's
 meager industries to various parts of the interior. Since
 independence, student enrollment has doubled.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 There is no press censorship, although nearly all local
 media are in government hands. There are no restrictions
 on religious practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no legal or administrative inhibitions to either
 domestic or foreign travel; passports are freely available,
 and many thousands of Djiboutians work in neighboring Arab
 countries.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The attainment of independence has led to an apparent
 
 
 60
 decline in the previously intense level of interest in
 politics. The government has attempted to create a single
 national party, comprised of representatives of all ethnic
 communities, but largely controlled by the ethnic Somalis of
 the Issa clan. Many Afars are opposed to the single party.
 None of the pre-independence political parties has been
 banned except for the Mouvement de Liberation de Djibouti,
 which was outlawed after having been accused of organizing a
 bombing in December 1977. The government has announced its
 intention to decentralize to a local level certain current
 central government functions, in order to permit greater
 political participation by the public.
 No women hold national political positions in the cabinet or
 the national assembly, and only a handful are employed in
 senior administrative capacities. Most females still
 undergo infibulation. Djibouti women can own property,
 maintain their own bank accounts, vote, and are generally
 regarded as an effective lobby in national politics.
 The Government has recently sponsored the creation of a
 single national labor union. Strikes are legal and a few
 scattered ones have taken place since independence, but union
 power is limited by the estimated 80 percent urban unemploy-
 ment.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 On three occasions since independence, most recently in the
 summer of 1979, there have been opposition-inspired press
 campaigns against alleged human rights violations occurring
 in the course of roundups of suspects and witnesses follow-
 ing terrorist incidents. On each occasion the government
 has complied with requests for information, and in 1979 it
 invited Amnesty International to come to Djibouti to in-
 vestigate. AI visited Djibouti during the week of January 4-
 11, 1980, and was provided full facilities by the Government.
