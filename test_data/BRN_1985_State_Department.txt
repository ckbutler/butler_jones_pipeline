 BRUNEI
 Brunei is a small Islamic monarchy, located on the north coast
 of Borneo. It is predominantly Malay in population, with
 substantial Chinese and other minorities. A hereditary and
 traditional Sultanate, the country has been ruled by the same
 family for over 500 years. Thus, the current Sultan
 represents one of the oldest continuously ruling families in
 the world. Brunei was a British-protected state until January
 1, 1984, but it had been internally self-governing since 1959
 with Britain responsible for defense and external affairs.
 A Constitution promulgated in 1959 provided for the first
 sharing of political power by the Sultan, who since
 independence has been advised by a Council of Ministers.
 However, the Constitution permits the Sultan to override the
 decisions of legislative and executive bodies in most
 instances. In elections for a legislative council in 1962, a
 party opposed to policies of the then Sultan won a large
 majority; tensions over the policy differences led in December
 1962 to an armed uprising, quickly put down by British
 troops. The Sultan at that time invoked an article of the
 Constitution under which he could assume emergency powers for
 a period of two years; this state of emergency has been
 renewed every two years and is still in force. Although the
 Constitution is not suspended, the state of emergency allows
 the Sultan great latitude in ruling by orders. These orders
 have in effect suspended certain articles of the
 Constitution.
 Since 1962 there have been no disturbances or agitaticn in
 Brunei. Economic factors have much to do with the general
 sense of well-being that prevails. Because, relative to its
 small population, Brunei produces substantial quantities of
 oil (estimated in excess of 170,000 barrels per day in 1984),
 it has one of the highest per capita gross domestic products
 (GDP) in the world. Oil revenues are sufficient to permit the
 Government to provide free medical care and free education
 (all by government scholarship abroad at the university level
 until this year when the first local university was opened
 with an initial intake of less than 200 students). A large
 proportion of the Malay population of working age is employed
 by the Government at salaries permitting a higher standard of
 living than that in surrounding countries. Government
 employees are also eligible for low-interest or no-interest
 loans to purchase homes, automobiles, and appliances. The
 only other major employer, Brunei Shell Petroleum, provides
 comparable benefits.
 The human rights situation in Brunei in 1985 remained
 essentially the same as in 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known instances of politically-motivated
 killings.

 BRUNEI
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances nor evidence of persons
 having been abducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely
 detained.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no known instances of people having been subjected
 to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no allegations or known instances of people
 detained, punished, or tried for expression of views critical
 of or different from those of the Government in 1985 or any
 recent year. There are, however, several detainees from the
 insurrection of 1962 and from the mid-70's who have not been
 released. Seven of the latter group were released in August
 and four more were freed in November. It is estimated that
 about six persons remain in detention without trial. Several
 leaders of the 1962 insurrection live abroad. They have not
 been sentenced to exile, a concept which does not exist in
 Brunei. However, they may still fear that they would be
 incarcerated should they return.
 Brunei has applied without modification the International
 Labor Organization convention on forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system in Brunei is in most respects derived from
 the British system. Those suspected of common crimes are
 detained, tried, and punished according to law. Lacking a
 senior judiciary of its own, the Brunei High Court when in
 session has for its Chief Justice an English judge seconded
 from Hong Kong. There were no known instances of interference
 with the judiciary by the Government in 1985 or in any other
 recent year.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 While the Government has considerable latitude allowing it to
 intrude into the privacy of individual persons, families and
 homes, in practice it does not do so.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In the absence of an organized political opposition (although
 a political party was organized with the approval of the
 Government in 1985; see below), there have been no challenges
 to the Government which would have tested its degree of
 tolerance in the political arena. The single television
 station is government owned and consistently avoids
 controversial issues. There is no daily newspaper, and the
 single weekly newspaper also usually avoids controversial
 issues but quite frequently reports matters that could be
 embarrassing to the Government. These are sometimes
 attributed to foreign news media. Beginning in the latter
 half of 1983, the distribution in Brunei of a weekly overseas
 
 
 714
 BRUNEI
 magazine was suspended. More than one article about Brunei
 was published just before the suspension, and it is not clear
 exactly what prompted the Government's action. At least one
 foreign journalist has been among a small number of aliens
 whose nonresident permits have been summarily withdrawn.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government permits the formation of associations for many
 kinds of private economic, recreational, or other purposes
 without interference, but requires their registration. In May
 1985 the Government allowed establishment of the first
 political party since party activity ended in 1967. This, the
 Brunei National Democratic Party (BNDP), claimed over 3,000
 members just before its official public launching on September
 29. Over half of its members held government jobs, but the
 Government announced in late September that government
 employees could not attend party meetings, become members of
 political parties, or otherwise engage in organized political
 party activity. Few members of the public were attracted to
 the launching assembly (the local press reported that fewer
 than 100 attended), and the longer-term effects of the ban on
 party membership by government employees has yet to be seen.
 There have been no other known instances of government
 interference with party membership drives. Party officials,
 in conversations with the foreign press, have been outspoken
 about their objectives.
 Formation of a labor union requires only seven persons with a
 common trade. Any such group has the right to request
 registration of its union by the Labor Department, which can
 refuse registration. The Labor Department says that no
 request for formation of a union has been denied. At present,
 there are only three unions registered, only one of which is
 believed to be active. There are no urgent labor issues in
 Brunei, mainly because there are only two major employers,
 Brunei Shell Petroleum and the Government, both of which
 provide substantial employee benefits. The existing unions
 have no political role. Unions have the right to bargain
 collectively and to be represented at the negotiation of any
 dispute. Strikes are illegal in Brunei under an Act of 1961.
 With government permission, unions may maintain relations with
 recognized international bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While Islam is the official state religion of Brunei, the
 Constitution guarantees freedom of worship for other religions
 and this right is freely exercised.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement in the
 country or abroad for its citizens.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the continuing-state of emergency there are no
 representative bodies at the national or local level. The
 only way in which citizens can effect changes in government is
 by working through appointed village headmen and district
 officers who meet regularly with their constituencies, and
 this is only at the local level.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In its 1985 Report (covering the year 1984), Amnesty
 International expressed concern about the continued detention
 without trial of eight persons allegedly involved in the armed
 uprising of December 1962. It noted that it had twice
 appealed to the Sultan for their release but received no
 reply. It also expressed concern about the continued
 detention of about 20 others who had been arrested for
 political reasons, mostly between 1975 and 1978. Freedom
 House rates Brunei "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Brunei's population, estimated at 232,000 in 1985 and with a
 growth rate of 3.7 percent, enjoyed a per capita gross
 national product (GNP) of $17,878 (1982 statistic). As an
 oil-rich state, Brunei can afford to provide the economic
 benefits of a modern welfare state. In the fields of health,
 education, and nutrition, the Government has spared little
 expense to assure that the needs of the population, including
 noncitizens, are met. The cost of food, otherwise quite high,
 is held down by government subsidies of the price of rice,
 nearly all of which is imported. The high income level of the
 population means that, despite high costs, the population is
 well-fed and, by the standards of the area and allowing for
 traditional preferences, well-housed. Citizens enjoy free
 education and medical care. In addition, civil servants, a
 large segment of the working population, have access to
 subsidized loans and a noncontributory pension program.
 Resident noncitizens pay only a nominal fee for medical care
 and can attend public schools for a reasonable fee.
 Life expectancy was 73.8 years in 1985, and the infant
 mortality rate was 13.1 per 1,000 live births. As of 1980, 98
 percent of the population had access to safe water. The
 calorie supply as a percentage of requirement was 114.2
 according to 1977 figures. Adult literacy, based on 1981
 figures, stood at 77 percent, with the primary school
 enrollment ratio at 122.9 percent.
 Working conditions are subject to inspection by the Labor
 Commission on several types of occasions: routine,
 approximately annually; at the time of immigrant worker quota
 renewal; and in response to complaints. These inspections
 concern adherence to minimum safety and health standards and
 compliance with compensation plans as filed with the Labor
 Commission. Brunei does not have a minimum wage law, but the
 Labor Department determines a "prevailing wage" for each
 worker category. Employers are required to pay at least the
 prevailing wage to obtain approval for a worker quota.
 Theoretically, these prevailing wage rates would apply to
 Brunei citizens as a minimum wage as well, but in fact Brunei
 citizens command wages considerably above those levels.
 Employment of children below the age of 16 is prohibited, and
 below the age of 18 requires the written conpent of the
 child's parent or guardian and approval of the Labor
 Commission. Other restrictions also apply, such as that women
 under 18 can not work at night or on offshore oil platforms.
 Work in excess of 48 hours requires payment of overtime.
 Double time must be paid for work performed on legal holidays.

 BRUNEI
 The status of women in Brunei appears to be substantially the
 same as in surrounding countries. Women are not under
 pressure to observe strict Muslim standards of dress and
 behavior, with trends in this direction reflecting personal
 and family conviction. Women are widely employed in the
 Government, primarily in clerical and secretarial positions.
 A few hold professional senior level positions.
 The great majority of the substantial Chinese minority in
 Brunei are not citizens (those having no claims to other
 nationalities were "British-protected persons" prior to
 independence and are now either stateless permanent or
 temporary residents). Many of the Chinese are temporary
 residents from other- countries and some of these have been
 here for many years. Nevertheless, the Chinese community has
 prospered, and most commercial activity is in Chinese hands.
