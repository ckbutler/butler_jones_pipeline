 HONDURAS
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy with a President and
 unicameral Congress elected every 4 years. In January 1990,
 the National Party candidate, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, was
 inaugurated as President. While the historically dominant
 military now plays a less intrusive role in the country's
 civilian Government, it still operates in practice with a great
 deal of institutional and legal autonomy, particularly in the
 realm of security and military affairs. Although the Callejas
 Administration took some initiatives in 1991 to improve the
 human rights situation, it has yet to ensure that human rights
 violations are fully investigated and that perpetrators of
 thoseviolations, whether members of the military or civilians,
 are prosecuted in a court of law.
 The Armed Forces, including its police branch, the Public
 Security Force (FUSEP), are responsible for domestic security.
 Major FUSEP elements include the Transit Police, the Customs
 Police, the Order and Security Police,'the Cobra Paramilitary
 Unit, and the National Department of Investigation (DNI). As
 in previous years, members of the Armed Forces were involved in
 human rights abuses in 1991, often for personal motives. The
 military's judicial system makes it difficult to know how many
 perpetrators are actually punished for these abuses; from the
 limited information available, it appears that many act with
 impunity.
 The economy continued to stagnate, resulting in part from a
 painful adjustment process initiated in March 1990 by the
 incoming Callejas Government. In 1991 per capita income was
 estimated to be approximately $500, combined unemployment and
 underemployment ran as high as 40 percent, illiteracy was
 approximately 33 percent, and inflation reached 35 percent.
 High rates of criminal violence continued in 1991, due in part
 to the country's poverty and lack of employment opportunities.
 The principal human rights problems are extrajudicial killings,
 arbitrary and incommunicado detentions, torture and abuse of
 detainees, and the impunity of members of the Armed Forces who
 commit such violations. As in past years, when members of the
 Armed Forces committed acts ofmurder or torture, the military
 often tried to cover up the violations. Another serious
 problem is a weak and inefficient judiciary. The criminal
 justice system is unable to protect systematically the rights
 of ordinary citizens owing to the Government's failure to
 exercise the political will to insist on accountability for
 human rights violations, to ensure the independence of judges
 and courts, to establish a transparent and just military
 judicial system, and to set up a mechanism to resolve
 jurisdictional issues between the civilian and military court
 systems. Approximately 80 percent of those detained in
 civilian penal centers are neither sentenced nor exonerated.
 Leftwing'terrorists claimed responsibility for several killings
 and attempted killings during the year, including one of a
 returned political exile.
 During the year, the Callejas Administration made some efforts
 to improve the country's human rights situation. An Office of
 Professional Responsibility was created within FUSEP in
 September to investigate allegations of police misconduct.
 Preliminary results are promising, but its real effectiveness
 remains to be proven. The President negotiated the return of a
 number of leftist political exiles who had fled the country
 primarily in the early 1980's. Work commenced with U.N.

 assistance to set up a new governmental human rights commission
 at the presidential level. Strong administration support led
 to congressional passage of a "full and unconditional" amnesty
 that resulted in the release of'some 13 persons incarcerated
 for crimes against the State and an unspecified number of
 persons jailed on charges involving land invasion. There was
 no evidence of retaliation by members of the military or the
 police against these people or against the returned leftist
 exiles. In cooperation with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Government agreed to
 provide safe haven for 250 Haitians fleeing turmoil in their
 homeland.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Although firm evidence was not available, past practice and a
 persistent lack of investigatory followup suggests that
 extrajudicial killings by police and security forces continued
 in 1991. Members of the Armed Forces were responsible for
 killing and injuring a number of other civilians in 1991,
 apparently for personal motives. Armed Forces authorities, in
 some cases responding to intense public pressure, arrested and
 detained a few of the.perpetrators. However, no one has yet
 been sentenced for these crimes. No arrests or convictions
 were made in the cases of possible political killings from
 previous years.
 Riccy Mabel Martinez, an 18-year-old student, was raped and
 murdered on July 13 in Tegucigalpa. Family members and
 classmates of the victim named Colonel Angel Castillo
 Maradiaga, commander of the First Communications Battalion, and
 Captain Ovidio Andino Coello, head of personnel for that
 battalion, as primary suspects. A junior employee of the Armed
 Forces General Staff, Santo Eusebio Ilovares Funez, confessing
 guilt, surrendered on July 20 to a civilian court but recanted
 a few days later stating that he had confessed only under
 threat of torture by DNI agents. On July 23 the U.S.
 Ambassador to Honduras publicly urged that the crime be
 resolved promptly and fairly through an open judicial process.
 Three days later a civilian court issued arrest warrants for
 Colonel Castillo and Captain Andino, but FUSEP Commander
 Colonel Guillermo Paredes Hernandez would not carry them out
 before Armed Forces Commander General Discua Elvir and Armed
 Forces Auditor General Efrain Gutierrez Ardon ruled on the
 issue of jurisdiction. The military discharged the two
 officers and relinquished jurisdiction to the civilian court.
 This action precluded the Supreme Court from issuing an opinion
 which might have clarified the jurisdictional question for
 cases contested in the future. The two officers and Ilovares
 Funez remained incarcerated in the Central Penitentiary while
 criminal investigations continued.
 Two members of FUSEP's Cobra Paramilitary Unit, Oscar Fidel
 Almendarez and Rafael Villagra Galo, killed five persons and
 wounded eight in a night club altercation on March 9. After
 the two soldiers surrendered voluntarily to a civilian court,
 high-level military authorities insisted that the two be placed
 under the jurisdiction of a military court, asserting a
 longstanding claim that the Armed Forces have the
 
 
 645
 HONDURAS
 constitutional right to try all such cases. In November
 Almendarez escaped from a minors' detention center and remained
 at large at year's end. Villagra remained in detention by
 order of the military judge.
 On May 3, a group of about 15 men, armed with assault weapons
 and dressed mostly in military uniform; killed five unarmed
 members of the National Association of Honduran Peasants
 (ANACH) and wounded eight others in rural Agua Caliente in a
 dispute over land owned by Army Lieutenant Colonel Leonel
 Galindo Knutsen. Survivors alleged that Galindo's foreman led
 the assault at the behest of Galindo, with members of the army
 carrying out the attack. A military court ordered Galindo's
 arrest and charged him, inter alia, with murder. Four
 suspected participants in the massacre were held under the
 jurisdiction of a civilian court. According to credible
 sources two of these suspects, 16- and 17-year-old minors, were
 not involved in thecrime. The press reported charges that the
 two minors were tortured by DNI agents; neighbors and family
 members stated that the two boys were at work when the massacre
 occurred. Armed Forces authorities insisted that military
 courts retain jurisdiction over Galindo. However, ANACH
 members obtained legal counsel to pursue the matter through a
 civilian court. That court petitioned the Supreme Court to
 rule on jurisdiction in November. Other participants in the
 massacre, including Galindo's foreman, remained at large at
 year's end.                                 ,
 Deputy Director of the Armed Forces Military Command and Staff
 School, Colonel Erick Sanchez Sandoval, shot civilian Gustavo
 Funez on June 9 outside a restaurant in La Ceiba after a brief
 argument. Funez, who was unarmed, was rendered quadraplegic.
 Sanchez was removed on June 25 from his position at the school
 after a military court issued an arrest warrant for him. When
 Armed Forces authorities insisted that jurisdiction be retained
 by the military tribunals, the nongovernmental Committee for
 the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH) filed 'charges
 in a civilian court. The military court, citing Sanchez'
 assertion of self-defense and the absence of contradictory
 testimony, found Col. Sanchez not guilty on September 5. The
 verdict was sent on September 5 to a civilian appeals court for
 review as stipulated under Honduran law. That court confirmed
 the military court's verdict in early January, 1992. thereby
 releasing Colonel Sanchez from military detention.
 Three men and two women, ranging in age from 17 to 29 years,
 were killed on August 18 in the village of El Balsamo after
 reportedly having attended a dance. A few days later the
 police arrested six men who publicly claimed they were
 innocent. Responding to local residents' speculations that two
 FUSEP agents had actually carried out the killings, the local
 DNI chief publicly stated that the two had taken the accused on
 patrol.with them on the night of the murder but had returned to
 their duty stations before the murders were committed. When
 newspapers carried photographs of five of the suspects' badly
 bruised buttocks, a DNI spokesman claimed they had not been
 tortured but "only beaten" by a DNI agent who was then
 arrested, charged in a military court, and detained in a San
 Pedro Sula jail. The six suspects, who claimed their
 innocence, were provisionally released on September 11 for lack
 of evidence. No other suspects had been arrested for the crime
 by year's end.
 
 
 646
 HONDURAS
 On November 2 a group of approximately 10 men dressed in
 military uniforms and carrying high caliber weapons kidnaped
 Jose Agapito Paz Rivera, his son, brother, and an employee from
 their homes in the village of El'Plomo in the Department of
 Olancho. The bullet-ridden bodies of the men were discovered
 lying along a road the next day. Paz' widow initially accused
 members of the Honduran Armed Forces of involvement in the
 killings but retracted those claims a few weeks later. By the
 end of November, FUSEP authorities had arrested a total of
 eight suspects, four of whom were Paz' cousins. Investigations
 in the case continued at year's end.
 Three members of the Marxist-led National Central of Farm
 Workers (CNTC) were killed during the year. Manuel de Jesus
 Guerra, a prominent CNTC leader, was killed on December 11. At
 the time of his death, Guerra was involved in organizing
 demonstrations in support of striking electrical workers.
 Although the CNTC blamed the Government for the crime, Guerra
 could also have been targeted by landowners for his advocacy of
 squatters' rights or killed as a result of internal CNTC power
 struggles. CNTC member Moises Castillo Lopez died on February
 19 when he was hit by a truck trailer while in_ the custody of
 two FUSEP officers in Santa Barbara. A FUSEP commission named
 to investigate the case concluded that Castillo had threatened,
 while drunk, to kill two women. FUSEP officers arrested him,
 and while they attempted to hail a ride to police headquarters,
 he fell into the path of the trailer because of his drunken
 state. Five days later, CNTC Press and Propaganda Secretary,
 Marcos Mejia Reyes, died in El Progreso, Yoro. The CNTC
 publicly speculated that the military was involved in his
 death, but the police said their investigation showed that
 Mejia was killed when an automobile struck the motorcycle he
 was, driving at an excessive speed while intoxicated.
 Leftwing terrorist groups claimed responsibility for several
 killings and attempted killings in 1991. A faction of the
 Cinchonero Popular Liberation Movement, which has refused to
 renounce armed struggle, claimed responsibility for the May 26
 shooting of Roger Eludin Gutierrez, one of four ex-Cinchonero
 leaders who returned to Honduras from abroad under the auspices
 of President Callejas' reconciliation program (see Section
 2.d.). The shooting was in apparent retaliation for Gutierrez'
 abandonment of armed struggle and statements he made during a
 May 10 press conference at the Presidential Palace. Three days
 after taking responsibility for the rocket attack on the
 Tegucigalpa headquarters of the United Nations Organization for
 Central America (ONUCA), the Morazanist Patriotic Front (FPM)
 claimed in a June 27 communique that one of its commando units
 had executed Jose Blas Pena Paz, nephew of former Armed Forces
 Commander and Head of State Policarpo Paz Garcia. Pena was
 shot by two men in front of family members as he was leaving
 his house on June 25. The Morazanist Patriotic Front initially
 claimed responsibility for the October 4 killing of Raul Suazo
 Madrid, a member of the rightwing United University Democratic
 Front (FUUD), but subsequently denied that claim. It took
 responsibility for the November 22 attempted murder of Arturo
 Guillen, chief of personnel of the National Enterprise for
 Electric Power (ENEE).
 Marco Tulio Lopez Hernandez, the 26-year-old son of the
 president of the nongovernmental Committee of Relatives of the
 Detained and Disappeared in Honduras (COFADEH), was shot and
 killed on July 22 as he stepped off a bus in San Pedro Sula.
 FUSEP agents arrested Julio Cesar Guardado almost immediately
 
 
 647
 HONDURAS
 when a passerby restrained him as he was fleeing through the
 streets. Credible reports indicate that the murder was not
 related to Lopez' human rights activities but that he was
 killed by a member of a leftist organization. There is no
 information suggesting armed forces involvement.
 The Government has failed to pursue its investigation into the
 1990 killings of labor leader Francisco Javier Bonilla Medina
 and student leader Ramon Antonio Briceno. Two accused
 triggermen, claiming they were tortured in 1990 into confessing
 to killing Bonilla, were released in April 1991 for lack of
 evidence. There is no indication that the investigation into
 Bonilla's murder has been reopened.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in 1991. Local human rights groups-continued to press,
 unsuccessfully, for an official accounting of the approximately
 145 claimed disappearances which mainly occurred during the
 early 1980's under the tenure of former Armed Forces Commander
 General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, and military
 authorities reiterated throughout 1991 their assurances that
 the practice had been stopped, credible charges of torture and
 other abuse of detainees continued. Methods of torture
 included beatings, on various parts of the body, near-
 suffocation, and psychological pressures such as death
 threats. While FUSEP authorities have announced in past years
 that individual cases of alleged torture would be investigated,
 the results of such investigations have never been released.
 There are no known instances of members of the Armed Forces
 ever being convicted of torture.
 In September FUSEP authorities opened an Office of Professional
 Responsibility (OPR) to investigate allegations of police
 misconduct. Preliminary reports indicated that some officers
 and enlisted personnel have been punished, and national level
 FUSEP directors stated that internal discipline has improved as
 a result of the establishment of the OPR. The effectiveness of
 this office, however, remains to be demonstrated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Honduran law states that a person may be arrested only with a
 court order, unless the arrest is made during the commission of
 a crime, and that the person must be clearly informed of the
 grounds of the arrest. A detainee must be brought within 24
 hours before a judge who then must issue an initial temporary
 holding order within 24 hours, release an initial decision
 within 6 days, and conduct a preliminary investigation to
 decide whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a trial
 within 30 days, or if necessary, to extend the 30-day period up
 to 3 months. While bail is legally available and used, poor
 defendants, seldom represented by an attorney, are very often
 unable to take advantage of it. Under the 1984 Code of
 Criminal Procedures, criminal proceedings may be initiated by a
 judge, the police, public officials, or any citizen. Perhaps
 as many as 80 percent of the cases reported to the police are
 
 
 648
 HONDURAS
 never referred to the criminal justice system but indtead are
 settled administratively by the police or municipal offices.
 As in past years, police and other security force elements
 continued in 1991 to practice arbitrary arrest and detention in
 a substantial number of cases. Credible reports of
 incommunicado detention and failure to comply with writs of
 habeas corpus also continued. FUSEP and DNI agents were most
 often responsible for violations of these laws and regulations.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under Honduran law, an accused person has the right to a fair
 trial, which includes the right to an initial hearing by a
 judge, to bail, to an attorney provided by the State if
 necessary, and to appeal. Defendants in military tribunals
 have the same due process rights as those being tried in the
 civilian system with the exception of bail. The military court
 system does not have courts uf appeal; appeals and
 ratifications of military tribunal verdicts are referred to the
 civilian judicial system..
 Jurisdictional disputes between the civilian and military court
 systems arose throughout 1991 in several cases in which a
 member of the military was alleged to have committed a crime
 against a civilian in circumstances unrelated to official
 duties. In all of these cases, high-level Armed Forces
 authorities insisted that the Constitution gives jurisdiction
 to the military courts, while several prominent civilian
 jurists publicly argued that civilian courts should have
 jurisdiction. A congressional committee began to study
 clarification of the pertinent constitutional articles
 governing the issue in August. The Supreme Court failed to
 resolve the question despite several cases pending before it.
 The civilian court system is weak and inefficient. The
 Attorney General is directly subordinate to the Congress, which
 is dominated by the political party in power. The nine
 magistrates of the Supreme Court are elected directly by
 Congress and confirmed by the President. The Supreme Court
 appoints most of the judges in the lower civilian courts.
 Whenever past elections resulted in a change of party, there
 was always a large turnover of court personnel. However, with
 enactment in March of the Career Judicial Law, judges,
 prosecutors, and defenders may now only be legally removed for
 cause, a step which may reduce the susceptibility of the
 judiciary to outside influence.
 The judicial system also suffers from inadequate funding. The
 executive branch and the Congress were only willing to fund
 about half of the 3 percent of the government budget that the
 judiciary is authorized under the Constitution.
 Detention without sentencing, averaging 14 months and sometimes
 as long. as 4 years, constitutes one of the most serious human
 rights problems in Honduras. A significant number of
 defendants in Honduras serve the maximum possible sentence for
 the crime of which they are accused before their trials are
 ever concluded or sometimes even begun. Approximately 80
 percent of the prison population in 1991 had neither been
 sentenced nor exonerated.
 These judicial weaknesses, along with FUSEP's poor
 investigative skills and the lack of transparency in the
 
 
 649
 HONDURAS
 military court system, greatly undermine the right of Hondurans
 to a fair public trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable
 and that entry by persons authorized by the State may only be
 made with the owner's consent or with authorization by a
 competent authority, and then only between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. or
 at any time in the event of an emergency or to prevent the
 commission of a crime. There were credible charges in 1991
 that police and Armed Forces personnel failed at times to
 obtain the needed authorization before entering a private
 home.
 Government monitoring of mail or telephones may be authorized
 by judicial order for specific purposes, such as criminal
 investigation or national security. There is no proven illegal
 monitoring by government authorities of telephone
 communications or written correspondence; although it is widely
 believed that the Armed Forces takes advantage of its operation
 of the national telephone company to illegally monitor selected
 telephone lines.
 Section 2 Respect For Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and
 these freedoms are largely respected in practice. The media's
 active role in shaping public opinion was apparent in the Riccy
 Martinez murder (see Section i.d.) when media discussion became
 a key element in moving the Government and Armed Forces to
 pursue justice in the case.  The media, however, are also
 subject to worrisome levels of corruption and politicization.
 As in past years, there were allegations of intimidation.by
 authorities, instances'of self-censorship, and payoffs to
 journalists. In January some members of the National Congress
 threatened to end duty-free privileges for newsprint and
 related equipment after the press severely criticized
 congressmen for granting themselves the right to duty-free
 import of three automobiles over a 4-year period. The
 automobile import privileges were rescinded, and President of
 Congress Irias Navas and President Callejas quickly assured the
 press that its duty-free privileges would continue as provided
 for by the Constitution. Two unidentified persons in a pickup
 truck shot at but missed Allan McDonald, an award-winning
 political cartobnist, as he was walking down a sidewalk in
 Tegucigalpa on June 8. McDonald said he had received several
 threatening telephone calls earlier about his cartoons. His
 assailants were not identified.
 The Government respects academic freedom and has not attempted
 to curtail political expression on campus.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution gives Hondurans the right to peaceful assembly
 for political, religious, or other purposes. The Government
 does not generally require prior authorization or permits but
 may ask for a permit to "guarantee public order."
 Demonstrations to protest such matters as the Government's
 economic programs routinely took place throughout the year
 
 
 HONDURAS
 without obstruction. Photographs of supposed plainclothes
 FUSEP agents mingling with student demonstrators calling for
 justice in the murder case of Riccy Mabel Martinez (see Section
 l.d.) were printed in newspapers 'in early August. Following
 those peaceful demonstrations, Armed Forces authorities ordered
 tanks and personnel carriers into the streets of Tegucigalpa,
 ostensibly to maintain law and order. Many Hondurans, however,
 believed that the real purpose of the maneuvering was to
 dissuade future demonstrations over the case. There are no
 restrictions on the rights of association.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Cqnstitution protects all forms of religious expression,
 and there is no state religion. While most Hondurans are Roman
 Catholic, foreign missionaries of various Protestant sects work
 and proselytize throughout the country. There were no publicly
 reported incidents of harassment or intimidation of the clergy
 by the military in 1991. President Callejas, responding to
 pressure from the country's Catholic community led by Bishop
 Luis Santos of Copan, in April canceled a major educational
 reform project called "Schools for the Future." The Bishop
 alleged that the program, developed by a U.S. evangelical group
 and funded by the Honduran Government, violated the concept of
 separation between Church and State. In September the Catholic
 Bishops' Conference issued a communique condemning recent
 violence, pervasive corruption in the administration of
 justice, and the failures of the Government's national agrarian
 reform program.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens enter and exit Honduras without arbitrary impediment,
 and travel within the country's borders is freely permitted.
 There have been no known instances in which citizenship has
 been revoked for political reasons.
 The Callejas Administration reached an agreement in early 1991
 to promote the repatriation of political exiles who bad left
 the country primarily in the early 1980's. On January 12
 President Callejas personally welcomed home four prominent
 leftist leaders. Under terms of the agreement, the four, as
 well as all other returnees, have the right to pursue their
 political objectives through legal means and to organize
 political parties and union movements. A second group of
 leftist repatriates, comprising 36 men, women, and children,
 returned to Honduras on May 7. They were followed on May 10 by
 four former leaders of the Cinchonero Popular Liberation
 Movement and in November by 11 leftists who had been living in
 Cuba. The "full and unconditional" amnesty passed by Congress
 on July 10 applies to all returnees.
 The few remaining Nicaraguan, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan
 refugees,, who numbered as many as 80,000 during the 1980's,
 continued throughout the year to return to their countries of
 origin. An official ceremony on February 28 to close the Los
 Guasimos Camp for Nicaraguan refugees in Jacaleapa marked the
 end of the UNHCR assistance program to Nicaraguans in
 Honduras. Approximately 1,700 Salvadorans remained in the Mesa
 Grande Camp at year's end.
 At the request of the UNHCR, the Government agreed to provide
 safe haven to 250 Haitians fleeing turmoil in their homeland.
 
 
 HONDURAS
 A camp was established near the city of Trujillo for the
 Haitians, -who arrived in Honduras on November 20. On December
 17, 104 of the Haitians were voluntarily repatriated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Hondurans continue to exercise the right to change their
 government through democratic and peaceful means. National and
 municipal governments are chosen by free, secret, direct, and
 obligatory ballotting every 4 years. Suffrage is universal,
 and any citizen born in Honduras or abroad of Honduran
 parentage may hold office except for members of the clergy and
 Armed Forces. A new political party may gain legal status by
 obtaining 20,000 signatures and establishing party
 organizations in 50 percent of the country's departments.
 Section 4 Governmental AttitudeRegarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Government officials continued to meet and cooperate with
 representatives of local and international human rights
 organizations in 1991. The governmental Inter-Institutional
 Commission on Human Rights (CIDH), established in 1987 to
 respond to domestic and international inquiries and to
 investigate human rights violations, is comprised of members
 drawn from the Supreme Court,-Armed Forces, Foreign Ministry,
 Ministry of Government and Justice, and National Congress. It
 is charged with gathering evidence in human rights cases,
 presenting that evidence to the courts, and asking the Supreme
 Court to ensure that trial take place based on that evidence
 when the lower courts fail to act. However, the Commission is
 ineffective: it did not ask the Supreme Court to pursue any
 human rights case in 1991, and it did not receive full
 cooperation from military and civilian judicial authorities.
 In late 1991 President Callejas began work to create a new
 governmental human rights commission at the presidential level.
 The Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras
 (CODEH) and the Committee of the Relatives of the Detained and
 Disappeared in Honduras (COFADEH) are the best known and most
 active local nongovernmental human rights organizations. Since
 the Government has failed to establish an effective human
 rights monitor, CODEH, with its network of offices throughout
 Honduras. is often the only recourse available to victims of
 abuses, particularly those living in rural areas. The
 nongovernmental Center for the Investigation and Promotion of
 Human Rights (CIPRODEH) was established in April. The center
 plans to offer basic human rights courses, holdmonthly
 seminars, carry out research studies on Honduran issues, and
 serve as a source of information on human rights.
 There were no serious incidents of harassment against members
 of human rights organizations in 1991. Although the
 26-year-old son of COFADEH President Liduvina Hernandez, Marco
 Tulio Lopez Hernandez, was shot and killed on July 22 in San
 Pedro Sula.(see Section l.d.), credible reports indicated that
 the murder was not related to Lopez' human rights activities
 but that he was killed by a member of a leftist organization.
 The Inter-American Court of Human Rights reported in April to
 the General Assembly of the Organization of American States
 that the Government of Honduras has. not yet fully complied with
 
 
 652
 HONDURAS
 the judgments of August 17, 1990, in the Velasquez Rodriguez
 and Godinez Cruz cases. In those cases, the court found
 Honduras liable for the involuntary disappearances of two labor
 activists and awarded compensatory damages to the widows and
 children. A subsequent interpretive ruling required that the
 damage awards be protected against devaluation of the Honduran
 currency.. Honduras paid in late 1990 the original damages but
 has not paid to date either the full economic value or
 postjudgment interest, as ordered by the court. The matter
 remained under consideration by the Government at year's end.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution bans discrimination for reasons of race, sex,
 and class. Women are represented in at least small numbers in
 most of the professions, but cultural attitudes act to limit
 their career opportunities. Women have equal access to
 educational opportunities and are paid equal wages for equal
 work, although their jobs are often classified as less
 demanding as a justification for paying them lower salaries.
 Physical abuse of women occurs in Honduras, but reliable
 statistics on the extent of the problem are unavailable. There
 are no shelters specifically maintained for battered women.
 Although the law offers legal redress, few women take advantage
 of the legal process. This reluctance stems from a lack of
 education and the perception that judges would be unwilling to
 apply the law vigorously.
 Many organizations have begun to offer assistance to women,
 principally targeting those living in the rural sectors and
 marginal neighborhoods of cities. The Honduran Federation of
 Women's Association, for example, provides home construction
 and improvement loans, offers free legal assistance to women,
 and lobbies the Government on women's causes.
 Although discriminatioh on the basis of class is banned under
 the Constitution, only Hondurans from the middle and lower
 classes are forcibly recruited into the Armed Forces. The
 Constitution provides for 2 years of compulsory military
 service for male citizens between the ages of 18 and 30.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the legal right to form and join labor unions.
 Although only about 20 percent of the work force is organized,
 trade unions exert considerable economic and political
 influence. They frequently participate in public rallies
 against government policies without interference and also make
 extensive use of the media to advance their views. There are
 three large peasant associations directly affiliated with the
 trade uniqns.
 The right to strike, along with a wide range of other basic
 labor rights, is provided for by the Constitution and honored
 in practice. Although the Civil Service Code stipulates that
 public workers do not have the right to strike, there were
 strikes in the public sector in 1991. On November 27, the
 Government declared illegal the strike of the Electrical

 fired from her job when she did not obey the Government' order
 to return to work.
 A number of private firms have instituted "solidarity"
 associations. (Solidarity is a labor/management concept which
 provides an array of services through an association and a
 joint employer/worker capital fund.) Organized labor,
 including the American Federation of Labor and Congress of
 Industrial Organizations and the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), strongly opposes these associations
 on the grounds that they do not permit strikes and have
 inadequate grievance procedures. The membership of such
 associations in Honduras remained static during 1991.
 On October 24, members of the 105th Army Brigade forcibly
 attempted to open a road blocked by miners from the El Mochito
 Mine. The miners were striking over management's attempts to
 institute a "solidarity" association. A retired miner was
 killed and over 20 were injured, including several members of
 the Army. As part of the settlement of the bitter 37-day
 strike, the Government agreed to introduce legislation banning
 "solidarity" organizations, but a debate about the
 constitutionality of this measure has ensued and it has not
 been passed as yet.
 "Land invasions" are still common and have sometimes resulted
 in armed conflicts among groups of peasants or squatters and
 landowners. During 1991, 12 peasants died as a result of land
 disputes, but no one has been found guilty of any of these
 killings. On May 3, five members of the National Association
 of Honduran Campesinos (ANACH) were killed in a land dispute
 with an army colonel (see Section l.a.). Two well-known
 leaders of the Xicaque Indian tribe were killed on September 30
 in yet another land dispute. An unpopular Anti-Terrorist Law
 used to arrest squatters is still on the books, although the
 Government has announced its intention to abrogate it.
 A few union activists were killed in unclear circumstances in
 1991. The Government failed to pursue its investigation into
 the 1990 murder of labor leader Javier Bonilla (see Section
 l.a.).
 The 1991 Report of the International Labor Organization's (ILO)
 Committee of Experts repeated earlier requests that provisions
 of the Labor Code be revised to conform with ILO Convention 87
 (freedom of association), including extending the right to
 organize to agricultural workers, allowing more than one union
 in a workplace, and removing restrictions on the right to
 strike.
 In May the New York Labor Committee in Support of Democracy and
 Human Rights in El Salvador filed a petition with the U.S.
 Trade Representative (USTR) requesting that Honduras'
 Generalized System of Preferences benefits be withdrawn because
 of alleged worker rights violations. In July the USTR
 announced that the petition had been rejected due to
 insufficient credible information.
 Honduras' trade union movement maintains close ties with
 various international trade union organizations.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and to bargain collectively is protected
 by law but not always observed in practice. Retribution by
 employers for trade union activity is not uncommon, in spite of
 its prohibition in the Labor Code. There are instances in
 which companies have threatened to close'down-if unionized.
 Some workers have been harassed and, in some cases, fired
 because of their efforts to form a trade union. Relatively few
 workers are actually dismissed for union activity; these cases,
 however, have served to discourage other workers from
 attempting to organize. Workers who are fired may apply to the
 Ministry of Labor or the courts for redress.
 Collecive bargaining agreements are the norm for companies in
 which the workers are organized. Workers in both unionized and
 nonunionized companies are'under the protection of the Labor
 Code, which gives them the right to seek redress from the
 Ministry of Labor. Wages in nonorganized companies are
 determined by labor supply and demand, within the constraints
 of the minimum wage law which was last adjusted by Congress in
 July.
 The free trade zones are governed by the same labor regulations
 as the rest of private industry, and working conditions in
 these export processing zones are generally considered superior
 to those prevailing in the rest of the country. Unions are
 active in the government-owned Puerto Cortes free trade zone,
 but factory owners have resisted efforts to organize the
 privately owned new industrial parks.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Honduras; such
 practices are prohibited by law and the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Constitution and the Labor Code prohibit the employment of
 children under the age of 16 years. Violations of the Labor
 Code occur frequently in rural areas or in small companies.
 High unemployment and underemployment have resulted in many
 children supplementing the family-income by working in' small
 family farms, as street vendors, or in small workshops. The
 Ministry of Labor has the responsibility for enforcing child
 employment laws, but it lacks the resources necessary to carry
 out the task.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In July President Callejas negotiated a tripartite agreement
 among labor, Congress, and the private sector which granted an
 average 27.8 percent minimum wage increase. The Constitution
 and the Labor Code require'that all labor be fairly paid.
 Minimum wages, working hours, vacations, and occupational
 safety are all regulated, but the Ministry of Labor lacks the
 staff and other resources for effective enforcement. The
 minimum wage, which varies by occupation, is considered
 insufficient to provide a decent standard of living,
 particularly in light of spiraling inflation. Many households
 need to pool family members' salaries to survive.

 The law prescribes an 8-hour day and a 44-hour workweek. The
 Labor Code provides for a paid vacation of 10 workdays after I
 year and 20 workdays after 4 years. The regulations are
 frequently ignored in practice as a result of the high level of
 unemployment and underemployment.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing national
 health and safety laws. Due to a lack. of resources, the laws
 are not well enforced. Reliable reports indicate that as many
 as 50 deaths per year result from serious health and safety
 hazards facing Mjskito Indian scuba divers employed in lobster
 and conch harvesting off the Caribbean coast of Honduras. Some
 complaints have also arisen about the failure of foreign
 factory managers to colaply with the Labor Code in factories
 located in free zones and industrial parks.
