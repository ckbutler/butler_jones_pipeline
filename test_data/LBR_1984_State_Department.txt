 LIBERIA
 Liberia has been ruled by a military government since a 1980
 coup ended 133 years of constitutionally elected government.
 The previous Government was an oligarchy of freed slaves who
 had come to Liberia seeking freedom denied them in the United
 States and the West Indies. This group and their descendants,
 called 'Americo-Liberians," largely excluded from political
 and economic power the 95 percent of Liberia's population
 which came from indigenous ethnic groups. Master Sergeant
 Samuel Kanyon Doe and 16 fellow coup-makers, all young
 non-commissioned officers from indigenous backgrounds,
 justified taking power as a revolt against elite rule. Doe
 and his colleagues established a military government called
 the People's Redemption Council (PRC), suspended the
 Constitution, instituted martial law, and placed a ban on
 political activities. Thus, for the present, Liberia has a
 military government with few institutional checks on the power
 of the Head of State and the executive branch, although the
 judiciary can and does act independently, as recently occurred
 in two major cases.
 In December 1980, Head of State Doe pledged to return Liberia
 to civilian rule in 1985. Since that time, he has repeatedly
 and publicly reaffirmed his commitment to the transition to
 democratically elected, constitutional, civilian rule, now
 announced for January 1986. In preparation, a new
 Constitution was drafted by a National Constitution
 Commission, and approved in a referendum in July 1984. This
 was followed by the dissolution of the PRC and the
 establishment of an Interim National Assembly, comprised of
 all former PRC members and 36 appointed civilian members, with
 Head of State Doe serving as its President. Next, on July 26,
 1984, the ban on political activities was lifted, except in
 educational institutions, and within 3 months, 13 political
 parties had formed and announced their intention to contest
 the elections.
 This steady progress has since slowed due to stiff
 registration requirements for political parties, and the
 promulgation of Decree 88A, which has a chilling effect on
 political expression by blurring the limits of permissible
 criticism of the Government.
 Also in 1984 there have been more frequent detentions of
 individuals without charge (four journalists, one lawyer, and
 several political figures); a seven-month closure of a leading
 independent newspaper; the public flogging without trial of
 two government officials accused of theft; and the violent
 dispersal on one occasion of protesting students and
 subsequent closure of the University of Liberia.
 Liberia has a mixed economy with significant state enterprise
 activity in utilities, agriculture marketing, and
 transportation. Foreign exchange receipts and government
 revenues are heavily dependent on exports of iron ore, rubber,
 and timber, all of which have suffered prolonged market
 decline. Education, wealth, and commercial property are
 concentrated in a narrow elite while two-thirds of the
 population remain in subsistence agriculture. The Government
 has attempted to reduce income disparities by increasing
 employment in government, the country's largest single
 employer, and raising minimum wages for civil servants and the
 military. Economic constraints, mismanagement, and corruption
 have hindered broader access to education, health services,
 
 
 182
 LIBERIA
 and participation in the modern sector. Corruption persists
 despite periodic trials of government officials for theft and
 corruption. Literacy is estimated at 25 percent and
 unemployment at 18 percent, although the latter may approach
 50 percent in certain areas, such as Monrovia.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no confirmed reports of political killings in
 Liberia in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 In 1984 there were no permanent disappearances of persons
 resulting from actions of government, quasi-government, or
 opposition elements, although arbitrary arrests and
 detentions, mostly short term, have continued. Four persons
 were reported missing after troops were used to put down
 demonstrations on the University of Liberia campus in
 Monrovia; one has been found and the investigation continues
 in the other three cases.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Suspects in criminal offenses may be subjected to beating or
 lashing by security personnel as a summary form of 'justice"
 upon or shortly after apprehension. However, it is not in
 most cases repetitive nor used as a tool in interrogation.
 Prisoners are also often stripped to their underwear in an
 effort at humiliation and to impede their escape. These
 practices run counter to Liberian judicial principles and are
 not condoned by the Government, although they have proved
 difficult to curb. However, some criminal statutes authorize
 sentences including periodic administration of a specified
 number of lashes. In October 1984, the Minister of Finance
 ordered the public flogging without trial of two government
 officials accused of theft.
 Custom and government regulations permit "trial by ordeal' in
 some civil and criminal cases although senior government
 officials have spoken out against the practice. While the
 suspect's consent is formally required, social pressure may
 play a coercive role. The ordeal usually consists of drinking
 a liquid prepared from the bark of the "sassywood" tree.
 Vomiting the liquid after ingestion indicates innocence, while
 its retention signifies guilt. However, even if vomited, the
 potion may be toxic. There have been no reports of
 "sassywood" related deaths in 1984.
 Most prisons lack proper nutritional, exercise, and sanitary
 facilities. However, the Palace of Correction in Zwedru,
 Grand Gedeh County, is reported to be clean, modern, and
 spacious.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Since the 1980 coup, martial law has coexisted with civilian
 law enforcement and judicial machinery. While the
 
 
 183
 LIBERIA
 Constitution and the right of habeas corpus have been
 suspended, the full body of pre-coup statute and case law is
 regarded more or less as valid. Civilians charged with
 statute violations are arrested by police under warrant and
 must be charged within three days of the arrest. Suspects
 have the right of bail in non-capital offenses, are entitled
 to legal counsel, and may only be convicted in a court of law
 under the due process procedures. Security officers charged
 under council decrees, and in some cases civilians, may be
 arrested by armed forces personnel, and brought before the
 Special Military Tribunal. The Tribunal is a panel of three
 uniformed officers which operates using the standards of the
 Uniform Code of Military Justice of the U.S. military.
 Reports of abuses by police and soldiers are frequent,
 although declining in response to disciplinary efforts.
 Reports of harassment are common. Civilians have reportedly
 been arrested or threatened with arrest by soldiers and police
 who then required payment of a 'fine.' In other cases,
 members of the former PRC arrogated to themselves informal
 authority to arrest, detain, and try persons involved in civil
 and labor disputes. Fines and short prison sentences were
 sometimes imposed without reference to due process or to
 relevant statutes and decrees. The Government condemns these
 practices and regularly makes statements calling for their
 eradication.
 In late August and early September, several leaders of one of
 the political parties were arrested and accused of plotting a
 coup. The Liberian Council of Churches, the entire
 administration of the University of Liberia, and the majority
 of the political parties petitioned the Head of State for
 their release. Western diplomats also expressed their concern
 that the accused be given a speedy and fair trial. Seven
 weeks after the arrests, the detainees were released without
 formal charges having been brought against them.
 In a violent incident on August 22, soldiers entered the
 campus of the University of Liberia by order of the Head of
 State to disperse several thousand students who were
 protesting the detention of a prominent Liberian educator and
 political leader. The Government has stated that 102 injuries
 resulted, 5 from gunshots, and acknowledged that some people
 were made to strip, were beaten and whipped, and even raped.
 The incident has not yet been thoroughly and independently
 investigated, but the Government has denied claims by various
 groups that people were killed.
 During 1984, the Government also detained four journalists and
 a lawyer without charges after they made statements critical
 of the Government. All were released after two to five months
 in prison. In December, five individuals were arrested and
 accused of publishing a series of leaflets critical of the
 Government; however, they have not been formally charged. One
 party official is currently under arrest for criticizing
 government action with regard to the arrest of a prominent
 Liberian educator and political leader.
 Detainees are not usually held incommunicado, though
 occasionally a detainee will be denied visitors for several
 days. In some instances bribes are demanded by guards before
 family members are permitted to visit those jailed.

 LIBERIA
 The Liberian Government does not exile its citizens. In fact,
 the Head of State and other government officials have on many
 occasions urged Liberians who fled or stayed abroad after the
 coup to return home. The Government specifically excluded
 from its amnesty two former regime figures who remained
 abroad: former Vice President Bennie Warner, and former True
 Whig Party Secretary Clarence Simpson. However, on July 26,
 the Head of State granted amnesty to Bennie Warner. Those
 Liberians who did return have not been persecuted by the
 Government.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Liberia's civilian court system is based on Anglo-American
 jurisprudence, and the military courts follow the Uniform Code
 of Military Justice of the U.S. military. While there are
 many good judges and lawyers, there have been numerous
 allegations of corruption among lawyers and judges and of
 interference in court cases by senior government officials.
 For three months in 1984, the Special Military Tribunal tried
 the case of 19 defendants, some of whom were civilians,
 charged in November 1983 with conspiring to overthrow the
 Government. The trial was closed to the public and only
 representatives of the government-owned media were present.
 There were allegations that the trial was manipulated by the
 Government. Thirteen of the defendants were found guilty and
 sentenced to death. However, two days later the Head of State
 gave clemency to 10 of the 13. Ultimately, three men found
 guilty of murder during a raid connected with the alleged coup
 were executed.
 Historically, the judiciary in Liberia has been very weak and
 vulnerable to influence exerted by the executive branch.
 However, in 1984, the courts showed considerable independence
 and integrity in two major cases of interest to the Government.
 On June 21, the Special Theft Court, a panel of three judges
 whose decisions are not subject to appeal, acquitted former
 Director of the National Housing and Savings Bank Hilary
 Dennis of embezzlement charges, on the grounds that the
 prosecution "was negligent and failed to present a prima facie
 case.' The strongly worded decision was especially important
 because it had been alleged that the Special Theft Court was
 vulnerable to government pressure.
 The same court, however, has also accepted jurisdiction in
 disputes in which its jurisdiction is open to question. It
 recently ordered the arrest of heads of private companies in
 two instances of disputes with employees or clients on
 compensation and insurance claims. It has been argued that
 such disputes belong in appropriate civil courts, whose
 judgments are subject to appeal. Both cases were dismissed,
 but only after considerable delay.
 Another important trial was the case of the Daily Observer, a
 leading independent newspaper closed by the Government in
 January for printing articles critical of the Government. The
 case was heard by one of the Supreme Court justices, who ruled
 in April that the Government had no case. The paper resumed
 publication in August 1984.
 The Head of State's statement in late 1984 that a prominent
 Liberian educator and politician (who had been detained for
 subversion and was subsequently released without being
 
 
 185
 LIBERIA
 charged) should be considered guilty until proven innocent,
 and Doe's reversal in December of a unanimous Supreme Court
 decision, have raised fears within the judiciary and the
 public at large over the independence of the judiciary.
 Traditional courts presided over by tribal chiefs are not
 bound by Anglo-American common law or judicial principles but
 apply customary unwritten law to domestic and land disputes
 and petty theft. Customary court decisions may be reviewed in
 the statutory court system, or may be appealed through a
 hierarchy of chiefs, followed by administrative review by the
 Internal Affairs Ministry, and in some instances a final
 review by the Head of State. Allegations of corruption and
 incompetence involving the traditional courts are often heard.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the martial law regime currently in effect, security
 forces may enter private residences without warrants, although
 civilian courts continue to issue warrants in the majority of
 cases. There were several cases reported in 1984 of persons
 arrested in their homes without warrants. In none of these
 cases, however, was the residence reportedly entered forcibly.
 In enforcing the ban on political activities, Liberian
 security services monitored the activities of groups or
 individuals believed to harbor political ambitions, and have
 continued to do so after the ban on politics was lifted.
 Surveillance is not widespread or generalized, however.
 There have been some instances reported of mail-opening by
 government forces. There is no express prohibition on
 receiving foreign publications, but occasionally the
 Government attempts to ban a particular issue of a foreign
 periodical that it considers especially critical.
 The Government has returned most of the real and personal
 property confiscated after the coup. In April 1984, Head of
 State Doe ordered the immediate return of any confiscated
 properties not previously returned to their owners.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government has dealt inconsistently with the issue of
 freedom of speech and press. Government officials have made
 statements affirming support for free speech. At the same
 time, however, the Government has passed laws restricting free
 speech and press.
 In 1980, Council Decree 2-A was passed outlawing efforts to
 "control, influence, oppose, castigate or deride (government)
 actions on policies.' The law mandates death by firing squad
 for offenders. Only two prosecutions have been brought under
 Decree 2-A, both prior to 1983, and in both the convicted
 defendants were pardoned by the Head of State.
 But in 1984, the Government increased its restrictions on
 freedom of speech and press. In August, the Government
 announced Decree 88A which makes it a felony to accuse any
 government official or other individual of any crime if the
 
 
 186
 LIBERIA
 purpose of the accuser is to injure the person's reputation,
 to create disharmony, to spread rumors, to undermine the
 security of the state, or impede the electoral process. Three
 members of an opposition political party have been charged
 with violations of Decree 88A; however, only one is imprisoned
 (he was held for six weeks before charges were brought), as
 the authorities have been unable to locate the other two. In
 December, five individuals were arrested and accused of
 publishing a series of leaflets critical of the Government.
 The detainees may be charged with a violation of Decree 88A,
 but they have not yet been formally charged with any crime.
 The two major independent newspapers, several political
 parties, and the Liberian Council of Churches have publicly
 stated that Decree 88A is an unwarranted restriction on
 freedom of speech and press.
 In addition to statutory limitations, the Government has taken
 other steps which have had the effect of restricting freedom
 of speech and press. Besides the politician who continues to
 be detained and has been charged with a violation of Decree
 88A, four journalists, one lawyer, and one other politician
 were detained without charges after making statements critical
 of the Government. All were released after two- to five-month
 prison terms, and no charges were ever brought. The
 politician was publicly accused of having plotted to overthrow
 the Government but was never formally charged. He was
 released after seven weeks.
 In January, the Government closed the Daily Observer, a
 leading independent newspaper, and began legal proceedings to
 revoke its license to publish. This was the fifth time since
 the 1980 coup that the Government has closed this newspaper.
 In April, a Supreme Court judge ruled that the Government had
 no case; the Justice Ministry appealed the verdict, but in
 July the Head of State ordered that the paper be allowed to
 reopen.
 The result of the government actions to restrict free speech
 and press has been to introduce an unspecified degree of
 self-censorship to avoid confrontation. The independent press
 usually avoids direct criticism of government policies. In
 analyzing public issues, finding fault with the status quo and
 suggesting remedies, however, editorials regularly express
 criticism indirectly. In some instances, the Government has
 forbidden reports on specific events, such as labor unrest or
 school disturbances, whose disclosure could prove embarrassing
 to it. There is no organized censorship of independent news
 organs. The government-owned Liberian News Agency keeps high
 standards of accuracy, although it omits reports on some
 developments at the direction of the Information Ministry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The ban on political parties was lifted in 1984 and parties
 have been allowed to hold organizing meetings. However,
 shortly after the lifting of the ban, the Special Elections
 Commission announced that parties wishing to register to
 compete in the elections would have to deposit $50,000 in cash
 and a $100,000 bond in an escrow account until they satisfied
 all requirements for registration, including the signatures of
 500 registered voters from at least 6 of the 11 counties.
 This has created a significant obstacle to the registration of
 opposition parties.
 
 
 187
 LIBERIA
 There are no official restrictions on civic, religious,
 social, recreational, or self-help development associations.
 Union organizing, collective bargaining, and the internal
 operations of trade unions are largely free from government
 interference. The Government has in fact allowed union
 organizing on plantations, forbidden under previous
 administrations. A national trade union confederation, the
 Liberian Federation of Labor Unions (LFLU), and several
 individual independent unions exist. The LPLU is a member of
 the Brussels-based, democratic-oriented, International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, as well as of the
 continent-wide, Ghana-based Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity.
 Unions are prohibited from strike action but brief strikes
 have occurred despite the ban. In most cases, workers have
 been persuaded to return peacefully to their jobs and the
 Government has taken no punitive action. in considering the
 case of an agricultural union suspended in 1982 the
 International Labor Organization noted that the prohibition
 against strikes 'constitutes in itself a serious violation of
 trade union rights.' The suspension, based on allegations of
 embezzlement against the union's secretary general, came
 shortly after illegal strikes which he had allegedly
 instigated. The suspension was lifted in October 1984 shortly
 after embezzlement charges were brought against the secretary
 general and two other officials. In 1983 and again in 1984,
 the Liberian Government was cited by the ILO for violations of
 ILO Convention 87, regarding freedom of association (because
 Liberian legislation does not recognize the right of workers
 in the public service or in government enterprises to form
 unions), and Convention 29, regarding forced labor. The
 Liberian Government has drafted a new labor code, which
 eliminates the objectionable legislation cited by the ILO, but
 it has not yet promulgated its new labor code, and thus the
 legislation for which it was cited by the ILO still remains on
 the books.
 Under the new Constitution and the election laws, unions and
 business are both prohibited from forming political parties or
 canvassing for or contributing to political parties. Parties
 are also prohibited from canvassing for members until they
 have met the $150,000 pre-registration requirement.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The pre-coup Constitution called for separation of church and
 state, a concept repeated in the new Constitution for the
 future civilian government. Christianity, brought by 19th
 century settlers and spread through the interior by
 missionaries, has long been the religion of the elite groups.
 But it has not been an official or state-favored religion.
 The majority of the rural population continues to practice
 traditional religions, and approximately 15 percent of the
 total population is Muslim. Many government officials are
 Muslims, and Muslims are active throughout the economy,
 especially in transportation and gold and diamond trading. In
 late 1983, the Government solicited suggestions for a date of
 particular significance to Muslims to be declared an annual
 national holiday.
 
 
 188
 LIBERIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Neither domestic movement nor foreign travel is restricted.
 Some travelers have reported harassment and requests for
 payoffs from security personnel manning internal checkpoints
 and border crossings or, in rare cases, by government agencies
 trying to pressure travelers. Exit visas are required for
 departure and obtaining them may be made more difficult by
 bribe-seeking officials. Emigration and immigration are not
 formally restricted. Some naturalized Liberian citizens
 originally from other African states have had their
 citizenship revoked on apparently arbitrary grounds.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Liberia's military Government has made substantial progress in
 instituting a formal mechanism to allow the people to
 participate in the political process of transition to
 democratically chosen, constitutional civilian government.
 The commitment to return Liberia to civilian rule was first
 made publicly in December 1980 by the Head of State. Since
 that time it has been repeated many times by the Head of State
 and other officials, and the legitimacy of the military
 Government has been linked to that pledge.
 The new Constitution, drafted by the National Constitution
 Commission and reviewed by the Constitutional Advisory
 Assembly, was approved by the Government. The Special
 Elections Commission conducted a successful voters'
 registration, and the voters then approved the Constitution in
 a referendum which was hailed by many observers as an
 important milestone in Liberia's history. The new
 Constitution is scheduled to become effective with the
 installation of a civilian government in 1986. The ban on
 politics was lifted in July 1984, and 13 political parties
 began organizing themselves to participate in the 1985
 elections. Although there have been some recent difficulties
 and delays in the long transition process, e.g., Decree 88A,
 overall progress has been significant.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Generally, the Government poses few objections or obstacles to
 investigations of the human rights situation. However, the
 Government did not allow observers at the trial in early 1984
 of 19 persons charged with conspiracy to overthrow the
 Government. Several times this year the Government has met
 expressions of concern or requests for information with the
 argument that they constitute unwarranted interference with
 Liberia's domestic affairs. Amnesty International stated in
 its 1984 report that it did not have sufficient information on
 the situation in Liberia to include an entry in its report.
 Freedom House terms Liberia "partly free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Liberian economy depends heavily on export of iron ore,
 rubber, and timber, whose production is dominated by foreign
 corporations. Expatriate communities, primarily Lebanese and
 Indian, also control an estimated 80 percent of retail and
 
 
 189
 LIBERIA
 wholesale trade. However, foreigners are not permitted to own
 real property. Gross national product (GNP) per capita was
 estimated in 1982 at $492.60, but 50 percent of national
 income is held by only 5 percent of the population. The
 current per capita figure is probably significantly lower due
 to negative GNP growth each year since 1980.
 Twenty-three percent of the population (1978) is below the
 absolute urban poverty level. Health care is poor, especially
 outside urban areas. Only 20 percent of the population has
 access to safe water (35 percent in urban areas and 6 percent
 in rural; 1974). Average calorie supply, however, is 104.81
 percent of requirements (1977). Despite a relatively high
 infant mortality rate of 129.60 per 1,000 (1984) and a life
 expectancy at birth of only 52.14 years (1984), the population
 is growing by 3.3 percent per year (1984).
 Education for this growing population is a major problem.
 Only 25.4 percent of adults are literate (42.2 percent of
 males and 9.3 percent of females; 1980). The primary school
 enrollment ratio was 80.15 percent (99.09 percent for males
 and 60.95 percent for females), but many students drop out
 (only 22 percent of school-age children will finish elementary
 school and the dropout rate is much higher among women than
 men). The problems of poor education are exacerbated by the
 fact that two thirds of the teachers are not professionally
 qualified and only 70 percent have finished high school.
 Liberia was founded by private American 'colonization
 societies," as a territory where blacks could enjoy political,
 economic, and social freedoms denied them in the United
 States. Eventually, 20,000 settlers came to Liberia and they
 and their descendents have remained heavily influenced by
 American cultural, economic, and political models. In urban
 areas and along the seacoast where settler dominance was
 strongest, a modern sector has evolved with a free enterprise
 economy, substantial political and economic equality for men
 and women, and Anglo-American judicial procedures based on
 English common law as transmitted and modified by the American
 experience. Here, land is plotted, deeded, and held in fee
 simple, and women can inherit equally. There is no formal
 discrimination in property ownership, educational opportunity,
 or participation in economic and political processes. Women
 in Liberia have held ministerial and ambassadorial positions
 and are represented in the professions and throughout the
 modern economy.
 In rural areas, where 70 percent of Liberia's estimated
 2,160,000 population lives, the inhabitants practice
 subsistence agriculture and follow a traditional culture in
 which men's and women's roles are more strictly defined.
 Here, most land is held communally among the related families
 of a clan, and women provide most of the labor in food
 production and distribution, both for household consumption
 and market sale. As opposed to statutory marriage, seen as a
 contract between individuals, customary marriage is an
 agreement between families. With payment of dowry under the
 customary marriage system, a woman is considered the property
 of her husband and family. Upon the husband's death, the
 marital contract continues with the family, which has certain
 obligations and responsibilities to the widow, or more
 commonly widows, if they remain with the family as wives to
 other relatives. In the traditional sector, women are not
 usually entitled to inherit from their husbands or to
 
 
 190
 LIBERIA
 administer their estates. In addition, women are informally
 excluded in many indigenous ethnic groups from chieftancies or
 membership in the councils of elders that direct the affairs
 of the community. In practice, especially in newly urban
 areas, many women use both the customary and statutory legal
 systems.
