 LATVIA
 Latvia, having regained its indeendence in 1991 after 50 years of forced annex-
 ation by the Soviet Union, is a par lamentary democracy. The 1993 coalition govern-
 ment comprising the Latvia's Way and Farmers' Union parties broke up and was
 replaced by another government dominated by Latvia's Way. The Prime Minister,
 as chief executive, and the Cabinet are responsible for government operations. A
 1991 Constitutional Law, which supplements the 1922 Constitution, provides for
 basic rights and freedoms.
 The security apparatus consists of: the national police and other services subordi-
 nate to the Interior Ministry; municipal police operating under local government
 control; the National (Home) Guard, a mainly volunteer reserve which assists in po-
 lice activities; and the Latvian Republic Security Service (LRSS). All these organiza-
 tions were responsible for abuses, including use of lethal or excessive force. In late
 1994, the National Guard and LRSS which had operated independently, were both
 placed under Defense Ministry jurisdiction. All active-duty Russian troops left Lat-
 via by August 31, 1994, although as many as several thousand officers demobilized
 in place remained illegally.
 Traditionally dominated by agculture and forestry-based industry, with military-
 industrial production introduced by the Soviets, Latvia's varied economy is increas-
 ingly oriented toward the service sector. As the transition from a centrally planned
 to a market-oriented economic system continues, private enterprise in trade and
 services is thriving, and about 50 percent of farmland is now in private hands. In
 the industrial sector, progress is slower, and the first stage of mass privatization
 of firms is not scheduled to begin until 1995. With a stable, freely traded currency
 unemployment around 8 percent, and annual inflation about 25 percent in 1994 and
 trending downward, the economy has begun to grow again.
 A key development in 1994 was the enactment of a law on naturalization and citi-
 zenship, and promulgation of attendant implementing regulations. If carried out,
 the law will allow most of Latvia's approximately 700,000 noncitizen residents to
 seek naturalization over the next several years. The main requirements are knowl-
 edge of the Latvian language, history, and Constitution, as well as a pledge of loy-
 alty to Latvia. While Russia and some noncitizens criticized the law, most independ-
 ent experts, including the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
 (CSCE) resident mission, deemed it a compromise consistent with international
 norms. By year's end, the Government had not yet introduced its national program
 for protecting individual rights, and Parliament had not yet adopted on third read-
 ing a law specifying the rights of noncitizens.
 Police and security forces, which are ethnically mixed, continue to use violence
 and excessive force, occasionally resulting in death, and the Government has not yet
 taken adequate disciplinary action against those responsible. Prison conditions re-
 mained substandard, and the authorities reportedly injured many inmates when
 they suppressed prison hunger strikes. Although the Citizenship and Immigration
 Department (CD) continued to act arbitrarily and to ignore court orders in some
 cases concerning the residence status of noncitizens, independent observers noted
 limited improvements in the latter half of 1994.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudcial Killing-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 
 
 871
 Latvian media reported extensively on instances in which security officials inap-
 propriately used lethal force, resulting in the shooting deaths of at least two inno-
 cent civilians. In a separate case, LRSS officials allegedly beat a detainee so badly
 that he died of his injuries. Investigations continue in these cases, and subsequently
 the Government greatly reduced the size of the LRSS, limited its functions, and
 placed it under the jurisdiction of the Defense Ministry.
 b. Disappearance-There were no known instances of political abductions or dis-
 appearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture. However, there were credible reports that police
 and prison personnel beat detainees and prison inmates (see Section L.a.). There
 were no known instances in which the Government prosecuted those responsible.
 Prison conditions remain poor. Inadequate sanitation facilities, persistent short-
 ages of blankets and medical care and insufficient lighting and ventilation are corm-
 mon problems, as is the availability of resources. The prohibition against allowing
 detainees awaiting trial to send mail, which existed under Soviet law, continues.
 In mid-1994 the authorities, using Interior Ministry prison guards with reinforce-
 ments from special Interior Ministry police brigades, reportedly suppressed large-
 scale hunger strikes against prison conditions and injured many inmates when they
 cracked down harshly. Although the State Minister for Human Rights appointed an
 investigative commission, the Government by year's end had taken no disciplinary
 action or legal measures against those officials alleged to have used excessive force.
 The situation for some imjprisoned children was extremely poor, although some
 improvements were reported in 1994. Credible reports indicate that children as
 young as 14 years old were kept in unsanitary conditions and suffer from disease
 and deprivation. Both boys and girls are subject to violence and possible sexual
 abuse.
 One of the legacies of Soviet domination is the regular practice of hazing military
 recruits. The authorities did not take any significant disciplinary or legal action to
 punish military authorities who accept or tolerate cruel and degrading treatment of
 young soldiers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no known instances of arbi-
 trary arrest or exile. As of October 1, the responsibility for issuing arrest warrants
 was transferred from prosecutors to the courts. The law requires the prosecutor's
 office to make a formal decision whether to charge or release a detainee within 72
 hours after arrest. Charges must be filed within 10 days of arrest. A detainee may
 not be held for more than 6 months without new arrest orders being issued by the
 prosecutor's office. No detainee may be held for more than 18 months without the
 case going to court. Detainees have the right to have an attorney present at any
 time. These rights are subject to judicial review, but only at the time of trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.--Although the criminal justice system is organized
 according to the former Soviet model, Latvia is reforming its judicial system and
 adding regional courts. For more serious criminal cases, two lay assessors join the
 professional judge on the bench. There sre no reports that the Government improp-
 erlyvrrn infuenedjudes
 Trinaluenced  eosed if state secrets might be revealed. In one case of a par-
 liamentarian accused of collaborating with the Soviet secret police (KGB), the trial
 was closed to protect the identity of ex-KGB officers who appeared as witnesses. All
 defendants have the right to hire an attorney, and the State will lend funds to des-
 titute defendants for this purpose. Defendants have the right to read all charges and
 confront all witnesses. Defendan  ma offer witnesses and evidence to support their
 case.
 In May the state prosecutor informed the Saeima (parliament) of allegations that
 five parliamentarians (of whom two were government ministers) were suspected of
 having willingly collaborated with the KGB. All Saeima candidates had been re-
 quired to sign documents denying such collaboration. Although all five originally de-
 nied KGB links, the Saeima majority voted to suspend their parliamentary man-
 dates pending the outcome of trials to determine their guilt or innocence. The Gov-
 ernment characterized this step as an unconstitutional infringement of the par-
 liamentarians' right to a presumption of innocence as well as a violation of Saeima
 procedures. Nevertheless, at year's end, three of the accused were still barred from
 exercising their parliamentary responsibilities pending conclusion of lengthy trials
 and appeals. A former minister without portfolio was exonerated and returned to
 Parliament, while the former Foreign Minister admitted limited cooperation with
 the KGB and resigned his seat.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-By law,
 law enforcement authorities require a judicial warrant to intercept mail, telephone
 calls, or other forms of communication.
 
 
 872
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Latvia generally enjoyed freedom of speech and
 press throughout 1994 which is provided for by the Constitutional Law. The 1991
 Latvian press law proibits censorship of the press or other mass media. In 1994
 the number of independent television and radio outlets, broadcasting in both Rus-
 sian and Latvian, continued to grow. Two cable television companies compete for
 subscribers in Riga, who continue to increase in number.
 Virtually all newspapers and magazes in Latvia are privately owned, and new
 publications continued to appear. Newspapers in both Latvian and Russian pub-
 lished a wide range of criticism and political viewpoints.
 In September the Riga city council adopted a law which would have banned the
 distribution of certain foreign publications "directed against Latvian national inde-
 pendence." Before the law was scheduled to take effect, however, the Government's
 Minister of State Reform exercised her legal authority to overrule the city council.
 In overturning this local legislation, which was intended to outlaw the distribution
 of hard-line Russian nationalist publications, the Government argued that the press
 ban would have been a violation of international human rights instruments as well
 as Latvian guarantees of freedom of the press. Riga city council officials did not ap-
 peal the Government's decision but suggested they would use indirect administra-
 tive measures, such as the licensing of newspaper dealers, to restrict unwanted pub-
 lications.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The authorities legally do not
 have the power to prohibit public gatherings. Organizers of demonstrations must
 provide advance notice to local authorities, who may change the time and place for
 such reasons as fear of public disorder. In 1994 numerous mass meetings and politi-
 cal demonstrations took place without government interference.
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public organizations. How-
 ever, the law on registering public organizations was amended in late 1993 to bar
 registration of Communist, Nazi, or other organizations whose activities would con-
 travene the Constitution. More tan 40 political parties are officially registered.
 In October 1993, the Cabinet directed authorties to close three small organiza-
 tions that allegedly had plotted a coup against the Latvian Government in connec-
 tion with the insurrection in Moscow, inc~uding the Union of Comunists. That or-
 ganization and the like-mindd Union for the Protection of Veterans' Rights sued
 the Government for its refusal to register them as legal organizations. In September
 a court ruled that the Justice Ministiy had acted properly in refusing to register
 the Union of Communists.
 The Justice Ministry also refused to register the League of Stateless Persons in
 Latvia on the grounds that noncitizens are prohibited from forming "political" orga-
 nizations. While the refusal to register the League has serious legal consequences,
 such as the ability to incorporate and hold property, the authorities did not prevent
 the League from holding meetings and speaking out on behalf of noncitizens.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government does not interfere in the exercise of reli-
 gious freedom. Foreign evangelists are permitted to hold meetings and proselytize.
 The Government does not require the registration of religious groups. Only religious
 groups which have members who are Latvian citizens, however, may incorporate.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no obstacles to freedom of movement within the country, for-
 eign travel, or repatriation of citizens.
 Sme noncitizens may require reentry permits. In late 1994, the Government was
 developing a new travel document for noncitizen residents. Before issuing this docu-
 ment, it ran short of the former Soviet passports that it previously issued to
 noncitizens. Pending the Government's issuance of the new document (or purchase
 of additional former Soviet passports), foreign travel for some noncitizens was tem-
 porarily restricted.
 Latvia is not a signatory to international conventions on refugees and does not
 have a law on political asylum. Most of those seeking refugee status are persons
 from the Middle East entering by land from Russia and hoping to reach Scandina-
 via; Latvia usually attempts to return such applicants to Russia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. Latvia held free and fair elec-
 tions for Parliament in 1993 and for local councils in May 1994, with the participa-
 tion of numerous parties and factions representing a broad political spectrum. Eight
 parties won seats in the Saeima, and 90 percent of eligible voters participated, using
 a secret ballot.
 
 
 There was no mechanism for the many residents of Latvia who were not citizens
 to participate in the elections. Furthermore, there was a Latvian-language require-
 ment for candidates in local elections. A similar requirement may also apply to fu-
 ture Saeima candidates, but in 1994 the Saeima rejected efforts to apply a language
 requirement to its own members retroactively. There are no ethnic restrictions on
 parliamentary representation, and ethnic Russians serve in the Saeima.
 In July the Saeima approved the final version of the naturalization law based on
 a much-amended bill originally submitted by the ruling Latvia's Way par. Since
 the restoration of independence in 1991, Latvian citizenship had previously been ac-
 corded only to those persons who were citizens of the independent Latvian Republic
 in 1940 and their direct descendants. Owing to the Russification policy pursued dur-
 ing the Soviet era, ethnic Latvians make up only about 54 percent of the total popu-
 lation and do not constitute a majority in seven of Latvia's eight largest cities. Many
 Latvian citizens are particularly sensitive about citizenship and naturalization is-
 sues owing to the large minority that is not ethnicall Latvian.
 In late June, the Saeima adopted a law on naturaization that would have set an-
 nual quotas of less than 20,000 applicants in each year after 2001. Following serious
 criticism  by international orglnzations and foreign governments, President
 Ulmanis sent the law back to 1Parliament with a recommendation to eliminate the
 quota provision from the law. The Saeima accepted the President's recommendation,
 and the enacted law met with approval by most international human rights experts
 from the Council of Europe (COE) and other international organizations.
 As enacted, the naturalization law provides that various categories of noncitizens
 will be eligible to apply for naturalization over a period extending from 1995 until
 early in the next century. Highest priority will be given to spouses of Latvian citi-
 zens, ethnic Latvians, citizens of other Baltic states, and persons born in Latvia.
 The law includes a Latvian language and residence requirement as well as restric-
 tions on naturalization of former Soviet KGB and military officers. The law requires
 applicants for citizenship to renounce previous non-Latvian citizenship, to have
 knowledge of the Constitution, and to take a loyalty oath. Furthermore, the law also
 provides for legal guarantees concerning naturalization procedures and decisions
 through operation of (a) a parliamentary supervising committee; (b) an obligation
 to render decisions within 1 year from the date of appcation; and (c) judicial review
 of decisions not to grant citizenship. International experts, Latvian government offi-
 cials, and domestic human rights monitors agreed that Latvia will must place high
 priority on implementing the naturalization law in a fair, impartial manner and
 provide greater opportunities for noncitizens to learn the Latvian language.
 The Citizenship and Immigration Department (CmD), which has administrative re-
 sponsibility for registering noncitizens, has consistently failed to implement properly
 and fairly laws affecting noncitizens. Most cases involve CID denials of noncitizen
 residents' applications for "permanent resident" status. Although negative CID deci-
 sions are subject to judicial review, when courts do overturn negative CID decisions,
 the CID frequently refuses to comply. In October Minister of State for Human
 Rights Janis Tupesis acknowledged unprofessionalism on the part of CID officials
 but denied any large-scale violations of human rights. Toward the end of the year,
 there was some evidence of modest improvement in the CD's implementation of
 court orders.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A few nongovernmental organizations devoted to research and advocacy of human
 rights issues, including prison conditions, operate without government restriction.
 Several organizations deal with issues of concern to local ethnic Russians, present-
 ing them to the courts and the press.
 The Government demonstrated a willingness to engage in dialog with nongovern-
 mental organizations working on human rights issues, particularly after it created
 in March a new post of State Minister for Human Rights. It welcomed visits b
 human rights organizations and received delegations from, among others, the CSC,
 the COE, and the United Nations. A resident CSCE mission was established in Lat-
 via with a mandate to "address citizenship issues and other related matters." Lat-
 vian officials worked particularly closely with the CSCE and COE during the draft-
 ing and ultimate adoption of the citizenship law.
 In late July, the Government hosted a special high-level mission organized by the
 United Nations Development Program, the COE, and the CSCE to discuss the for-
 mulation of a national program for the protection and promotion of human rights.
 Headed by the Federal Human Rights Commissioner for Australia, the mission met
 with official and nongovernmental sources and provided the Government with obser-
 
 
 874
 vations on the human rights situation as well as recommendations for developing
 domestic institutions to protect human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitutional Law provides that all persons are equal under the law regard-
 less of race, sex, religion, language, social status, or other grounds and grants equal
 rights to work and wages to persons of all nationalities. Of a tot  puation of 2.7
 million, there are 1.4 million Latvians, 900,000 Russians, 120,000 Belarusians, and
 100,000 Ukrainians.
 Women.-Women possess the same legal rights as men. The Latvian Labor Code
 prohibits women from performing "hard jobs or jobs having unhealthy conditions."
 based on a list agreed between the Cabinet and labor unions. Beyondthis, it bans
 employment discrimination. In reality, women frequently face hiring and pay dis-
 crimination, especially in the emerging private sector. Women apparently have not
 brought any discrimination suits before the courts.
 Sources indicate that the problem of domestic violence against women is fairly
 widespread and is often connected with alcohol abuse. There is anecdotal evidence
 suggesting that the entire legal system, including the courts, tends to downplay the
 seriousness of domestic violence. Observers suggest that police are sometimes reluc-
 tant to arrest in such cases. No programs exist specifically to assist victims of do-
 mestic abuse. Adult prostitution has not been outlawed; it is increasing and is often
 linked with organized crime.
 Women's advocacy groups are still small. They are involved in finding employ-
 ment for women, lobbying for increased social benefits, and banning thehazing of
 military recruits.
 Children.-The Government seeks to ensure that children's human rights are re-
 spected and their basic welfare needs met. A few children's advocacy groups are ac-
 tive, particularly in lobbying for legislation to protect children's rights and for in-
 creased welfare payments for children. Legislative gaps hampered efforts to win con-
 victions in child molestation cases. Law enforcement authorities have won court
 suits to remove children from abusive parents and secured convictions in child pros-
 titution cases.
 Children's advocates point to the lack of special institutions for rehabilitation and
 vocational training of juvenile offenders. Although recent legislation provides for the
 establishment of such special schools, the Government failed to budget funds for
 this purpose. Consequently, juveniles are frequently housed in regular prison facili-
 ties after committing relatively minor offenses.
 National Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitutional Law provides that only
 citizens may occupy state positions, establish political parties, own land, and "choose
 a place of abode on Latvian territory." Under the Constitution, all residents of Lat-
 via enjoy equal rights under the law. However the majority of persons who are not
 ethnic Latvians have difficulty participating fuhy in the civic life of the country. Re-
 liable sources suggest that practical problems are most acute for those noncitizens
 who have only temporary residence permits in Latvia. These are typically people re-
 siding in factory dormitories or housing units previously connected to the Soviet or
 Russian military.
 The Latvian language law requires employees of the State and of all "institutions,
 enterprises, and institutes" to know sufficient Latvian to carry out their profession.
 The law also requires such employees to be conversationally proficient in Latvian
 in order to be able to deal with the public. Despite the language law, there have
 been no reports of widespread dismissals, even in the city of Daugavpils, in which
 87 percent of the population is not ethnically Latvian, and Russian is the prevailing
 language in industry. Nevertheless, many non-Latvians believe that they have been
 disfranchised and that the language law discriminates against them, although there
 are no reports of widespread dismissals among management, teachers, or other sec-
 tors.
 Some ethnic Russians have also complained of de facto discrimination resulting
 from Latvia's property laws, which limit land ownership to citizens. Moreover,
 noncitizens were given fewer privatization certificates (which will eventually be
 used to purchase land, apartments, and stocks) than citizens. New legislation, how-
 ever, allows land ownership by companies in which noncitizens own shares. Because
 of past Soviet Russification policies, ethnic Russians generally live in newer, better
 housing than ethnic Latvians. The level of compensation for their apartments to
 those emigrating from Latvia is not high enough to permit them to purchase an
 apartment in Russia. Latvia does not officially grant any compensation to former
 Russian officers for apartments assigned them by the Soviet military, although at
 least some seem to circumvent such legal restrictions.
 
 
 875
 The Government has agreed to continue using Russian as the language of instruc-
 tion in public schools where the pupils are pr narily Russian speakers. Although
 all non-Latvian-speaking students in public schools are supposed to learn Latvian,
 there are shortages of Latvian teachers. State-funded university education is in Lat-
 vian, except for the medical school and some classes for outgoing seniors. Incoming
 students whose native language is not Latvian must pass a Latvian-language en-
 trance exam. It remains the Government's stated goal that all public schools eventu-
 ally convert to Latvian as the language of instruction.
 People With Disabilities.-Latvia does not have a law banning discrimination
 against the disabled. The Government supports special schools for disabled persons.
 The Government does not enforce a 1993 law requiring buildings to be accessible
 to wheelchairs, and most buildings are not accessible to wheelchairs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Latvia's law on trade unions mandates that workers,
 except for the uniformed military, have the right to form and join labor unions of
 their own choosing. In 1993 about 50 percent of the work force belonged to unions;
 union membership continued to fall as workers left Soviet-era unions that include
 management or were laid off as Soviet-style factories failed. The Free Trades Union
 Federation of Latvia, the only significant labor union confederation, is nonpartisan,
 though some leaders ran as candidates for various smaller parties that failed to
 enter Parliament in the 1993 elections. Unions are free to affiliate internationally
 and are developing contacts with European labor unions and international labor
 union organizations.
 The law does not limit the right to strike, and in December more than 10,000 Lat-
 vian teachers staged a 9-day strike, which was the first major labor action since the
 restoration of Latvian independence. Although many state-owned factories are on
 the verge of bankruptcy and seriously behind in wage payments, workers fear dis-
 missal if they strike, and noncitizens fear that their participation in strikes may af-
 fect their residency status. While the law bans such dismissals, the Government has
 not effectively enforced these laws.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions have the right
 to bargain collectively and are largely free of government interference in their nego-
 tiations with employers. The law prohibits discrimination against union members
 and organizers. Some emerging private sector businesses, however, threaten to fire
 union members; these businesses usually provide better salaries and benefits than
 are available elsewhere. The Government's ability to protect the right to organize
 in the private sector is weak.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not practiced. Inspectors from the Welfare Ministry's labor
 epartment enforce the ban.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment of children is 15, although those aged between 13 and 15 may work
 in. certain jobs after school hours. Children are required to attend school for 9 years.
 State authorities enforce child labor and school attendance laws. The law restricts
 employment of those under 18, for instance, by banning night shift or overtime
 work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In October the minimum monthly wage was
 set at about $50 (28 lats). The authorities estimate the poverty line to be about $120
 (68 lats) per month. Many factories are virtually bankrupt and have reduced work
 hours.
 The Labor Code provides for a mandatory 40-hour maximum workweek with at
 least one 24-hour rest period, 4 weeks of annual vacation, and a program of assist-
 ance to working mothers with small children. Latvian laws establish minimum occu-
 pational health and safety standards for the workplace, but these standards are fre-
 quently ignored.
