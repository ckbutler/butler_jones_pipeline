 IRAN*
 Iran is officially an Islamic Republic under the leadership of
 Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini. Its formal system, based
 on the Constitution approved in 1980 by popular referendum,
 follows a parliamentary pattern with a legislature and a
 president elected from among multiple candidates by universal
 suffrage. However, only candidates meeting highly restrictive
 religious and political criteria are permitted to contest
 elections, and the choice offered to voters is limited. The
 regime continues to be dominated by a political elite composed
 of Shi'a Muslim clerics who support Khomeini and of laymen
 aligned with these clerics. The regime, however, is not
 monolithic, and there are major differences on theology and on
 economic issues such as private property ownership, government
 versus private control of foreign trade, industrial policy,
 and diplomatic strategy.
 The regime's hold on power is reinforced through arrests,
 executions, and other forms of intimidation practiced by an
 extensive internal security system. Political arrests are
 made by members of the Revolutionary Guard or, less commonly,
 by members of komitehs, local neighborhood groups which have
 assumed a quasi-official role.
 Although 10 years have passed since the ouster of the Shah in
 1979 and the advent of the Islamic Revolution, the regime
 still considers itself revolutionary but must grapple with the
 need to revive the economy and operate political and social
 institutions, both new and old, in a productive manner.
 Although Iran is an oil-rich developing country, the
 disruptions of the revolutionary period and the burden of war
 have caused serious economic deterioration. Inflation and
 unemployment remain high, and corruption and black market
 activities ontinue to flourish.
 The human rights situation continued to be affected by the
 Iran-Iraq war, despite the August 20 ceasefire. Apart from
 its toll of hundreds of thousands of casualties, the war has
 resulted in large-scale destruction of cities and villages and
 massive population displacement, and in general has had a
 drastic impact on the quality of life of all segments of
 Iranian society which will continue to be felt for many years.
 Major human rights abuses continued in Iran in 1988. These
 included at least several hundred political executions,
 continuing arbitrary detentions, the repression of freedoms of
 speech, press, and association, and the use of torture in
 repressing political opposition. Amnesty International (AI),
 in its 1988 Report covering 1987, described many of these
 abuses and detailed a wide range of particularly brutal forms
 of torture. A variety of observers in August and September
 alleged widespread executions of political prisoners. In
 October AI reported receiving more reports of political
 executions in Orumieh and Tabriz and elsewhere.
 In October the U.N. General Assembly published the interim
 report by the Special Representative of the Commission on
 Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The report
 contains eyewitness allegations of torture and executions.
 *Because of the absence of a United States Mission in Iran,
 this report draws heavily on unofficial sources.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reliable statistics were not available on the number of people
 killed for political or religious reasons in 1988. Because of
 the lack of basic procedural safeguards for defendants tried
 in revolutionary courts, which handle virtually all political
 cases, most of the executions ordered each year by such courts
 amount to summary executions. It is also difficult to
 separate cases of executions for participation in violent
 activities or narcotics trafficking from executions based
 purely on the defendants' beliefs, statements, and
 associations, given the regime's practice of cloaking the
 latter category with charges from the former.
 Following their capture during an Iraqi-supported offensive
 into Iran in August, some members of the Iraqi-based National
 Liberation Army, the military wing of the Mojahedin, were
 executed along with some of their supporters.
 AI, in an Urgent Action memorandum dated November 8, reported
 "substantial numbers of political executions in Iran in the
 last 3 months.. .Some opposition groups put the figure at over
 2,000," while others put the figure in the hundreds. In
 December AI published a report alleging the execution of more
 than 300 people since July, but said the true death toll could
 number in the thousands. Exact figures, however, cannot be
 determined.
 According to the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 Special Representative, many opponents of the regime were
 executed during July, August, and September, including members
 of the Tudeh Party, the People's Fedayeen Organization, the
 National Liberation Army, and collaborators with the People's
 Mojahedin Organization. Many were publicly hanged in cities
 throughout Iran. AI's December report stated that opposition
 activists were killed secretly in prisons throughout Iran.
 Political violence was also perpetrated by opposition groups,
 including the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, still the most active
 antiregime organization in Iran. The Mojahedin organization
 continues its attacks and operations in Iran against
 Revolutionary Guards, clergy, and members of the Government.
 b. Disappearance
 No information is available on the number of disappearances in
 1988.
 Although there are some cases of long-term disappearance, most
 disappearances are seldom permanent. People are arbitrarily
 arrested or carried off, held.without charge, and some are
 summarily executed; the society, however, is not tightly
 controlled, so a persistent relative can usually determine who
 was responsible for the arrest and locate the detainee.
 
 
 1345
 IRAN
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Stories of torture in Iran's prisons are rampant and cover a
 wide range of inhuman practices. According to various
 sources, mock executions are a common method of torture, as
 are threats of sexual abuse of female prisoners and female
 relatives of male prisoners. Beatings of all kinds appear to
 be common. Allegedly, prisoners are flogged on the soles of
 their feet until they can no longer walk; others have had
 damaged kidneys as a result of being kicked and beaten.
 Former Iraqi prisoners in .Iran's prisoner-of-war camps have
 reported that Iran subjects prisoners to whippings, random
 executions, and psychological torture.
 Torture apparently takes place in government prisons or in
 government houses in which prisoners of special interest are
 held for questioning. Presumably it takes place with the
 sanction of top officials. The U.N. Special Representative
 cited tortures such as rape, beating by several guards at
 once, threats against prisoners' families, and forcing
 relatives or other prisoners to watch torture.
 In its 1987 Report, "Torture in the Eighties," AI expressed
 concern that torture has become a routine practice in at least
 some Iranian prisons. In its 1988 Report, covering 1987, AI
 reported that torture of political prisoners remained
 widespread and that thousands of people were subjected to
 lashings and other punishments which constitute torture, or
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although arrests for expression of views critical of or
 different from those of the Government have decreased during
 the past several years, opposition to the regime itself or to
 an Islamic form of government still may lead to arbitrary
 detention. If there is a formal accusation, the charge is
 usually subversion, antiregime activities, or treason.
 There is also evidence that some persons are arrested on
 trumped-up criminal charges (for example, on drug charges)
 when their actual "offenses" are political; the lack of fair
 trials and other procedural safeguards encourage such a
 practice.
 No judicial determination of the legality of detention exists
 in Iranian law. Al notes that there is no legal time limit on
 incommunicado detention. Suspects are held for questioning at
 local Revolutionary Guard offices or in jails. In some cases
 an Islamic clergyman is involved; in others, unidentified
 questioners, sometimes including torturers. It is unclear
 whether this questioning constitutes a trial by a
 revolutionary court or whether it is part of the investigation
 process. Sometimes defendants are released after several
 hours or days, but the process may be repeated two or three
 times before the authorities decide that the detainee is
 innocent or that he is guilty and should be jailed. Time
 spent in detention does not count toward fulfilling prison
 sentences.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 
 
 1346
 IRAN
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most of those arrested have a trial of some sort, and although
 trials of major opposition figures have sometimes been
 telecast, no trial by a revolutionary court can be called fair
 or public. If the trial is given publicity, it is generally
 because the prisoner has already been forced to confess to
 crimes.
 In his 1988 Report, the U.N. Special Representative noted that
 individuals he interviewed described their trial in prison as
 an "extremely summary proceeding" lasting a few minutes. None
 of the persons had access to a defense lawyer and there was no
 appeal process. Some of those sentenced were imprisoned beyond
 the limit of their sentence, in one case 3 years beyond it.
 Restraints on arbitrary actions of the revolutionary courts
 were reportedly severely weakened in 1985 by a government
 decision to limit the review authority of the Supreme Court.
 Formerly, all cases decided by the revolutionary courts were
 subject to review by the Supreme Court, permitting improper
 decisions to be overturned. But under the 1985 decision the
 Supreme Court can examine only those cases which are
 recommended for review by the Supreme Judicial Council, which
 consists of the Chief Justice, the Prosecutor General, and
 three mullahs.
 The judicial zystem is further weakened by the fact that
 revolutionary courts can consider cases formally under the
 jurisdiction of the civil and criminal courts. Assignment of
 cases to regular rather than revolutionary courts is haphazard
 and apparently occurs mainly when arrests are made by regular
 police. Revolutionary courts can also overturn the decisions
 of civilian courts.
 For-common criminal offenses, many elements of the
 prerevolutionary judicial system survive, and the accused
 often have the right to a public trial with benefit of lawyers
 of their own choosing, assuming they can afford the fee. Even
 this judiciary is not fully independent, however. Many of the
 former judges were retired after the revolution, and new
 judges selected. One criterion for new judges is grounding in
 Islamic law, and political acceptability is a requirement for
 any government position. Favorable verdicts reportedly can
 often be "purchased" from the judges serving on civil and
 criminal courts and to a lesser degree from judges of the
 revolutionary courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government is attempting to remake Iranian society
 according to Khomeini's interpretation of Shi'a Islam. It
 rejects the Western distinction between a public sphere which
 the Government may control and a sphere of private life
 (religion, culture, thought, and private behavior) which the
 State may not properly control. The regime defines itself as
 Islamic and attempts to enforce a way of life asserted to be
 Islamic.
 Since Khomeini's eight-point decree of December 1982, Iranians
 have enjoyed somewhat greater freedom in their private lives.
 One of the eight points provided that no one had the right to
 enter private homes without a warrant. An exception was made
 
 
 1347
 IRAN
 for suspected hideouts of opposition groups. The decree did
 say that if Revolutionary Guards entered a home believing it
 to be an opposition hideout and found they had made a mistake,
 they were to depart, even if they had found evidence of
 un-Islamic activities such as the presence of alcoholic
 beverages. The decree also stated that mail should not be
 opened or telephones tapped unless there was good reason to
 suspect antiregime activities.
 While homes are still entered, mail opened, and phones tapped,
 these violations continue to occur less frequently than in the
 years before 1982. A Headquarters for the Enforcement of the
 Imam's Decree was set up,-as were a number of provincial and
 local offices. These offices are said to have received
 thousands of complaints about violations of rights of privacy.
 Special Revolutionary Guard units and neighborhood Komitehs
 check on social activities. Women whose clothing does not
 completely cover the hair and all of the body except hands and
 face, or who wear makeup, are subject to arrest. In 1988,
 however, enforcement of Islamic morality, including of rules
 governing dress and appearance, became somewhat more lax.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution states that "publications and the press may
 express ideas freely, except when they are contrary to Islamic
 principles, or are detrimental to public rights." In
 practice, most publications are controlled by the Government;
 independent publishers run the risk not only of press
 shutdowns And confiscation of publications and equipment but
 of arrest and summary punishment if they are overly critical
 of the regime. Examples of such punishments were sufficiently
 numerous in past years to have a chilling effect.
 All books must be submitted to the Ministry of Islamic
 Guidance for censorship before they can be published.
 Publishers, authors, and printers also engage in substantial
 "self-censorship" before submitting books to the Ministry in
 an effort to avoid the substantial penalties, including
 economic losses, incurred when books are rejected.
 While there are competing newspapers in Iran, and officials
 and government policies are often subjected to public
 criticism, newspapers are forbidden to criticize Khomeini and
 the concept of the Islamic republic, or to support the right
 of self- determination for any ethnic groups in Iran.
 Nevertheless, some independent publishers out of favor with
 the regime continue to survive, and some books and pamphlets
 critical of the regime are published without reprisal.
 Foreign books, newspapers, and magazines may be imported only
 after review.
 All broadcasting facilities are government owned.
 There has been greater academic freedom in the last several
 years, and universities operate under looser constraints. For
 example, the Islamic credentials of applicants for university
 posts are not rigorously checked as they have been in the
 past. Course content is still monitored by on-campus
 informers, however, and genuine critical debates are
 impossible. To secure permanent employment, professors
 reportedly must build a record of cooperation with government
 
 
 1348
 IRAN
 authorities over several years. As part of the admissions
 process, all Muslim students must pass examinations that
 demonstrate knowledge of the Koran and Islamic precepts. The
 relatively few Jews and Christians who enter universities
 reportedly must pass tests demonstrating knowledge of their
 respective religions. All textbooks are reviewed by
 government authorities to determine their acceptability.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution permits unarmed assemblies and
 marches "provided they do not violate the principles of
 Islam," the only ones permitted in practice are those
 sponsored by the Government, such as Friday prayers and
 sermons and parades on official occasions.
 The Constitution permits political parties, groups,
 professional associations, and both Islamic and minority
 religious associations, but most independent organizations
 have either been banned, co-opted by the Government, or are
 moribund. Restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly
 discouraged the participation in the 1984 parliamentary
 elections of any party other than the semiofficial Islamic
 Republican Party (IRP), now also defunct. In December the
 Ministry of Interior announced that political parties would be
 allowed to form soon, provided they meet the regime's
 religious and political criteria.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iran terms itself an Islamic republic, ano religion is closely
 intertwined with government. Grand Ayatollah Khomeini is
 recognized as the supreme leader, and this position is viewed
 as having something akin to divine sanction. The President
 and many other top officials are mullahs (religious leaders),
 as are the Speaker of the Parliament and nearly half the
 Parliament deputies.
 Approximately 90 percent of Iranians are Shi'a Muslims. Aside
 from slightly over 1 percent who are non-Muslims (Baha'is,
 Christians, Zoroastrians, and Jews), the rest are Sunni
 Muslims. The Sunnis are mostly Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans,
 Baluch, and other ethnic minorities. Their political
 influence is very limited. The Constitution declares that
 "the official religion of Iran is Islam and the sect followed
 is Ja'fari Shi'ism," but it also states that "other Islamic
 denominations shall enjoy complete respect." Although Sunnis
 have encountered religious discrimination on the local level,
 the regime has made efforts to reduce Shi'a-Sunni antagonism.
 Tests of Islamic knowledge and orthodoxy, required in the
 early postrevolutionary years for public or semipublic
 employment, have been dropped on the grounds that they
 conflict with the constitutional provision that "the
 interrogation of people regarding their beliefs is
 forbidden." This provision is ignored, however, in the
 treatment of members of the Baha'i faith.
 The Baha'i religion, an offshoot of Islam, is considered a
 "misguided sect" by the authorities, and is not officially
 recognized. Since the revolution the Baha'is, Iran's largest
 
 
 1349
 IRAN
 non-Muslim minority (300,000-350,000 members), have suffered
 severe persecution, mainly government-directed and aimed at
 the religious leadership.
 In 1983 the Prosecutor General issued an order that
 effectively banned all Baha'i religious activity and provided
 the legal foundation on which virtually all members of the
 faith can be charged with crimes. Baha'i property has been
 confiscated, shrines demolished, businesses disbanded or
 confiscated, and known Baha'is denied public-sector employment
 and social services. Baha'i marriages are not recognized.
 Participation by Baha'is in social welfare organizations is
 forbidden, their businesses are outlawed, and teaching of the
 faith is not permitted. In 1988 the U.N. Special
 Representative noted that Baha'is with whom he spoke cited
 "denial of means of subsistence and of access to higher
 education" as the most common form of harassment. Although
 the Baha'i national leaders dissolved the community's
 organizations in obedience to the Prosecutor General's edict,
 they subsequently were arrested, and at least some were
 executed. Many ordinary Baha'is also have been arrested on
 vague charges.
 According to the National Spiritual Assembly of Baha'is of the
 United States, however, the situation of Baha'is improved
 somewhat dtring 1988. No Baha'is have been arrested since
 February. In addition, the number of Baha'is held in prison
 was reduced, from roughly 200 in late 1987 to about 129 in
 1988. There have been no recent reports of torture of
 Baha'is. A small number of Bahai's have been issued visas to
 leave the country. Some Bahali property confiscated by the
 Government was returned, although the amount represents a
 small part of the total seized. Some Baha'i students who had
 been expelled were allowed to resume their studies. The UNHRC
 Special Representative reported that persons to whom he spoke
 said the intensity of the campaign of persecution "had
 somewhat diminished in the first half of 1988."
 It is too early to tell whether this improvement represents a
 temporary lull or reflects a permanent change in government
 policy. However, it is clear that the Government has not
 abandoned its anti-Baha'i policies; widespread discrimination
 against, and persecution of, the community persists.
 The small Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian (the pre-Islamic
 religion of Iran) populations are concentrated mainly in urban
 areas. Their religions are recognized by the Constitution,
 and they elect representatives to seats reserved for them in
 the Parliament. They are permitted to practice their
 religions, to instruct their children, and--although with a
 great deal of disruptive interference--to maintain schools.
 There continue to be reports of officially sanctioned
 discrimination against these minorities, particularly in the
 areas of employment and public accommodations, and of severe
 discrimination by the Government against Muslims who have
 converted to Christianity. Other reports indicate growing
 religious tolerance and readiness to accept employment of
 minorities in the professions. Nevertheless, Christians are
 sometimes suspected of harboring sympathies with Western
 powers, while Jews are seen as pro-Israeli and therefore a
 possible fifth column against Islam and Iran.
 
 
 1350
 IRAN
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iranians may travel to any part of Iran, except for the war
 zone on the border with Iraq and, in times of heavy fighting,
 some Kurdish areas. Such limitations are for purposes of
 military security. Persons may change their place of
 residence without obtaining permission.
 Travel outside Iran is considerably easier now than before the
 spring of 1983. Khomeini's decree of December 1982 included
 the right to travel abroad. Prior to that time passports and
 exit visas had been difficult to obtain. However, there are
 indications that in 1988 airport departure procedures were
 tightened, while the exit tax was increased sharply.
 Males of draft age are not issued exit visas except for
 approved courses of study, and Iranians who are suspect
 politically, such as some retired military officers and high
 level public officials under the former regime, may not be
 able to leave. Persons who have not repaid loans obtained
 from development banks under the old regime also are denied
 exit visas. Reportedly some Iranians, particularly those with
 skills in short supply and who were educated at government
 expense, are required to post bonds to obtain exit visas.
 Jewish Iranians are permitted to obtain passports and to
 travel, but they are normally denied the multiple-exit visas
 given to most Iranians and must make a fresh application (with
 a fresh fee) for each planned trip. Permission is not
 normally granted for all members of a Jewish family to travel
 outside Iran at the same time.
 With the exception of some with close ties to the former
 regime, Iranians are generally able to return after long
 periods abroad without reprisal. Not all citizens who leave,
 however, are guaranteed the right to return. Iranians
 suspected of close association with the old regime have
 encountered problems obtaining new passports, and there have
 been unconfirmed reports of arrests on their return.
 However, numerous other immediate relatives of persons wanted
 by the regime seem able to live in Iran, travel outside, and
 return without undue difficulty, and in recent years many who
 fled-at the time of the revolution have returned and have
 sought, through the Iranian judicial system, the return of
 their properties.
 Iranian passports have always been stamped "not valid for
 emigration," but the Government does not make a clear
 distinction between legal residence in another country and
 emigration. According to the regulations, Iranians with a
 legal residence outside Iran may be issued passports and
 advance exit visas by the Iranian embassy, consulate, or
 interests section in their country of residence. Iranians who
 have acquired U.S. citizenship are considered Iranian (in
 effect dual nationals) unless they have formally renounced
 their Iranian citizenship in accordance with Iranian law.
 Dual nationals have complained that the Iranian Interests
 Section in Washington will neither give them visas in their
 U.S. passports nor issue them Iranian passports and exit visas
 on the grounds that their residence in the U.S. is not legal
 because, according to Iranian law, they emigrated illegally.
 
 
 1351
 IRAN
 Although such services may be denied, there are no known
 instances of the denial of Iranian citizenship to Iranians who
 left Iran, or to those who have remained there.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders and their lay
 associates who share a belief in Ayatollah Khomeini as the
 supreme leader of the revolution and in the legitimacy and
 desirability of a theocratic state based on his interpretation
 of Shi'a Islam. Citizens are not free to question or to
 change this theocratic form of government. The only political
 party represented in the Government--the Islamic Republican
 Party (IRP)--was disbanded in June 1987 at the request of
 President Ali Khamene'i (IRP Secretary General) and Parliament
 Speaker Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, and with the consent of
 Ayatollah Khomenini.
 Beginning a year after the Shah's departure, the revolutionary
 regime has held elections at fairly regular intervals for
 president, Parliament deputies, members of the Council of
 Experts (responsible for choosing Khomeini's successor), and
 members of local government councils. All elections have been,
 hard fought, generally with several candidates for every
 position. All candidates must be approved by the Council of
 Guardians, however, and only those meeting the Council's
 vaguely described political and religious criteria may run.
 In practice, only supporters of the theocratic state are
 accepted. There has, however, been considerable diversity of
 opinion among candidates on economic and social questions.
 Parliamentary elections took place in April but were marred by
 charges of vote rigging. New elections for some contested
 seats took place in October.
 The independence of the Parliament is enshrined in the
 Constitution and exists to a large degree in practice. At
 least three women serve as deputies in the Parliament. While
 Parliament deputies are typically allied with various powerful
 political and religious officials, they may speak and vote
 independently and may shift from one faction to another.
 Vigorous parliamentary debates--normally covered extensively
 in the press--cover a wide variety of issues but not central
 issues such as the war or the fundamental character of the
 Islamic Republic. Criticism of government officials is often
 aired in these debates; in some cases, laws proposed by the
 executive branch have been voted down.
 The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed
 of 12 members: 6 clerics unilaterally appointed by Khomeini,
 and 6 lay members well-grounded in Islamic law who are
 nominated by the head of the Judicial Council subject to the
 Parliament's approval. The Council of Guardians must certify
 all bills passed by the Parliament as being in accordance with
 Islamic law and the Constitution. If bills fail to be
 certified, they are sent back to the Parliament for revision.
 They cannot become law until passed by the Parliament and
 certified by the Council.
 The Council has rejected various important bills and portions
 of bills passed by the Parliament, including legislation on
 land reform, foreign trade, private enterprise, the press
 code, and reform of the civil code.
 
 
 1352
 IRAN
 In February Khomeini ordered the formation of an Expediency
 Discernment Council to decide on the final disposition of
 bills on which the Parliament and Council of Guardians are
 unable to reach agreement. Its 13 members comprise the 6
 clerics of the Council of Guardians plus 7 other regime
 leaders.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The regime in Iran is disdainful of foreign human rights
 groups, government-sponsored or independent, and regards them
 as a Western means of interfering in the country's internal
 affairs. Since 1984, the Government has refused to allow a
 U.N. Human Rights Commission special representative to enter
 Iran to prepare his reports and has not commented on human
 rights violations submitted for consideration. There are no
 internal human rights groups.
 In October 1986, the Government announced that the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) would be
 permitted to visit Prisoner of War (POW) camps. Since
 November 1986, the ICRC has been visiting camps and
 interviewing prisoners. It has assisted in several POW
 exchanges between Iran and Iraq and its officials are active
 in arranging the exchange of POW's envisioned by U.N. Security
 Council Resolution 598, which provides the framework for a
 negotiated end to the war.
 In its 1988 Report, AI reported that it had intervened
 repeatedly with Iranian authorities in 1987 to urge the
 release of certain prisoners, fair trials within a reasonable
 time for all political prisoners, and an end to torture and
 the death penalty. It said that the Government had failed to
 provide any substantive response and continued to assert only
 that there were no political prisoners or torture in Iran.
 The U.N. Special Representative, in his interim report of
 October, "expressed his belief that acts continued to occur in
 Iran that were inconsistent with international instruments to
 which the Government was bound... It appears that the
 persistence of allleged violations of human rights,...in
 particular, the recent reports of a renewed wave of
 executions.. .suffices to justify international concern and the
 need for competent U.N. organs to continue monitoring the
 situation in that country." By the end of 1988, the
 Government had not responded publicly to the report, but
 various officials have denied charges that a series of
 executions has taken place.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Always the object of discriminatory practices in Iran's
 conservative society, women have faced even more
 discrimination since the Revolution. Ultraconservative dress,
 entirely hiding the hair and all of the body except the face
 and hands, is a requirement for all women, regardless of their
 religion, national origin, citizenship, or diplomatic status.
 In the past, women have been harassed, detained, or physically
 attacked if they appeared in public in clothing which official
 or self-appointed guardians of public morality deemed
 
 
 1353
 IRAN
 insufficiently modest. However, as noted in Section l.f.,
 women in 1988 seem to be enjoying somewhat greater freedom in
 dress and appearance.
 Employment opportunities for women are more restricted than
 was the case under the Shah. Women are legally barred from
 being judges. Although there are cultural barriers making
 employment in professional-level positions difficult to
 obtain, women do work as lawyers, physicians, and
 statisticians, and in other professions in both the public and
 private sectors. Two women serve as deputies in the
 Parliament.
 The Family Protection Act, passed under the Shah, was revoked
 by the Islamic Government and replaced by a civil code
 reflecting Islamic law. A bill passed in mid-1983 did give
 women the right to divorce their husbands, and regulations
 announced in 1984 substantially broadened to 12 the number of
 grounds for which a woman may seek divorce. A husband may
 obtain a divorce without having to state a reason or go to
 court. The new marriage regulations provide for improved
 financial settlements for wives whose husbands divorce them.
 As noted in Section 2.c., the Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian,
 and Baha'i minorities suffer varying degrees of officially
 sanctioned discrimination in a number of areas, particularly
 with respect to employment and public accommodations. Muslims
 who have converted to Christianity are similarly discriminated
 against.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There were until recently no legal labor unions, although some
 unauthorized unions had been organized and were active.
 However, a new national labor union, the Islamic Union,
 reportedly was created in late 1985 under a law enacted by the
 Parliament. All economic concerns with a minimum of 50
 employees are permitted to have a branch of the new union,
 whose proclaimed goal is to protect workers' interests and
 further their professional development. Nominally
 independent, it is in fact controlled by the Labor Ministry.
 Union employees have little real control over its operations.
 It is also believed that there are officially sanctioned
 "Islamic workers councils" in some factories. These too,
 however, are more instruments of government control than
 bodies created and controlled by workers to advance their own
 interests, although they have frequently been able to block
 layoffs or firings of workers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In practice, the right of workers to organize independently
 and bargain collectively is extremely limited.
 It is not known whether labor legislation and practice are

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Iranian labor law, which exempts agriculture, domestic
 service, family businesses, and, to some extent, other small
 businesses, forbids employment of minors under 12 years and
 places special restrictions on the employment of minors under
 18. In addition, women and minors may not be used for hard
 labor or, in general, for night work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor law establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum
 (except for overtime at premium rates), with 1 day of rest
 (normally Friday) per week as well as at least 12 days per
 year of leave with pay and a number of paid public holidays.
 There are also legal provisions with respect to minimum wages
 and health and safety in workplaces.
 Given the large segments of the economy exempted from the
 labor law, the State's still unresolved administrative
 disorganization resulting from the revolution, the effects of
 the war with Iraq, and the general lack of labor unions which
 are both legal and effective, it is unclear to what extent the
 provisions of Iran's labor law actually affect most of the
 labor force.
