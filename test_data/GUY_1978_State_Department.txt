 GUYANA
 Since independence in 1966, Guyanese politics have
 been dominated by the Peoples National Congress (PNC)
 of Prime Minister Forbes Burnham. The PNC draws most
 of its support from the Afro-Guyanese who make up 42
 percent of the population. The East Indian community,
 representing about 53 percent of the population, has
 largely backed the main opposition political party,
 Dr. Cheddie Jagan's Peoples Progressive Party (PPP),
 a Marxist-Leninist organization which tends to follow
 the Moscow line. The adherence of the East Indian
 population to the PPP can be explained more by ethnic
 than by political loyalties, however. The PPP has
 accused the Government of manipulating the political
 system to seek authoritarian solutions when unable
 to generate adequate popular support for its policies.
 Despite underlying tensions, guarantees for individ-
 ual human rights, which are written into the current
 Constitution, have been honored as a matter of both
 tradition and policy.
 The Government appears to be dedicated to providing
 for the basic human needs of the Guyanese people
 including adequate sustenance, shelter, health care
 and education.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited in Chapter II of the Consti-
 tution of Guyana. There have been no reported
 instances or allegations of the use of torture by
 
 
 264
 the Government.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degraaing Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits such treatment or
 punishment. There have been no reported instances or
 allegations of cruel or otherwise objectionable
 treatment of prisoners.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Constitution provides that no person may be
 deprived of personal liberty, except as-authorized by
 law. This right is generally respected. A few
 instances of arbitrary arrest were alleged by the
 opposition in connection with the July 10, 1978,
 referendum.  (See Section 3.c.) The detainees were
 released the same day upon orders of the Chief of
 Police, apparently acting on instructions of the
 Government.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Law and politics are honored professions, and the
 independence of the 3udiciary and the integrity
 of the judicial process are generally respected.
 A belief in the right to a fair trial is ingrained
 in the Guyanese political ethic. The Constitution
 protects the right of anyone charged with a criminal
 offense to a fair hearing by a court established by
 law. There have been no reports of trials held in
 camera. Criminal case hearings appear to be consistently
 fair. on occasion allegations circulate that decisions
 in civil matters are based upon political considerations.
 There are also allegations of unreasonable delays
 in 3udicial proceedings that are reportedly caused in
 part by personnel and material shortages reflecting
 the general low level of resources available to the
 Government.

 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Government basically has adhered to a policy
 of respecting the individual's right to privacy at
 home. However, searches for contraband have
 apparently been carried out without warrants, despite
 Constitutional guarantees. The principal opposition
 has contended tnat such searches, particularly in the
 period preceding the July, 1978 referendum, were
 politically motivated.
 Government officials have publicly stated tnat
 the Constitution to be established pursuant to that
 reterendum will contain provisions similar to those
 in the old Constitution protecting citizens against
 individual human rights violations as delineated above
 in sub-sections 1 (a) througn I (e).
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government has declared that fulfillment of
 the vital, basic human needs of the people is a
 major reason and justification for the new Constitu-
 tion. Stated goals include self-sufficiency in food
 production, supply of food at reasonable prices (basic
 foods are price-controlled), adequate shelter for
 all, free health care and free education.
 Food and housing subsidies are provided by the
 Government. Basic human needs figure prominently in
 tne Government's economic development program, and a
 September, 1978 World Bank report notes that the
 Government attaches "high priority to an equitable
 distribution of income and ... provision of food,
 housing,'health care and education to the population."
 The Government maintains that the fulfillment of vital
 needs takes priority over the observance of "intan-
 gible" human and civil rights. Nevertheless, many
 of these stated goals have been unfulfilled largely
 because of severe economic constraints on the Govern-
 ment.
 
 
 266
 There has been a fair amount of corruption invol-
 ving Government officials. However, the current
 administration has embarked on an enforcement campaign
 which has led to the resignation of one Cabinet
 Minister and the arrest of some high-level officials.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Under PNC leadership, the Guyanese Government has
 pursued an increasingly Marxist ideology.
 There is no Government censorship of reading material.
 Although Guyanese radio stations are government con-
 trolled and reflect government policies, the Guyanese
 regularly listen to radio broadcasts from the British
 Broadcasting Corporation, Voice of America and neigh-
 boring countries without interference. With the
 exceptions noted below, the Government has tolerated
 political opposition and has not interfered with
 the basic civil liberties of its citizen.
 Political activities surrounding the July 10
 referendum included a few documented instances
 of harassment of opposition members by PNC militants.
 On the day of the referendum, several opposition
 members who attempted to photograph or otherwise
 document alleged irregularities were assaulted.
 The Government has harassed the opposition press
 in at least three different instances during the
 past year. It has refused to grant the PPP's Mirror
 import licenses for both new press equipment and
 newsprint. The Government press has refused to
 continue printing the weekly Catholic Standard,
 which has been highly critical of the Government's
 policies. The Standard has been reduced to an
 electro-mimeograph format. The Maoist-oriented
 editor of an irregularly printed news sheet was fined
 for not registering his publication as a newspaper.
 He was jailed for two or three weeks for failing
 to pay his fine. Both the Government-owned newspapers
 and the public and private radio stations refused
 
 
 to publish, either as news or as paid announcements,
 political pronouncements of opposition parties or
 groups. Nonetheless, an outspoken opposition press
 continues to publish, if with reduced scope. Opposi-
 tion leaders still speak out in meetings ana rallies,
 using sound trucks, pickets with posters and news
 handouts.
 There has been no Government interference with
 the right of citizens to practice their religion.
 However, religious groups, notaoly the Roman Catholic
 Church and the Guyana Council of Churches, have
 been the object of veiled threats by the Government-
 controlled media and Government officials because
 of their opposition to the Government proposal that
 was the subject of referendum. Foreign-born clergy
 who were in any way involved in the referendum issue
 have been threatened with expulsion or a refusal
 to have their residence permits renewed. One American
 missionary who was a member of the Executive Board
 of the Guyana Council of Churches was denied a renewal
 of his residence permit allegedly because of his
 connection with the Council.
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteea under the present
 Constitution and has been generally observed by
 the Government. Political opposition groups regu-
 larly hold rallies and meetings without hindrance.
 In the pre-referendum campaigning, there were a few
 physical attacks on speakers and other participants,
 although for the most part the Government did not
 interfere with the opposition.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There is treeaom to move about Guyana, save for
 isolated areas where the Government has announced its
 intention of protecting American Indian civilizations
 by limiting Guyanese and foreign intrusions. Citizens
 may travel abroad and emigrate, although travel for
 personal reasons is hampered by strict controls of
 the amount of money one is permitted to take out.
 
 
 268
 C. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Guyana is a constitutional democracy with a parlia-
 mentary system of government based on the Westminster
 model. Facea by growing economic pressures from both
 without and within Guyana and the increasing pressure
 from the East Indian majority, the Government has taken
 steps to protect itself and perhaps improve its long-
 run political prospects. In the July, 1978 referendum,
 a majority of the voters endorsed a PNC proposal to
 transform the Parliament into a Constituent Assembly
 empowered to amend or alter the existing Constitution
 without further reference to the electorate. The
 Government won the referendum by a substantial margin,
 though the opposition PPP accused the Government of
 rigging the election. The immediate effect of the
 referendum was to postpone national elections for 18
 months or more while the Constituent Assembly, which
 was formerly the Parliament, hammers out a new
 Constitution.
 There were numerous complaints regarding the
 Government's registration procedures and credible
 allegations of manipulation of the vote. All Guyanese
 were ostensibly encouraged by the Government to
 participate. The opposition called for a boycott.
 The opposition has decided also to boycott the new
 Constituent Assembly. Thus, unless the PPP decides to
 return, only the splinter United Force Party, which
 holds two seats, remains as formal opposition in the
 Assembly.
 Labor union members can organize and strike. They
 can also effectively participate in the political
 process through their unions. Independent and opposi-
 tion unions remain factors which the Government must
 take into account. Their ability to influence events
 is likely to be small but, like the churches, the
 trade unions retain some political power which the
 Government may not completely ignore.

 Although there is only one woman Cabinet Minister
 (Information and Culture), women enjoy rights equal
 to men and occupy several senior Government
 positions. The Prime Minister's wife is the head
 of the important Women's Revolutionary Socialist
 Movement. Other Guyanese women play leading roles
 in the fields of medicine, education, politics and
 tne military, and there is no legal hindrance to
 women serving in any job they wish to occupy. The
 Guyana Defense Force has women pilots on active duty.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The principal allegation of human rights violation,
 voicea by opposition figures ranging from the churches
 to avowed pro-Peking and pro-Moscow opposition party
 leaders, is that Prime Minister Forbes Burnham's PNC
 nas consistently rigged elections from 1968 through
 the referendum of July 10, 1978. On several occasions,
 the opposition has called for investigations. Most
 recently it urged the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission to look into irregularities involving
 the referendum. Prime Minister Burnham was reported
 in the press as replying in Parliament that "as
 long as he was Prime Minister he would not allow
 any group to invite any organization for the purpose
 of observing any election or referendum."
 Guyana has supported human rights initiatives in
 international fora. In 1977, the Government ratified
 the following United Nations conventions on human
 rights: the International Covenant on Economic, Social
 and Cultural Rights; the International Convention on
 the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination;
 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights. Guyana is not a member of the Organization of
 American States.
