 ALBANIA
 Albania is a parliamentary republic with a Parliament elected in a seriously
 flawed process. Pending a new constitution, the Law on Major Constitutional Provi-
 sions, which includes a Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms, serves
 in its place. The governing Democratic Party won 122 out of the 140 parliamentary
 seats, an 87.1 percent majority, in flawed multiparty elections in May. The major
 op sitionarty, the Socia list Pty, together with some small center parties, staged
 Sycott of the election process sever  hours before the polls closed, citingreports
 of widespread Government-sponsored fraud, beatings, and intimidation. They re-
 fused to recognize the newly elected Parliament's legitimacy. President Sali Berisha,
 elected by Parliament in 1992, continued his 5-year term. The law provides for the
 separation of powers and an independent judiciary. However, the judicial branch re-
 mains subject to strong executive pressure and corruption.
 Local police detachments reporting to the Ministry of the Interior are principally
 responsible for internal security. In addition to their usual tasks, police were re-
 sponsible for securing order during the parliamentary and local elections in May
 and October respectively. There were numerous allegations of police abuse before,
 during, and after the May elections. In September Parliament passed new legisla-
 tion governing police conduct during the October elections. The Albanian National
 Intelligence Service (SHIK) is legally responsible for both external and domestic in-
 telligence collection and counterintelligence functions. SHIK's internal responsibil-
 ities include gathering information on government corruption and anticonstitutional
 activities in support of law enforcement agencies. Given the activities of the former
 security service (Sigurimi) under the Communists, some citizens perceive SHIK as
 a similar organization and fear it accordingly.
 Albania is a poor country experiencing the painful transition of reform after near-
 ly 50 years of a Stalinist, centrally planned economy. Its economy remains based
 on agriculture, but a rapidly growing commercial and trade sector has taken root
 in cities and larger towns. Construction is the fastest growing sector. There is some
 mining and light manufacturing (clothes, shoes, beverages, and consumer products).
 Most state-owned heavy industry is moribund. The Government continued
 privatizing medium and large state enterprises, a process begun in 1994. Privatiza-
 tion has expanded to many sectors of the economy and continues in the mining, en-
 ergy distribution network, telecommunications, and textiles sectors. Remittances
 from Albanians working abroad and foreign assistance remain major sources of in-
 come. With the lifting of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro at the end of
 1995, the country lost a significant source of hard currency from organized fuel
 smuggling to those countries. Prices for key consumer itms such as bread, elec-
 tricity, and kerosene were freed from state control at midyear, creating additional
 hardships for public sector workers and pensioners on fixed incomes, but moving the
 overall economy toward greater efficiency. Sal  increases and subsidies for public
 secto orkers and those receiving pensions helped offset these increases. Overall
 economic growth remained strong, about 6 percent for the second year in a row. In-
 flation, which was near zero at the end of 1995, was expected to exceed to 20 per-
 cent in 1996, largely as a result of growing government budget deficits. Whileper
 capita gross domestic product reached approximately $650, more than double that
 in 1992, the economic transformation has created an emergng middle class as well
 as widening income disparities. Organized crime has surged. A number of large pyr-
 amid type schemes operate throughout the country, and a significant number of peo-
 ple have deposited money in them. Several of these schemes, including some larger
 ones, collapsed in 1996, causing depositors to lose their funds.
 The Government's human rights record worsened during the year. The flawed
 May elections, coming at a time of further government pressure on the judiciary and
 the press were major steps backwards for democracy. There  e  numerous serious
 (813)
 
 
 814
 
 human rights abuses during the May 26 parliamentary elections and the May 28
 opposition demonstration in protest of those elections. Other serious problems in-
 cluded police killings and beatings; poor prison and pretrial detention conditions-
 harassment of the press; a judiciary that is subject to widespread corruption and
 executive pressure and lacking in resources, training, and experience; and discrimi-
 nation and violence against women. However, the Government took some positive
 steps by ratifying the European Convention on Human Rights, amending the law
 on public meetings, and exempting city and district council candidates from the
 antigenocide and lustration laws for the local elections in October. The Government
 made physical improvements in some prisons, set up courses forprison officials to
 improve treatment of prisoners, introduced training programs an new regulations
 for local police, and prosecuted those who committed abuses against prisoners. The
 Government is working with the Greek Government to assure improved conditions
 for the Greek minority.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was one report of a killing in
 custody.
 Authorities arrested former president Ramiz Alia in February and charged him
 with the internment and imprisonment in concentration camps of thousands of citi-
 zens during the Communist regime. After pretrial detention, the prosecutor added
 other charges: Ordering the killing of people who attempted to leave the country;
 ordering troops and police to fire on the people who toppled the Hoxha monument
 in Tirana; ordering the arming of military students who subsequently killed some
 civilians; and ordering the shootings on April 2, 1991, in Shkodra that left four
 dead. Estimates are that another 6 months of investigation will be needed before
 Alia is brought to trial.
 Unknown persons beat and burned to death a 15-year-old Romani boy (see Section
 5).
 The Government has yet to respond to queries about the status of charges against
 police and prison guards in 1994 deaths in custody of Enrik Islami and Irfan Nano.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms states that "no one can be
 subject to torture, punishment, or cruel and brutal treatment." The Penal Code
 maes the use of torture a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison and pro-
 hibits the use of physical or psychological force during criminal proceedings, with
 penalties for those found guilty of abuse. Police nevertheless continued to beat de-
 tainees, journalists, and political opposition party members, most noticeably around
 the time of the May election campaigns and post-election demonstrations (see Sec-
 tion 3). Except for incidents during the election, many of the beatings appear to be
 random or based on revenge or family blood feuds (usually more common in the
 north but now occurring throughout the country). The Interior Minister opened of-
 fices in the Ministry and local- police stations to deal with citizen complaints and
 instituted human rights training courses for police. The impact of these measures
 remains to be seen.
 Prison conditions do not meet minimum international standards; some are well
 below those levels, but the Government has made a serious effort to improve condi-
 tions in all prisons. Pretrial detention conditions are still poor, particularly hygiene
 and sanitation. The Government transferred responsibility for prisons from the Min-
 istry of Interior to the Ministry of Justice. Two new prisons are under construction
 and were designed using international standards. The Government invested $1.8
 million in improvements at two of the seven existing prisons. The European Union
 (EU) gave the Government 800,000 Ecu to modernize and increase the capacity of
 the prison in Lezha. All prisons now offer water 24 hours a day and allow personal
 furniture. However, severe budget restraints limit the Government's abilities to ad-
 dress all the problems.
 The Ministry instituted new rules for treatment of prisoners and started training
 courses for prison officials and guards, some of whom received additional short-term
 training in Western Europe. There were no reported cases of torture in the prisons.
 Officials now attempt to house those sentenced for violent crimes apart from those
 in prison for minor offenses as well as from those under age 18, but such separation
 is not always possible. According to the Penal Code, military and civilian prisoners
 should be in separate facilities; again, this division is not always followed. New visi-
 tation rules allow a prisoner to meet family members once a week for 30 minutes
 per session, or twice a month in maximum security prison. One conjugal meeting
 
 
 815
 a month is granted for married prisoners. Prisoners can receive items from visitors,
 e.g., food, televisions, radios, or books and newspapers, and use them in their cells.
 Prisoners receive approximately 1 hour of daily physical activity. There is no con-
 firmation that these new regulations are as yet applied throughout the prison sys-
 tem. Reportedly those prisoners with money still can bribe prison officials for better
 treatment and more food.
 According to ministry figures, 35 women are in prison. They are housed in a sepa-
 rate prison in Tirana, and their living conditions are reportedly much better than
 conditions in other prisons, due to funds provided by an Italian charity.
 Official state or nongovernmental organization (NGO) personnel can have unlim-
 ited visitation rights but must first secure permission from the general director of
 prisons. Local NO's usually receive permission.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Pariament approved new penal and
 nal procedure codes based on European standards in 1995and modified them in
 1996. The Penal Procedures Code mandates improved rights for detained and ar-
 rested persons, but the extent to which they are followed inpractice remains un-
 clear. According to the code, a police officer or prosecutor may order a suspect into
 custody. Detained persons must be informed of the charges against them and their
 rights, and, if detained by the polie, a prosecutor must be notified within 12 hours.
 Within 24 hours from the time of arrest or detention a court must decide, in the
 presence of the prosecutor, the suspect, and the suspect's lawyer, if the detainee is
 to be released or charged. Legal counsel must be provided free of charge if the de-
 fendant is unable to afford a private attorney.
 Bail in the form of money or property may be required if it is believed the accused
 may not appear for the hearing, or a suspect may be placed under house arrest. The
 court may order p retrial confinement in cases where there is reason to believe that
 the accused may leave the country or is a danger to society.
 The Penal Pr, ocedures Code requires completion of pretrial investigations within
 3 months. The prosecutor may extend this period by 3-month intervals in especially
 difficult cases. The accused and the injured party have the right to appeal these ex-
 tensions to the district court.
 The Albanian Helsinki Committee (AHC) reports increased complaints received in
 1996 of police violating the law pertaining to search and seizure, detention, interro-
 gation, advice of rights, timely court appearance, and adequate access to defense
 counsel.
 The appeals court has reduced more than a dozen of the sentences given to high-
 level offals found guilty of crimes against humanity in connection with the vast
 network of prisons and labor camps under the Communist regime. The court re-
 duced former chief of the Supreme Court Aranit Cela's and former general prosecu-
 tor Rrapu Mino's death sentences to 25 years in prison each and former head of the
 secret police Zylyfiar Ramizi's to life in prison.  A  ala Court also reduced or
 commuted several other Communist officials' sentences, although the head of the
 Tirana Communist Party Liambi Gegprifti's sentence remains at 20 years. On De-
 cember 29, the President issued a decree reducing in part or all of the sentences
 of 102 persons in prison for various charges. The times reduced ranged from 6
 months to 6 years off an individual's sentence. Former prime minister Fatos Nano's
 sentence was reduced by 6 months under this deree  ee setSection i.e.).
 The law does not provide for and the Government does not employ exile as a form
 of punishment or political conrol.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Triae.mThe Law on Major Constitutional Provisions pro-
 vides for an independent judiciary, but the judiciary is hampered by political pres-
 sures, insufficient resources, inexperience, patronage, and corruption. The Par-
 liament approved new civil, penal, and labor codes and new penal procedures in
 1995.
 The judicial system &~mprises the courts of first instance (also known as district
 courts), the Courts of Appeals, and the Court of Cassation (also known as the High
 Court or Supreme Court). Each of these courts is divided into three jurisdictions:
 Criminal, civil and military. The Court of Casation hears appeals from the Court
 of Appeals, wh'ile a Constitutional Court decides those cases requiring interpretation
 of constitutional legislation or acts.
 The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the right to
 a fair and speedy trial. However, there have been delays in bringing some cases to
 court. The law also mandates public trials, except in cases in which the interests
 of public order, morality, national security, the privat lives of the parties, or justice
 require restrictions. If convicted, the accused has the right to appeal the decision
 within 5 days to the Court of Appeals and again to the Court of Cassation, which
 renders the final verdict. The law does not specify any time period within which the
 Court of Appeals or the Court of Cassation musthear a peals.
 
 
 816
 The Parliament has the authority to approve and dismiss judges of the Constitu-
 tional Court (9 members, of which the Parliament nominates 5 and the President
 4) and the Cassation Court (11 members, which Parliament nominates. The Presi-
 dent nominates the chairman and the two deputies subject to parliamentary ap-
 proval Cassation judges may be dismissed only for mental incompetence or convic-
 tion of a serious crime. Constitutional Court justices serve maximum 9-year terms,
 rotating in three new justices every 3 years. Cassation Court judges are elected for
 7-year terms. The President heads the Supreme Judicial Council which appoints
 and dismisses all other judges. According to its internal statute, the Supreme Judi-
 cial Council has broad powers to fire, demote, transfer, and otherwise discipline dis-
 trict and a p peals court judges for incompetene, ommission of a serious crime, or
 questionable morality. The composition of the Supreme Judicial Council and its
 broad authority subjects the courts to direct executive branch control. Judges are
 not always notified in advance of disciplinary proceedings underway against them
 and often are not given the opportunity to present facts in their defense.
 In 1996 the Council removed 17 judges from their positions for disciplinary rea-
 sons based on the 1992 law "On the Organization of the Judiciary," which sanctions
 removal on the decision of the Supreme Judicial Council for violation of the law,
 rules and procedures, corruption, and meting out light sentences for serious crimes.
 Reasons cited for removing the 17 included falsifying documents, delaying proce-
 dures giving light sentences, and taking bribes. Judges may also be removed for
 poor health, failure to pass the periodic professional test, or discipline or moral
 problems. Many lawyers report that loyalty to the ruling Democratic Party is a key
 prerequisite in selecting replacements. Judges' salaries are low, and there are wide-
 spread accusations of corruption. The Justice Ministry claims that it investigates all
 Charges.
 The Parliament approves the court budgets. Administration of courts' budgets was
 transferred from the Ministry of Justice to the courts, although the Ministry still
 provides and approves administrative and support personnel.
 The Parliament appoints the chief prosecutor and the two deputies on the rec-
 ommendation of the President. They may be dismissed only for mental incompetence
 or conviction of a serious crime. To improve the judicial system, the Parliament
 passed a law in July to establish a magistrates' school, a government-subsidized in-
 stitution to assure the professional training of judges and prosecutors. The program
 is expected to include mandatory initial training of candidates for magistrate posi-
 tions as well as a program for the continuing education of magistrates. One seminar
 took place in November. Regular classes are scheduled to begin in October 1997.
 The Council of Europe and foreign NGO's are working with the Government to
 print and distribute the penal codes and laws from Parliament throughout the coun-
 try. Many courtrooms, however, are still without updated versions of many of the
 laws and codes.
 On February 14, the Constitutional Court ruled that the September 1995 dismis-
 sal by the Parliament of the former Chief Justice of the Court of Cassation, Zef
 Brozi-which became a major political issue-was legal, because Brozi had commit-
 ted serious criminal offenses. Although Brozi had not been charged with a specific
 crime, the court held in its decision that the Parliament acted reasonably and that
 the unconstitutionality of Brozi's actions, e.g., in suspending the execution of certain
 decisions, was sufficient to constitute a serious criminal offense. Numerous domestic
 and international observers believe that Brozi's actions did not provide legal
 grounds for removal, that he was removed to subordinate the Court to the executive,
 and that the Government falsified the parliamentary vote to do so, actions all moti-
 vated by political reasons, including Brozi's attempt to reopen the Fatos Nano case.
 Nano, Socialist Party chairman and former prime minister, was convicted on
 charges of corruption. However, many observers believe Nano was imprisoned be-
 cause he was President Berisha's principal political opponent.
 Members of the opposition and human rights NGO's claimed that some persons
 being held on criminal charges are actually political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms Provides for the inviolability of
 dwellings and the individual person, as well as the privacy of correspondence. There
 have been credible reports of government-sanctioned tampering with correspondence
 and wiretapping or interference with telephone service.
 In January the Constitutional Court ruled that the genocide law and the law on
 the verification of the character of officials (lustration law) were legal. The law had
 the effect of exempting President Berisha and many of his chief aides, also former
 Communists.
 Under the provisions of the genocide and lustration laws, the Government exam-
 ined the files of political candidates in the May parliamentary elections. The 1995
 
 
 817
 Law on Genocide and Crimes against Humanity Committed during the Communist
 Regime prohibits any persons who were senior government officials, members of the
 secret police, or secret police collaborators before March 1991 from holding high-
 ranking state positions or being elected as Members of Parliament until the year
 2002. The lustration law allows examination of the former secret police files to de-
 termine the rights of individuals under the genocide law. The Special Commission
 (Verification Committee) set up to review these files consists of 7 individuals: The
 Council of Ministers appinted two members; the Minister of Justice, the Minister
 of Defense, Minister of the Interior, and the head of the National Intelligence Serv-
 ice each appointed one member, and the Parliament elected the chairman. The oppo-
 sition parties were able to participate only in a limited and inadequate way, through
 their minority in the Parliament, in the selection of and actions of the Commission.
 The executive branch effectively controlled the Commission and gave it the powers
 to judge, in closed session, decisions based on secret files that were not open for re-
 view to the general public, but that were available to the candidates and their law-
 yers for examination. The executive branch also had the final say in the decisions;
 the Prime Minister, Minister of Interior, and the head of SHIK had the right to ap-
 pear before the Commission and take part in the decision in any case on the basis
 of state security interests.
 Under these laws, the Commission banned 139 individuals from participating in
 the May parliamentary elections. Of those banned, 45 were members of the Socialist
 Party, 23 were Social Democrats, 11 were from the Democratic Alliance, 13 from the
 Republican Party, 3 from the Democratic Party, and the rest from minor parties.
 According to the law, these individuals had the right to appeal the Commission's
 decision to the Court of Cassation. Only 57 appealed and the Court overturned 7
 decisions. The Albanian Helsinki Committee contends that the entire process vio-
 lated Albanian and international law by failing to grant prospective candidates the
 right to due process. All court sessions were closed to observers and the media.
 There were complaints that the time for appeal was too limited, and several deci-
 sions came after the time limit had passed for candidates to file for the election.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and
 Freedoms provides for freedom of speech and the press. In practice, however, the
 Government sometimes restricted freedom of speech, including the freedom to criti-
 cize the Government and its officials. In some cases, the Government used laws
 against slander, insult, incitement to national hatred, and distribution of
 anticonstitutional literature to prosecute persons, especially journalists, for critical
 commentary.
 Although financial and judicial harassment of journalists increased, particularly
 at the time of the May elections, the print media remain willing and able to criticize
 the Government. Publications in general, however, are hampered by small circula-
 tion and limited revenue. Taxes on publications, in addition to rising printing costs,
 made it difficult for independent media to be economically viable without subsidies
 or loans from their patrons, e.g., political parties, trade unions, social organizations,
 or private businesses. Their dependence on outside sources for revenue leads to
 pressures that limit the independence of reporting. Some journalists believe that the
 Government is using excessive taxation as a deliberate means to cripple the inde-
 pendent and opposition press. On December 24 President Berisha told the heads of
 the main newspapers that he would lower some taxes and levies. At year's end, the
 reductions had not yet been implemented. Between 150 to 250 different publications
 are nevertheless available. Three Greek minority newspapers are published in
 southern Albania.
 A 1993 press law assesses large fires for publishing material that the Govern-
 ment considers secret or sensitive, permits confiscation of printed matter or property
 by judicial order, and allows for criminal punishment under certain circumstances.
 The media and the AHC denounce the press law as being too imprecise and too
 harsh for a country with poorly developed legal institutions. Under this law and
 general criminal laws journalists have been beaten, detained, arrested, fined, and
 jailed, although most sentences are reduced to fines.
 Government officials invoked libel laws as well as the press law against journal-
 ists. The Government prosecuted one reporter and teacher, Ylli Polovina, accusing
 him on state television of provoking a car bombing through an article he wrote fol-
 lowing the October 3, 1995, assassination attempt on the president of the former
 Yugosav Republic of Macedonia. The article deplored the attack and stated that in
 the Balkans corruption and political oppression are dangerous and should be fixed
 before they lead to another such extreme result. In January there was an assassina-
 tion attempt against Tirana's head judge. In February a car bomb exploded in front
 
 
 818
 of a Tirana grocery store killing four people. Polovina was taken from his home 6
 hours after the bombing incident, held for 12 days, brought to trial, and convicted
 of instigating the violence through his article, fined $300, and released. He was fired
 from his teaching job but was later given another teaching job in a small village
 after he wrote a public letter to the President.
 The newspaper Koha Jone (KJ), which has the country's largest circulation, as
 well as other opposition papers, accused the Government of systematic harassment,
 e.g., through higher taxes and increased printing charges. Reporters claim regular
 harassment from police and threats from unknown individuals. Police confiscated
 eight of NJ's cars for various reasons, such as no license, no documentation or hav-
 ing tinted windows. Police later returned six cars to the newspaper. KJ's tefephones
 were disconnected from April 14 to December 8, ostensibly for technical reasons. Al-
 legedly based on two separate eyewitnesses who placed a KJ employee near the
 scene of the February car bombing in Tirana, police detained the entire KJ staff,
 including drivers and janitorial staff. Koha Jone reporters say that they suffered
 physical harassment, including a relatively serious beating of one KJ reporter by
 persons unknown eariy in the May election campaign. Several newspapers com-
 plained that telephone/fax lines were cut for 2 or more months during the campaign.
 Opposition newspapers reported that polie blocked cars and impounded copies of
 their newspapers before the May elections.
 Police clubbed several journalists, including some foreign reporters, and con-
 fiscated cameras and film during the post-parliamentary election demonstration in
 Tirana on May 28. Assailants almost killed one independent journalist, Bardhok
 Lala, who was still in serious condition at year's end from the beating he received.
 State-run radio and television are the main sources of domestic news for the vast
 majority of people, giving the Government a near-monopoly on domestic news.
 State-owned television relays international entertainment and news broadcasts in
 some cities. Home satellite dishes are common, and most Albanians, even in remote
 villages, have access to international broadcasts. There is still no law on private
 radio and television broadcasting, but there are at least four "pirate" private radio
 stations. The Government has temporarily closed some stations-but generally allows
 stations to operate provided they do not heavily criticize the Government.
 Since November 1991, the Parliament has exercised direct control over television,
 delegating some oversight duties to an Executive Committee of Radio and Tele-
 vision, which it appoints. The Executive Committee comprises 11 members from out-
 side the Parliament and meets occasionally to review programming and the content
 of news broadcasts. This gives control of programming effectively to the Democratic
 Party. International observers and opposition critics noted, for example, that the
 Government-run television was used to serve the interests of the Democratic Party
 during the May parliamentary election campaign and its aftermath. Parliament
 amended the local election law in September to provide a new formula for equal
 media time dedicated to the campaign (50 percent for the Government and 50 per-
 cent for all opposition parties) during the October local elections.
 Local radio in the south broadcasts some Greek-language programming, with its
 content translated directly from Albanian lan age reporting. Also widely listened
 to are stations from Greece, the FYROM, the Brtish Broadcasting Corporation, and
 Voice of America radio.
 The AHC has criticized the Government's infringement of academic freedom. Al-
 though student newspapers do not exist, there is a relatively new independent stu-
 dent union. However, the university system still operates with a number of its
 former faults intact. Grade corruption is widespread, a large percentage of the stu-
 dent body bypasses exams and enters university via political means, and decisions
 are thoroughly centralized. There are reports that political criteria figure promi-
 nently in the tenuring and promotion of professors. Ten professors who were opposi-
 tion members of the 1992-96 parliament have not been allowed to return to their
 jobs after they lost their seats in the May elections.
 Local and foreign observers reported a growing climate of apprehension in the
 universities in the last quarter of the year. In November a number of foreign profes-
 sors were removed from their teaching positions, ostensibly for lack of contracts of
 formal sponsorship by a foreign university. Efforts to return these teachers to the
 classroom continued at year's end. There is no change in the status of the eight edu-
 cators fired last year under an amendment to the Labor Code permitting the release
 of employees accused of obstructing democratic and economic reforms.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Law on Fundamental
 Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the right of peaceful assembly. However,
 the Government places some limitations on this right. Many in the opposition par-
 ties complained about restrictions on campaign rallies and gatherings before and
 after the May 26 parliamentary elections. To address those complaints, in Septem-
 
 
 819
 her the Parliament passed a new law to replace the 1991 decree on public gather-
 in owever there are still some limitations on the right of assembly. For gatherings
 in public places, organizers must request permission from the chief of police in the
 locality ofthe planned rally at least 3 days prior to the event. The chief of police
 must issue his decision, with explanations for any refusal, no later than 24 hours
 prior to the event. The police may refuse the permit in cases when the rally may
 violate human rihts and freedoms; traffic obstruction may become a problem; there
 is sufficient evidence that violent or criminal acts may occur, if another raly is
 planned for the same time; or if it would interfere with a national event, e.g, a kres-
 idential speech. No advance official permission is now required for meetings held
 in closed nonpublic places. The police no longer have the authority to preapprove
 speech or slogan content.
 Under the September law, police have the authority to be present during any law-
 ful rally in a public place and are authorized to disperse the participants if the rally
 calls for anticonstitutional actions or incites calls for violence. If the participants do
 not disperse, the chief of police or authorized representative may order their disper-
 sion b force after the police issue a warning. The law provides that the police
 shoul avoid the use of force wherever possible, but if force is used, it should be
 limited to the minimum necessary for the situation. Under the new laws, the opposi-
 tion parties freely organized rallies during the October local election campaign, al-
 though some problems were reported.
 The Socialist Party applied for permission under the 1991 meetings law to hold
 a gathering in Tirana's main square on May 28 to protest the conditions of the May
 26 parliamentary elections but was refused by the police. The opposition parties
 nevertheless called for the meeting to be held in the square and urged members to
 attend.
 The Government contends the resultant rally was illegal. The police severely beat
 a number of opposition leaders and their supporters as well as journalists and on-
 lookers in the square. Some were arrested and mistreated at police stations. The
 Government admitted that the olice actions were excessive, but the Interior Min-
 istry blamed the opposition for inciting the initial police reactions. After conducting
 an investigation, the Ministry claimed that two high ministry officials and five po-
 lice officials were fired. The police also took disciplinary action against officers 'To
 used excessive violence, and the prosecutor has filed criminal charges against a
 large number of these officers, although the disposition of these cases has not been
 ascertained.
 The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the right of
 association and states that "no one may be denied the right to collective organiza-
 tion for any lawful purpose." A political party must apply to the Ministry of Justice
 for official certification. It must declare an aim or purpose that is not
 anticonstitutional or contrary to law, and it must describe its organizational struc-
 ture and account for all public and private funds that it receives. In 1995 the Min-
 istry of Justice denied such certification for the Party of the Democratic Ideal, using
 the argument that the party's progam 'is no different from the programs of other
 parties      it is not likely that the problems in these areas (economic and politi-
 cal) will be solved with other alternatives outside of those of the parties already reg-
 istered in any fundamental way." The Ministry of Justice also confirmed that it re-
 fused certification because it considered some of the points in the party's program
 against the national interest, e.g., advocating a greater Albania by all means nec-
 essary, including force. The party apaled its case to the Court of Cassation, which
 invaldated the Ministry's decision. There were no other cases in 1996.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms
 states that "the freedom of thought, conscience, and religion may not be violated.
 Citizens may change freely change their religion or beliefs and ma manifest them
 alone or in community with others, and in public or in private life, in worship,
 teaching, practice, and observance." The Government respects these provisions in
 practice.
 The majority of Albanians are secular in orientation after nearly 45 years of se-
 vere religious persecution and 25 years of rigidly enforced atheism. The largest tra-
 ditional religious group, Muslims, follow moderate forms of Islam. The other large
 traditions are the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox and Roman Catholic. The Alba-
 nian Orthodox Church split from the Greek Orthodox Church in 1922, and there is
 a strong identification with the national church as distinct from the Greek church.
 The current archbishop is Greek because there are no Albanian monks qualified for
 this position, and two Greek priests serve as his assistants. One Greek priest trav-
 els to Gjirkaster on a regular basis to teach. Other priests from Greece come on
 a rotating basis to teach and augment the indigenous clergy of the Albanian Ortho-
 
 
 820
 dox Church in the Greek-speaking congregations primarily in the south. There are
 three Greek nuns in Tirana. Foreign clergy, including Muslim clerics, Christian, and
 Baha'i missionaries, freely carry out religious activities. The Minister of Culture es-
 timates that 15 different Muslim societies and sects and approximately 80 Christian
 societies and sects are active in Albania. The Government considers some of these
 groups to be of dubious origins, and some Orthodox Church leaders have accused
 certain groups of being responsible for a number of suspicious activities such as de-
 stroying Orthodox icons, spying, or setting fire to a Greek school. No substantiating
 evidence is available in any of those cases. The Government lacks control over these
 groups and has little accurate information about most of them.
 A small but growing Protestant evangelical ommunity desires official government
 recognition and representation in the religious affairs section of the Council of Min-
 isters. A Protestant umbrella organization, the Albanian Evangelical Alliance, com-
 plains that Protestant grups have encountered some admimistrative obstacles to
 building churches and obtaining access to the national media.
 A religious affairs section in the Council of Ministers oversees the activities of the
 religious communities. The ministers decided in January that 21 religious sites (18
 orthodox Churches, 2 mosques and 1 Catholic Church) were cultural properties that
 required special protection. These sites are from a list of 175 religious cultural ob-
 jects and edifices, of which 140 are churches (mostly Orthodox). According to the de-
 cision, each religious community must negotinte an agreement with the Institute for
 Cultural Monuments to decide how often religious services will be allowed in each
 of the 21 old buildings to protect them from deterioration and the theft of icons and
 other artistic treasures. The director of the Institute said that the Government re-
 tains many icons for safekeeping. It returned some objects to the churches, but some
 churches also asked the Government to keep them because they had no way to se-
 cure them safely. The Orthodox Church, however, has complained to the Govern-
 ment because the authorities have dragged their heels on returning some objects
 turned over for restoration and safekeeping. President Berisha promised to return
 to churches and mosques the land they owned prior to state confiscation or, in cases
 where it is impossible to return the original land, to compensate the church with
 money or another piece of land. The Government has not yet returned all lands but
 this spring successfully completed the turnover of all the buildings at Ardenitsa to
 the Albaman Orthodox Church. Restitution of religious properties to the respective
 religions is a long, difficult, and delicate process  a  religion is slowly recovering
 old proertie, but in cases where the monuments were "cultural monuments pro-
 tected by the state" or military objects, transfer of ownership is problematic and
 slow.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the country.
 Albanian-born citizens in all foreign countries are eligible to apply for dual citizen-
 ship. Since the downfall of the Communist regime, hundreds of thousands of eco-
 nomic migrants have left. Most go to Greece or Italy, many entering those countries
 illegally. Their remittances are an important economic factor. Albanians who fled
 the country during the Communist dictatorship are welcomed back with citizenship
 restored.
 There is a significant influx of refugees from Kosovo. Young men from Kosovo
 come to Albania and stay to avoid the Serbian draft. The Government has no formal
 refugee policy. The transit of refugees without visas is also problematic, especially
 of Kurds, Pakistanis, Chinese, Turks, and others from the Middle East and Asia on
 their way to Western Europe, usually through the port at Vlora. The Government
 did not forcibly expel anyone who had a valid claim to refugee status. The United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in conjunction with the Alba-
 nian Red Cross, runs a "care and maintenance" program for what they consider
 "vulnerable" groups, i.e., those who arrive in Albania and cannot return to where
 they came from or continue further. The UNHCR office in Tirana assesses refugee
 cases and approves grants of money, shelter, and food for those considered to meet
 refugee criteria.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions states that citizens have the right
 to change their governmnent "by free, general, equal, direct, and secret ballot." P~ar-
 liamentary elections were held on May 26, and local elections, which were not near-
 t as plitically significant, were held on Otober 20. International observers judged
 the May parliamentary elections to be seriously flawed. The opposition parties,
 claiming massive fraud and manipulation, withdrew from the elections several
 
 
 821
 hours before the pUs closed and subsequently boycotted the second round of elec-
 tions June 2 and the reruns of individual races held on June 16.
 Numerous irregularities marred the elections and represent a significant step
 backward from the previous parliamentary elections in 1992. Various observers wit-
 nessed instances in which the authorities violated the electoral laws, including the
 manipulations of vote counts and the casting by single voters of multiple ballots.
 The intimidating presence of armed guards at some polling stations also has been
 repo rted. Irre  arities have been acknowledged by the authorities themselves.
 However, the premature withdrawal of opposition party candidates and their
 members of the electoral commissions--who claimed they were threatened with vio-
 lence-also made it difficult to gauge the true dimension of problems subsequently
 observed during the vote count. The Council of Europe (COE) and the Organization
 for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) asked for a repeat of the awed par-
 liamet    ary letio.                                             i      ar
 The 0SCE parliamentary report concluded that "Albanian legislation provides
 conditions for free and fair elections. However, the law on gocide includes proce-
 dures which cannot be considered fair and transparent. It also includes stipulations
 which limit the electorate's options to freely choose their candidates. During the
 campaign authorities did not always act in an unbiased manner. There also ap-
 peared to be confusion concerning some decisions, or lack of decisions, on behalf of
 the Central Election Commission in the management of the process. Procedures in
 the polling stations were, in general, in accordance with the law. There were, how-
 ever, a number of irregularities and technical shortcomings. The state-owned media
 was not entirely unbiased." The OSCE report also said that "The political environ-
 ment appeared to have deteriorated after the first round of the elections. This di-
 minished the integrity of the second round and also undermines the credibility of
 the democratic process in the country.* * *"
 The OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) pub-
 lished a separate final statement on the May elections. It concluded that "although
 the lawfulness of the newly elected Albanian Parliament cannot be questioned, the
 electoral process included several aspects and incidents which severely question the
 credibility of the democratic process in the country. The Government and all parties
 alike share responsibility in this matter." The OSCE and ODIHR each offered a list
 of recommendations to improve the electoral procedure.
 The Albanian Helsinki Committee also issued a critical report on the parliamen-
 tary election process. It outlined the obstacles facing the opposition during the cam-
 paign, especially government control of the media and actions against the opposition
 when it attempted to hold rallies, leading to the problems on election day. The Gov-
 ernment did not give official permission for the AHC to monitor the elections. The
 Government made it difficult for other domestic observers, particularly those from
 the Society for Democratic Culture (SDC), to get credentials. Some government offi-
 cials claim that the AHC and the SDC submitted some names and information
 about potential observers too late for processing. The AHC said that the
 progovernmentpress tried to discredit the committee as "a tool in the hands of the
 Socialist Party. The AHC reported that the police intimidated and beat opposition
 party local electoral commission members as well as some voters, forcibly removed
 opposition party observers from polling stations, and harassed or attacked some op-
 position candidates. In addition the AHC accused "secret agents and government ap-
 pointees of the electoral commissions" of "brutally" violating the electoral law. The
 AHO and the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights (1HF) issued a
 joint evaluation on June 6. They called for the Government, the OSCE, the COE,
 and the United Nations to declare the elections invald. They recommended new
 elections, an investigation of electoral fraud and police violence, and a separation
 of powers within the Government. The report condemned government control of the
 media, government interference in the work of NGO's in the country, and the vio-
 lent actions of police forces during the May 28 demonstration and during other at-
 tempts of the opposition to meet, Committee members wrote that "human rights vio-
 lations before, during, and after the Albanian parliamentary elections on 26 May
 and 2 June 1996 have seriously compromised free and fair elections and signifi-
 cantly undermined the development of just democratic institutions in transition Al-
 bania. Ballot stuffing, multiple voting, voter list manipulation and police intimida-
 tion and violence have all contributed to violating the constitutional right of the Al-
 banian people to freely and fairly elect their political representatives. These viola-
 tions call into question the willingness of the Government to abide by the rule of
 law and ensure that political processes occur in conformity to Albanian and inter-
 national law.* * *"
 During the campaign numerous opposition party members and credible eye-
 witnesses reported police restrictions on their campaign activities, e.g., preventing
 
 
 822
 rallies and beatings. The worst violence occurred on May 28 during a post-election
 opposition party rally (see Section 2.b.)
 The Democratic Party won 122 of 140 seats in the Parliament. President Sali
 Berisha insists that the election was valid and that the current Parliament is rep-
 resentative of the will of the people. The Socialist Party won only 10 parliamentary
 seats and refused as a party to enter Parliament, which it considers illegitimate.
 One of the Socialist candidates nevertheless took his seat, but the Party states that
 individual does not represent it.
 International observers judged the October 20 local elections to be an improve-
 ment over the May 26 parliamentary elections, although some irregularities were
 observed. The major political parties met in roundtable discussions prior to the local
 elections, and these sessions led to significant changes in the local election law, the
 rules governing the conduct of the police during the voting, and in access to tele-
 vision time during the campaign. Enactment of a new law on meetings and gather-
 ings, designed to eliminate the abuses encountered in the May parliamentary cam-
 paign, was largely successful.
 The Government took a number of steps apparently designed to hamper both local
 and international monitoring efforts. Age qualifications for monitors were raised
 from 18 to 25. This had the effect of eliminating the vast majority of university stu-
 dents as monitors. It also created a situation in which persons old enough to vote,
 serve on election commissions, and hold elective office were disqualified as observ-
 ers. Due to disagreement with some provisions in ODIHR's report on the May elec-
 tions, the Government initially refused to allow ODIRR to send any monitors for
 the October elections. The Government later modified its decision, but sought to vet
 the names of the observers and limit their number to 15, a number ODIR consid-
 ered insufficient to do the job effectively. As a result, ODIHR did not send any ob-
 servers. The EU denounced the lack of Government cooperation with ODIHR. The
 COE and several EU-member governments sent monitors for the local elections.
 The COE described the elections as "sufficiently free and fair to be accepted as
 a reliable expression of the inhabitants' preference for their future mayor or head
 of commune, and agreed that these elections are a definite step in the right direc-
 tion." Other international observer groups issued similar statements. While opposi-
 tion politicians did not explicitly accept the elections as "free and fair," they gen-
 erally acknowledged that the Government's actions before, during, and after the Oc-
 tober elections were a substantial improvement over its actions in regard to the May
 elections. Some of the problems included accuracy of the voting lists, ballot box
 stuffing, and altered vote counts. The Democratic Pay won more than 80 percent
 of the local offices. The opposition acknowledged the victory, although it did not con-
 cede all the vote totals The Goverent never published the voting protocols as re-
 quired by the election law. The opposition cited as an additional problem low turn-
 out among its supporters because of lack of confidence in the process due to the
 events in May.
 Although there are no legal impediments to their participation and their numbers
 are slowly increasing, women are still underrepresented in politics and government.
 According to women's groups, 18 women are members of Parliament, 2 are Min-
 isters, 2 are State Secretaries, at least 1 is a Deputy Minister. The major political
 parties have women's organizations, and a few women sit on the parties' leadership
 committees. Reportediy some women discovered that their names were printed on
 ballots in the May elections without their knowledge or consent.
 The 1992 Law on Political Parties prohibits the formation of any party or organi-
 zation with an antinational, chauvinistic, racist, totalitarian, Fascist, Stalnist,
 "Enverist" or Communist, or Marxist-Leninist character or any politicalparty with
 an ethnic or religious basis. The Unity for Human Rights Party, founded by ethnic
 Greeks but representing several ethnic minorities, is most popular in the south
 where the majority of the Greek minority resides. There are three Human Rights
 Party members of Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally permitted various human rights and related organiza-
 tions to function freely. Some organizations noted that while they were able to oper-
 ate and on occasion cooperate with the Government, they were harassed and intimi-
 dated once they had made direct criticisms of the Government. Some groups com-
 plained that the Government failed to respond to written requests for information
 or data that would normally be considered of a public nature. The AHC, the major
 human rights monitoring organization, took an active role in defending human
 rights in certain areas, particularly during and after the May parliamentary elec-
 tions. The AHC believes that it was unable to function this year as freely and indis-
 
 
 criminately as in the past. Representatives complain that the Committee has be-
 come the target of criticism in progovernment newspapers and verbal attacks by
 government officials. Besides the election, the AHC focuses on the status of minor-
 ties, rule of law issues, the importance of a new constitution and is pressing for
 amendments to the law on the organization of the national intelligence service.
 Several new domestic NGO's focus on the rights of women and children. The Alba-
 nian Human Rights Documentation Center continues to be active in preparing
 human rights educational materials to be used in elementary and secondary schools.
 It has a library that attempts to keep current on the most important human rights
 issues. Like most domesticNO's, the Center's work is hampered by a lack of suffi-
 cient funds and equipment. The Society for Democratic Culture works on civic edu-
 cation, monitoring e ections, and women's issues. Progovernment newspapers criti-
 cized the SDC's director, and several individuals, including a member of the Central
 Election Commission, reportedly verbally threatened her following the release of the
 Society's report critical of the May 26 elections.
 Delegations from the COE, the OSCE, OSCE's ODIHR, and the European Par-
 liament made several visits to observe and evaluate the May parliamentary elec-
 tions and assist in preparation for the October local elections. Representatives of the
 OSCE's Office of the High Commissioner for National Minorities also visited to con-
 fer with political officials and representatives of the ethnic Greek community.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions prohibits discrimination based on
 sex, race, ethnicity, language, or religion, but women and some minority groups
 complained of discrimination in practice.
 Womens.-Women's groups report that spousal abuse in this traditional, male-
 dominated society, continued to be common and is generally treated by police as a
 family matter. However, there was an increase in cases reported to the authorities.
 There is no government-sponsored program that protects the rights of women, nor
 are there any shelters for abused women. Many men, especially those from the
 north, still follow the old traditions of law in which women are considered as chattel
 and treated as such. The concept of marital rape is still foreign to many; it is not
 considered a crime and is not reported. A recent report indicated that divorce is on
 the rise, and that women now initiate around 70 percent oef th divorce cases.
 Some women, either voluntarily or by force, participate in prostitution rings and
 other criminal aciiti   ies.
 The situation of women improved dur n  the last year, b ut overall it remains in-
 adequate. There are currently 26 NGO's devoted to women's issues, and some are
 starting to coordinate with each other. They organize seminars, training courses,
 and counseling for women throughout the country. Although most are located in
 Tirana, the larger grups are starting to establish branches outside the major cities.
 International foundaions and NGO's provide expertise and support, and as a result
 the women's NGO's are getting stronger. Some women have organized their own
 reundtables for discussion of issues. Women are now doing research on a number
 of problems, e.g., the need for a law on domestic violence and the position of women
 in society in relation to land ownership. They plan to lobby the Parliament to pass
 laws on these and other issues and have already successfully lobbied legislators to
 pass a law relating to land inheritance. In January the Parliament passed a law
 on reproductive rights.
 Women involved in these groups believe that communications have improved be-
 tween the Government and the NGO's, but old prejudices and attitudes still remain.
 In January the Government established a "Women and Family Department" in the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs with the intent to create a networ& of offices
 to address social problems around the country. Some women claim, however, that
 the department is not really focused on women's rights so much as social protection
 in general and that it has not produced any concrete results. The Government also
 created a new Department for Women's Issues in the Ministry of Culture, Sports,
 and Youth, but women say that its aims are unclear. Female members of Par-
 liament do not usually independently contact women's NGO's, but some have been
 responsive when NGO's take the initiative.
 Women are not restricted, either by law or practice, from any occupations but do
 not typically rise to the top of their fields. The Labor Code mandates equal pay for
 equal       While no data are available on whether women receive equal ay for
 equal work, public sector wage scales are based on rank and duties, not sex. Women
 have suffered more from unemployment and discrimination in seeking jobs. Al-
 though women enjoy equal access to higher education, they are not accorded full,
 equal opportunity and treatment with men in their careers. An increasing number
 
 
 824
 of women is beginning to open shops and small businesses. Many are migrating
 along with men to Greece and Italy to seek employment.
 Children.-The Government's commitment to children's rights and welfare is
 based on domestic law and international agreements. Attendance at school is man-
 datory through the eighth grade (or age 18, whichever comes first); the Government
 has adopted measures to discourage truancy, but these measures in many areas are
 not very successful.
 Child abuse is a little-reported problem, but the authorities and NGO's believe
 that it exists. There have been two publicized cases in which men were convicted
 of the sexual abuse of children. One was sentenced to 18 months and the other to
 2 years in prison. There are numerous reports that organized criminal elements kid-
 nap children, especially young girls, and send them to Italy and elsewhere to work
 as beggars and prostitutes. Romani children in particular are used as beggars, in
 full view of the police who take no action either to assist the children or against
 the adults who use them. Child Hope, an international NGO, operates a center for
 street children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no law mandating accessibility to public build-
 ing for people with disabilities, and little has been done on their behalf.
 Widespread poverty and the poor quality of medical care account for a large num-
 ber of disabled persons. The disabled are eligible for various forms of public assist-
 ance, but budgetary constraints limit the amount received. The public care section
 of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs has set up a network of social service
 administrators throughout the country whose goal is to improve the quality of serv-
 ices to disabled persons and promote their social integration rather than institu-
 tionalization. Donations from abroad have led to improvements in living conditions
 in some institutions, especially in Korea and Durres. In Lezha a daycare center for
 the disabled was opened. This center works to help integrate the disabled into their
 families. Oxfam, a British NGO, helped open a workshop to employ the disabled.
 National lRacial /Ethnic Minorities.-While no recent official statistics exist re-
 garding the size of the various ethnic communities, ethnic Greeks are the most orga-
 nized and receive the most attention and assistance from abroad. The Greek minor-
 ity, which according to the AHC "is an integral part of the Albanian society," is con-
 centrated in the south and numbers, by official estimates, 80,000 people. Greek ni-
 nority sources' estimates run as high as 200,000 people. The numbers are always
 varying because of the continuous movement of a portion of the population back and
 forth between Albania and Greece. In the eastern p art of the country are a few
 thousand ethnic Macedonians and in the north a small grup of ethnic
 Montnegrins. There are no reports of discrimination against the Vlach, who speak
 Romanian as well as Albanian, or against the Cams (ethnic Albanians from north-
 ern Greece).
 Relations between Albania and Greece improved, and in March the two Govern-
 ments signed a treaty of cooperation and friendship. This treaty led to a number
 of agreements on the key issues of Albanian immigration to Greece and Greek lan-
 guage education in Albania, as well as agrements on other issues. The Government
 opened three new first-year classes in the Greek language in the southern cities of
 Saranda, Gjirokaster, and Delvina when the new school year started in September.
 The AHC concluded in a recent report that the rights of the ethnic Greek minority
 had "reached a new (positive) dimension," and that the Greek minority was "an inte-
 gral part" of Albanian society.
 There is an association which claims to represent more than 100,000 Roma
 throughout Albania. There was one reported incident in July in which a group of
 young men of unknown ethnicity beat and then burned to death a 15-year-old
 Romani boy. The AHC strongly condemned the incident and asked the general pros-
 ecutor to undertake a full investigation. Action remained pending at year's end. The
 ARC fears any revival of racism, which is now uncommon.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to create independent trade
 unions, and the Independent Confederation of Trade Unions of Albania (BSPSH)
 acts as the umbrella organization for a number of smaller unions. A separate rival
 federation continues to operate in close cooperation with the Socialist Party. There
 are also some independent unions not affiliated with either federation. The private
 sector employs more than 800,000 workers, mostly in agriculture, small shops, en-
 terprises, and restaurants, but very few of them have formed unions to represent
 themselves.
 According to the Law on Major Constitutional Provisions and other legislation, all
 workers, with the exception of uniformed military, police, and some court authori-
 ties, have the right to strike. The law forbids strikes that are openly declared to
 
 
 825
 be political, or so judged by the courts. Public workers staged a peaceful 1-hour
 "warning' strike on September 16 to protest a lack of government subsidies to com-
 pensate for the new, higher prices of essential goods such as bread, gas, and ker-
 osene. The Government previously offered to pay public sector employees and pen-
 sioners a supplement to cover the rising costs, but the amount was deemed inad-
 equate. The average family spends $20 to 25 per month on bread, which remains
 the diet staple. Workers staged a peaceful 1-day walkout on October 4 and threat-
 ened an indefinite walkout in the future if the Government did not increase wages
 or subsidies. In December, Prime Minister Meksi signed an agreement with the
 largest confederation of independent trade unions to index wages to inflation.
 Labor federations are free to maintain ties with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.--Citizens in all fields of em-
 ployment, except uniformed members of the armed forces, police officers and some
 court employees, have the right to organize and bargain collectively. In practice,
 unions representing public sector employees negotiate directly with the Government.
 Wages for all state employees are defined by the wage pyramid, legislated in 1992,
 which comprises 25 wage levels organized by trade.
 Parliament passed a law establishing free-trade zones between Tirana and Durres
 and elsewhere in the country. These are to become export processing zones, but the
 zones are not yet functioning due to the lack of implementing regulations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Law on Major Constitutional
 Provisions and the Labor Code prohibit forced labor, and there were no cases re-
 ported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code sets the minimum
 age of employment at 14 years of age and limits the amount and type of labor that
 can be performed by persons between the ages of 14 and 18. The Labor Code covers
 working conditions for those over the age of 16. The Ministry of Labor enforces the
 minimum age requirement through the courts. In rural areas, children continue to
 be required to assist their families in farm work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for all public sector work-
 ers over the age of 16 is approximately $35 (3,500 lek) per month, which is not suffi-
 ient to maintain a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Most workers
 must find second or part-time jobs to supplement their incomes or rely on remit-
 tances from family members residing abroad. The law guarantees social assistance
 (income support) and unemployment compensation. However, this is extremely lim-
 ited, both in the numbers of unemployed who receive it and in the amount that they
 receive. The average monthly wage for workers in the public sector is approximately
 $100 (10,000 lek), an increase of around 60 percent over last year. No data are
 available for private sector wages, but they are perceived to be considerably higher
 than the public sector. A draft law was under consideration at the end of 1996 that
 would set a minimum wage for private sector employees.
 Workers are limited by law to a 48-hour workweek, and many workers normally
 work 6 days a week- the Council of Ministers must approve exceptions. The Ministry
 of Labor enforces this law whenever possible. Women may not work at night in
 some professions, and pregnant women may not perform any night work.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards but has limited
 funds to make improvements in the remaining state-owned industries; health and
 safety are generally very poor. The 1995 Labor Code spells out the obligations of
 employers and their employees with regard to workplace safety. The law, however,
 does not provide specific protection to workers who choose to leave the workplace
 for fear of hazardous conditions.
