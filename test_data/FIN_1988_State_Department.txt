 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic founded upon the principle
 of the rule of law. It is a parliamentary democracy with
 sovereign power vested in its citizens as represented by their
 elected delegates to Parliament. The President, also elected
 by popular vote, exercises the executive power. The Cabinet,
 consisting of the Prime Minister and 17 ministers and
 responsible to Parliament, assists the President in governing
 the country. Four political parties form the governing
 coalition, headed by the Conservative Prime Minister.
 Judicial power is exercised by an independent judiciary
 consisting of the Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative
 Court.
 The Finnish security apparatus is controlled by elected
 officials and supervised by the courts.
 Finland has a mixed economy with state-owned, privately owned,
 and publicly owned companies. Citizens are free to pursue
 their legitimate private interests, hold private property, and
 engage in economic activity without government interference.
 National minorities and women enjoy the same economic and
 political rights as the Finnish majority and men respectively.
 During 1988 there were no reported violations in Finland of
 fundamental human rights. Finland is pursuing full membership
 of the Council of Europe (COE) which should occur early in
 1989. In that endeavor, Finland may need to make limited
 adjustments to its human rights legislation in order to make
 it consistent with that of the COE member countries. A
 Finnish parliamentary delegation visited the COE headquarters
 in Strasbourg in September 1988 in order to determine the
 specific changes required in Finnish legislation.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killings for political motives did not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearances, abduction, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Prisoners are treated justly with respect for their
 human dignity and without distinction on the basis of race,
 sex, language, nationality, religious or political conviction,
 social position, wealth, or any other grounds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest, imprisonment, or exile is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. A reform of
 pretrial procedures was adopted by Parliament and took effect
 on January 1, 1989. It shortened the maximum possible
 detention period from 17 days to 7 days and permits the

 FINLAND
 accused access to a lawyer during that period. The current
 law, in effect as of January 1, 1989, achieves uniformity with
 the practice in other Western countries.
 A court hearing must take place within 8 days of notification
 of the arrest, if in a city, or within 30 days, if the arrest
 occurs in rural areas. The circumstances of the arrest are
 subject to judicial review at the time the accused is brought
 to trial. Should the arrest be found to have been incorrect,
 or should the accused be found innocent, an application to the
 same court for civil damages for loss of freedom may be made.
 Habeas corpus and bail do not exist as such in Finland. Those
 charged with serious crimes must remain in custody while those
 charged with minor offenses may be released on personal
 recognizance at the court's discretion.
 Preventive detention is authorized only during a declared
 state of war for narrowly defined offenses, such as treason,
 mutiny, or trafficking in arms. Supervisory personnel from
 the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior--as
 well as the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of
 Justice--have authority to enter prisons and to order the
 release of prisoners held without charges. Exile is
 prohibited by law in Finland.
 New legislation on the status of conscientious objectors to
 Finland's obligatory military service took effect in 1987 for
 a trial period of 5 years. It grants the Finnish citizen the
 option of serving in the military or becoming a conscientious
 objector. The law both abolished the Investigative Board
 (which decided whether to confer the status of conscientious
 objector) and set the period of alternative civilian service
 for conscientious objectors at 16 months (twice the minimum
 length of military service). Jehovah's Witnesses are exempted
 from military service altogether under the new law.
 A small but growing number of total objectors, i.e., those who
 do not accept even unarmed alternative service, on the grounds
 that it is part of the total system of national defense and
 thus militaristic, have been sentenced to prison. As of
 October 1988, 10 objectors were serving an approximate 1-year
 sentence in jail, some 30 more had been sentenced to jail, and
 another 30 were awaiting trial.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair and public trial by an independent
 judiciary is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Finnish citizens and aliens legally present in Finland have
 the right to effective counsel. The State pays legal fees for
 the indigent defendant. Charges must be clearly stated.
 Civilians may not be tried by military courts except in time
 of war. There are no separate "security" courts in Finland.
 Local courts may elect to exclude the public in juvenile,
 matrimonial, and guardianship cases, or when publicity would
 offend morality or endanger the security of the State. In
 "national security" cases, the judge may restrict the release
 of information pertaining to charges, verdicts, and
 sentences. Sanctions may be imposed by the court if such
 information is divulged to the public. The Constitution
 prohibits provisional tribunals.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, including
 prohibition of eavesdropping and mail tampering, are
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. There is no
 forced political membership. The activities of the security
 police are subject to judicial scrutiny.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 An effective judiciary, an independent press, and a
 functioning democratic political system ensure freedom of
 speech, an open broadcast media, numerous publications, and
 extensive academic freedom. There have been no instances of
 abuse or legal decisions restricting freedom of the press.
 While the press occasionally exercises restraint in treating
 issues potentially harmful to the national interest, it is
 under no pressure from the Government to do so.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association.is provided for
 by the Constitution. However, only Finnish citizens may
 belong to associations whose primary purpose is to influence
 political issues. Police must be informed before public
 demonstrations are held.
 The Government encourages the formation of voluntary
 organizations and subsidizes private groups formed in
 pursuance of a public purpose. There is no restriction on
 these organizations maintaining relations with groups in both
 communist and Western countries. Nevertheless, the
 Government's permission to operate is required when foreign
 membership exceeds one-third of the total.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Finland has two state religions: Lutheran and the Orthodox
 Church in Finland. Persons are free to pursue their religious
 beliefs. Schools provide education in both religions. Taxes
 are collected by the Government from citizens to support these
 churches. Other Christians, Moslems, and Jews enjoy
 unrestricted freedom of worship. Approximately 89.5 percent
 of the population belongs to the Lutheran Church.
 Discrimination in employment because of religious affiliation
 does not exist in Finland.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Finnish citizens may travel within Nordic countries--Finland,
 Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland--without passports. They
 need not apply for exit visas for travel to other countries.
 Over 200,000 Finns have emigrated to Sweden in the past two
 decades--mainly to seek employment--but over one-half of them
 have returned. Net emigration is decreasing. No restrictions
 have been placed on emigration or repatriation.

 Debate occurs sporadically on the criteria which the Finnish
 Government applies when deciding to grant political asylum.
 The Government maintains that, "in accordance with the Geneva
 Agreement, Finland gives asylum to individuals arriving (in
 Finland) who have the characteristics of refugees as
 determined by the agreement."
 The number of persons applying for political asylum in Finland
 is low: about 20 per year. In 1987 Amnesty International
 (AI) submitted to Finnish authorities a memorandum in which it
 noted 12 Soviet citizens were repatriated by Finland between
 1959 and 1982; that all were arrested after their return; and
 that two were still in prison. AI was concerned that Finland
 does not appear to have uniform rules of procedure. The
 Ministry of the Interior denied any agreement with the Soviet
 Union to repatriate asylum seekers but said it would look into
 the matter seriously. At the same time, the Government issued
 written instructions translated into several languages for the
 use of aliens who potentially might apply for political
 asylum. Of the 49 persons applying for political asylum in
 Finland in 1987, 15 were deported, 6 withdrew their
 applications, 15 were granted residence permits, and 13 were
 given asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Finland is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which
 citizens over the age of 18 freely elect representatives to
 the 200-member Parliament from among multiple lists of
 candidates who represent a wide spectrum of political
 ideologies. Currently, there are seven political parties and
 an environment-oriented group known as The Greens represented
 in Parliament. National and local elections take place every
 4 years, presidential elections every 6 years. Should none of
 the presidential candidates receive an absolute majority of
 votes cast, a 301-member electoral college elects the
 president.
 The country has the longest tradition of women's suffrage in
 Europe, and there are at present 63 female representatives in
 Parliament and four female Cabinet ministers. While any
 Member of Parliament is free to introduce legislation, bills
 are generally submitted by the Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Within Finland, several organizations monitor human rights
 performance, including the Finnish Red Cross, the government-
 sponsored Equality Council, the Women's Rights Union, and
 Amnesty International. A Finnish Helsinki Watch group was
 established in July 1985 to monitor compliance with the
 provisions of the Helsinki Final Act, but it has not been very
 active. In connection with the Swedish-language University in
 Turku, a Human Rights Institute was founded in early 1985. It
 conducts human rights, research and studies and distributes
 human rights information. Finland participates actively in
 international human rights organizations.
 Seccion 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Religion, Sex,
 Language, or Social Status
 )d, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 
 
 1049
 FINLAND
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 To redress existing inequities between the sexes, the
 government-established Council for Equality and an Equal
 Rights Ombudsman monitor compliance with current legislation
 to ensure that the needs of women as workers, mothers, widows,
 and retirees are met. A surname law which permits women to
 retain their maiden names after marriage took effect in
 January 1986. The same law provides that the husband may take
 his wife's name. Finnish marriage legislation was amended in
 1988 to provide for a more equitable distribution of property
 in case of divorce or death.
 Government statistics indicate that in 1988 women's wages and
 salaries as a percentage of those of men increased slightly
 and has now reached almost 80 percent. Total female
 participation in the labor force continues to increase and
 during the last quarter of 1987 registered almost 65 percent.
 Male participation in the labor force remained nearly the same
 as in 1987, i.e., about 71 percent.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike.
 Trade unions enjoy a protected status and play an important
 role in Finnish political and economic life. While a
 one-million-member blue-collar confederation--the Central
 Organization of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK)--dominates the
 trade union movement, three other central organizations
 provide membership opportunities to white-collar,
 professional, and technical employees. Finnish trade unions
 are independent of the Government and are democratically
 organized and managed. Most unions maintain strong relations
 with their Nordic counterparts. The SAK and one white-collar
 confederation are members of the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). Two affiliates of the SAK have
 ties to Communist-dominated trade union internationals.
 Finnish trade unions participate in the International Labor
 Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is protected by
 law and is exercised extensively in Finland. Over 80 percent
 of both workers and employers are members of trade unions and
 employers* collective bargaining associations respectively.
 With few exceptions, all collective agreements since 1968 have
 been based on incomes policy agreements between central
 employees' and employers' organizations and the State. The
 central agreement covers the general level of wage and salary
 increases, other terms of employment, and a "social policy
 package" which provides for vacation, holidays, sick pay,
 maternity and paternity leave, travel costs, taxes, rents,
 etc. Labor legislation and practice are uniform throughout
 Finland.
 As of January 1, 1988, Finland had ratified 76 ILO conventions
 many of which, in addition to local legislation, provide
 protection against antiunion discrimination and which
 encourage trade union organization.

 c. Prohibition of Forced Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor does not exist in Finland.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 It is prohibited to employ persons under the age of 15.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Although there is no national minimum wage in Finland,
 national collective bargaining agreements set the "floor" for
 wages in virtually all employment sectors and for all workers,
 whether they are members of unions or not. As a result,
 collective bargaining agreements guarantee minimum wages of
 about $9.00 per hour at current exchange rates. Extensive
 legislation protects the worker's health and safety, ensures
 reasonable working conditions and limits the maximum hours
 they work. All aspects of Finnish labor law are effectively
 monitored and enforced by the Ministry of Labor. Compliance
 with labor legislation in Finland is effected through the
 Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and the National Board
 of Labor Protection. Regional and local supervision is
 delegated to 11 labor protection districts, each employing
 several inspectors. On the other hand, labor disputes
 concerning the interpretation of collective agreements are
 heard by labor courts or by arbitration. General courts of
 law have jurisdiction over labor disputes not relating to
 collective agreements.
