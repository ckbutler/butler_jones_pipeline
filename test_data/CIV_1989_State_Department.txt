 COTE DIVOIRE
 PoWer in Cote d'Ivoire is concentrated in the Democratic Party
 of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI) and its long-time leader, President
 Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who is in his mid-to-late eighties.
 Although the freedom to form other parties is provided for in
 the Constitution, in practice no other party has been allowed
 to participate in fhe political process. Basic policies are
 set within the PDCI; the unicameral National Assembly has never
 publicly challenged a policy put forth by the party.
 The Ministry of Internal Security includes the Surete Nationale
 and the gendarmerie, the national police, structured along
 French lines. The Surete has an arm tasked with intelligence
 gathering and counterespionage responsibilities. The
 gendarmerie is responsible for territorial security, especially
 in the rural areas.
 During the 1980's Cote d'Ivoire has been squeezed by a heavy
 debt burden andfalling prices for its exports, principally
 coffee, cocoa,  nd tropical woods, and per capita income has
 slipped in recent years from well over $1,000 to $740. In 1989
 the economy continued to decline and the financial situation
 remained critical. A new International Monetary Fund and World
 Bank financial package was being assembled at the end of 1989.
 In 1989 human rights remained circumscribed. The President
 continued to advocate dialog with dissenters in settling
 disputes, but it is unclear if this has eased the lingering
 threat of detentions and conscriptions, such as those which
 took place in 1988, and their stifling effect-on critics,
 including students, teachers, and trade unionists. One
 businessman was widely believed to have been convicted on
 manufactured charges because of his connection with a
 .ell-known dissident. Other areas of human rights abridgement
 included restrictions onlreedom of speech and press, academic
 freedom,'and-freedom-of -assembly and association; and
 limitations onewomen's and worker rights, and the right of
 citizens to change their government through democratic means.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the'Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no neports of political or extrajudicial killings in
 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of officially sanctioned abduction or
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 *Treatment or Punishment
 The Penal Code prohibits official violence without "legitimate
 justification." The Code does not, however, specifically
 mention or prohibit torture, or the level of violence officials
 may use if "justified." While there were no confirmed reports
 of torture in 1989, foreign Africans are routinely treated more
 roughly by police on arrest than are Ivorians. This rough
 treatment is reported to include beatings, often with the
 objective of extracting a confession.
 
 
 COTE DIVOIRE
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment. The Government has, however,
 occasionally detained persons considered a threat to internal
 security. The Government has also used the threat of forced
 conscription, such as that which occurred in 1988, to
 discourage student and trade union efforts peacefully to oppose
 the Government or its policies. In 1988, 20 former officials
 or members of the Secondary Schoolteachers' Union were detained
 and conscripted into varying lengths of military service.
 Under the Code of Penal Procedure, a public prosecutor can
 order the detention of a suspect for up to 48 hours without
 bringing charges. The Code dictates that further detention
 must be ordered by a magistrate who can authorize periods of up
 to 4 months, but who must also provide the Minister of Justice,
 on a monthly basis, with a written justification for continued
 detention. The;e have been unconfirmed reports that local
 police have held persons for more than 48 hours in a few
 cases. Bail is-technically available but is not commonly
 provided. Defendants are not guaranteed the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of their detention.
 Some prominent critics of the Government have chosen to live
 and write in other countries (see Section 2.a.). Political
 exiles from a number of countries have found Cote d'Ivoire to
 be a hospitable safe haven.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The modern judicial system is headed by a Supreme Court and
 includes a Court of Appeals and lower courts. Although the
 judiciary is generally considered independent of the executive
 in practice as well as under the Constitution's separation of
 powers provisions, the judiciary follows the lead of the
 executive in cases concerning perceived national security
 issues. There have also been credible reports that the courts
 have given lenient treatment to individuals with personal
 connections to the Government. One businessman, Innocente
 Anaky, is widely believed to have been convicted of trumped-up
 charges of financial impropriety because of his connections to
 prominent dissident Laurent Gbagbo. Anaky is currently serving
 a lengthy prison sentence.
 Defendants have the right to be present at their trials.
 Innocence is presumed, and defendants have the right of appeal,
 although in practice verdicts are rarely overturned.
 Defendants accused of felonies or capital crimes have the right
 to legal counsel, and the judicial system provides for
 court-appointed attorneys for indigent defendants. In
 practice, however, many defendants cannot afford private
 counsel, and court-appointed attorneys are not readily
 available.
 Ivorian law establishes the right to a fair public trial. This
 provision is generally respected in urban areas. In rural
 areas, justice is often administered at the village level
 through traditional institutions which handle domestic
 disputes, minor land questions, and family law. Dispute
 resolution is by extended debate, with no known instances of
 resort to physical or similar punishment. These traditional
 courts are increasingly superseded by the formal judicial
 system.

 COTE D',JVyXR
 Civilians are not tried by military courts. There are no
 appellate courts within the military justice system. Persons
 convicted by-a military tribunal occasionally request the
 Supreme Court to set aside the-tribunal's verdict and order a
 retrial.
 The number of political prisoners is unknown, butis believed
 to be small.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 All Ivorians are considered to be members of the PDCI. Party
 regulations call for active participation in party activities'
 and -ayments of dues, which are collected in most cases through
 deductions from paychecks. Most.party regulations, however,
 are not strictly enforced, and Ivorians who choose not to
 participate do not suffer retaliation.
 The Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official or
 investigative magistrate may conduct searches of homes without
 a warrant if there is reason to believe there is evidence on
 the premises concerning a crime. The official must have the
 prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized in the
 search and is required to have witnesses to the search, which
 may not take place between the hours of 9 p.m. and 4 a.m.
 Legal safeguards against arbitrary searches are generally
 respected in urban areas, although there have been reports of
 police entering homes of foreign Africans, taking them to the
 local police station, and extorting small amounts of money for
 alleged minor offenses. Safeguards against arbitrary searches
 are also believed to be ignored on occasion in the countryside.
 In 1988 there were some reports that armed members of the
 gendarmerie were directly involved in robberies of civilians,
 particularly on the highways. There were no such reports in
 1989; however, there were continuing reports, difficult to
 substantiate, of police roundups of foreign Africans, also with
 the intention of extorting money. Private telephone
 conversations are monitored to some degree, although it is
 difficult to estimate the extent of such monitoring. There is
 no evidence that private correspondence is monitored.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free expression in Cote d'Ivoire is provided for in the
 Constitution but significantly limited in practice. Public
 criticism of basic government policies, the party, or the
 President, rarely occurs. Critics of the Government express
 themselves in informal situations without fear of reprisal.
 Government policy assigns the media a positive role in
 promoting national unity and development, allowing criticism of
 failures to execute policy but not criticism of the policies
 themselves. Investigative journalism is not permitted with
 respect to the Government and its policies. The Government
 operates radio, television, and a wire service, and owns
 majority shares in the two daily newspapers. There are also
 two weekly newsmagazines which are controlled by the party
 All of these media follow government policies. Several
 periodic pamphlets are published privately.
 
 
 .COTE D'IVOXRE
 In April Vice President of the National Assembly Bamba was
 detained for carrying political tracts advocating a multiparty
 system. He was released and retains his elected position as
 Deputy in the National Assembly.
 Academic freedom is restricted. A university professor, Pascal
 Kokora, was fired from his job in January 1988 after having his
 linguistics class compare Ivorian and foreign news reports of
 the trial of former Secondary Schoolteachers' Union officials.
 As no alternative work was available for him, he left the
 country after several months. This report last year indicated
 that Kokora was given his job back in September 1988; in fact,
 he was not reinstated and has once again left the country.
 Laurent Gbagbo, generally considered to be Cote d'Ivoire's
 leading dissident, lived in voluntary exile in France from 1983
 to 1988, when he returned and was given a job at the
 university. In his current position, Gbagbo is limited to
 research activities and publishing in scientific journals, and
 he is not allowed to have significant contact with students.
 In general, professors and students report that they are afraid
 to express antigovernment sentiments in any public'forum.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the Constitution, but in
 practice is restricted when the Government perceives a
 significant and immediate danger to public order (which can
 include the expression of unwelcome political views).
 Gatherings occasionally are canceled to prevent the expression
 of controversial views in public forums. Only nonpolitical
 gatherings are permitted on campus.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no known impediments to religious expression. There
 is no dominant religion, and no faith is officially favored by
 the Government. The open practice of religion is permitted,
 and there are no restrictions on religious ceremonies or
 teaching.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises minimal control over domestic travel
 but has increased internal security roadblocks for identity and
 customs checks. Persons stopped at such roadblocks are
 frequently harassed and "fined" for one minor infraction or
 another. In 1989, at one checkpoint in Abidjan, security
 forces slapped an American citizen and beat her French citizen
 husband without cause other than perceived verbal insolence.
 The army subsequently initiated an inquiry and suspended the
 corporal in charge of the patrol pending the inquiry's findings.
 Although Professor Kokora initially had some problems obtaining
 a passport, Ivorians normally can travel abroad and emigrate
 freely. Ivorians have the right of voluntary repatriation.
 There are no known cases of revocation of citizenship.
 Cote d'Ivoire's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The
 country has resettled or granted safe haven to many refugees
 from many different countries. In 1989 approximately 800
 
 
 95
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 refugees, mostly Africans from neighboring countries, entered
 the. country. While in Cote d'Ivoire,:-refugees receive 1-year,
 renewable resident visas for their first 5 years in the
 country,-after which they may apply for permanent residence.
 Cote-d'qvoire does not take- any:significant responsibility for
 the economic and social welfare of refugees, who become the
 concern of private and international organizations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 While in theory the citizens of Cote d'Ivoire have the right to
 a multiparty system, in practice they are unable to change the
 one-party system bf government. (The President recently
 restated his long-held position that Cote d'Ivoire is "not yet
 ripe" for a multiparty system.) No opposition groups exist
 openly, and the Government dbes not allow their formation.
 Within the PDCI, the-President wields power through a 13-member
 Executive Committee, a 57-member Political Bureau, and a
 208-member Steering Committee. Political power is concentrated
 in the President's hands, and most important decisions are made
 by the President himself. The 175-seat National Assembly
 confirms and ratifies legislative initiatives received from the
 President.
 Within this strict one-party system, the Government continues
 to encourage more open participation in the political process
 by expandihg the size of party institutions and by permitting
 morifprty members to compete in legislative, municipal, and
 local party elections. In 1989 an important mayoral race in
 San Pedro was hotly, and by allfaccounts-fairly, contested.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is not a party .to international human rights
 accords but has been cooperative in the past towards
 international inquiries intb its human rights practices. It
 did not respond publicly to Amnesty International's appeals in
 2988 on behalf of the Secondary Schoolteachers' Union, and it
 is thus not known what impact, if any, these appeals may have
 had on the Government's subsequent positive action.
 In 1987 a group of Ivorians formed an internal Human Rights
 Associai �on. The Government has repeatedly refused to
 recognize this association and has not allowed local
 journalists-to attend the two press conferences it has held.
 Under these circumstances the group's ability to investigate
 and report-on alleged human rights violations has been very
 limited.
 Sectioh 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,.
 Language, or Social Status
 There is'no overt, official discrimination based on race, sex,
 -religion, language, or social status. Although French is the
 official language and the language of instruction in the
 schools, radio and television broadcasts-are provided in major
 local languages. Social and economic mobility are not limited
 by policy or custom.
 Males -clearly play the preponderant role overall, although some
 Ivoriar traditional societies accord women considerable
 political and economic power. Nonetheless, in rural areas
 
 
 96
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 tribal customs dictate that menial tasks are performed mostly
 by women. Although PDCI policy is to encourage full
 participation by women in social and economic life, there is
 considerable informal resistance among employers to hiring
 women, who may be considered "undependable" by virtue of
 potential pregnancy.
 Female genital mutilation (i.e., clitorectomy) is widely
 practiced in Cote d'Ivoire, particularly among the rural Muslim
 population in the north and west. The operation, which takes
 place at puberty as one element of a rite of passage, is
 generally performed outside modern medical facilities.
 Clitoral excision is illegal in Cote dlIvoire, but the
 Government does not make strong efforts to prevent the
 practice, and social pressures are sufficiently strong that it
 persists, particularly in small villages where the tribal chief
 is the primary decisionmaker. Excision is becoming less
 frequent as the population becomes better educated.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, is neither
 widely practiced nor tacitly condoned. However,
 representatives of womens' organizations state that wife
 beating does occur, often leading to divorce. Doctors state
 that they rarely see the victims of domestic violence. A
 severe social stigma is attached to domestic violence of any
 kind; neighbors will often intervene in a domestic quarrel to
 protect an individual who is the object of physical abuse. The
 courts and police view domestic violence as a family problem
 unless serious bodily harm is inflicted, in which case criminal
 proceedings do take place. The Government has no clear-cut
 policy regarding wife beating beyond the obvious strictures
 against violence in the Civil Code.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to form unions under the Labor Code of
 1964, but almost all unions are organized within a single
 government-sponsored labor confederation, the General Union of
 Cote dlIvoire Workers (UGTCI). Only the University Teachers'
 Union is independent of the confederation.
 The leader of the UGTCI occupies a senior position in the party
 hierarchy. Union membership is encouraged but not mandatory.
 The UGTCI is a relatively passive coordination mechanism rather
 than an active force for worker rights, although it has had
 some success in improving working conditions and safety
 standards. The UGTCI represents approximately one-third to
 one-half of the organizable work force.
 The right to strike is protected by statute, but in practice
 strikes are rarely authorized by the UGTCI. There were no
 official strikes in 1988, although there were several "work
 stoppages." For example, workers in a factory near the capital
 stopped work to protest a management plan to reorder
 production. In this case, as usually happens, the Government
 stepped in to mediate. In 1989 reliable sources suggested that
 some wildcat strikes occurred without receiving publicity or
 being officially acknowledged.
 Generally, the Government negotiates with strikers and resolves
 at least some of their economic grievances. In the 1987-1988
 dispute with the secondary schoolteachers, the Government used
 a variety of powers to coerce the teachers back to their jobs.
 
 
 97
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 This included arrest and detention of 20 of them and
 conscription of several men into military service. There were
 no reports that professional groups experienced persecution or
 harassment in 1989.
 The UGTCI formally prohibits its individual trade unions from
 forming or-maintaining affiliations with international
 professional organizations in their fields, with the exception
 of the Organization of African Trade-Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In theory, collective.bargaining is protected by the Labor
 Code. In practice, however, only the UGTCI is allowed to
 engage in, collective bargaining with individual companies. The
 UGTCI has representatives in every major business enterprise,
 and the UGTCI Secretnriat often plays a mediation or  I
 conciliation role in relations between labor and management in
 individual businesses. There are no export processing zones in
 Cote d'Ivoire, although there is some discussion about creating
 such zones in the future. Labor legislation, to the extent it
 is applied, is applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor-
 There have been no reports of forced labor in Cote d'Ivoire,
 and it is prohibited by law.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 In most instances, the. legal working minimum age of 16 is
 enforced among government employees and among large
 multinational companies.- However, children often work on
 family farms, and in Abidjan some children routinely act as
 vendors of consumer goods in the informal sector.. There are
 also reports of children working in what could be described as
 sweatshop conditions in small workshops. Many children leave
 the formal school system at an early age; lower grade education
 is mandatory but far from universally enforced, particularly in
 the rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government enforces a comprehensive labor code governing
 the terms and conditions of service for wage earners and
 salaried workers and providing for occupational safety and
 health standards. Those employed in the modern sector are
 reasonably protected against unjust compensation, excessive
 hours, and capricious discharge from employment. The standard
 workweek is 44 hours. Minimum wages vary according to
 occupation, with the lowest bqing approximately $110 per
 month. This does not provide a decent standard of living for a
 worker and his family. Government medical insurance and
 retirement programs provide an element of income security for
 salaried employees in the modern sector. Month-long paid
 vacations and a substantial severance pay are also guaranteed.
 There is, however, a large informal sector of the economy,
 involving both urban and especially rural workers, in which
 many of these occupational regulations are enforced erratically
 at best.
