 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a democracy with a good human rights
 record. During President Carter's March 28-29, 1978
 visit to Venezuela, he and President Carlos Andres
 Perez issued a 3oint communique reaffirming their com-
 mitment to the preservation and strengthening of
 democracy and human rights.
 Venezuela's human rights record has improved dra-
 matically in the twenty-year period since the end of
 the Perez Jimenez dictatorship, as democratic institu-
 tions and practices have taken hold. The country has
 a free. press, an independent judiciary which enforces
 the right of habeas corpus, and an open political
 system in which political parties compete for public
 attention and votes.
 Occasionally, however, there are charges of human
 rights violations leveled against Venezuela.
 Local human rights groups assert there are political
 prisoners, and publish charges of abuse against such
 prisoners. While individual abuses undoubtedly have
 occurred, there is no indication that the Government
 condones them.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Constitutional guarantees of integrity of the person
 are enforced. Torture is not practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Venezuelan laws prohibit cruel, inhuman or aegrading
 treatment or punishment and this prohibition is
 respected in most circumstances. Approximately two
 dozen prisoners held at San Carlos Military Prison
 
 (343)
 
 
 344
 on charges of military crimes have publicly claimed
 mistreatment. Most of their complaints concerned
 such matters as tine denial of reading materials and
 visits; some concerned physical mistreatment. Op-
 position politicians and others have on occasion
 charged security authorities with abuse of peasant
 suspects being interrogated in connection with ter-
 rorist activities in Eastern Venezuela. There is
 no doubt that there has been occasional mistreatment
 of suspects.
 There have also been persistent press reports
 that Venezuelan police officials have organized
 "death squads" which execute corimon criminals during
 shoot-outs and other confrontations. These allega-
 tions have not been backed by evidence, but they have
 received notoriety because of the sizeable number of
 common criminals reported killed during police
 operations. President Perez and other prominent
 officials, including the Attorney General (responsible
 under the Constitution for protecting citizens'
 rights), have categorically denied any such police
 activity. Nevertheless, in a case that has received
 nationwide publicity, police officials have been
 charged with the murder of a leading lawyer and its
 subsequent cover-up.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under Venezuelan law, persons charged with crimes
 cannot be held longer than eight days without having
 formal charges filed against them. In most cases
 charges are filed within the time period. In general,
 individuals are arrested and imprisoned for legiti-
 mate and non-arbitrary reasons.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The slowness of the judicial system occasionally
 leads to the situation of "justice delayed, justice
 denied". This is particularly true of cases in the
 military courts, where prisoners accused of terrorist
 or subversive acts have been held for lengthy periods
 without trial. There is no enforceable limit on the
 
 
 345
 amount of time the state can take in preparing a case
 for trial. In military trials, the accused and his
 lawyers have full access to the court, but the code of
 military justice leaves tnird party access to the
 proceedings to the judge's discretion.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbitrary
 invasion of the home.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Forty percent of the $12 billion 1978 budget was ear-
 marked for social services, principally public health,
 education and welfare. The welfare policies of the
 Venezuelan Government are designed to respond to the
 needs of the poor. Recent measures include supple-
 mentary nutritional programs for underprivileged
 children, low cost housing projects, expansion of
 health care facilities in the interior, and increases
 in the number of schools and technical institutions
 nationwide. The Government operates a social security
 system which covers approximately three-fourths of
 wage ana salary earners. Nevertheless, there still
 exist great differences between social and economic
 classes and poverty remains widespread in various
 sectors of society.
 While the Constitution and other laws provide equal
 job and income rights to women, social conventions
 and tradition have prevented many from enjoying equal
 access. This situation is chanying rapidly, however,
 as women workers are being sought to relieve the
 acute shortage of trained workers.
 Corruption is a problem in Venezuela but does not
 appear to divert more than a small fraction of the
 Government's total budgetary outlays. Few Vene-
 zuelans pay income taxes, since the bulk of the
 Government's revenue comes from petroleum. Income
 taxes apply only to those earning more than $17,000
 and are steeply progressive. Sales taxes are not
 burdensome.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Respect for civil and political liberties is well
 established. All religious groups are free to orjanize
 and practice without state interference. While the
 press is generally free, there are occasional abuses
 when the Government believes that criticism either
 involves support of subversion or exceeds the bounds
 of personal propriety. In a few cases, the Government
 has jailed journalists, temporarily cancelled media
 programs and in some cases withdrawn official adver-
 tisiny. In all such instances the media and profes-
 sional journalist associations have been permitted to
 make their complaints freely. Freedom of speech,
 thought and assembly are guaranteed in the Constitution
 and are realized in daily life.
 Labor rights are guaranteed by the Government, both
 in law and practice. Since the establishment of
 democracy in 1958, trade unions have played an important
 political role and assured representation of workers
 in Venezuela's aeveloping political process.
 b. Freedow of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on freedomn of movement,
 travel or emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is full freedom to participate in the political
 process. Approximately 87 percent of those registered
 voted in the December, 1978 national elections. There
 has been no appreciable election fraud in recent years.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 
 
 347
 The Venezuelan Government has permitted Amnesty
 International to open an office in Caracas, allowed
 representatives from the Inter-American Press
 Association to travel freely and has supported
 the endeavors of the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission (presently chaired by a Venezuelan) and
 other human rights groups. The Government favors
 the creation of a United Nations mechanisia for the
 monitoring of human rights violations.
