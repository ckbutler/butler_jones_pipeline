 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 The German Democratic Republic (GDR or East Germany) was
 created in 1949 as a Communist state out of the Soviet
 occupation zone of Germany. There are still approximately
 380,000 Soviet troops stationed on its soil. The country is
 ruled by the Communist party, known as the Socialist Unity
 Party (SED), which closely resembles the Soviet model. The
 four other parties have no real power or independence, and the
 SED leadership makes all important political, economic, and
 social decisions.
 Despite such formidable barriers as the Berlin Wall, deep
 historical, cultural, linguistic, and family ties remain
 between the people of the German Democratic Republic and those
 of the Federal Republic of Germany. Concern that such ties
 and constant exposure to Western values could undermine
 support for the Communist system is a central reason for the
 Government's tight control over its population. For this
 purpose, the GDR has an efficient security apparatus
 administered by the Ministries of the Interior and State
 Security. Together, they employ approximately 300,000 people.
 The German Democratic Republic has a centrally planned economy
 in which the bulk of industrial and agricultural property is
 state-owned. Although holding private property is permitted,
 controls are placed on its acquisition, inheritance, and the
 income derived from it. Private businesses are few and
 tightly controlled.
 The German Democratic Republic continues to restrict, through
 use of the large secret police apparatus supplemented by
 informers, the fundamental freedoms of thought, speech,
 religion, assembly, and travel. The secret police opens mail,
 installs listening devices, places people under surveillance,
 subjects them to interrogation and intimidation, and arrests
 them without due process. During 1985, the rate of emigration
 increased somewhat over the 1980-83 average. The Government
 reportedly dismantled all automatic shooting devices along the
 border with the Federal Republic of Germany and has promised
 to remove all mines. A slightly more lenient attitude toward
 some religious groups has recently been~apparent.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killings in the German Democratic Republic appear to
 take place only in the context of attempts to leave the
 country by crossing the border without authorization. A 1982
 law codified orders to border guards that they should shoot,
 if necessary, to prevent a person from leaving the country
 without permission. It is not known how many people have been
 shot while trying to flee to West Germany or West Berlin. The
 borders remain nearly impenetrable. Although the East Germans
 have announced the dismantling of the last automatic shooting
 devices along the border and the forthcoming removal of
 minefields, a heavily guarded fence 500 meters behind the
 frontier has helped reduce unauthorized border crossings from
 192 in 1984 to 96 through the end of August 1985. Any who
 attempt escape still risk death. No exact figure for the
 number of unsuccessful escape attempts, and possible resulting
 
 
 981
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 deaths, can be given since border guards from the Federal
 Republic of Germany are not necessarily aware of all incidents.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of permanent disappearance during 1985.
 c. Torture, and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of systematic torture in 1985. Specific
 laws'state that the life, health, and the ability to work of
 arrestees and prisoners must not be jeopardized. However,
 former detainees and prisoners have reported excessively harsh
 conditions and psychological strain in GDR prisons. Former
 political prisoners have reported 13-hour workdays without any
 day of rest. In 1985, an investigatory commission of the
 European Parliament heard testimony describing beatings and
 the use of cramped "tiger cages" in GDR prisons. In general,
 however, the use of repressive psychological measures (such as
 the denial of family visits, mail, and packages) seems to be
 more common.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In practice, the police have blanket authority to detain and
 interrogate East Germans on suspicion alone. East Germans who
 become particularly active in officially disapproved ways are
 sometimes subject to repeated harassment, such as regular
 police interrogations, despite the absence of formal charges.
 They may be arrested with or without warrants and merely for
 expressing dissenting views. When held in detention, a person
 does not have the right to a judicial determination of
 continued detention.
 Although the criminal procedure code sets a limit of 3 months
 on investigatory proceedings, prosecuting authorities appear
 to have no difficulty in extending this period. In most
 political cases it takes longer than 24 hours--often many
 weeks--before interested parties are notified of the arrest.
 Furthermore, the code does not specify a maximum time period
 which may elapse before a detained person may see a lawyer.
 Although the code guarantees access to a defense attorney, the
 prosecutor may monitor or restrict contacts between the
 defense attorney and his client as he sees fit.
 Charges filed in clearly political cases are often based on
 laws which are written in vague and general language. The
 Penal Code provides, for instance, that the transmission of
 information "detrimental to the interests of the German
 Democratic Republic," even if it is not secret, may be
 considered treason. Laws against "anti-state agitation" and
 "asocial behavior (parasitism)" are often applied selectively
 against citizens who become politically active. Their broad
 and vague wording severely restricts the possibility for
 defense. Amnesty International states that it has yet to
 learn of an acquittal when a prisoner has been brought to
 trial under these laws.
 Forced labor as a means of political coercion or education is
 not practiced in the German Democratic Republic.

 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 GDR law provides for a fair public trial for defendants in
 civil and criminal cases. In cases involving security and
 political issues, however, judges may bar individuals or
 groups from "open trials." Prisoners are allowed to choose a
 lawyer from a list of those available in their area. However,
 all attorneys are state employees, and only a handful are
 willing to take on political cases. Until investigatory
 proceedings are completed, prisoners may see their lawyers
 only in the presence of the secret police and may discuss only
 matters not relating to the case. Discussion of a case itself
 usually takes place in a brief interview shortly before a
 trial. Attorneys are not allowed to make photocopies or tape
 recordings of their clients' files; files may be reviewed only
 in court and notes must be taken in longhand.
 Trials tend to be short and perfunctory. Constitutionally,
 the courts are under the control of the Council of State; in
 reality, they are controlled by the SED, which appoints the
 judges. Military courts try civilians only in military
 espionage cases.
 The German Democratic Republic does not admit to having
 political prisoners, nor does it publish statistics which
 would assist in determining the number of political prisoners
 held. The West German-based International Society for Human
 Rights estimates that there are 6,000 political prisoners in
 the German Democratic Republic. The August 13 Working Group,
 a West Berlin human rights organization, presently places the
 number at 8,500, a decline from its earlier estimates.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 By law, the police need authorization to enter and search a
 house, but they may authorize entry themselves, and the courts
 will retroactively give approval. It is routine and legal for
 the state security organs, solely on their own authority, to
 tap telephones and open mail. Evidence thus obtained can be
 used in court. The Government has achieved its goal of
 instilling a widespread belief that state security informants
 are ubiquitous and discovery of opposition to the state is
 certain.
 All printed materials require an official permit. Only
 magazines and newspapers bearing a postal license may be
 legally imported and distributed. West German television can
 be viewed by 80 percent of East Germans, and Western radio
 broadcasts can be heard throughout the country. There are no
 government attempts to jam or otherwise hinder these
 broadcasts.
 Young people are not forced to join the SED's youth movement,
 the Free German Youth, but school and government authorities
 make it clear that failure to join this group will limit
 educational and job opportunities.
 East Germans must obtain government permission to marry
 foreigners. The authorities appear to be following faithfully
 the letter of an October 1983 law which specifies that
 applications for binational marriage should be decided within
 6 months of completing an application, though the process of
 assembling documents can be time-consuming.
 
 
 983
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 East German citizens in positions deemed "sensitive" by their
 Government may not be visited by or even maintain contacts
 with close relatives who live in the West. Emigrants from the
 German Democratic Republic must generally wait 5 years before
 they may return to visit relatives.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All media are controlled and censored by the Government, and
 all publications must be licensed before distribution.
 Western newspapers and magazines, other than politically
 acceptable publications such as those of Western Communist
 parties, are generally unavailable to the general public.
 Small quantities of Western journals are for sale for hard
 currency in international hotels upon request. Some
 libraries, university departments, and official institutes
 also receive Western journals, but circulation is highly
 restricted. East Germans and Western travelers may be
 interrogated or arrested simply for possessing unlicensed
 printed material. Contact with Western journalists is
 severely limited by law; for the average East German, such
 contact is illegal.
 The SED conceives of art and literature as a means of
 promoting political goals. Works are judged on the basis of
 their conformity to "socialist realism", i.e., whether they
 convey a clear, optimistic view of Communist society and
 goals. Contrary views or perceptions are discouraged or
 censored. Professional associations for writers and artists
 are headed by party members and controlled by the state.
 Dissidents and critics have been expelled and deprived of
 important professional privileges. Publishing houses practice
 self-censorship, and works must receive official clearance
 before they are published, performed, or exhibited. Some
 works are banned completely; others may be published only
 outside the country under contracts negotiated by the
 state-run agencies; others are permitted to be published,
 performed, or exhibited in the German Democratic Republic only
 in edited form. East German cultural figures continue to
 emigrate to the Federal Republic to escape these government
 restrictions.
 Individual academic freedom is severely limited. The State
 views education as an instrument for "building socialism."
 All areas of academic inquiry are strictly controlled.
 Teachers who allow open classroom discussion of unapproved
 themes or topics or who deviate from the party line are
 disciplined. Many books are prohibited totally; others are
 permitted only in university libraries to which only carefully
 screened and authorized personnel are allowed access.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of assembly,
 only government-organized demonstrations are allowed. The
 formation of private organizations or clubs also requires
 state permission. Environmentalist Udo Zeitz applied for
 permission to emigrate after his request to form an
 association for environmental protection was denied. His
 continued protest against GDR environmental policies and
 denial of his right to emigrate led to his arrest and
 
 
 984
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 conviction to 3-1/2 years of imprisonment on charges of
 "defamation of the German Democratic Republic."
 GDR workers do not have the right to establish and join unions
 of their own choosing. The Free German Trade Union is an
 appendage of the SED. It is made up of 16 unions covering all
 workers and professionals. Its role is to enforce and promote
 official government and party policies rather than to promote
 members' interests-which might conflict with those policies.
 The right to strike does not exist in the German Democratic
 Republic.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of religious belief and
 worship, but the State officially promotes atheism. In
 practice, the State tolerates but does not encourage,
 religious activity. Overt adherence to religious beliefs may
 result in disqualification for preferred jobs and educational
 opportunities, although the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the
 largest in the German Democratic Republic, has had some
 success in pleading the cases of its members who have suffered
 such discrimination.
 Clergy and lay members of Western churches have been permitted
 to attend church synods and conferences at a national
 ecumenical level, and some GDR religious leaders have been
 allowed to attend similar meetings in the West. However, the
 Evangelical Lutheran Church complained at its regional synod
 in Dresden in 1985 that GDR authorities are increasingly
 refusing West German church members permission to visit
 affiliated congregations in the German Democratic Republic.
 The authorities prohibit official relations between East and
 West German congregations and does not permit personal visits
 by West German clergy when they suspect church business will
 be discussed.
 New churches continue to be built in limited numbers with
 government approval. However, the Evangelical Lutheran Church
 Synod also complained that government assistance in
 restoration and upkeep of existing churches was insufficient
 owing mainly to the lack of building materials.
 Under continuing government pressure to watch its words and
 deeds, the Evangelical Lutheran Church showed more caution in
 1985. Secret police continue to monitor church-sponsored
 events closely. Nevertheless, the church remains the only
 institutional forum where divergent opinions can be expressed
 with relative freedom.
 The Government has demonstrated some flexibility in its
 treatment of minority religions. A Mormon Temple was
 dedicated in Freiberg near Dresden, and Christian Scientists
 have begun receiving church literature promised to them during
 a. meeting with government officials in December 1984. However
 they, like the Jehovah's Witnesses, are still under court
 orders restricting their religious practice. An American
 Jewish organization has received official encouragement in its
 efforts to arrange for a rabbi to be sent to reside in East
 Berlin, where for years there has been no rabbi to serve the
 tiny Jewish community.
 
 
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel,.Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Most East Germans can travel freely within the country, except
 near borders or military installations. They are not allowed
 to change their place of residence without government
 permission. All citizens must carry identification cards
 which the police have the right to check at will. Because of
 their criminal or political activities, including the filing
 of emigration applications, approximately 60,000 East Germans
 carry a special identification card, called PM-12, which in
 many but not all cases restricts their domestic as well as
 foreign travel.
 Foreign travel is tightly controlled, except to
 Czechoslovakia, which East:Germans can visit using only a
 normal identification card. Travel to other Communist
 countries is restricted, and travel to Poland strictly
 controlled. With few exceptions, travel to non-Communist
 countries is not allowed until East Germans reach retirement
 age (60 for women, 65 for men).
 In 1985, a total of 24,912 East Germans legally emigrated to
 the Federal Republic of Germany. The 1985 monthly rate of
 emigration visas issued was higher than the average of
 960-I,000 visas in recent years, except 1984 when the
 authorities allowed about 40,000 people to emigrate.
 Nonetheless, only a fraction of those wishing to leave have
 been allowed to do so. Some Western authorities estimate, that
 as many as 300;000 to 500,000 applications are still pending.
 A law effective October 15, 1983 narrowly restricts cases of
 family reunification to first-degree relatives (parents or
 children) and spouses. Though some East Germans other than
 those with firbt-degree relatives have been allowed to leave,
 the narrow definition of eligibility for emigration has
 created difficulties for the largemajority of applicants.
 Many successful applicants wait from 1 to 5 years for
 permission to leave, often in the meantime suffering loss of
 employment and even imprisonment.
 Those who left the country illegally before January 1, 1981
 are eligible to apply for permission to visit, but reportedly
 only half of those who have applied have obtained visas.
 Those who fled after 1980 face criminal prosecution if they
 return to the German Democratic Republic. Those who emigrate
 legally must generally wait 5 years before they are permitted
 to return again.
 Section 3 Respect for PoliticalRights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 The Government is completely dominated by the Socialist Unity
 Party. Although four other parties are represented in the
 Government, they are not permitted to challenge Communist
 doctrine or control. All decisions are made by the SED
 leadership; lower-level representatives are expected only to
 approve and to carry out these decisions. The unicameral
 legislature, the Volkskammer (People's Chamber), never rejects
 government proposals. The SED also determines who will fill
 executive positions in the Government and ensures that its
 members fill a majority of the positions.
 
 
 986
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 All parties and mass organizations (such as the trade unions)
 are represented in the National Front, which is controlled by
 the SED. For election purposes, the National Front prepares
 lists of approved candidates according to a formula which
 ensures the SED's complete domination. The list of candidates
 on a ballot exceeds the number of available seats, and a
 candidate high on the list may be rejected if more than 50
 percent of voters cross his name off the ballot. In such a
 case, a candidate lower on the list may be elected.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 The German Democratic Republic is a signatory of the Final Act
 of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
 However, it has generally taken the position that inquiries
 into its human rights policies constitute interference in its
 internal affairs. Requests by private human rights groups in
 the West for information on human rights conditions go
 unanswered, and the Government does not permit visits by such
 groups. No unofficial human rights groups are known to exist
 in the German Democratic Republic. The government-sponsored
 Committee for the Protection of Human Rights does not attempt
 to safeguard the human rights of East Germans but to criticize
 human rights conditions in other countries while claiming
 there are no problems in the German Democratic Republic.
 In its 1985 Report (covering the year 1984), Amnesty
 International expressed continuing concern about the large
 number of prisoners of conscience, most of them imprisoned for
 attempting to leave the country without permission or for
 trying to obtain permission to do so. Other prisoners of
 conscience included peace campaigners, dissenting Marxists,
 and conscientious objectors to military service. Amnesty
 International was also concerned that political prisoners were
 tried in secret and therefore denied the right to a fair
 public trial. Freedom House rated the German Democratic
 Republic "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The German Democratic Republic, which claims a population of
 over 15,500,000 plus almost 1.2 million in East Berlin, has a
 highly industrialized, centrally planned economy. It is
 generally an importer of raw materials and an exporter of
 manufactured goods. All large industrial, retail, and
 agricultural properties are state-owned, but small private
 businesses with fewer than 10 employees are permitted. Over
 90 percent of the farmland is collectivized or state-owned,
 and only 2 percent of the labor force is still privately
 employed.
 An extensive social welfare system provides free medical care
 to the population. According to the World Bank in 1984, life
 expectancy at birth was 73.1 years, and the infant mortality
 rate was 11 per 1,000 live births. However, serious shortages
 of hospital beds and medicines are reported. East Germans may
 now receive medicines from the Federal Republic against their
 local prescriptions. Even seriously ill patients must wait
 several months or years for hospitalization or surgery, unless
 they can pay for admission to "hard currency wards" which have
 been established in several hospitals.
 
 
 987
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 The supply and safety of drinking water is of growing concern
 to the Government and the local population. At present the
 use of water--15 billion cubic meters per year--is extremely
 close to the total amount available for use. Reports from
 provincial areas indicate that drinking water is increasingly
 contaminated through the overuse of pesticides and
 fertilizers, chiefly nitrates, and illnesses and birth defects
 from drinking unsafe water are increasing.
 Housing remains the most serious shortage. Single residents
 in East Berlin usually wait more than 18 months for housing
 and married couples often wait more than 1 year. The
 Government is committed to a major housing construction
 program lasting until 1999. The authorities also encourage
 private initiative in repairing or building homes by providing
 low interest loans, but building materials are often in short
 supply.
 Literacy is almost universal. Free and universal education is
 provided through the 12th year. Almost all school-aged
 children attend school. The number of students in
 institutions of higher learning is a function of projected
 needs. Competition is keen, and admission is usually as much
 a matter of the student's political acceptability as academic
 promise.
 Children may work part-time during vacations and to further
 their education from age 14 onwards, and full-time with
 permission of their parents between the ages of 14 and 18.
 Children under the age of 18 may not work between 6 p.m. and 6
 a.m.. The workweek averages 43-1/2 hours a week, and a 2-day
 weekend is common. Minimum paid holidays total 18 workdays a
 year, and certain persons, such as mothers with small
 children, have the right to additional days of paid holidays.
 In general, health and safety standards are adequate, but
 occasional reports persist of poorly maintained or overtaxed
 industrial plants and machinery. Railway workers have
 complained repeatedly that the freight transport capacity of
 the railway system is overextended and leading to safety
 problems.
 Men and women are treated equally in most respects. The
 retirement age for women is 60, for men 65. As one of the
 many incentives to increase the birth rate, women are given
 extensive maternity leave with pay. Eighty-seven percent of
 women of working age are employed, and there is a
 comprehensive child care system for working parents. Women
 are given one day a month off to do household shopping, as are
 single or divorced fathers with custody of children. Women
 can be found in all professions except the military, from
 which they are exempt except in times of war. There are few
 women in high positions in the party and Government and in
 most professions, although they are well represented in the
 medical profession.
 The Sorbs, a Slavic group located around Cottbus and Dresden
 and numbering about 45,000, constitute the only remaining
 significant ethnic minority in the German Democratic
 Republic. The Sorbs are well integrated into the general
 population, and there is no apparent discrimination.
