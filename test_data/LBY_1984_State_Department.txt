 LIBYA*
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya describes its
 form of government as "popular democracy.' While in theory
 political power is vested in the General People's Congress, in
 practice the country is under the control of a military
 dictator, Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi. The governing
 principles of the society are expressed in Qadhafi's "Green
 Book,* rather than in the Constitution. Qadhafi has created a
 political system that borrows from Islamic and Socialist
 doctrine and is heavily influenced by his own revolutionary
 philosophy. It ostensibly emphasizes full participation of
 the people, through a system of "people's committees,* in
 decisions which affect daily life. The committees have some
 influence on local government, social institutions, and local
 enterprise, including farming and manufacturing. Despite this
 local level participation, Qadhafi, though holding no formal
 government position, is the only decisionmaker on all
 important issues and the influence of popular views on him
 appears minimal. At the same time, however, revolutionary
 committees acting on the basis of Qadhafi's speeches have
 ordered assassinations and other operations which must be
 regarded as government activities.
 Libya has benefited from the high oil prices of recent years
 and has used its increased revenue to finance internal
 development (new schools, hospitals, roads) and to acquire
 large quantities of weapons. Qadhafi has used these weapons
 and Libya's oil wealth for aggression against Libya's
 neighbors and for terrorism and subversion in many parts of
 the world.
 Libyan oil revenues declined considerably in 1981 (to about
 $15 billion), and somewhat further (to $13 billion) in 1982.
 Oil revenues remained at this level in 1983 but appear to be
 declining again in 1984. Significant parts of the 1981-1985
 development plan continue to be postponed because of related
 financial problems, but weapons purchases and efforts to
 destabilize moderate neighbors have not declined appreciably.
 Qadhafi has admitted that financial problems have made it
 difficult for him to finance 'liberation movements,* and from
 time to time funds for a few extremist groups have been
 stopped or reduced. But whatever financial constraint Libya
 may be experiencing has not been enough to halt its invasion
 of Chad or acts of terrorism and subversion.
 Libyan forces invaded and occupied portions of northern Chad
 beginning in June 1983. Libyan aircraft conducted extensive
 bombings including the use of napalm and cluster bombs against
 the northern town of Faya Largeau. This was followed by the
 use of Libyan armored columns to occupy several key locations
 in northern Chad. Despite an agreement with France to
 withdraw both countries' soldiers from Chad by November 9,
 1984, Libyan soldiers and equipment remain in Chad. In
 addition to the death and suffering caused by Libya's actions,
 there is considerable evidence that Libya impressed citizens
 of other nations against their will into service with the
 Libyan Army or with Libya's 'Islamic Legion.'
 *After the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli on December
 2, 1979, Embassy operations were suspended. On May 2, 1980
 the Embassy was closed. Because of the absence of a U.S.
 Mission, this report draws heavily on unofficial sources.

 LIBYA
 In April, members of the 'Libyan People's Bureau,* or embassy,
 in London fired on a crowd of demonstrators from within the
 embassy, killing a British policewoman. This incident
 followed a series of bombings in London attributed to Libyan
 terrorists, and resulted in the severing of diplomatic
 relations between Britain and Libya.
 Libya's human rights record has been poor since Qadhafi seized
 power in 1969. Reports of torture and abuse have increased,
 notably in the aftermath of a coup attempt on May 8, which
 resulted in a purge unprecedented in its breadth and
 brutality. The purge included public hangings and summary
 executions and generated reports that thousands of Libyans had
 been arrested and many tortured.
 On March 10, 1983, Amnesty International warned that Libyans
 abroad were under threat following a February 17 decision by
 the General People's Congress that all Libyans considered
 'hostile" would be liquidated. In early 1984, the Government
 directed resumption of assassinations of Libyan exiles and in
 May it announced formation of "suicide squads' to hunt down
 and kill Libyan dissidents abroad. There have since been
 assassinations of Libyans in Greece, England, Italy, Germany,
 and Spain. Qadhafi subsequently called on pilgrims to the
 Islamic holy places to attack their fellow Libyans who opposed
 the "revolution."  In November there was a much publicized
 claim by the government radio that Libyan agents had
 assassinated former Libyan Prime Minister Abdel Hamid
 al-Bakoush in Cairo, but the Egyptian Government revealed that
 it had intercepted the assassination team, prevented the
 killing, and duped Qadhafi into believing Bakoush had been
 Killed. When Libya claimed credit for the death, Bakoush was
 presented alive and well to the press.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reports of summary executions were common in 1984, in addition
 to continued reports of deaths by torture and hangings. On
 June 13, Amnesty International expressed alarm at the summary
 public hanging of seven prisoners by local 'people's' bodies
 in support of Qadhafi's call for the liquidation of "stray
 dogs and traitors." Amnesty International said that these
 seven persons had been arbitrarily arrested and hanged
 publicly without trial, two within an hour of their arrest, on
 suspicion of opposition to the regime. Amnesty International
 called on the Government to renounce its official policy of
 .physical liquidation" of its enemies.
 The assassination campaign against Libyan exiles, a form of
 domestic persecution practiced abroad, followed an April 1980
 address in which Qadhafi issued an ultimatum to his enemies
 abroad to return to Libya or be killed. Although the campaign
 was not openly resumed in 1982, Qadhafi made two speeches in
 early October of that year in which he threatened to renew the
 killings. Qadhafi was reportedly advised to defer
 implementation of his threats, but during 1984 the campaign
 was openly renewed. In 1982, some exiled dissidents received
 threatening communications from Libyan officials including, in
 some cases, letters from the General Revolutionary Committee
 in Tripoli revoking their citizenship and vowing to "liquidate
 
 
 1316
 LIBYA
 them physically.' There are reports that pro-Qadhafi groups
 have met in Europe periodically to select assassination
 targets. These threats have been taken seriously among Libyan
 exiles. The constant fear of assassination as a result of
 this threat in itself constitutes a form of terrorism. In
 1984, Qadhafi ordered all Libyan students studying abroad to
 return to Libya for a political meeting. Several of those who
 did were interrogated and tortured, and some were among the
 Libyans hanged or shot by local committees, including student
 committees, in the purge which followed the May 8 coup attempt.
 On May 8, there was an attempted coup by the National Front
 for the Salvation of Libya, an exile opposition group. There
 were unconfirmed reports of fighting at Qadhafi's barracks,
 and a government attack on dissidents in an apartment house in
 downtown Tripoli. When the shooting stopped, the Government
 claimed there had been no attack on Qadhafis barracks but
 showed films of at least 15 dissidents who had been killed. A
 nationwide crackdown followed, resulting in the arrest of
 thousands of Libyans. Many were condemned to death and
 executed in gruesome public spectacles.
 b. Disappearance
 There continue to be reports that Libyan businessmen, former
 government officials, religious oppositionists, and political
 activists have been taken into government custody with no
 further information available as to their condition or
 whereabouts or the charges against them. Amnesty
 International has stated that detainees apparently have been
 held incommunicado for unlimited periods in centers operated
 by the intelligence services. The number of such reports
 increased dramatically following the arrest of up to 5,000
 Libyans in the mop-up operation after the May 8 coup attempt.
 Press reports indicate that the total number of executions
 following this incident may have exceeded 100.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 During 1984, reports of torture and mistreatment of prisoners
 increased. Detainees in criminal and security cases
 reportedly are regularly beaten during interrogation. In some
 prisons, conditions reportedly are tolerable but, according to
 information received by Amnesty International, conditions of
 detention for political prisoners have worsened, including
 transfer to overcrowded cells and confiscation of reading and
 writing materials. There have been many reports of hangings
 and torture following the May 8 incident. Some of those
 arrested have been shown making confessions on Libyan
 television, their faces and hands bearing what appeared to be
 marks of torture.
 In its report Torture in the Eighties, Amnesty International
 noted that reports of torture and ill-treatment in Libya were
 rarely received until after the 1980 official call for the
 *physical liquidation of enemies of the 1969 revolution living
 abroad and of counter-revolutionary elements within Libya,"
 and that afterward, in the wake of the reported arrest of
 hundreds of people, it began to receive first-hand testimony
 about torture and ill-treatment, inflicted mainly to obtain
 confessions and information. It noted that some had
 reportedly died under torture. The methods of torture most
 
 
 1317
 LIBYA
 commonly reported include electric shocks and beatings on the
 soles of the feet.
 Amnesty International has also expressed concern about the
 large number of offenses, including political offenses, which
 are punishable by death under Libyan law. For example,
 membership in an illegal organization is a capital offense.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Libyan law, detainees may be held incommunicado for
 unlimited periods. Many allegedly are held without charge or
 trial, apparently as an example to would-be opponents of the
 Qadhafi regime. Some are said to have been released quickly;
 others reportedly were beaten.
 Libya declared several years ago that there were then 'no
 political detainees on any charge in its prisons.' Reports
 from a variety of sources, however, assert that the prisons
 contain increased numbers of persons convicted of, or held
 for, political offenses, including several thousand persons
 arrested in 1984. Qadhafi has personally justified
 imprisonment on political, as opposed to criminal, charges.
 In a 1981 speech he stated, *Those who are put into prisons
 are there because they are the enemies of the people and they
 fight for restoring the government above the people. There is
 nu shame and there is nothing wrong in putting these persons
 in prison or in treading on them with your feet.' During 1984
 up to 5,000 persons were reportedly arrested, hundreds of whom
 are believed to have been killed.
 In April 1983, the authorities detained eight West German
 nationals who ultimately were released in May in exchange for
 two Libyan nationals who had been imprisoned in Bonn for
 torturing fellow Libyans at the Libyan People's Bureau there
 in 1982. In October 1983, Libya refused to permit the exit of
 any French nationals for several days, apparently because a
 Libyan accused of murder in Italy was being held by the
 French. These incidents demonstrate that foreigners in Libya
 are also subject to arbitrary arrest and detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The normal court structure in Libya has been bypassed to a
 significant extent by the "people's courts," which conducted
 .show trials' and executions in 1984. The parallel legal
 system provides fewer safeguards, and trials are frequently
 held in camera or in absentia. Over the years, the
 authorities have put considerable pressure on the legal
 profession. For example, a book by exile attorney 'Imran
 Muhammad Buruways claims Qadhafi in 1977 personally threatened
 to execute the director and board of the Libyan Lawyers' Union
 if it did not issue a certain statement. The pressure
 culminated in a 1981 law prohibiting the private practice of
 law and making all attorneys employees of the Secretariat of
 Justice. The Union of Arab Lawyers, located in France, has
 expressed concern for the ability and freedom of attorneys
 simultaneously to provide legal defense for political
 prisoners and to serve as government employees. There is thus
 some question about the claim by Libyan authorities that they
 .guarantee prisoners all necessary means of defense and
 safeguards of justice adequate to the principles contained in
 the Declaration of Human Rights.' They also claim that the
 accused may contact their lawyers and families "as soon as
 
 
 1318
 LIBYA
 possible with respect to the exigencies of interrogation,' but
 there are numerous reports to the contrary.
 In routine civil or criminal cases, these claims may reflect
 accurately the prevailing situation. However, in security
 cases, there are many reports of prisoners being held
 incomunicado and without trial for long periods. While
 undergoing interrogation, sometimes for periods of several
 months, they are given no access to legal representation.
 Alleged political offenses seem increasingly to be tried
 before ad hoc "revolutionary courts' rather than through the
 normal judiciary procedure, with the opportunities for defense
 severely restricted.
 Amnesty International reported that 25 former members of the
 pro-Iraqi Ba'ath party were arrested in February 1983 and
 tried as members of an illegal organization. They reportedly
 were acquitted at their trial, but were subsequently held in
 detention by administrative decree. In July they were
 reportedly tried again by a revolutionary court. Three were
 sentenced to death, and two received eight-year prison
 sentences. The remaining 20 reportedly were acquitted and are
 believed to have been released.
 There is no precise estimate of the number of political
 prisoners in Libya. As a result of the events in 1984, the
 number may be several thousand.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government recognizes no right to privacy which would
 hinder its ability to carry out its policies, and fear of the
 security apparatus severely restricts individual expression.
 The legal requirement that judicial warrants must first be
 obtained before entering a private home reportedly is often
 disregarded. Local and international telephone calls are
 routinely monitored. Qadhafi relies heavily for his personal
 security on a network of secret police, informers, and
 bodyguards. The informer network extends to the revolutionary
 committees and other local organizations and does not respect
 individual privacy.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is severely limited, particularly with
 regard to any criticism of the Government or Qadhafi. Some
 difference of opinion is tolerated in people's committee
 meetings and the General People's Congress. In general,
 however, most Libyans are circumspect about voicing dissident
 views about the regime's policies. Freedom of speech and
 other basic civil and political freedoms are further
 restricted during periods of internal security crises. Libyan
 media are owned and controlled by the Government. JANA, the
 official news agency, is the designated conduit for
 politically acceptable opinions. It is impossible to publish
 opinions contrary to Qadhafi's current policies. There is an
 underlying climate of fear and mistrust at all levels of
 society which severely restricts freedom of speech. Although
 dissent is not tolerated within Libya, a number of opposition
 groups in exile are increasingly active in their criticism of
 Qadhafi's regime and human rights violations and in efforts to
 
 
 1319
 LIBYA
 overthrow his regime. The National Front for the Salvation of
 Lioya claimed responsibility for the aborted coup attempt on
 May 8.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of association is granted only to those institutions
 affiliated with the regime apparatus. Attempts at public
 assembly are repressed if they are not government-controlled
 and supportive of regime positions. Organizations such as
 trade unions and professional associations are viewed as
 threats by Qadhafi, who has vowed not to *accept interme-
 diaries between the revolution and its working forces.'
 Unions are organized under government control and are adminis-
 tered through the popular committee system. Collective bar-
 gaining does not occur. There have been no reports of strikes
 for years--presumably they are not permitted. An exiled
 opposition group in June 1983 appealed to the International
 Labor Organization to investigate 'the oppressive record of
 tne Qadhafi regime with regard to its treatment of workers and
 laborers and employees in Libya, with particular emphasis on
 violations of human rights agreements and conventions gov-
 erning labor and labor unions.' This group also charged that
 Libya has forced foreign workers and employees into military
 training with the intention of coercing them into military and
 subversive activities against their own countries. Reports
 from other sources support this claim, including the case of
 individuals sent by Libya to fight in Chad.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. Services are permitted in
 some Christian churches. There is a resident Catholic bishop,
 and the small number of priests and nuns are reportedly
 permitted to wear their habits. The regime has banned the
 once-powerful Sanusiyya Islamic religious organization as part
 of Qadhafi's efforts to eliminate rival power bases.
 Restrictions were placed on the operation of the organi-
 zation's Zawaayaa (lodges), a government supervisor was
 appointed for Sanusi properties, and the Sanusi-sponsored
 Islamic University was merged with the University of Libya.
 Nearly all of the formerly large Jewish community has emi-
 grated. No information is available on the status of any Jews
 who may remain; however, virulently anti-Jewish broadcasts on
 Libyan radio contributed to anti-Jewish violence in 1982 in
 portions of Tunisia within broadcasting range.
 It is not known what became of 15 persons reportedly arrested
 in a Tripoli mosque in late 1980. Amnesty International
 reported that it received information that five of these
 persons, including a mosque official, may have been executed
 in 1981. Amnesty International's requests to the Libyan
 Justice Secretary for information on this and other cases have
 gone unanswered.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 With the exception of security areas, internal freedom of
 movement is not usually restricted for Libyan citizens. An
 exit permit is required for travel abroad. Military conscrip-
 tion regulations have led to some restrictions on the issuance
 of exit permits to potential inductees. As of the summer of
 1983 when Libya invaded Chad, persons of draft age who had not
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 84
 
 
 1320
 LIBYA
 yet served or had not obtained exemptions were not allowed to
 leave. In many instances approval for travel for such persons
 is subject to the whims of officials. It is reportedly
 increasingly difficult for Libyans suspected of inadequate
 revolutionary attitudes to travel abroad. During 1982 the
 authorities reportedly withdrew the passports of some persons
 suspected of intending to have contacts with Libyan exiles.
 Information concerning current Libyan policy with regard to
 emigration or voluntary repatriation is unavailable. Under
 Libyan Islamic law, wives may not leave the country without
 husbands' permission; children may not travel without their
 father's consent. Restrictions limit the amount of currency
 which can be taken out of the country to about $1,000 (300
 dinars) per year regardless of the number of trips. There are
 no restrictions on the amount of currency brought in.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Major government decisions are controlled by Qadhafi or by
 committees acting in his name. He makes all appointments of
 military officers and official functionaries down to a low
 level. Power flows through a small circle of trusted
 associates, whose own authority is a reflection of their
 proximity to Qadhafi. Corruption has assumed major
 proportions, with adverse effects for local government.
 Officially, Libya describes itself as the world's only
 Jamahiriya, or 'Republic of the Masses.' Major changes in the
 organization of the Libyan state occurred in 1977 designed to
 provide the "Jamahiriya.* Qadhafi sought to replace
 subnational leaders, chosen on traditional and cultural bases,
 with leaders selected by and presumably loyal to Qadhafi. The
 changes centered on the establishment of the General People's
 Committee and a series of subordinate popular committees.
 Although political parties have been outlawed, many people
 have some involvement in the system through the local
 committees. Efforts have been made to recruit women and
 members of the Berber minority in this local political
 structure.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In its 1984 report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the continued detention and imprisonment of prisoners of
 conscience; the continued detention of political prisoners,
 including prisoners of conscience, who continued to be held
 after having been acquitted of charges against them or having
 completed their sentences; the prolonged detention without
 charge of political suspects; repeated allegations of torture;
 and judicial executions for allegedly political crimes.
 Freedom House classifies Libya as 'not free.* Libya is
 currently serving a second term on the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Libya's substantial oil wealth has allowed the regime to
 improve living standards significantly, especially for the
 lower class, despite rampant corruption and the curtailment of
 freedom. Per capita gross domestic product rose from $5,560
 in 1971 to $11,700 in 1980 before slipping to $8,476 last
 year.
 
 
 1321
 LIBYA
 Libya has abided by the cut in its OPEC quota from 1.1 million
 barrels per day to 900,000 made by the OPEC conference in
 October. The current budget marked a modest surplus last
 year. Budget expenditures for the past two years have been
 scaled back and many projects under the 1981-85 plan have been
 delayed. These measures have reduced the abundance and
 variety of consumer goods, and chronic shortages have been
 reported. More critical than revenue cuts is the drawdown in
 liquid assets.
 Investment in health facilities and a marked growth in female
 literacy over the past decade have contributed to an increase
 in life expectancy at birth from 52 years in 1971 to 58 in
 1984. However, the infant mortality rate was 84 per 1,000
 live births in 1984, an increase from the rate of 53 per 1,000
 in 1971. Population, estimated at 3,749,000, is increasing at
 about 6.5 percent a year. Between 1971 and 1979 the
 percentage of the population with access to safe water
 increased from 58 to 100, and the percentage of calorie supply
 available for consumption relative to nutritional requirements
 increased from 105 to 122. Salt water encroachment into
 littoral aquifiers, however, is contaminating fresh water
 supplies in some urban centers, forcing the Government to
 undertake massive water relocation projects.
 Qadhafi's efforts to provide women with military and
 university training and change their status in the society
 have met with mixed success and have created some tension
 among various groups in the society.
