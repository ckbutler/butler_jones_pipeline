 MOZAMBIQUE
 After five centuries as a Portuguese colony, Mozambique gained
 independence in 1975 following a decade of guerrilla warfare
 waged by FRELIMO (Front for the Liberation of Mozambique),
 which then took power. The Government is run by a Council of
 Ministers appointed by the President, who is also the head of
 the FRELIMO party. It is the only functioning party and
 establishes the general parameters of government policies.
 FRELIMO espouses socialism tempered by nationalism and
 pragmatism.
 With independence, the new Government confronted growing
 activities of the National Resistance Movement. The sharp
 rise in the armed conflict in 1984 resulted in serious
 incidents in which civilians were frequently the victims.
 Trains, buses, and cars were attacked and the occupants shot
 and burned. Rural villages were pillaged, with the residents
 often killed, kidnapped, or disfigured. For their part,
 security forces eager to press the fight against the
 resistance at times also committed atrocities. Excessive
 measures by the security forces caused President Machel to
 wage a public campaign against such abuses and to replace in
 mid-year the Minister of Interior and the Minister of
 Security, both of whom had been closely associated with the
 harsh security measures. Dozens of other security officials
 were also dismissed or jailed. In March, 1984, the Government
 of Mozambique and the South African Government signed the
 Nkomati Accord, by which each side agreed not to let its
 territory be used as a staging area for insurgent attacks on
 the other. Later in 1984, negotiations began under the
 auspices of the South African Government to attempt to achieve
 a ceasefire in Mozambique. To date, no significant progress
 has been made in reducing hostilities.
 There were some positive developments in 1984. For example,
 some of the most blatant abuses which took place during 1983
 ceased, including the ending of public executions and public
 whippings. Fifty-two individuals, imprisoned for political
 crimes such as espionage and working for the former colonial
 power, were granted amnesty in September 1984. "Operation
 Production," instituted in 1983 to move large numbers of urban
 unemployed to rural areas, also came to a halt. Organized
 religion continued to operate with relative freedom.
 Nevertheless, the human rights outlook remains tenuous due to
 domestic violence, economic problems, and fragile social and
 political institutions.
 Mozambique ranks among the world's poorest nations. Per
 capita gross national product was estimated at $376 in 1982,
 but has probably dropped since then. The country faces a
 large balance of payments deficit and has rescheduled its
 foreign debt. The lack of trained personnel is one of many
 obstacles to rapid economic and social development. About 85
 percent of the population is engaged in subsistence
 agriculture. The economy has deteriorated steadily over the
 past few years as a consequence of successive natural
 calamities (prolonged severe drought and heavy localized
 flooding), disruptions caused by resistance activity, and
 ill-conceived economic policy. The Government is taking some
 remedial steps in economic policy, including: increasing
 support to the family and private sectors in agriculture,
 boosting producer prices, and controlling public sector hiring
 and wages. It also became a member of the IMF/IBRD system.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The continuing war between government and resistance forces
 has led to the death of both Mozambican and foreign
 civilians. The insurgents have been brutally violent,
 killing, maiming, and kidnapping their targets. Government
 military actions have also contributed to civilian casualties
 in contested areas. Precise figures are unavailable, although
 the total number of fatalities is estimated to be in the
 hundreds. The insurgents have targeted, in particular, party
 and government officials and foreign workers. Several
 Portuguese are known to have been assassinated during the
 year, as was an Italian priest.
 There were no known public executions of those convicted of
 economic offenses or other crimes against the state as had
 occurred during the previous year. At the beginning of 1984,
 President Machel announced a general amnesty for those rebels
 who voluntarily turned themselves in with their weapons.
 There have been no reports of harm to those taking advantage
 of the amnesty, although it is possible that captured rebels
 may have been sentenced by military tribunals which have the
 power to impose capital punishment in closed proceedings that
 do not provide for defense counsel.
 b. Disappearance
 Although the occasionally arbitrary nature of judicial and
 police activities has led to situations in which relatives and
 friends of detainees lose track of prisoners, there are no
 confirmed reports of government-sponsored disappearances. The
 resistance has abducted thousands, usually villagers,
 sometimes conscripting them into their movement. On occasion
 the resistance also kidnapped or killed foreign residents.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In 1983 the Government legalized floggings for a wide range of
 crimes including black marketeering. There have been several
 reported cases of injury. Prisons are generally overcrowded
 and characterized by inadequate food, hygiene, and medical
 care. Apart from its regular prisons, the Government
 established, shortly after independence, "reeducation centers"
 in remote parts of the country where political prisoners and
 other "anti-social elements" (e.g., prostitutes, black
 marketeers, etc.) are interned. The prisoners may be given
 sentences of indeterminate length. Conditions at the centers
 are harsh and prisoners must feed and shelter themselves.
 Reports by occasional visitors describe extremely spartan
 living conditions. There have been allegations of capricious
 and cruel treatment by guards.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and detention occur in Mozambique.
 Preventive detention may be employed if officials believe a
 crime is probable or imminent. Although the concept of habeas
 corpus is acknowledged in Mozambique law, it is not always
 
 
 230
 MOZAMBIQUE
 followed. A suspect may be held up to 90 days before charges
 are brought in serious cases, and for shorter periods in
 lesser cases. This period is meant to be used for
 investigative purposes, and may be extended only once, for an
 additional 90 days, if the state requires more time to prepare
 its case. In practice, however, once charges are brought,
 prisoners sometimes languish in prison for months before they
 are brought to trial. Detainees may be released from prison
 prior to their trial but there appears to be no well-defined
 system of bail. There are cases where the individuals, both
 Mozambican and foreigners, are held incommunicado.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Partly because of the Portuguese influence, Mozambique employs
 an inquisitional, rather than adversary, system of justice.
 In cases which the court rules to be of insufficient
 significance, the accused are denied access to defense
 counsel. Public defenders are available in other cases.
 The Government exerts strong influence over the judiciary,
 which suffers from the lack of qualified personnel and a firm
 institutional base. However, continuing efforts are made to
 train lawyers and judges.
 Judgment is rendered by the judge and two or four elected
 jurors. In so-called people's tribunals in rural areas,
 individuals with only rudimentary education and legal
 knowledge are expected to exercise common sense and apply
 general principles. Military tribunals try both civilian and
 military personnel in cases involving "crimes against the
 people and state security." This definition has been expanded
 to include economic criminals such as black marketeers.
 Military tribunals operate in camera and are composed of
 military personnel, some of whom may have legal training.
 Right of appeal is recognized for non-military cases involving
 sentences of eight or more years, and persons sentenced to
 death may appeal to the President of the Republic.
 There is no reliable estimate of persons detained for
 political reasons. Over the almost 10 years of independence,
 the total could add up to several thousand if reeducation camp
 inmates are included. There have been claims that 3,500-6,000
 resistance troops are in custody. However, most observers
 believe there is a downward trend in the numbers of persons
 incarcerated for their political beliefs.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The degrading "Operation Production" which forcibly relocated
 thousands from large urban areas to the countryside in 1983,
 halted in 1984. A few of the most blatant abuses were
 corrected as some people were allowed back to their former
 dwelling places. People are not forced to belong to FRELIMO.
 However, the party attempts to establish local chapters in
 most functioning government and business organizations. There
 is a notable correlation of professional advancement and party
 membership, although it is not total.
 It is widely assumed that surveillance devices are employed in
 local and international telecommunications systems. There
 have also been instances of tampering with mail, especially
 the international post.
 
 
 231
 MOZAMBIQUE
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 At the local level, especially in rural areas, there is
 considerable openness for the people to express their views on
 prevailing conditions. For example, magazines and newspapers
 often contain articles or letters to the editor complaining
 about the lack of goods and social services, or the
 ineffectiveness of a particular individual. However, no
 outright opposition to government policies is permitted. The
 Government owns all authorized publications in the country as
 well as the radio and experimental television facilities. The
 media promote the Government's general philosophy and its
 viewpoints on issues, but there is reporting on abuses within
 the system or flaws in the implementation of policies where
 the Government itself has admitted to errors. Journalists are
 subject to pressures from the government-sanctioned
 association of journalists to which they must belong. Despite
 the ban on travel of South Africa-based journalists to the
 southern African "Front Line States," some journalists based
 in South Africa continue to visit Mozambique and conduct
 interviews.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While there are private groups of individuals who join
 together for common interests, and while religious
 organizations are largely autonomous, the Government does
 exercise influence over most associations. It also sponsors a
 wide variety of important bodies such as women's
 organizations, youth leagues, etc.
 In 1983 the Government established the Mozambique Workers'
 Organization, intended to function as a national labor union,
 and which remains affiliated to the FRELIMO ruling party.
 However, an organized union movement has yet to develop, and
 labor presently has little influence on economic policy or
 politics. There' are occasional exchanges of delegations in
 the labor field with other countries, especially with those of
 Eastern Europe. Existing labor law is generally very
 favorable to the employee, but in practice it is difficult to
 enforce because of the fragility of the institutions
 associated with labor. The Mozambique Workers' Organization
 is a member of the continent-wide, Ghana-based, Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Mozambique. Although the
 Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, the Government
 has placed restrictions on the activities of religious
 groups. It has reserved the right to decide whether
 individual church buildings can be operational and whether
 individual clergy can visit outlying areas. It has stated its
 intention eventually to nationalize churches, schools, and
 hospitals. The Government still closely monitors religious
 activities, limits the number of dioceses in the country, and
 insists that the character of the religious groups be
 Mozambican and that they not act as representatives of
 external groups. The practice of traditional African
 religions is officially criticized and ridiculed but permitted.
 The Government has, however, continued to relax administrative
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 16
 
 
 232
 MOZAMBIQUE
 restrictions on the religious community. The right of
 churches to operate and follow their rites and ceremonies has
 been affirmed, and the Government has agreed to hear requests
 for reopening churches which closed during the uncertain
 period following independence. Government authorities have
 also granted the clergy greater access to outlying districts
 and parishes. Membership in a religious group per se does not
 appear to affect, either favorably or unfavorably, a person's
 secular standing, although, since it is incompatible with
 party membership, it is likely to hinder advancement in the
 political sphere.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel and relocation within the country are controlled by
 security and employment requirements under the rationale of
 assuring public and social order. Mozambicans are required to
 carry an identity card, work card, and residence permit.
 Mozambicans planning to travel outside their city of residence
 must obtain a travel permit from local government authorities.
 Temporary visits abroad are permitted. Mozambican law does
 not address the issue of emigration, but in some cases would
 be emigrants have been imprisoned or interned in reeducation
 camps. Thousands fled from Mozambique at independence
 because of economic chaos and fears of political persecution.
 In the past few years, additional thousands have fled, some
 only temporarily because of the deteriorating security
 situation created by the guerrilla war and because of
 continuing economic hardship including the drought. In 1981
 the Government announced a policy of welcoming back
 Mozambicans who had left the country, and in 1982 it passed a
 law allowing for the reacquisition of citizenship for
 Mozambicans who had left the country and assumed another
 nationality. Initially, some Mozambicans who had opposed the
 party before independence were jailed upon their return to the
 country. More recently, Mozambicans who have accepted the
 Government's invitation to return have apparently not suffered
 harassment or retribution.
 Mozambique is not a party to any international agreement on
 the status of refugees. The Government has not been known to
 repatriate forcibly refugees to countries in which they fear
 persecution. Most refugees in Mozambique come from South
 Africa, Latin America, and Malawi. Despite Mozambique's weak
 economy, the Government has contributed to the welfare of
 these refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The only legal party, FRELIMO, dominates political activity in
 the country. The party and the Government are controlled by a
 small cadre of senior officials. While structures for a mass
 political involvement exist at the provincial, district, and
 local levels, they do not provide significant citizen
 participation. The party and Government espouse a system of
 "People's Democracy" where decisions are made by consensus; in
 practice this means that policies and initiatives emanate from
 above. Election to representative bodies is made from a
 single slate and the electorate has the option of endorsing or
 rejecting candidates pre-selected by the party. Votes by the
 National People's Assembly endorsing government policies are
 
 
 23
 MOZAMBIQUE
 usually unanimous. Individual ethnic groups are treated
 equally, and tribal affiliation appears to have slight
 correlation to political outlook. The number of ethnic Indian
 and white Mozambicans holding important positions is
 disproportionately high, a reflection of their greater
 educational opportunities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Mozambique is a member of the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission. Amnesty International's 1984 Report (covering
 1983) expressed concern about the long-term detention without
 trial of suspected opponents of the Government, including some
 reported detainees arrested before independence in 1975;
 unfair trial procedures; and allegations of beatings and
 ill-treatment of prisoners. Freedom House describes
 Mozambique as "not free." The Government claims to be holding
 several thousand resistance adherents, but so far has not
 allowed international relief organizations access to them.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mozambique has a population estimated at 13.4 million, 85
 percent of which is engaged in subsistence agriculture.
 Because of drought, lack of security, and mismanagement, food
 production has fallen far short of domestic requirements.
 Accordingly, the country spent a significant amount of its
 meager foreign exchange on food imports and relied on very
 sizable food aid grants from abroad, including emergency aid
 from the U.S. Although the drought conditions have improved,
 considerable foreign food aid will still be required in 1985.
 In 1977, caloric supply available for consumption was
 estimated to be only 81.5 percent of nutritional
 requirements. The Government does not actively promote
 population control programs and the population growth rate was
 estimated at 2.8 percent in 1984.
 The industrial sector also faces severe problems.
 Productivity has suffered from shortages of raw materials,
 equipment, spare parts, and trained personnel. A lack of
 foreign exchange has prevented the country from easing the
 shortages through imports. As a result, most factories
 operate at less than 50 percent capacity, and even companies
 that produce for export have work stoppages.
 The economic system is socialist and governmental enterprises
 dominate all sectors of the economy. Individuals are allowed
 to operate small businesses, but the right to own property is
 restricted. In 1983 the Government indicated publicly that
 small private farming should be encouraged and began to turn
 land over to the private sector. Mozambique continues to
 solicit foreign investment. Various companies have begun to
 explore for oil and gas. The Government published an
 investment code in 1984, signed an agreement with the U.S.
 Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and joined the IMF
 and IBRD. Medical care is significantly better in
 metropolitan areas. For example, the infant mortality rate now
 averages 141.0 per 1,000 nationwide, but varies from a low of
 35-40 per thousand in sections of the capital to a high of 200
 per thousand in some rural areas. Life expectancy at birth is
 51.3 years but, again, there are wide differences among
 various parts of the country.
 
 
 234
 MOZAMBIQUE
 The Government continued its inoculation campaign, aimed
 primarily at children. Because so many of them are
 malnourished, children are particularly susceptible to disease
 (measles is a major killer), and as many as 40 percent of all
 deaths in the country occur among children under the age of
 five. Probably less than 10 percent of the population has
 access to safe water supplies and, even in large cities,
 outbreaks of cholera occur.
 Education continues to be a priority. The Government has
 emphasized teacher training programs, particularly in rural
 areas. The World Bank estimated that the primary school
 enrollment ratio was 68.2 (78.3 for males, 58.3 for females)
 in 1981. Even taking into account that these figures include
 adults enrolled in primary school, they would appear to be
 high. A more realistic estimate would be a ratio of 50 to 60
 for both males and females. Furthermore, even the lower
 figure can be misleading because of the poor quality of
 schools. Similarly, the World Bank estimated the literacy
 rate at 33.2 percent in 1980. Although the literacy rate has
 risen as a result of government programs, a rate of 20 percent
 (including those who are only semi-literate) would probably be
 more accurate. Other than the inequalities between rural and
 urban areas, the Government attempts to apportion social
 services more or less equally among the populations.
 The status of women in Mozambique did not alter appreciably
 over the past year. Both the national Constitution and
 FRELIMO party policy provide that there shall be no
 discrimination on the basis of sex. In fact, however, two
 societies exist: a) the contemporary society of the larger
 urban areas; and b) the more traditional society of the rural
 areas. Women play a prominent role in the urban society.
 They have equal access to education. There is a surprisingly
 large number of women in the professions, the military, and
 within the bureaucracy, and many hold policy positions. They
 also engage in a wide range of economic activity, including
 commerce. In the political area, the Minister of Education
 and Culture is a woman, but no other women occupy ministerial
 or vice ministerial ranks. Moreover, there are no women on
 the FRELIMO Politburo, and women on the Central Committee are
 a small minority. There is a new organization devoted to
 women's affairs. In the rural areas, traditional practices
 reinforce discrimination against women. Specific customs vary
 according to ethnic grouping, but generally women do much of
 the manual labor in agriculture as well as care for the home
 and family. In certain ethnic groups, women may retain the
 earnings from cash crops they cultivate, but in most instances
 economic and political decisions are taken by men.
