 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany is a stable parliamentary
 democracy in which the head of government--the
 Chancellor--plays a central role. Although the Chancellor is
 elected by the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) and can be
 replaced by it, an incumbent chancellor enjoys a powerful
 position, approaching that of an American president. The
 legitimation of the system is based on the principle of
 majority rule, as reflected in free and fair elections by
 secret ballot.
 The Federal Republic of Germany, founded in 1949, is the first
 stable democracy in the modern sense on German soil. The
 founders of the Federal Republic took a number of steps to
 avoid the instabilities of the classical European parliamentary
 system of government, as manifested by the Weimar Republic
 (1919-1933), notably by strengthening the position of the head
 of government, discouraging the development of splinter
 parties, and by passing laws which make the parties themselves
 integral parts of the national political decision-making
 process.
 The Constitution ("Basic Law") of the Federal Republic also
 provides for an essentially free market economic system, but
 with a strong "social" element.
 Thirteen years of rule by a coalition of the Social Democratic
 Party and the centrist Free Democratic Party ended in
 September, 1982, to be replaced by a new coalition of the
 Christian Democratic Party, its Bavarian sister party, (the
 Christian Social Union), and the Free Democratic Party. There
 have been no changes in the observance of human rights in the
 Federal Republic over the past year. The new coalition
 Government, if it continues in office beyond national elections
 scheduled for March, 1983, is not expected to restrict human
 rights in any way. It may, however, marginally strengthen
 measures designed to limit residual terrorism and to limit
 subversion of the Republic by pro-Soviet or other communist
 elements.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Politically motivated killing by the government or by
 oppositional political organizations among citizens of the
 Federal Republic is unknown, with the exception of occasional
 acts of violence carried out by extremely small terrorist
 groups on the far left (the Baader-Meinhof group), the far
 right (neo-Nazi groups), and among some groups of resident
 foreigners. The frequency, success, and political impact of
 such acts have diminished markedly since the mid-1970's. There
 were three car bombings, in which the drivers were the targets,
 at American military housing areas in the Federal Republic
 during 1982. The government of the Federal Republic, including
 the President, has expressed its outrage at these attacks,
 which caused no deaths, and is investigating them.

 Left-wing terrorism in the country had its roots in the
 "extra-parliamentary opposition" movement of the late 1960's
 and early 1970's. By 1982, many, but not all, of the
 Baader-Meinhof activists had been imprisoned, or had sought
 refuge in other countries. The federal government and the
 involved state-level governments have been scrupulous in
 protecting the human rights of imprisoned suspects and
 convicted terrorists.
 Extreme right wing terrorism has not recovered from the
 October, 1981, arrest of its most notorious proponent,
 Karl-Heinz Hoffmann. Hoffmann, leader of the "Defense Sport
 Group Hoffmann," was jailed for complicity in the murder of a
 Jewish businessman and his wife.
 There is a problem with political violence, including killing,
 among feuding factions of foreigners resident in the country,
 notably among Turks and Iranian students. As in its dealings
 with German terrorists, the government has been extremely
 careful to respect the rights and privileges of foreigners
 involved in such crimes. The new government has promised a
 broader policy designed to reduce the number of foreigners
 living in the country, and, at the same time, has increased its
 efforts to complete the integration of those foreigners legally
 resident who want to remain. To the extent that these new
 policies succeed, the causes and therefore the prospects for
 political violence among foreign residents may decrease.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by government authorities. There have
 been no kidnappings in recent years by terrorist groups for
 political motives.
 c. Torture
 Torture, whether physical or mental, is not intentionally
 inflicted by government authorities on prisoners. It is
 neither authorized by the Basic Law nor tolerated in practice.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There is no known discrimination in the treatment of prisoners
 on the basis of social class, race, sex or religion.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no reports of any prisoners in the country imprisoned
 in substantial disregard of, generally accepted principles.
 Article 104 of the Basic Law prohibits arbitrary arrest and is
 scrupulously respected in practice. Any person arrested by the
 police must be brought before a judge within 24 hours (or 48
 hours under-exceptional circumstances). There is no preventive
 detention, except that a prisoner may be detained no longer
 than 24 hours while awaiting a formal charge if there is
 evidence that he might seek to flee the country to avoid
 prosecution. Bail bond exists in the Federal Republic but is
 seldom employed.
 
 
 911
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Basic Law guarantees due process and prohibits ex post
 facto laws and double jeopardy. It also requires that a judge
 (who must charge a prisoner within 24 hours after arrest) shall
 inform a prisoner of the reasons for his detention, examine
 him, and give him an opportunity to raise objections. The
 independence of the judiciary is assured by the Basic Law. A
 prisoner is entitled to counsel at any time. The Federal
 Republic's judiciary system is independent of political
 influence. (On occasion, prominent German political figures
 have themselves been subject to court proceedings.) There are
 no "political courts." Military courts deal only with military
 personnel.
 g. invasion of the Home
 Article 13 of the Basic Law guarantees the sanctity of the
 home, and it is respected in practice. Police may enter a home
 forcibly only with a warrant issued by a judge (or, in an
 emergency, by a public prosecutor). "Bugging" also requires a
 court warrant.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Includingz
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press is guaranteed under the
 Basic Law. Any political point of view may be expressed or
 reflected in the press or news media; criticism of the
 government is unrestricted. There is no censorship of the
 media or books and artistic works. Academic freedom is
 unfettered.
 German newspapers are privately owned. German radio and
 television are independent "corporations under public law" and
 governed by independent collegial boards made up of
 representatives of various political parties, churches, and
 other organizations.
 The new coalition Government is favorably inclined towards
 private access 1o the "new" media (cable television and
 satellite broadcasting).
 There is no "self-censorship" by journalists or media
 correspondents. However, the press corps in the Federal
 Republic is, by tradition, respectful of political leaders and
 disinclined to take an 'adversary" attitude towards the actions
 of government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of assembly is uninhibited by the government.
 Demonstrators are required to obtain permits to conduct planned
 demonstrations. There have been a number of very large-scale
 "peace" demonstrations in the country over the past year. They
 have generally been peaceful, with both the police and
 demonstration organizers determined to prevent violence. The
 police generally are highly disciplined and restrained and are
 as inconspicuous at such events as circumstances permit. Where
 there is a chance of violence, the police are usually prepared
 to respond with a massive show of force, in order to avoid
 having to use it.
 
 
 912
 Labor unions in the Federal Republic occasionally demonstrate,
 invariably peacefully, concerning their grievances. There has
 been an increase in the number and scale of labor
 demonstrations, as the worst recession since the end of the
 Second World War has taken hold in the country. Workers are
 highly organized, with most unions consolidated into one major
 labor confederation, the German Trade Union Federation.
 Unions are not organized, controlled, or influenced by the
 state. Historically, the great majority of labor leaders has
 been sympathetic to the Social Democratic Party and supportive
 of its policies.
 The professions, academics, and a host of other special
 interests are also highly organized. They are in no way
 government-controlled or intimidated. Unions and other
 organizations are free to associate in any way they choose with
 .collateral foreign organizations, and they do so on a large
 scale.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There-is no state or otherwise-favored religion in the
 country. All major religious groups benefit from the state
 through the church-tax system, and church-affiliated schools
 are subsidized by the Government.
 The population of the Federal Republic is overwhelmingly
 Christian, about equally divided between the Catholic and
 Protestant (largely Lutheran) churches. Political
 organizations, including the parties, are no longer actively
 concerned with reflecting a balance between the two major
 Christian confessions. In the new cabinet, nine ministers
 (including Chancellor Kohl) are Catholic, five are Protestant,
 and two have no religious affiliation. There is no
 discrimination in the country against persons affiliated with
 minority religions.
 Religious:affiliation does carry some political advantage or
 disadvantage, depending on the religious preferences of the
 population in various parts of the country. Protestant
 politicians tend to be prominent in the generally Protestant
 northern half of the Federal Republic; Catholics, on the other
 hand, stand out in the south. Religious affiliation conveys no
 discernible advantage or disadvantage in the civil service,
 economic life, or -the military.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 1 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement Within the country is completely free. Police do
 occasionally spot-check identification, vehicle registrations,
 and dTiving permits in the vicinity of places where there is a
 :potential danger of terrorist-incidents.
 Residents of the Federal Republic are required to register with
 local police authorities.in the city or town where they reside
 and to report to the police when they change residences. This
 is a bureaucratic formality, however, that does not restrict
 the right to reside anywhere in the country. The Federal
 Republic does not control emigration. It issues passports to
 all citizens requesting them, other than criminals.
 
 
 913
 Historically, the Federal Republic has regarded itself as the
 homeland of all ethnic Germans. It practices policies and
 programs to encourage the movement of ethnic Germans from
 Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to the Federal Republic.
 Such immigrants are treated with generosity. For example,
 those eligible receive pensions, based on the hypothetical
 salaries they would have earned had they lived out their
 careers in the Federal Republic.
 A growing political concern in the country over the past year
 has been the increasing number of foreign, non-ethnic German
 residents. Faced with continuing large numbers of persons
 claiming political refugee status, federal and state-level
 German authorities havo become increasingly vigorous in
 defining such status. They have sought to eliminate
 non-political incentives to persons who falsely claim to be
 political refugees. For example, applicants for political
 asylum are no longer permitted to seek employment during the
 first two years while their cases are pending, or until they
 have actually been granted asylum. In some cases, they are
 given welfare assistance only in kind, not in cash. (Refugees
 from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are excepted from this
 rule.)
 A burgeoning problem in recent years stems from the increasing
 number of foreign workers, notably Turks, in the country,
 despite decisions by the Government several years ago no longer
 to issue permits to new foreign workers. The new coalition
 Government has indicated that it will undertake a series of
 measures designed to enforce vigorously laws against illegal
 residents, to encourage foreign workers through a variety of
 incentives to return to their native countries, and, at the
 same time, to encourage the integration of those foreign
 residents legally in the country who wish to remain.
 a. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 While the Federal Republic of Germany has a parliamentary
 system of government, the Chancellor, orhead of government,
 holds an unusually strong position vis-a-vis the Bundestag once
 he has assumed office. At present, there are three parties
 represented in the Bundestag, as described in the
 introduction. In September-October, 1982, there was a peaceful
 and constitutional change in government, as the small, centrist
 Free Democratic Party resigned from the coalition it had
 supported with the Social Democrats ever since 1969. A few
 days later, it joined in a so-called "constructive vote of no
 confidence," which made the chairman of the Christian
 Democratic Party, Helmut Kohl, chancellor. The parliamentary
 system .of government enjoys overwhelming popular support.
 In recent years, and particularly over the past year, there has
 arisen in the Federal Republic a new political party, the
 "Greens," a very loose and still somewhat incoherent
 confederation of environmentalists, "peace" movement activists,
 counter-culture advocates, social "dropouts", and local special
 interest groups. The "Greens" are now represented in six of
 the eleven state assemblies in the country as well as Berlin.
 
 
 914
 The "Greens" do not fully support the parliamentary system in a
 number of respects. Most importantly, their leaders argue
 simultaneously for parliamentary representation and the
 .achievement of political aims through non-violent street
 action. They reject the principle of personal leadership, and
 do not themselves have a chairman, merely rotating
 uspokesmen." They believe in the "imperative mandate", which
 holds that Green deputies in various parliaments should vote on
 the basis of binding instructions from the party membership
 rather than personal conviction.
 The "Greens" present -a challenge, although probably a temporary
 one, to-the stability and effectiveness of the parliamentary
 system of-government in the Federal Republic. The present
 � Social. Democratic leadership, in particular, is seeking ways to
 integrate-the "Greens" into its party structure in the coming
 years.
 All.,segments-of German society participate actively in the
 poli-tical. proress--even those, such as the "Greens," who do not
 share.much-nthusiasm for it. Although there is no obligation
 .tc vote,-generally between 75 and 90 percent of all eligible
 voters do exercise the franchise.
 Society and the economy in the Federal Republic are highly
 organized in a great panoply of interest groups and lobbies,
 all of which compete for the attention of parties and
 government.
 In a complicated system of dual ballots, each citizen votes
 for both a candidate for the Bundestag from his own electoral
 district and a state-level party slate of additional Bundestag
 candidates. In state-level-elections, voting is conducted on a
 similar basis. The only parties or groups denied participation
 in this process are those few (the Communist Party of Germany
 -and a now defunct neo-Nazi party) which in the 1950's were
 found to be in violation of the Basic Law and therefore
 ineligible to exist as political parties. Since that time,
 governments led by either of the major parties have preferred
 to err on the side of tolerance of anti-constitutional parties,
 so that there exist today a new communist party (DKP) and a
 neo-Nazi party (NPD), which participate freely in elections.
 However, their appeal to the electorate is almost
 non-existent. Together they have attracted only a fraction of
 one percent of the popular vote in recent elections.
 Among citizens of the Federal Republic, the only ethnic
 minorities are a small Danish-speaking group in the northern
 state of Schleswig-Holstein and those foreign workers who have
 acquired German citizenship. Women, to the extent that they
 wish to be, are full participants of the political process. Of
 the 497 deputies in the parliament, some 40 are women. Of the
 16 cabinet members in the Kohl Government, however, only one is
 a woman.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 
 
 915
 A number of human rights organizations exist in the Federal
 Republic, notably Amnesty International and the International
 Society for Human Rights. They operate in complete freedom,
 and their activities and reports are regularly and prominently
 reported upon in the press. The International Society for
 Human Rights, for example, held hearings in Bonn during
 November, 1982, on the issue of forced labor in the
 construction of the Soviet trans-Siberian pipeline. The very
 positive human rights situation in the Federal Republic itself
 is such that Amnesty International and other governmental or
 non-governmental organizations have had little occasion to
 concern themselves with it.
 Amnesty International did pursue allegations that imprisoned
 Baader-Meinhof terrorists had been harshly treated, insofar as
 they had been kept in solitary confinement. (Such confinement
 was made necessary, German officials judged, by their
 well-documented ability to carry on terrorist plans and
 activities even from within jail, with the assistance of their
 lawyers). No evidence has emerged to support charges of harsh
 treatment of imprisoned terrorists.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Federal Republic has a highly-developed social welfare
 system. Wages are high, unemployment, health, and old-age
 pension plans are generous, and are seen by some observers as
 contributing to the country's present economic difficulties.
 There is little sexual, racial, or religious discrimination,
 and it is not encouraged by the Government at any level. The
 right to own property, alone or in association with others, is
 fully protected.
 The country's population (61,010,000 in 1981) is stable and has
 not grown significantly for many years. Growth was negative in
 1980: -0.2 per cent. GNP per capita ($13,585 in 1980) and life
 expectancy at birth (72.6 years) are high. The 1980 infant
 mortality rate was 13.5 per 1000 live births. Adult literacy
 is virtually universal (99%).
 The entire population is well-fed and has access to safe water
 and to primary and secondary school education. The 1977 ratio
 of calorie supply available for consumption, relative to
 nutritional requirements was 127 per cent. Generous
 unemployment compensation (68 percent of one's last net salary)
 assures that even in periods of economic downturn, basic human
 physical needs are well-covered.
