 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde gained its independence on July 5, 1975, after
 more than five hundred years of Portuguese rule. The
 African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and
 Cape Verde (PAIGC), which had led a successful guerrilla war
 against the Portuguese in Guinea-Bissau (there were no
 military engagements in Cape Verde), sent its representatives
 and troops to Cape Verde and took over the reins of government
 from the departing Portuguese. Thus, for five years Cape
 Verde and Guinea-Bissau had the unique status of being ruled
 by the same political party. After the political coup in
 Guinea-Bissau in November 1980, Cape Verde severed its ties
 with the PAIGC component in Bissau and renamed the Cape
 Verde component "The African Party for the Independence of
 Cape Verde" (PAICV). The PAICV continues to rule. No
 opposition is permitted.
 There is a national assembly which meets for about two or
 three weeks a year to approve decisions made by the executive.
 National elections were held in December 1980, for the first
 time since independence, to choose national assembly members.
 There was a single voting list comprised primarily of then
 PAIGC members. The national assembly in turn elects the
 president.
 Cape Verde has a one-party system. While the ideology of
 the party is socialist, Cape Verde still has a mixed economy
 with most shops in private hands. The party leadership has
 tried to improve the physical well-being of the poor majority
 without thus far engaging in arbitrary expropriations of
 private property or passing confiscatory tax laws. The
 government is the largest employer and controls banking,
 commodity imports, mass transit, the press, schools and most
 medical services.
 The country receives economic assistance from a wide variety
 of donor countries.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is expressly forbidden in the constitution. There
 were reports of maltreatment involving torture of persons
 detained by the authorities for anti-government behavior
 during and immediately following the coup in Guinea-Bissau.
 The government publicly disavowed engaging in any such human
 rights violations. There was no official inquiry into the
 reports.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 These practices are outlawed in the constitution and no
 violations have been reported in the past year.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of any mysterious disappearances,
 abductions or secret arrests.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 (44)
 
 
 45
 The constitution prohibits such action. Nevertheless,
 after a disturbance (August 1981) on the island of Santo
 Antao in which people protested the government's proposed
 land reform legislation, about 30 persons were arrested and
 imprisoned without formally being charged or appearing
 before a magistrate, as required by local law. Habeas
 corpus exists in practice for criminal infractions, but it
 is not observed in the case of alleged political offenses.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 The judiciary of Cape Verde is independent in theory,
 although it is not known to have challenged an official act
 of the executive. Trials, both civil and criminal, are open
 to the public. The constitution specifies that "All...
 accused have right to defense,* and that *citizens... will
 not be denied justice because of insufficient economic
 means." Defendants are afforded legal counsel; if indigent
 or incompetent, they are assigned counsel from a judicial
 institute where Cape Verde's lawyers are registered.
 Shortly after independence tne government established a
 system of "zone tribunals' in which persons accused of minor
 offenses were tried locally without recourse to professional
 legal assistance. In effect the tribunals constitute
 political show trials whereby party militants can attempt to
 sway public opinion in favor of government policies.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution'.., recognizes and guarantees the inviolabil-
 ity of family houses ... 'and recognizes'.., the citizen's
 right to the inviolability lof domicile ... *During the
 August-September 1981 protests in Santo Antao, government
 officials forcibly entered private homes without arrest
 warrants or other mandates required by local law and took
 persons into custody.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees all these freedoms. In practice
 freedom of speech and assembly are limited. Strong criticism
 of the government in times of political tension has been
 suppressed and the critics detained. The government does
 not tolerate serious political dissent, condemning such
 activity as "counter-revolutionary."
 The news media (radio and newspaper) are government monopolies.
 News is edited to reinforce support for the government's
 economic development programs and foreign policy.
 No state religion exists. The government respects freedom
 of worship, and members of all religious sects practice
 their religions without harassment. The government, however,
 discourages the participation of religious leaders in
 political affairs. On several occasions in the recent past
 non-Cape Verdean Catholic priests, long resident in the
 islands, were forced to leave for allegedly engaging in
 political activities.

 b.  Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution states that repatriation is a right of the
 citizen. There is no refugee population in Cape Verde,
 although many residents of Angola and Mozambique who left
 those countries after they achieved independence have
 settled in Cape Verde.
 There are no restrictions on travel within Cape Verde.
 The government imposes some administrative hurdles on
 emigrants, apparently ineffective as evidenced-by the high
 level of emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in political affairs is possible only to the
 extent that membership can be obtained in the single
 political party. The first national elections for the
 assembly were held in December 1980. There was only a
 single voting list which was compiled by the PAICV. Voters
 did have the option of rejecting the list. Eight percent
 did so. The national assembly in turn elected the head of
 state, but this election is believed to ratify a decision
 already taken at the party's superior council level.
 Participation of the general population in a practical
 sense takes place through activities at the local party
 level.
 It is not necessary to belong to the PAICV to hold senior
 positions in government, but most leading officials are
 party members.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests by outside groups to investigate
 human rights conditions in Cape Verde, and the attitude of
 the government to such investigations is not known. A
 request made to the government in 1981 by a local association
 of attorneys to hold a public inquiry into allegations of
 torture and other maltreatment of prisoners was refused.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The government is committed to improving economic conditions
 for its citizens. The government's ability to help its
 citizens attain a minimum level of well-being is severely
 restricted by the islands' lack of resources and the contin-
 uation of a severe "drought" -- now in its thirteenth
 year. The government's first priority is to prevent famine,
 which has successfully warded off since independence
 food aid, primarily from Western countries. Food distribu-
 tion has been equitable.
 The government has also given priority to emergency programs,
 financed primarily by foreign grants, to provide jobs
 for agricultural workers displaced by the drought.  Water
 and soil conservation programs and road and school construc-
 tion are given emphasis. High unemployment (about 33 percent)
 
 
 47
 and recurrent droughts have led to periodic emigration.
 About 500,000 Cape Verdeans live overseas; more than 3U0,000
 in the United States. Emigrant remittances and official
 transfers account for two-thirds of the country's gross
 national product.
 The population of the Cape Verde islands is about 300,000.
 Despite the continuing drought, Cape Verde has experienced
 an economic recovery during the past two years. Spurred
 by large public development outlays made possible by substan-
 tial foreign financial assistance, the real gross domestic
 product rose by 15 percent and 10.6 percent in 1978 and
 1979, respectively. The per capita income is now about
 $270.
 Racial discrimination is not a problem in Cape Verde, and
 the vast majority of the population shares various proportions
 of Portuguese-African ancestry. Sex discrimination exists
 because many of the traditional, male-oriented values in the
 Portuguese and African heritages of Cape Verde are still
 part of the island's culture. Women are customarily excluded
 from certain types of work, and are often paid less than men
 for comparable work. The government has included women
 in the labor-intensive economic development projects financed
 by foreign grants. The constitution bans sex discrimination.
 The government and the political party are making efforts to
 bring women into various economic and social activities
 through affirmative action in education, for example, where
 women have been traditionally absent. In 1981 Cape Verde
 made some progress toward its stated goal of equality of the
 sexes. Under the auspices of the ruling (and only) political
 party, Cape Verde held a national women's conference which
 voted to establish a national women's organization. In
 publicizing the event the government announced that the
 development of "social justice and progress" is not possible
 without the full participation of the nation's women.
