 KIIBATI
 The nation of Kiribati comprises some 72,500 people occupyin 33 small islands
 widely scattered across 3.5 million  are kilometers of the central Pacific. The pop-
 ulation is primarily Micronesian, wi   a significant remainder of Polynesian origin.
 Kiribati gained full independence from the United Kingdom in 1979 and became a
 republic within the Commonwealth of Nations. It has a nationally elected president
 and a legislative assembly with 39 members elected by universal suffrage and 2 ex.
 officio members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to that followed in
 New England town meetings.
 The main security ap aratus is a small police force of some 200 men, responsible
 to and effectively controfled b civilian authority.
 The economy is very sma    most people are engaged in subsistence agriculture
 and fishing. The islands' isolation and meager resources, including poor soil and lim-
 ited arable land, severely limit prospects for economic development.
 Kiribati society is egalitarian, democratic, and respectful of human rights. There
 were no reports of specific human rights abuses in 1992, but in the traditional cul-
 ture women have occupied a subordinate role, with limits on their job opportunities.
 RESPECrT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no politically motivated
 killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no disappearances, and no evidence of people
 being abducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely detained.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and inhuman or degrading punishment or other such treatment are forbid-
 den by the Constitution, and there were no reported instances of such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Constitutional safeguards against arbi-
 trary arrest and detention are observed in practice. There is no exile, internal or
 external.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The right to a fair public trial is assured by law
 and observed in practice. The Constitution provides that an accused person be in-
 formed of the nature of the offense for which he is charged and be provided ade-
 quate time and facilities to prepare a defense. The right to confront witnesses,
 present evidence and appeal convictions is enshrined in law.
 Procedural safeguards are based on English common law and are generally simi-
 lar to those in Western democracies. The judiciary is independent and free of gov-
 ernmental interference. Kiribati has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The pri-
 vacy of the home is protected in law and respected by the Government. There is
 no arbitrary intrusion by the State or political organizations into the private life of
 the individual. Membership in political organizations is entirely voluntary.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is provided for in
 the Constitution and observed in practice. Kiribati's radio station and only news-
 paper are government owned, but offer a variety of views. Churches publish news-
 letters and other periodicals. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.--The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, including the rifht to form or belong to asso-
 ciations for the advancement or protection of a group s interests. There are no sig-
 nificant restrictions in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Complete freedom of religion prevails in Kiribati. There
 is no state or preferred religion. Missionaries are free to seek converts and actively
 do so.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel within the ountry and abroad. There are no
 restrictions on repatriation. Kiribati has no refugees or displaced persons.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government is chosen by the people in free and open elections. Executive au-
 thority is exercised by the President, who is elected by the people. No less than
 three and no more than four presidential candidates are nominated by the elected
 Legislative Assembly from among its members. Under the Constitution, the Presi-
 dent is limited to three terms.
 There is no tradition of formally organized parties in Kiribati. However, elections
 bring about coalitions of various interest groups around specific issues. For example,
 the 1991 election campaign saw the emergence of several such interest groups: the
 Christian Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, the National Progressive Party, and
 the New Movement Party. These groups do not seem to have any durable distin-
 guishing characteristics and they have, as yet, no party headquarters, formal plat-
 forms, or party structures. In 1992 a leading opposition politician announced that
 he was creating a formal party, the Maneaba Party.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on the formation of local nongovernmental organizations
 that concern themselves with human rights, but to date none has been formed.
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights violations by the Govern-
 ment and no known requests for investigations. Kiribati is not a member of the
 United Nations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, national ori-
 gin, or sex, and this prohibition is observed in practice. Kiribati society, being fun-
 damentally egalitarian, does not have the privileged chiefly class of some other Pa-
 cific island societies.
 The traditional culture, in which males are dominant, has been an impediment
 to women taking a more active role in the economy. This is slowly changing, and
 more women are finding work in unskilled and semiskilled occupations. There are
 also signs of affirmative action in government hiring and promotions to redress this
 culturally based inequity. Recent examples of affirmative action with regard to the
 advancement of women include the appointment of Makurita Baaro as the nation's
 first female Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Furthermore, the selection of recent par-
 ticipants from Kiribati in overseas training programs to the United States, Japan,
 and other countries reflects a firm commitment to the advancement of women.
 Women have full and equal access to education. Statistics on the participation of
 women in the work force and comparative wages are unavailable. Women have full
 rights of ownership and inheritance of property. Violence against women does not
 appear to be a major problem in this isolated, rural society. Rape is a crime under
 the law, and the law is enforced when charges are brought to court. To the extent
 that it exists, wife beating is dealt with informally and in a traditional way; fre-
 quently communal pressure is brought to bear.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Freedom of association is provided for in the Con-
 stitution. Workers are free to organize unions and choose their own representatives.
 Over 90 percent of the work force is occupied in fishing or subsistence farming, but
 the small wage sector has a relatively strong and effective trade union movement.
 The Government does not control or restrict unions. In 1982 the seven trade unions
 registered in Kiribati merged to form the Kiribati Trade Union Congress (KTUC).
 It has approximately 2,500 members, mostly from the public service sector. The
 KTUC is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The
 right to strike is provided for by law. However, strikes are rare, the last one having
 taen   lace in 1980. This is probably due to the small size of the cash economy.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivety.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 vided for under the [ndustrial Relations Code. Government wage setting is the rule
 in the large public sector. However, in a few statutory bodies and government-
 owned companies, employees may negotiate about wages and other conditions. In
 the private sector, employees may also negotiate about wages with employers. Nego-
 tiations are generally nonconfrontational, in keeping with Kiribati tradition. There
 have been no reports of antiunion discrimination. However, there are mechanisms
 for resolving any such complaints. Kiribati has no exprt processing zones.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited under the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Kiribati law prohibits the employ-
 ment of children under age 14. Children through age 15 are prohibited from indus-
 trial employment and employment aboard ships. Labor officers from the Ministry of
 Commerce, Industry, and Employment are responsible for enforcement of these laws
 and do a reasonable job given the rudimentary conditions of the Kiribati's economy
 and its industrial relations system. Children are rarely employed outside the tradi-
 tional economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government has taken no concrete action
 to implement long-standing legislation authorizing establishment of minimum
 wages. There is no legislatively prescribed workweek. Government is the major em-
 ployer in the cash economy.
 Employment laws provide rudimentary health and safety standards for the work-
 place. Employers, for example, must provide an adequate supply of clean water for
 workers and must ensure the existence of sanitary toilet facilities. Employers are
 liable for the expenses of workers injured on the job. The Government's ability to
 enforce employment laws is hampered by a lack of qualified enforcement personnel.
 Women may not work at night except under specified circumstances (generally in
 service jobs such as hotel clerks).
