 ANGOLA*
 In the first full year following the signing of the Peace Accords (May 1991) be-
 tween the Government of the Republic of Angola (GRA) and the National Union for
 the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), Angola continued an arduous task of
 national reconstruction and reconciliation, highlighted first by multiparty elections
 but subsequently by renewed fighting. The ruling MPLA won the September 29-30
 legislative elections with 53.7 percent of the vote. Incumbent President Jose
 Eduardo dos Santos (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-MPLA)
 gained 49.6 percent of the presidential vote, just shy of the absolute majority re-
 quired to win outri.ht. Running a distant second in both elections, the MPLA's prin-
 cipal rival, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and
 its leader, Jonas Savimbi, charged "massive, systematic, and generalized fraud" and
 rejected the results. The United Nations, following an investigation by the Angola
 National Electoral Council (CNE) in which U.N. advisors took part, declared the
 elections "generally free and fair and the results valid. The United States con-
 curred in this judgment. However, UNITA refused to recognize the results and in
 mid-October began a military campaign of occupying towns and cities in the central
 highlands whig expanded thrughout the country. U some instances, this takeover
 was accomplished through intimidation only; in others, by force of arms with consid-
 erable loss of life. In response, GRA forces took action against UNITA personnel in
 Luanda at the end of October, resulting in several thousand new casualties. At the
 end of the year, UNITA controlled approximately 70 percent of the national terri-
 tory. A tenuous cease-fire, negotiated in early November, broke down during the last
 week of December. A second round of Presidential elections between dos Santos and
 Savimbi (required since no candidate won a simple majority in the first round) has
 to date been blocked by the military situation; the GRA is calling for a return to
 the status quo ante September 29 before the second round of elections takes place.
 Prior to the elections, there were no major violations of the cease-fire but there
 was widespread low-level violence and escalating crime, due in part to demobilized
 soldiers with weapons. Pursuant to the Accords, GRA administrators were rein-
 stated in areas formerly under UNITA control, and 48 designated points were estab-
 lished throughout the country to help assemble soldiers and collect weapons. As
 stipulated in the Peace Accords, thousands of troops from both sides began to de-
 mobilize and the nucleus of a new unified Angolan Armed Force of 50,000 persons
 began to form prior to the September elections; nevertheless, demobilization, espe-
 cially on the UNITA side, was largely incomplete at the time of the elections.
 Each   side maintained reserve military/security forces; other troops were
 remobilized following elections, bringing estimated strength at year's end to 58,000
 GRA and 44,000 UNITA troops. The GRA police forces were augmented by an elite
 emergency unit, mainly demobilized GRA soldiers. GRA total military expenditures
 for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms and Disarmament Agency conducted
 a detailed analysis, were between $618 and $758 million. While the GRA has ex-
 pressed its intention to reduce defense spending, it is unlikely that this will occur
 in the near future due to the de facto state of war which currently exists.
 Angola has great economic potential, with extensive petroleum and diamond re-
 serves, rich agricultural land, and large hydroelectric potential, but it remains rel-
 atively underdeveloped. Subsistence agriculture has traditionally been the main
 source of livelihood for approximately 90 percent of the 12 million population, but
 it accounts for less than 15 percent of the gross domestic product. The 16-year civil
 *The United States does not recognize or maintain diplomatic relations with the Republic of
 Angola; while it maintains a liaison office in Luanda accredited to the Joint Political-Military
 Commission (JPMC) overseeing implementation of the May 31, 1991, Peace Accords, access to
 information on the human rights situation in Angola continues to be limited.
 
 
 war, coupled with the GRA's socialist economic policies, lowered living standards
 and turned Angola into a net importer of food. Starting in 1987, the GRA-MPLA
 began to shift policy direction and introduce economic reforms including in 1992
 elimination of price controls. The GRA intensified its dialog with the International
 Monetary Fund and the World Bank, but, worried about the potential electoral im-
 ailed to follow through completely on its reforms, such as addressing the
 huge public sector deficit.
 Human rights continued to be seriously circumscribed in 1992. During the year,
 the GRA-MPLA and UNITA repeatedly showed flagrant disregard for fundamental
 humanitarian values. There were also credible reports of extrajudicial executions in
 Cabinda province. The number of human rights abuses increased dramatically fol-
 lowing the deterioration of the military situation in the wake of the September 29-
 30 elections. Despite the massive violations late in the year, however, 1992 also saw
 significant improvements in human rights. The two sides formally concluded the
 first phase of a prisoner release process in which some 4,000 prisoners of war
 (POW's) were freed. They consulted on-and the National Assembly passed in Sep-
 tember-the Law on Constitutional Revision, which updates the May 1991 Constitu-
 tion and includes, inter alia, language on human rights and judicial independence
 as well as calling for an active presidential system. In all, 18 parties competed ac-
 tively in the elections, often criticizing the GRA vociferously in many rallies
 throughout the country. All parties, including UNITA, were represented on the Na-
 tional Electoral Council, which organized the difficult registration of 4.8 million vot-
 ers and supervised the September balloting. The GRA continued to manipulate the
 official press, but UNITA  and other party publications freely circulated, and
 UNITA's radio station continued to broadcast openly.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.- While there were no major violations
 of the cease-fire prior to the September elections, the general security situation
 steadily deteriorated throughout the year with a steep rise in violent crime, exacer-
 bated by the large number of demobilized soldiers with arms and with no source
 of income. It became increasingly difficult to distinguish between political and com-
 mon criminality.
 The renewed fighting after the elections produced some of the most serious abuses
 in 1992, with estimates of casualties running into the thousands. After withdrawing
 from the joint armed forces on October 5, UNITA began to attack and take over mu-
 nicipalities throughout the country, destroying infrastructure, including dams,
 schools, hospitals and medical facilities. UNITA f'orces targeted many civilians sus-
 pected of being MPLA sympathizers in several cities such as Caxito, Benguela, and
 obit. UNITA forces, in mounting attacks on Huambo, the political capital of the
 central highlands, and in seizing the northern city of Uige, killed a number of GRA
 soldiers and civilians. In Andulo, UNITA was reported to have killed a senior mili-
 tary official, the district police commander and GRA local administrator. There were
 also credible reports that UNITA targeted and killed members of provincial electoral
 councils in several provinces, including Benguela, Bie, and Malanje.
 Following the cancelation of a UNITA rally in Luanda on October 31, UNITA sup-
 porters and military elements began a series of drive-by shootings around the city.
 As more generalized fighting broke out later in the day between GRA and UNITA
 supporters, the GRA began to move systematically against key UNITA installations.
 During the several days of violence which followed, GRA security forces sum-
 marily executed a number of UNITA soldiers and civilians suspected of sympathiz-
 ing with UNITA. Two top UNITA officials, Vice President Jeremias Chitunda and
 Elias Salupeto Pena, were killed when they ran police roadblocks trying to flee
 Luanda. After taking control of Luanda, GRA forces and armed civilians searched
 from house to house for UNITA sympathizers, executing many and destroying or
 looting houses and personal property. GRA officials also did little to stop groups of
 civilians previously armed by the GRA from attacking UNITA houses and sym-
 pathizers throughout the capital. There were credible reports that these groups
 illed up to 40 persons a day in the vast shantytowns around Luanda.
 Prior to the elections, there were several instances of politically motivated
 killings, most related to ongoing tensions between the GRA and UNITA. In March,
 A supporters killed four GA air force officers in Huila province. In April GRA
 police shot to death a UNITA soldier in Bengucla province. The GRA policeman was
 jailed, but the circumstances surrounding the shooting remain unclear. In Luanda
 in September, security guards at the residence of UNITA President Jonas Savimbi
 killed a GRA officer assigned to the neighboring residence of the Vice Minister of
 
 
 Industry. Following an incident with police in Huambo in August, UNITA accused
 the Government of trying to assassinate Savimbi; the Joint Political Military Com-
 mission, overseeing implementation of the Peace Accords, investigated the case and
 concluded no such attempt had occurred. On October 31, UNITA guards killed a
 German national outside the U.S. compound in Luanda. A group of over 300 Ango-
 Ian intellectuals, including a number of university professors, claimed that UNITA
 was also responsible for the assassinations of four white Angolan intellectuals with
 close MPLA connections, including well-known physician Dr. David Bernardino. To
 date, however, no suspects have been apprehended in these cases.
 Several deaths, some apparently the result of torture and extrajudicial executions,
 occurred in Cabinda province in connection with efforts by the Front for the Libera-
 tion of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) to secure independence for the region. In No-
 vember 1991, GRA troops killed or wounded more than 20 people who were report-
 edly participating in a peaceful demonstration. During 1992 there were credible re-
 ports of extrajudicial executions of unarmed FLEC members by GRA security forces.
 For example, in September and October, GRA troops reportedy tortured and exe-
 cuted extrajudicially at least nine persons after an attak by F'LEC killed two sol-
 diers on September 4. So far as is known, the RA did not investigate any of these
 incidents of reported torture and extrajudicial execution. FLEC~eaders, in fact,
 claimed that hundreds of civilians had been killed by GRA troops. At the same time,
 FLEC was credibly linked to a number of armed attacks, including one incident in
 December when a convoy of civifian oil workers was attacked by a large group of
 armed men near Cabinda City. In that incident four of the workers were summarily
 executed. Access to Cabinda is limited and it is difficult to ascribe responsibility for
 individual events.
 There were also credible reports of killings of internal dissidents. A former
 UNITA media worker alleged in a press conference in Luanda that she had wit-
 nessed a number of executions carried out by UNITA in Jamba. In March two senior
 UNITA military defectors, Miguel Nzau Puna and Tony da Costa Fernandes, ac-
 cused Savimbi of ordering the deaths of internal opponents Tito Chingungi and Wil-
 son dos Santos and their families. In its initial response to the accusations, UNITA
 said that Chingungi and dos Santos had disappeared. In April Savimbi confirmed
 in a public announcement that the two and members of their families had been
 killed by UNITA in 1991; although he denied personal culpability, he accepted
 "moral responsibility." A UNITA-appointed commission of inquiry concluded that
 the executions had been ordered by Puna; however, credible reports indicated that
 the commission was composed entirely of UNITA members and did not meet accept-
 ed norms of independence and impartiality. A satisfactory explanation of the details
 surrounding their deaths has never been provided, in part because access to Jamba,
 where the killings occurred, is severely restricted by U A.
 A local human rights group, the Angolan Human Rights Nucleus, accused GRA
 prison authorities in Luanda of killing an 18-year-old detainee in April 1992 and
 then trying to justify the action by claiming the prisoner had murdered a fellow in-
 mate.
 b. Disappearance.-Despite the POW releases, there were still thousands of people
 in 1992 unaccounted for, including hundreds who had "disappeared" under the cus-
 tody of GRA and UNITA forces. A national family tracing effort strove to locate fam-
 ilies of some of the estimated 50,000 orphaned and abandoned children.
 There were several well-founded reports of disappearances. In June, a UNITA
 journalist, Bela Malaquias, reportedly was forced against her will to return to
 UNITA headquarters in Jamba, allegedly for opposing President Savimbi. She had
 not been seen by the end of the year. In Benguela in September, UNITA kidnaped
 10 supporters of an emergent party, the Angola Democratic Forum (FDA). There
 was no indication that they had been released by year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Throughout 1992 there were numerous incidents of cruel, inhuman treatment com-
 mitted by all sides, especially during the postelectoral period.
 Social Democratic Party leader Andrew Kilandomoko charged that he had been
 badly beaten by GRA police while detained following the Luanda violence in early
 November. Dr. Carlos Morgado, one of the UNITA officials detained in the wake of
 this incident in Luanda, charged in a telephone interview that he had been tortured.
 At year's end, he was believed still being held in the Ministry of Interior. UNITA
 charged that other party officials held at this ministry were also subjected to tor-
 ture, although no such charges were made by those detainees subsequently released.
 Prisoners held by UNITA and later released alleged that they had been beaten
 or subjected to other mistreatment. Credible reports emerged following the outbreak
 of renewed fighting that persons had been mutilated, apparently by UNITA forces,
 with their ears, lips, and noses partially or entirely severed.
 
 
 In the past, the African National Congress (ANC) held, abused, or killed prisoners
 at Viana transit camp near Luanda, the Luanda State Security Prison (Nova
 Instalacao), Pango camp north of Luanda, and quatro camp in northern Angola. At
 these camps, ANC security personnel tortured, mistreated, and in some cases
 extrajudicially executed  C- efector detainees and alleged South African govern-
 ment spies. Most of these abuses allegedly took place during the late 1970's and
 early 1980's, prior to the signing of the 1988 New York Accords, which required the
 ANC to leave Angola. A 1992 report issued by an ANC commission of inquiry inves-
 tigating abuses at ANC camps throughout the region specifically mentioned the
 Quatro camp in Angola, indicating that some of the worst abuses took place there.
 The ANC maintains that all detention camps outside South Africa have been closed.
 Thus far, there have been no free and independent inspections to verify the claims
 of abuses. There is also no evidence that those responsible for these abuses have
 been held accountable. At Quatro camp, prisoners were reportedly routinely beaten,
 humiliated, and forced to perform hard labor. At Pango camp members of the
 ANC's military wing who had taken part in a mutiny were tied to trees beaten,
 whipped, and burned with molten plastic. A report by an international human
 rights organization concluded that torture and ill-treatment of prisoners by the ANC
 in Angola were not isolated instances but rather a systematic, ritualized process of
 abuse which resulted in several documented deaths.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-On October 9, 1991, the National Assem-
 bly approved laws on detention, investigation, search, and arrests. However, there
 was still little information available in 1992 on the effect of these laws on the judi-
 cial process.
 Prior to the October 9 laws, the Code of Criminal Procedures stipulated that de-
 tainees (other than security detainees) had to appear before a judge within 48 hours
 of arrest. In security cases, persons suspected of committing serious acts against the
 State could be held for 6 months, apparently without the right to challenge the
 grounds for their detention. Thereafter, the State Security Service had to present
 charges, but there did not appear to be a specfic time limit within which a suspect
 had to be brought to trial.
 Under the Peace Accords, all civilian and military prisoners detained by the GRA
 and UNITA during the war were to be released under supervision of the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Throughout 1992 the exchange process
 p roved controversial, with a series of charges and countercharges by the GRA and
 U    A authorities concerning the holding back of prisoners. By the time of the elec-
 tion, however, more than 4 000 persons, soldiers and civilians, had been exchanged
 under ICRC auspices. The ICRC was permitted to inspect all known GRA places of
 detention and confirmed the release of virtually all prisoners covered by the Ac-
 cords; however the ICRC compiled credible evidence that UNITA still held close to
 700 prisoners. UNITA disputed this assertion but later discovered and subsequently
 released 20 GRA army and air force officers.
 Following the violence in Luanda in early November, the GRA detained several
 hundred UNITA supporters, including some elected representatives. By year's end,
 116 had been released, but several hundred remained in custody; the ICRC has ac-
 cess to those still detained.
 Under the terms of the Peace Accords, the JPMC created a subcommission
 charged with ensuring neutrality of the national police. The subcommission, which
 first operated in 1992, is composed of GRA, UNITA, and United Nations personnel.
 It investigated a number of cases of alleged arbitrary arrest, finding in some in-
 stances that the police had acted improperly in arresting UNITA members. In June
 police raided a local Luanda restaurant known to be frequented by UNITA, alleg-
 edly looking for weapons, and detained several UNITA supporters for a few days.
 In another incident, 10 UNITA journalists were arrested during the visit of Pope
 John Paul II to Luanda. U   A  said the journalists were unjustly detained; the
 GRA, while claiming they were carrying unauthorized weapons, later released them
 without charge.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the 1992 Law on Constitutional Revision
 (LCR) speaks of an independent judiciary, as does the 1991 amended Constitution,
 the judiciary in the past has followed MPLA guidelines, and it remained uncertain,
 at year's end, whether the new MPLA-dominated GRA would permit an independent
 judiciary in practice. The LCR abolishes the word "popular" for all three levels of
 courts: municipal tribunals; provincial tribunals; and the Supreme Tribunal. It also
 calls for the establishment of a Constitutional Tribunal.
 UNITA has been credibly accused of imposing summary justice in those area
 where it is in control. It does not appear that defendants have the right to legal
 counsel or any right of appeal for punishments imposed, some of which include sum-
 mary executions.
 
 
 5
 The 1991 Angolan Constitution provides detainees with the right to legal counsel
 and habeus corus but available information suggests these stipulations are often
 ignored particuary in light of the confrontational relationship between the GRA
 and UNITA. Both the G       and UNITA accused each other of willfully obstructing
 the judicial process. In early 1992, UNITA resisted turning over one of its soldiers
 who had killed a GRA officer in Luanda the previous November, claimin the GRA
 police and judiciary were not impartial. UNITA also refused to allow the GRA to
 question its personnel who killed a Ministry of Industry guard in September.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Both
 the GRA and UNITA accused each other of engaging in this practice during the
 year. GRA police on a number of occasions violated U  TA political offices search-
 ing for weapons. In October UNITA soldiers raided the Luanda residence of a group
 of Angolan Armed Forces medical personnel and burned the occupants' belongings.
 Once the fighting resumed in October, respect for the privacy of citizens deterio-
 rated notably.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Angola's 1991 Constitution provides for freedom
 of expression and this right was largely respected during the year. Political parties'
 speakers and publicity materials, many o them highly critical of the GRA, pro-
 liferated throughout the year in Luanda and other provinces with no interference
 from the GRA. Political activity increased during the official, one month election
 campaign when parties took advantage of allotted television and radio air time to
 present their views.
 The Constitution also provides for freedom of the press, but continued GRA con-
 trol of the only daily newspaper, television station, and national radio made it dif-
 ficult for alternative points of view to gain media access. The sole Angolan news
 agency is state controlled. Nonetheless, especially in the print media, there was an
 increase in the independence of editorial comment, especially preceding the elec-
 tions, and an attempt by managers to instill journalistic standards of accuracy and
 separation of editorial from news. There were also other media outlets.
 UNITA's weekly newspaper circulated freely in the capital, and its radio station
 transmitted its programs without interference. A handful of other periodic publica-
 tions offering critical commentary also were available. A new radio station began
 operating during 1992. This station is partially funded by the GRA and considered
 by some independent journalists to be essentially an extension of the state-con-
 trolled radio.
 Foreign journalists and publications must register with the Government Press
 Center ut otherwise had good access to officials. Journalist travel was not formally
 restricted but, in practice, was difficult due to inadequate infrastructure and dif-
 ficulty in gaining access to UNITA-controlled areas. Journalists sometimes traveled
 outside of Luanda at the invitation of the GRA or UNITA for arranged press events.
 During the official campaign period, national radio and television carefully ad-
 hered to the electoral law on media access, which gave each legally registered party
 daily radio and television time. However, news space devoted to the two major par-
 ties was not balanced in any media organ.
 A group of Angolan journalists attempted to create a self-sustaining independent
 union in 1992. While suffering from a lack of resources, the organization was still
 in operation at year's end and claimed a membership of 300 countrywide. Some of
 its members claimed their livelihoods were in jeopardy because of their association
 with this union.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The 1991 Constitution $uaran-
 tees the right of peaceful assembly and association, provided 3-day notice is given
 to the authorities. In practice the law was widely respected during the year when
 numerous parties--MPLA, UNITA, and numerous small third parties-held dem-
 onstrations and rallies supporting their election campaigns. The GRA officially cer-
 tified 24 political parties, 18 of which, including UNITA and the MPLA, fielded can-
 didates and took part in the elections.
 GRA police broke up several illegal demonstrations in Huambo and Luanda by de-
 mobilized soldiers demanding increased benefits. UNITA also alleged that the police
 attempted to interfere in their party's legal demonstrations on a number of occa-
 sions, including rallies in Bie and Luanda.
 Several third parties charged, with credible evidence that the  were not per-
 mitted to organize and hold rallies in UNITA-controlled areas. Numerous parties
 criticized UNITA for harassment and intimidation of their activists and supporters.
 In March UNITA security personnel violently broke up an Angola Democratic
 Forum (FDA) demonstration in Luanda; in September UNITA militants attacked
 FDA marchers in Benguela. kidnaving 10 veoule. In another serious incident in Au-
 
 
 gust, UNITA soldiers fired on MPLA vehicles leaving a rally in the southern prov-
 ince of Huambo. In that incident, the GRA accused UNITA of deliberately trying
 to assassinate MPLA campaign director Kundi Paihama. After investigating, how-
 ever, the JPMC concluded there was no assassination attempt.
 c. Freedom of Religin.-Religion plays an important role in Angolan society-
 some 85 percent of the population is either Roman Catholic or Protestant; most of
 the rest is animist. The GRA has tried to improve its relations with the churches
 over the past few years and has returned dozens of properties previously confiscated
 from the churches. In Uige Province, for example, the GRA returned a building,
 then used as an army barracks, taken from an evangelical sect. Foreign and Ango-
 lan religious workers now carry out normal activities, and Pope John Paul II visited
 Angola for the first time in June. The GRA also lifted the ban on smaller religious
 sects it previously considered subversive, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and the
 Tocoist Church, which combines Christian and indigenous beliefs. The latter's activi-
 ties were frequently covered by. the press during the year.
 For its part, UNITA has respected freedom of religion in areas under its control
 and provided modest administrative support to Catholic and Protestant churches.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Angola Peace Accords called for free circulation of people and goods
 throughout the national territory. The GRA by most accounts respected this stipula-
 tion, but numerous observers, including the GRA, political parties, and international
 agencies, accused UNITA of impeding freedom of movement. For example, UNITA
 required residents of areas under its control to obtain formal permission to leave
 their villages. In particular, critics charged UNITA did not allow the population of
 Jamba to return to their home areas. By year's end, UNITA had established check-
 points around several provincial capitals and was restricting movement in and out
 of those areas.
 The GRA places no restrictions on Angolans' international travel; upperand mid-
 dle-class urban residents in particular frequently travel to Europe and neighboring
 countries. The ending of the war led, at least through early September, to a signifi-
 cant increase in overland travel, most of it commercial, to neighboring countries,
 particularly Namibia.
 In early November, the GRA briefly imposed restrictions on travel abroad b
 males over age 16. However, this policy, which the GRA claimed was never official,
 was halted on November 12.
 Approximately 9,000 Zairians were still refugees in Angola at year's end. The
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) continues to assist them, but plans
 for voluntary repatriation were forestalled by unrest in Zaire.
 According to UNHCR estimates, more than 400,000 Angolans fled to Zaire and
 Zambia during the extended civil war. Up to 100,000 of them spontaneously repatri-
 ated between the May 1991 signing of the Peace Accords and the November 1992
 postelection violence but many are reported to have again sou ht as lum in neigh.
 boring countries. In late 1992, some 6,000 Angolans also crossed the order into the
 Republic of the Congo as a result of violence in Angola's Cabinda enclave. UNHCR
 repatriation plans await resolution of the current cycle of violence in Angola.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Peace Accords, the 1991 Constitution, and the 1992 Law on Constitutional
 Reform paved the way for Angola's first-ever multiparty elections in 1992. To that
 end, a National Electoral Council (CNE), consisting of GRA and political party rep-
 resentatives, was created to administer both presidential and legislative elections.
 In a remarkable effort, with U.N. logistical and technical assistance, the CNE reg-
 istered 4.8 million voters--over 90 percent of the estimated eligible voters-and
 managed a large turnout on election day.
 Dos Santos failed by the narrowest of margins (49.6 percent instead of the mini-
 mum of more than 50 percent) to gain the Presidency on the first ballot. Savimbi
 came in second with almost 40 percent of the vote. The electoral law provides for
 a runoff between the two, but in the wake of UNITA's claims that the voting had
 been "massively" fraudulent and renewed fighting, there was no progress by year's
 end toward setting an election date for the presidential runoff. In the legislative
 contest, the MPLA won 129 of the 220 seats in the National Assembly, while
 UNITA won 70 seats, and smaller parties won the remaining 21 seats. The National
 Assembly convened on November 26 without UNITA representation. On December
 4 UNITA declared its intention to send its representatives to the National Assem-
 bly and to a newly-named multiparty Cabinet but requested guarantees on security
 before doing so.
 
 
 All citizens may participate in the political process, but the number of women ac-
 tive in political roles is small. One of the candidates for President, Analia Vitoria
 de Pereira, is head of the Liberal Democratic Party. Two out of 27 GRA ministries,
 those of Fisheries and Women's Promotion, are headed by women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 One local human rights group, the Angolan Human Rights Nucleus was active in
 1992 and appeared to operate without GRA interference. A second private organiza-
 tion, the Angolan Human Rights Association, was launched in December without in-
 terference, although it was heavily dominated by GRA employees.
 The GRA allowed Amnesty International to visit Angola for the first time in
 March 1992. Al representatives met officials from the GRA, UNITA, third political
 parties, and nongovernmental organizations. The delegation also visited Cabinda
 province, site of continuing tension between the GRA and Cabinda separatist move-
 ments. AI was unable to visit UNITA areas, despite that organization's assertions
 that authorization would be given. AI's report was allowed to circulate freely.
 As part of the Peace Accords, the GRA allowed the ICRC to inspect prisons and
 provided access to its records to verify release of UNITA prisoners. It also allowed
 the ICRC to visit UNITA personnel detained in the wake of the Luanda violence.
 ICRC personnel also worked in UNITA areas, but many observers, ranging from
 freed prisoners to Amnesty International, accused UNITA of deliberately witholding
 prisoners from the ICRC.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Angolan law stipulates that all citizens are equal regardless of race, ethnic origin,
 sex, religion, or social status. Angola is a multiracial society, and in  ractice there
 was litte evidence of official discrimination. However, the long civi conflict has
 deep ethnic and urban/rural roots. The MPLA is heavily supported by the Mbundu
 ethnic group, which makes up an estimated 25 percent of the population, and by
 many city dwellers, notably in Luanda. It also has strong backing among the statis-
 tically small number of mixed-blood Angolans who occupy many technical and   v-
 ernmental positions. Election results indicated a high level of support among other
 ethnic group apart from the Ovimbundu. UNITA has the backing of the country's
 largest single ethnic group, the Ovimbundu, who make up an estimated 37 percent
 of the population and are concentrated in the central and southern parts of the
 country. The GRA claimed that UNITA's inflammatory rhetoric exacerbated ethnic
 tensions by dwelling on the perceived colonial ties of white and mixed-race Ango-
 lans.
 Angola's population includes a relatively small number of pre-Bantu stock indige-
 nous peoples, perhaps 1 to 2 percent of the population. Mostly hunters and gather-
 ers, these members of Khoisan and other liguistic groups are scattered throughout
 the southern provinces of Namibe, Cunene, and Cuando Cubango. There is no evi-
 dence of official discrimination or harassment of these peoples.
 There is little information available on the extent of violence against women, but
 it is believed to be widespread. The number of assault cases brought by women to
 courts appeared to be increasing. In addition, women clearly play a subordinate role
 in governmental and economic decisionmaking. At present, there are some senior
 women in the GRA military and civil service. The media have begun to address
 women's issues occasionally.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Reversing earlier policy, the 1991 Constitution recog-
 nizes the right of Angolans to form trade unions and to bargain collectively. The Na-
 tional Union of Angolan Workers (UNTA), the official labor union of the MPLA, re-
 mains the principal workers' organization in the country. There are two other
 groups, the National Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Angola and the Demo-
 cratic Confederation of Angolan Workers, but there is little information available on
 their activities. During 1992, at least one independent union was formed-the Union
 of Angolan Journalists. Free labor activity increased in general as employees in in-
 dividual factories or firms sometimes formed their own workers' committees.
 The Constitution also provides for the right to strike. Specific legistation passed
 in 1991 provides the legal framework-including prohibition on lockouts, protection
 of nonstriking workers, and prohibition of worker occupation of places of employ-
 ment. Strikes by military and police personnel, prison workers, and firemen are pro-
 hibited.
 In 1992 there were numerous strikes, including those by Ministry of Finance
 workers, hospital personnel, and teachers in Luanda. There was no GRA inter-
 ference with the walkouts, and settlements were negotiated peacefully. In August
 
 
 a dock workers' strike in Lobito threatened to get out of hand when several workers
 were fired and others attacked the port administration officers; however, the tension
 was diffused and a settlement reached without violence.
 Labor organizations may affiliate with international labor bodies. UNTA is affili-
 ated with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and the Communist-domi-
 nated World Federation of Trade Unions. Two other trade union federations have
 applications pending with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b.The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Constitutional changes gave
 Angolan workers the right to organize and bargain collectively, althoujgh specific
 laws were still being prepared in 1992. The draft laws reportedly prohibit discrimi-
 nation against union members. In 1992 the Ministry of Labor and Social Security
 still controlled the setting of wages and benefits. The Ministry granted significant
 salary increases following several work stoppages and currency devaluations under
 the GRA's economic reform program. Angola has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or .Compulsory Labor.-New labor legislation (still not
 pubished) prohibits forced labor reversing previous laws and provisions which had
 n cited by the International Labor Organization (ILO) for violations of its Con-
 vention 105. The previous legislation authorized forced labor for breaches of worker
 discipline and participation in strikes. In 1992 the ILO Committee of Experts ex-
 pressed "satisfaction" with Angola's repeal of these previsions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment in Angola is 16. There was no information available about enforcement of
 this law. Children at a much younger age work on family farms and in the informal
 economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1991 the GRA established a new minimum
 monthly wage, but it is not sufficient to support a worker and family. Accordingly,
 most workers must depend on the thriving informal sector, some subsistence farm-
 ing, or remittances from abroad to maintain an acceptable standard of living. The
 normal workweek is 44 hours. No information is available on adequacy of work con-
 ditions or health standards but in most cases it is assumed they do not approach
 Western standards, given te extreme underdevelopment of the Angolan economy.
