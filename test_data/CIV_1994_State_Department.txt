 COTE D'VOIRE
 From independence until 1990, President Felix Houphouet-Boiguy and his Demo-
 cratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI), the only legal political party, ruled Cote
 dlvoire. The PDCI continued its political dominance in the first mutiparty presi-
 dential and legislative elections in 1990, winning 165 of the 175 National Assembly
 seats in elections that were marred by irregularities (see Section 3).
 In 1993 Houphouet died and was replaced by his constitutional successor Na-
 tional Assembly President Henri Konan Bedie. The Constitution calls for Bedie to
 serve out the rest of Houphouet's term, which ends in October 1995.
 Cote d'Ivoire's security forces include the National Police (Surete) and the Gendar-
 merie, a branch of the armed forces with responsibility for general law enforcement.
 The armed forces traditionally have accepted the primacy of civilian authority. Secu-
 rity forces, including Special Anti-crime Police Brigade (SAVAC), were responsible
 for a number of human rights abuses in 1994.
 The Ivorian economy, largely market based but heavily dependent on the agricul-
 tural sector, has performed poorly in recent years, owing to low prices for its prin-
 cipal exports: cocoa, coffee, and tropical woods. High population growth coupled with
 economic decline resulted in a steady fall of living standards;  National Prod-
 uct per capita in 1994 was about $515. The devaluation of the currency, the CFA
 franc, benefited exports while penalizing consumers. A majority of the population
 is dependent on small holder cash crop production.
 Despite a peaceful, constitutional, presidential succession in December 1993, seri-
 ous huiman rights abuses continued n 1994. Members of the security forces carried
 out many extrajudicial killings of criminal suspects and beat and abused detainees.
 The Government failed to bring to justice perpetrators of these abuses. Prison condi-
 tions are poor and in some instances brutal. Police arrested and detained student
 leaders without trial following student strikes in May and imprisoned several jour-
 nalists for criticizing the Government and Chief of State.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known politically mo-
 tivated killings by government forces or reported deaths in official custody from un-
 natural causes. However, as violent crime increased, the security forces frequently
 resorted to lethal force. Credible reports indicate that SAVAC, in hot pursuit of
 armed criminals, killed three apparently innocent young men without warning dur-
 ing a raid in June. Best estimates put the number of persons killed by SAVAC and
 the regular police at 47. The Government prosecuted no SAVAC or police personnel
 for these killings.
 Occasionally the Government hasxunished male factors in the security forces. In
 July a police officer who had injure a woman and two children in 1992 was tried,
 sentenced to 5-years' imprisonment; later that month, another officer was sentenced
 to 10 years for killing a suspect he was pursuing. However, these are exceptions to
 the rule; many offenders are not tried.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of officially sanctioned abduction or dis-
 appearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police sometimes beat detainees or prisoners in order to punish them or to extract
 
 
 60
 confessions. There were no reports of government officials being tried for these
 abuses.
 A jurists' union official reported interviewing prisoners who were beaten to obtain
 their confessions and who were afraid to press charges against the police officers
 involved. Television footage and press photographs regularly show criminal detain-
 ees with swollen or bruised faces and bodies, a likely indicator of police mistreat-
 ment during arrest or detention.
 The acting secretary general of the students' union FESCI stated that during his
 2-week detention in May police physically abused him, employing beatings and sleep
 deprivation. A journalist imprisoned by the Republican Guard stated that they beat
 him during his detention. Police routinely treat non-Ivorian Africans residing in
 Cote d'Ivore (who represent a third of the total population) more roughly than
 Ivorians.
 During incarceration, neither the FESCI leader nor the other 24 students de-
 tained with him were allowed visitors. Although the law prohibits it, police restrict
 access to some prisoners.
 Harsh prison conditions include overcrowding, malnutrition, infectious disease
 and infestation by vermin, and are responsible for a high prison death rate. Several
 journalists released during the year reported that certain white-collar prisoners are
 accorded special treatment. Officials denied the Ivorian Human Rights League
 (LIDHO) and other human rights groups access to the prison in 1994.
 According to a LIDHO report, conditions at the main prison of Abidjan are espe-
 cially brutal for women, with violent and nonviolent criminals, as well as minors,
 housed together. There are no health facilities for women, and a number of women
 have reportedly given birth at the prison without medical attention. There are re-
 ports of women being raped by fellow prisoners and guards.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exle.-Under the Code of Penal Procedure, a
 public prosecutor may order the detention of a suspect for up to 48 hours without
 bringing charges. A magistrate may order detention up to 4 months but must also
 provide the Minister of Justice a written justification for continued detention on a
 monthly basis. However the law is often violated. Police have held persons for more
 than 48 hours without bringing charges. According to a representative of a   rists'
 union, this practice is common, and often magistrates are not able to verily that
 those not charged are released. Defendants are not guaranteed the right to a * di-
 cial determination of the legality of their detention. A judge may release pretrial de-
 tainees on bail if the judge believes that the suspect will not flee. However, accord-
 ing to LIDHO, many prisoners are detained for long periods, sometimes years,
 awaiting trial. While exact statistics are lacking, pretrial detainees probably make
 up 10 percent of the rison population.
 Detainees, particularly those arrested for opposition to the Government, are not
 always brought to trial. Following disturbances in Bouake in March, police arrested
 six students. Only one was tried and sentenced; the others were held in preventive
 detention, then released in June. In May, according to LIDHO, the authorities ar-
 rested 192 students following a confrontation between police and the students'
 union, FESCL Police released the students within 48 hours without charging them.
 Subsequently, security forces detained 25 members of the executive bureau of
 FESCI without charge for 2 weeks at the Gendarme training school, holding them
 incommunicado. It released student leaders after the acting'secretary general of
 FESCI apologized to the Government. He later stated publicly that officials had co-
 erced him to apologize. During the year, police arrested other students including two
 following a march in early November. In September the police detained a journalist
 for 5 days without charge. There are no accurate statistics on the total number of
 arbitrary arrests.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The modern judicial system is headed by a Su-
 preme Court and includes the Court of Appeals and lower courts. The judiciary is
 theoretically independent of the executive branch in ordinary criminal cases. In
 practice, the judiciary follows the lead of the executive in national security or politi-
 cal cases.
 There is not a clear separation between the judicial and executive branches of
 government. There are credible reports that those with ties to the opposition are
 treated more harshly by the judicial system than those with ties to the Government.
 Judges serve at the pleasure of the executive and are therefore likely to bend to po-
 litical pressure. One jurist claims that he was transferred out of Abidjan because
 of his public appeals for a more independent judiciary.
 Ivorian law establishes the right to a public trial, although key evidence is some-
 times given in camera, the presumption of innocence, and the right of defendants
 to be present at their trials. Those convicted also have the right of appeal, although
 
 
 61
 courts rarely overturn verdicts. Indeed, in the case of a Bouake student who ap-
 pealed a 1-year sentence in May, the Appeals Court increased it to 2 years. Defend-
 ants accused of felonies or capital crimes have the right to legal counsel, and the
 judicial system provides for court-appointed attorneys for indigent defendants. In
 practice, many defendants cannot afford private counsel and court-appointed attor-
 neys are not readily available.
 In rural areas, traditional institutions often administer justice at the village level,
 handling domestic disputes, minor land questions, and family law. Dispute resolu-
 tion is by extended debate, with no known instances of resort to phy    a punish-
 ment. The formal court system is increasingly superseding these traditional courts.
 Military courts do not try civilians. Although there are no appellate courts within
 the miltry court system, persons convicted by a military tribunal ma     tition the
 Supreme Court to set aside the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial. There were
 noknown political detainees or prisoners in 1994.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Code of Penid Procedure specifies that a police official or investigative magistrate
 may conduct searches of homes without a judicial warrant if there is reason to be-
 lieve that there is evidence on the premises concerning a crime. The official must
 have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized in the search and is
 required to have witnesses to the search, which may not take place between 9 p.m.
 and 4 a.m. In practice, police sometimes use a general search warrant without a
 name or address. On occasion, police have entered homes of non-Ivorian Africans
 (or rounded them up on the streets), taken them to local police stations, and ex-
 torted small amounts of money for alleged minor offenses.
 Security forces have reportedly monitored some private telephone conversations,
 but the extent of the practice is unknown. There is no evidence that private written
 correspondence is monitored.
 In Cote d'Ivoire's multiparty political system, citizens are free to join, or not join,
 any political party. However, the State has reportedly transferred government em-
 ployees (e.g., teachers) active in the opposition because of their political activities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of expression, and nongovernment newspapers frequently criticized government poli-
 cies, the Government imposes significant restrictions. The two government-owned
 daily newspapers offer little criticism of government policy, while government-owned
 radio and television offer none at all. Moreover, whi e the opposition press opposi-
 tion political party leaders, and student groups voice their disapproval of govern-
 ment or presidential actions frequently and sometimes loudly, the Government does
 not tolerate what it considers insults or attacks on the honor of the country's high-
 est officials. It is a crime, punishable by from 3 months to 2 years in prison, to of-
 fend the President, the Prime Minister foreign chiefs of state or government, or
 their diplomatic representatives, or to defame institutions of the State. Moreover,
 a 1991 press law created a new commission to enforce laws against publishing mate-
 rial "undermining the reputation of the nation or defaming institutions of the
 State."
 The Bedie administration used the press law to silence direct criticism of the
 President and of other government officials. In February a court sentenced a news-
 paper publisher to 1 year in prison for publishing an article which unflatteringly
 compared President Bedie to his predecessor, Bedie pardoned the publisher in July.
 In March courts sentenced five opposition journalists to 1 year in prison and im-
 posed a fine for printing an article based on a report in a foreign publication which
 suggested that President Bedie had asked the French Government to finance his
 predecessor's funeral. Although the authorities never actually confined the journal-
 ists, the sentence remains. In May courts sentenced David Gogbe, editor of a weekly
 newspaper, to 1 year in prison for defamation when he suggested that a high-rank-
 ing government official was implicated in a murder. The Government pardoned
 Gogbe in Decemberk
 The Government has also used the eress law to counter opposition journalists and
 to stifle investigations into "sensitive national security issues. The authorities ar-
 rested the publisher and a journalist from La Voie, a daily newspaper associated
 with the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI), in April for publishing an article calling for
 civil disobedience using legal means. The two received sentences of 3 years in prison
 for disturbing the public order and inciting revolt. The publisher, who is also the
 second ranking official of the FPL, lost his final appeal to the Ivorian Supreme Court
 in November. The two were released from prison on December 16 as part of a gen-
 eral Christmas amnesty. In September a journalist from Soir-Info, writing an inves-
 tigative article on the Republican Guard, was incarcerated for 8 days before police
 
 
 62
 released him. The journalist was not charged until 4 days after his arrest; the
 charges were later dropped.
 In December police in Agnibilikmu arrested journalist Frederick Konate Ousmane
 while he was researching an article on the family origins of President Bedie. Police
 took Ousmane to the Abidjan headquarters, interrogated him, and released him the
 following day on orders from Security Minister Kone.
 The Government owns both television networks and a major radio station. There
 are also four nongovernment radio stations and a private television subscription
 service, Canal Horizon. While the independent stations have complete control over
 their editorial content, the Government continues to exercise considerable influence
 over official media program content, news coverage, and other matters, using these
 media to promote its policies. Much of the news programming is devoted to coverage
 of the activities of the President, the Government, and the PDCI.
 Many prominent Ivorian scholars are active in opposition politics and have not
 suffered professionally, although some teachers and professors suggest that they
 have been transferred because of their political activities. The student union reports
 that the police have used informers at the University of Abidjan to provide data on
 dissident political activity. In April and May FESCI members accused the police of
 using student informers to indicate prominent members of FESCI to the police.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, but in practice that freedom is restricted when the Govern-
 ment perceives a danger to public order. Opposition parties assert that the Constitu-
 tion permits private associations to form without registration. The Government re-
 jects this interpretation and requires all organizations to register before commenc-
 ing activities. There were no reports in the past 3 years of denial of registration.
 Ivorian law prohibits the formation of political parties along ethnic or religious
 lines. In 1991 the Government banned FESCI for failure to register properly. The
 ban was never rescinded, although FESCI was allowed to operate openly until May.
 At that time, the Government again insisted that the organization was banned, ar-
 resting several members of its executive bureau (see Section 1.d.).
 Permits are required for public meetings and are sometimes denied to the opposi-
 tion, but never to the ruling PDCI. Police occasionally prohibit gatherings to prevent
 the expression of controversial views. In February 1992, the Government banned all
 outdoor public meetings "until further notice"; that ban has not been rescinded,
 though it is no longer strictly enforced. An "antivandal" law passed by the National
 Assembly in 1992 holds organizers of a march or demonstration responsible if any
 of the participants engage in violence. LIDHO and all major opposition parties con-
 demned the faw as unduly vague and as one which imposed collective punishment
 for the crimes of a few. Following the arrest of two opposition journalists, leaders
 of the Ivorian Popular Front canceled an announced protest march in April, saying
 they feared arrest under the antivandal law.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There are no known impediments to religious expression.
 There is no dominant religion, and no faith is officially favored. The Government
 permits the open practice of religion, and there are no restrictions on religious cere-
 monies or teaching.
 Nevertheless, certain segments of the Muslim community feel targeted for dis-
 crimination (see also Section 5). An incident in which police arrested 11 persons in
 a clash at an Abidjan mosque in June especially outraged Muslims. The National
 Islamic Council reported that the police were performing identification checks dur-
 ing prayer time on Friday and that they used undue force. A Commission of Inquiry,
 which included representatives of the National Islamic Council, found in August
 that police had ceased identification checks and used only necessary force in self-
 defense. Many Muslims also resent what they see as undue interference by the Gov-
 ernment in Islamic affairs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-While the Government does not generally restrict internal travel, uni-
 formed police regularly extort small amounts of money or goods for contrived or
 minor infractions by motorists or passengers on public conveyances. The Govern-
 ment has made no visible effort to stop this misuse of authority.
 Ivorians normally may travel abroad and emigrate freely, and have the right of
 voluntary repatriation. There are no known cases of revocation of citizenship.How-
 ever, the Government sometimes restricts foreign travel for political reasons. In
 1993 the Government twice refused the president of LIDHO permission to travel to
 conferences abroad. However, it did not prevent him from traveling to Rwanda and
 Geneva in 1994 as the United Nations Special Rappomur.
 Cote d'Ivoire's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The Government respects
 the right to first asylum and does not deny recognition to refugees, either by law
 
 
 or custom. Cote d'voire currently hosts some 350,000 refugees from the Liberian
 civil war. No cases of involuntary repatriation were reported in 1994.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Whether citizens have the ability to exercise this constitutional right in practice
 is not yet known. Multiparty elections were first permitted in 1990. While opposi-
 tion parties ultimately acquiesced in the results, which gave 165 of the 175 National
 Assembly seats to the PDCI, the elections were flawed. Before the presidential elec-
 tions, the National Assembly effectively restricted the number of candidates by im-
 posing the stringent requirement that each candidate must pay a large deposit (ap-
 proximately $80,000) refundable only if the candidate received more than 10 per-
 cent of the vote in the first round of balloting. Opposition parties, which became
 legal only in May 1990, charged that they had inadequate time to prepare for elec-
 tions held from October through December of the same year. Further, they faced on-
 erous restrictions on holding meetings and demonstrations and unequal access to
 the state-controlled media. There were numerous complaints by opposition parties
 of ballot-box stuffing, procedural irregularities, and polling places that were ficti-
 tious or belatedly designated. In the legislative elections, the names of well over 100
 duly registered candidates did not appear on the ballot.
 Elections are held every 5 years, with the next round scheduled for 1995; the bal-
 loting is secret.
 The President is both Head of State and President of the PDCI. An appointed
 Prime Minister, who serves at the pleasure of the President, controls day-to-day
 governmental affairs and economic polic. With 3 seats vacant, the PDCI holds 162
 of the 175 seats in the National Assembly, which in practice is subordinate to the
 executive branch. Two opposition parties, the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) and the
 Ivorian Workers' Party (PIT), originally won seats in the National Assembly. A third
 opposition party, the Rally of Republicans (RDR), broke away in 1994 from the rul-
 ing PDCI, taking an additional nine deputies away from the PDCI. While active and
 vocal, the opposition is not yet well enough represented to act as an effective coun-
 terweight to the powerful Presidency and the domination of PDCI.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on the participation of women in poli-
 tics, and they play an active role in Ivorian society and government. Two cabinet
 ministers are women, but women play a limited role in the National Assembly hold-
 ing only 8 of the 175 seats. Women hold 5 of the 36 leadership positions in the As-
 sembly. Two members of the Supreme Court are women.
 There are no impediments to the exercise of political rights by any one of the over
 60 ethnic groups.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 LIDHO, formed in 1987 and recognized by the Government in July 1990, has ac-
 tively investigated alleged violations of human rights and issued press releases and
 reports, some critical of the Government.
 The Government has been cooperative towards international inquiries into its
 human rights practices.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, or religion is against
 the law, but in practice women occupy a clearly subordinate role in society.
 Women.-In rural areas, ethnic customs dictate that women perform most menial
 tasks, although farm work by men is also common. Government policy encourages
 full participation by women in social and economic life, but there is considerable in-
 formal resistance among employers in hiring women, whom they consider less de-
 pendable by virtue of potential pregnancy. Women are underrepresented in some
 professions and in the managerial sector as a whole. Women in the formal sector,
 however, are paid on an equal scale with men.
 Representatives of women's organizations state that wife beating-while not wide-
 spread-does occur and often leads to divorce. Doctors state that they rarely see the
 victims of such violence. A severe social stigma is attached to such violence; neigh-
 bors often intervene in a domestic quarrel to protect a woman who is the object of
 physical abuse. The courts and police view such domestic violence as a family prob-
 lem, unless serious bodily harm is inflicted or the victim lodges a complaint, in
 which case they may initiate criminal proceedings. The Ivorian Association for the
 Protection of Women has been concerned by the indifference of authorities to female
 victims of violence and by reports that women who are the subject of rape or domes-
 tic violence are often iored or mtreated when they attempt to bring the violence
 
 
 to the attention of the police. The Government has no clear-cut policy regarding
 spouse abuse beyond the obvious strictures against violence in the Civil Code.
 Children.-The Ministries of Social Affairs and of Health and Social Protection
 seek to safeguard the welfare of children, and the Government has also encouraged
 the formation of nongovernmental organizations, such as the Abidjan Legal Center
 for the Defense of Children.
 There is a parental preference for educating boys rather than girls, which is no-
 ticeable throughout the country but more pronounced in rural areas. According to
 a 1991 U.N. report, females in Cote d'Ivoire receive only one-third of the schooling
 of males. Sexual harassment of female students by mate teachers is commonplace.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) is illegal in Cote d'Ivoire but is nevertheless
 practiced, particularly among the rural population in the north and west. The proce-
 dure is usually performed on young girls or at puberty as part of a rite of passage;
 it is generally done outside modern medical facilities and may be extremely painful
 and dangerous to health. The Government does not make strong efforts to prevent
 the practice, and traditional authorities in rural areas continue to uphold it. Accord-
 ing to an independent expert in the field, as many as 60 percent of Ivorian women
 have undergone FGM. The practice is becoming less common as the population be-
 comes urbanized and better educated.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no laws mandating accessibility for the dis-
 abled. Laws do exist prohibiting the abandonment of the mentally or physically
 handicapped, as well as enjoining acts of violence directed at them. Traditional prac-
 tices, beliefs, and superstitions vary, but infanticide in cases of serious birth disabil-
 ities is less commonplace. Disabled adults are not the specific targets of abuse, but
 it is difficult for them to compete with able-bodied workers in the tight job market.
 The Government supports special schools, associations, and artisans' cooperatives
 for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to form unions. For al-
 most 30 years, the government-sponsored labor confederation, the General Union of
 Workers of Cote d'Ivoire (UGTCIJ, dominated most union activity. The UGTCIs hold
 on the labor movement loosened in 1991 when several formerly UGTCI-affiliated
 unions broke away and became independent. In 1992, 11 formerly independent
 unions joined together to form the Federation of Autonomous Trade Unions of Cote
 d'Ivoire (FESCACI). Unions are freely allowed to join these and other groups and
 international bodies. Registration of a new union requires 3 months under Ivorian
 law.
 The right to strike is provided by the Constitution and by statute. The Labor Code
 requires a protracted series of negotiations and a 6-day notification period before a
 strike may take place, effectively making legal strikes difficult to organize. The
 UGTCI seldom calls strikes. Non-UGTCI unions frequently called strikes in the
 past.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code grants all
 IWorians the right to join unions andto bargain collectively. Collective bargaining
 agreements are in effect in many major business enterrises and sectors of the civi
 service. In most cases in which wages are not established in direct negotiations be-
 tween unions and employers, salaries are set by job categories by the Ministry of
 Employment and Civil Service. Labor inspectors have the responsibility to enforce
 a law which prohibits antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There were no reports of forced
 labor, which is prohibited by law. However, the IL(Ys Committee of Experts in its
 1993 annual report questioned a decree that places certain categories of prisoners
 at the disposal of private enterprises for work assignments without their apparent
 consent.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-In most instances, the legal mini-
 mum working age is 16, and the Ministry of Employment and Civil Service enforces
 this provision effectively in the civil service and in large multinational companies.
 Ivorian labor law limits the hours of young workers, defined as those under 18, com-
 pared to the regular work force. However, children often work on family farms, and
 some children routinely act as vendors in the informal sector in cities. There are
 reliable reports of some use of child labor in informal sector mining and also of chil-
 dren working in "sweatshop" conditions in small workshops. Many children leave
 the formal school system at an early age; primary education is mandatory but far
 from universally enforced, particularly in rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.--The Government administratively determines
 monthly minimum wage rates, which were last adjusted following devaluation of the
 
 
 65
 CFA franc in January 1994. A slightly higher minimum wage rate applies for con-
 struction workers. The Government enforces the minimum wage rates only for sala-
 ried workers employed by the Government or registered with the Social Security of-
 fice. Minimum wages vary according to occupation, with the lowest set at approxi-
 mately $70 (CFA francs 36,307) per month, which is insufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. The majority of Ivorians work in agri-
 culture or in the informal sector where the minimum wage does not apply.
 Through the Ministry of Employment and the Civil Service, the Government en-
 forces a comprehensive Labor Code governing the terms and conditions of service
 for wage earners and salaried workers and providing for occupational safety and
 health standards. Those employed in the formal sector are reasonably protected
 against unjust compensation, excessive hours, and arbitrary discharge from employ-
 ment. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. The law requires overtime payment
 on a graduated scale for additional hours. The Ivorian Labr Code provides for at
 least one 24-hour rest period per week.
 Government labor inspectors can order employers to improve substandard condi-
 tions, and a labor court can levy fines if the employer fails to comply. In the large
 informal sector of the economy, however involving both urban and rural workers,
 the Government's occupational health and safety regulations are enforced erratically
 at best. Ivorian workers in the formal sector have the right, under the Labor Code,
 to remove themselves from dangerous work without jeopardy to continued employ-
 ment by utilizing the Ministry of Labor inspection system to document danarous
 working conditions. However, workers in the informal sector cannot ordinarily re-
 move themselves from such labor without losing their employment.
