 GABON
 Gabon is a one-party state in which political power
 is effectively concentrated in the Presidency.
 Given the country's prosperity, small population
 and lack of ethnic tensions, there is little oppo-
 sition to the present leadership which has been in
 office since 1967. While political activities are
 circumscribed by the existence of a single party
 system, civil and individual rights are generally
 respected.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law in Gabon, and this
 prohibition appears to be followed in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Department of State has no knowledge that such
 treatment or punishment occurs.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Political detention of Gabonese citizens rarely
 occurs. Arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is pro-
 hibited by the Gabonese Constitution. While
 there -have been occasional exceptions, this pro-
 hibition appears to be generally respected.
 In July 1978, the Gabonese Government decided
 to expel most of the Beninese community of over
 10,000 persons following a political dispute be-
 tween Gabon and Benin. The decision sparked wide-
 spread Gabonese attacks on the Beninese, which
 were eventually quelled by the police. The Beninese
 were subsequently relocated in a temporary camp to
 
 
 59
 await final deportation which was accomplished via
 air transport by mid-August.
 Apart from the incidents generated by Gabonese-
 Beninese differences, arbitrary arrest and impri-
 sonment are rare.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair, public trial is guaranteed
 by the Gabonese Constitution which prohibits arbi-
 trary detention.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home is not officially sanctioned.
 There were cases during the past year when non-
 Gabonese, particularly Beninese and Equatorial
 Guineans, suffered invasion of the home by non-
 official Gabonese in the wake of political differ-
 ences between Gabon on one hand and Benin and
 Equatorial Guinea on the other. Confronted.with
 the situation, Gabonese officials provided protection
 to those affected.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Gabon's large mineral and timber resources and its
 small population (600,000) may have meant relatively
 high per capita income, but the distribution of
 income has been unequal, a problem which the Govern-
 ment has begun to address. Given its substantial
 foreign exchange earnings, Gabon has tended to import
 virtually everything it needs, and relatively high
 salaries have been accompanied by high prices. There
 is virtually no unemployment among Gabonese wishing
 to work. While instances of corruption are not uncom-
 mon, the problem is not a major one for Gabonese
 society.
 Although Gabonese investment programs have given
 priority to minerals and infrastructure projects,
 a substantial portion of the Gabonese budget is
 
 
 60
 devoted to providing shelter, health care and edu-
 cation. In the past two years, the Government
 has begun to improve agricultural productivity and
 the condition of the rural population. In spite
 of an austerity program which has forced curtail-
 ment of many development projects, those dealing
 with agriculture are being implemented. Free public
 education is available to all Gabonese, and an esti-
 mated eighty percent of those eligible to attend
 primary school do so. Free health benefits are
 theoretically available to all employed Gabonese
 and their families, although the system is hampered
 by shortages of doctors and medicines in both urban
 and rural areas.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Political liberities are restricted. There are
 no restrictions on religious worship or missionary
 activities in the country. There are also no legal
 restrictions on the right of assembly. However,
 since Gabon has only one political party, the Demo-
 cratic Party of Gabon (DPG), and a single labor
 federation closely affiliated with it, all assem-
 blies for political purposes above the village level
 require de facto government approval. Women are
 active in government and party affairs; the DPG
 has organized a Women's Union whose principal ob-
 jective is to increase the Gabonese woman's ability
 to participate more fully in modern society. All
 media are government controlled but coverage of
 international events is fairly objective and broadly
 based. Television frequently carries live news
 items from abroad. Reports of internal develop-
 ments are less numerous. Occasional stories cri-
 tical of the Government are permitted.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no significant restrictions on emigration
 
 
 or on freedom of movement within or travel outside
 the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Although all candidates for political office must
 have the approval of the single authorized party,
 there is considerable competition within the DPG
 for nomination to public office. Under the Consti-
 tution, the President is elected by universal suf-
 frage for a seven-year term concurrently with the
 deputies of the unicameral National Assembly.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Gabon has not always been responsive to requests
 for outside investigations. Although Amnesty
 International did not include a section on Gabon
 in its 1977 report, its 1976 report stated that
 the Gabonese Government did not cooperate with the
 organization's appeal for a general amnesty in the
 country. However, the report noted that in December
 1975, President Bongo announced an amnesty for all
 but one of the political prisoners who were sen-
 tenced six months earlier.
 The United Nations High Commission for Refugees
 opened an office in Libreville in November 1977.
 The Gabonese Government has cooperated with the
 High Commission in providing documentation and
 other services to the estimated 60,000 Equatorial
 Guinean refugees living in Gabon.
