 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is a one-party,
 Communist state. The Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP)
 is the source of all political authority in the country, and
 the party's leadership imposes broad and arbitrary controls on
 the population of approximately 3.9 million people.
 The LPRP came to power in 1975 after a protracted civil war,
 during which it received strong support from North Vietnam.
 Vietnam continues to exert considerable influence over Laos,
 codified in the 25-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation
 signed in 1977. The number of Vietnamese troops and advisers
 in Laos, however, has been declining since late 1987. The
 total of 40,000 to 50,000 troops originally stationed in Laos
 under the terms of the treaty has been greatly reduced. There
 have been reports that all Vietnamese combat troops and most
 military advisers have been withdrawn. In the last 2 years
 the LPDR has been working to improve relations with the West
 and to attract more Western assistance. The U.S.S.R. is also
 very influential in Laos; it is the largest contributor of
 economic and military assistance. Laos has begun to accept
 Soviet concepts of perestroika (restructuring), although the
 LPDR is seeking its own Lao formulation appropriate to its
 highly underdeveloped conditions.
 Established 14 years ago, the LPDR still has no constitution
 and no published code of law. However, elections were held in
 March for a national assembly to draft a constitution. All
 candidates in this election were approved by the LPRP,
 although a number of victorious candidates were not party
 members. A constitution is not expected before mid-1990 at
 the earliest.
 Laos is one of the poorest countries in the world. The
 Government's harsh policies, particularly in its first 5
 years, combined with difficult economic conditions in general,
 drove some 350,000 Lao into exile. Among those refugees were
 most of the educated elite. Laos accelerated its economic
 reform efforts in 1988 and 1989. These reforms are designed
 to stimulate domestic and foreign investment and to improve
 the efficiency of state-owned enterprises. Laos has also
 opened its economy to Thai and Western businessmen. Although
 the economy is improving as a result of these reforms and the
 ability of many citizens to participate in an emerging private
 or mixed state/private sector, the average standard of living
 remains extremely low.
 Although difficult for outside observers to judge accurately,
 the human rights situation appeared to have improved in 1989.
 Freedom of movement within the country and travel abroad has
 increased, and the instruments of state control, principally
 the police and other elements of the Ministry of Interior,
 seemed to be less evident and perhaps less oppressive.
 Nevertheless, there continue to be severe limitations on
 freedom of speech and press and on freedom of assembly and
 association. Most reeducation camps have been closed and the
 bulk of the prisoners released. An unknown number of inmates,
 but at least 34, are entering their 14th year of
 incarceration, without benefit of judicial trial or legal
 review for release. Many former camp prisoners apparently
 have been able to obtain work; some of them now have
 responsible, professional positions both with the Government
 of Laos and with international organizations present in
 Vientiane. Some, however, appear to be blacklisted and able
 to find only menial positions. These persons seem to be able
 
 
 901
 to obtain  assportsand visas as freely as any other Lao and
 have been'able to travel overseas, despite the fact that some
 have not-returned.
 *1ESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I- Respect for-the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Wteedom'fromr
 a. -Pol7itical and'Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There are sporadic reports of shooting-incidents involving
 organized groups leaving or entering Laos illegally. At least
 one group of Hmong tribesmen leaving Laos for Thailand was
 reported to have, been pushed back and then suffered casualties
 from LPDR forces. - ",In addition; in August the -Government -
 claimed to hde-,i-Aercepted and-killed or captured in southern
 Laos over 66 dfmed Vietnamese hostile to the Hanoi Government
 who had'intended to r6enter Vietnam. There are occasional
 reports-thaitgovernment Oatrols have fatally shot persons
 leaving or dntering Laos illegally. In those instances in
 which the Government c6nfirms such incidents, it generally
 claims that the persons were smugglers or members of the
 resistance. An unknowi but small number ofpeople are-killed
 annually in military operations against resistance forces,
 Many of the insurgents appear to'be former-Royal Lao Army
 troops and Hmong tribesmen. Both sides are reported to use
 brutalltactics, with antigovernment forces attempting
 assassintifi' aftid.amb'ti ,-6f 'government military and civilian
 personijel. -There are -lï¿½&'fecurreft reports of attacks by
 bandit groups-in'isolated-or intetior areas on vehicles
 bearing government-officials and on civilian buses. Official-
 policy calls for the execution of resistance leaders, but no
 such executions were reported'ii"1989.
 b. Disappearance         - -
 No disappdaraqcds were reported in 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishmefit
 A relatively gmalI'number of "reeducation" prisoners continue
 to be held in harsh conditions bdt'recent details are not
 available;7'The police do'not apodar to use torture or
 degrading Or akuel treatment during arrest or detention,
 although-p ison conditions are stark."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government'continues to maintain reeducation camps, or
 "seminar 6amps," in which persons who served the Royal Lao
 Government, or who have offended the current government, are
 imprisoned.- Even rough estimates fbr the population of these
 camps are difficult to make, but range from a minimum of 34
 politidal'Adainee -ieft-frdm the original popuiation'of Royal
 Lao Government officials to over 1,000. The higher number
 allegedly includes the original 34 plus many who were
 imprisoned-during the late 1970's and the 1980's. Government
 officials continued to claim, 'as they had previously, that
 nearly all sbldiers. and officials sent to the camps'in 1975-76
 -had been released and that very few remained. The accuracy of
 that statement cannot be verified. There were reports of
 releases of'groups of.up'to 300 persons in 1988. There were
 reports of additional, substantial releases of camp prisoners
 
 
 902
 LAOS
 in 1989, but firm numbers were not available. Since 1979
 conditions in the remaining camps reportedly have improved,
 and the majority of the camps have been reported closed. The
 Government claims that all reeducation camps have been closed.
 However, this claim has not been verified.
 Remaining detainees now live in a kind of internal exile in
 isolated provincial areas with severe restrictions on their
 freedom of movement. Many reportedly have been assigned to
 collective farms or construction units inside their former
 camps. Some are on probation or cannot obtain necessary
 travel documents. Others who have lost property and families
 are reported to have remained in areas near the camps to begin
 new lives.
 Those accused of hostility to the regime or of what the
 Government calls "socially undesirable habits," such as
 prostitution, drug abuse, idleness, and "wrong thought," are
 sent to "rehabilitation" centers, usually without trial. Most
 of these persons have been allowed to return to their homes
 after periods ranging from a few months to several years of
 hard labor, political indoctrination, and admission of guilt.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A criminal code and laws establishing a judiciary were enacted
 in November 1989 by the Supreme People's Assembly, although
 they had not taken effect or been published by year's end. It
 is not known what changes these laws may make to Lao legal
 procedures. At present the courts are not independent and
 there is no guarantee of due process. Prior to the recently
 passed criminal code, the Government had promulgated interim
 rules and regulations for the arrest and trial of those
 accused of specific crimes, including armed resistance to the
 Government. Although the regulations allow an accused person
 to make a statement presenting his or her side of the case,
 they provide no real opportunity for the accused to defend
 himself and do not permit bail or use of a freely chosen
 attorney. Rather, the Government has issued instructions on
 how to investigate, prosecute, and punish wrongdoers. These
 instructions are applied capriciously and inconsistently.
 People can be arrested on unsupported accusations and without
 being informed of the charges or the accusers' identities.
 Investigations often take a long time unless family members
 and friends take a strong interest in the cases. Government
 officials and their families easily can influence judgments.
 There is some provision for appeal, although important
 political cases tried by "people's courts" are without an
 appeals process. Death sentences must be approved by the
 Council of Ministers. Regulations call for judgment to be
 given in public. This generally amounts to a public
 announcement of the sentence and not a true public trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There appears to have been some relaxation of state control by
 the police and security elements. Knowledgeable observers
 report seeing fewer obvious signs of monitoring and control of
 citizens. However, search and seizure continue to be
 authorized by the security bureaus themselves rather than by
 judicial authority, and government regulations, which are not
 always followed, provide little protection. International and
 
 
 903
 LAOS
 domestic mail is selectively opened. Mail from China and
 non-Communist countries is particularly suspect. Telephone
 calls are frequently monitored. Privately owned land may npt
 be sold but may be inherited. Inheritances cannot be passed
 on to relatives who have left the country as refugees and
 acquired other-nationalities.
 The Government continues to try to monitor some aspects of
 family and work life through a system of neighborhood and
 workplace informants.
 Section 2 Respect for+Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Public expression of opposition to the Party and State is not
 permitted,- and participants insuch activity have been
 jailed. Newspapers and the state radio are instruments of the
 Government, reflecting only its views. Ordinary citizens may
 not import foreign newsmagazines or books; censorship is
 strict.
 The Government makes no attempt to stop citizens from
 listening to foreign radio stations such as the Voice of
 America, nor from setting up antennas to receive Thai
 television.
 Academic freedom does not exist.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government controls all meetings and, except for
 religious, athletic, and communal events, organizes-them.
 Persons do not have the right to promote nonregime-sponsored
 activities norx.to protest government policies. All
 associations--such as those for youth, women, workers, and a
 "peace organization"--are officially authorized to exercise
 government control and disseminate government policy. The
 LPRP organizes all professional groups, and their leadership
 is ordinarily drawn from party ranks., Associations are
 permitted to maintain relations with like-minded, politically
 acceptable organizations-in o.ther- countries, particularly
 those in Communist countries. -Ordinary Lao citizens are able-
 to meet-with foreigners only in unusual circumstances, usually
 involving their work. Nevertheless, contact with foreigners
 is increasing.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 NearlyalX Lao are Buddhists or, in the case of most highland
 groups, animists. In official statements, the Government has.
 recognizeA the right-to free ,exercise of religious.belief as
 well as the contributions religion can make to the development
 of the country.
 Many Lao believe, however, that the Government is engaged in a
 long-term effort to subvert religion because it considers the
 maintenance of temples and the activities of monks non-
 productive and because it objects to active groups with
 independent beliefs. This effort includes carefully
 controlling the education of young monks and compelling
 Buddhist clergy to propagate elements of Marxist-Leninist
 
 
 904
 doctrine. Further, since 1975 the Government periodically has
 taken over Buddhist and Christian places of worship for use as
 schools, offices, and fire and police stations, as well as for
 political indoctrination centers and warehouses. Nonetheless,
 since the Third Party.Congress in 1982, the Government has
 eased its stand on Buddhism. While it has not, so far as is
 known, contributed to the restoration of temples and religious
 institutions, it has not opposed efforts of the faithful to do
 so, and both restoration and new building are now widely
 evident.
 Monks remain the only social group still entitled to special
 honorific terms of address, which even high party and
 government officials continue to use. Buddhist clergy are
 prominently featured at important state and party functions.
 Religious festivals are permitted without hindrance. The
 Government does not object to the Lao custom of young people
 entering religious orders for short periods.
 Links may be maintained with coreligionists and religious
 associations in other countries, usually other Communist
 countries, only when approved by the Government. Most
 traditional links to Thai religious sects have been severed.
 Missionaries are not formally banned from entering Laos to
 proselytize, but in most cases they are denied permission.
 Despite the overall government attitude, many high party
 officials still participate in religious ceremonies.
 Roman Catholics and Protestants are permitted to worship, but
 the activities of their churches are closely monitored.
 Vatican officials visited in 1987 to meet with the Bishop of
 Vientiane, as well as with local church and government
 officials. Attendance at Christian services continues to
 require discretion, although less so in 1989 than in 1988.
 The Government tries through the media and other means to
 persuade highland minority groups to abandon their
 "old-fashioned" animist beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens must obtain permission from the authorities for
 internal travel. Non-Lao residents in Vientiane must obtain
 permission to travel outside the city. Permission is now much
 easier to obtain than before, but is not necessarily automatic.
 Government officials have cited threats of "disorders" created
 by "reactionary elements" as the reason for the restrictions.
 Foreign travel is increasingly permitted for officials,
 students, and others who have family abroad or access to
 foreign exchange. Most students continue to study in the
 Communist countries, but the number of students going to the
 West for higher education, although still small, has increased
 dramatically. Passports and exit visas have become much
 easier to obtain. The number of the relatively few travelers
 to the West and to the United States has increased sharply.
 Border crossing permits are available for those with business
 in Thailand. The number of permits increased in 1989, in
 keeping with the opening of additional border trade locations
 and the reduction in the number of items restricted by the
 Thai Government for trade with Laos. The permits are not,
 however, granted automatically and may be denied arbitrarily.
 Legal emigration is rarely authorized for ethnic Lao. To
 guard against emigration, those permitted to travel must often
 
 
 905
 leave their families behind as a guarantee of their return.
 Since iR75, 343,000 Lao citizens have registered as refugees
 in Thailand. An unknown number have crossed the border and
 simply settled with relatives or kindred ethnic groups.
 Some of those fleeing are fired upon and killed by border
 patrols as they attempt to cross the Mekong River. Government
 authorities have imprisoned many persons seeking to leave the
 coiintry-,illegally.
 Laos and Thailand have agreed to take back, on a case-by-case
 basis, those of their respective citizens who have illegally
 crossed into the other country and now wish to return home.
 Since May 1980, when agreement was reached with Thailand and
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on a
 voluntary repatriation program, over 4,675 persons have
 voluntarily returned to Laos under the auspices of the UNHCR.
 Those accepted for return receive several days~of-political
 indoctrination and then are released to return to their homes,
 where they are placed under the-control of village
 authorities. The UNHCR provides basic necessities for the
 returnees and monitors their treatment and living conditions
 thereafter. There appears to be no official harassment or
 maltreatment~of these voluntary returnees, and UNHCR officials
 have not been preventedfrom visiting them. In addition,
 perhaps as many as 10,000 persons have repatriated themselves
 without official involvement.
 The Government. has also agreed in principle to take back Lao
 citizens in Thailand whom the Thai have determined do not meet
 refugee status criteria. Procedures for the return of these
 persons were-worked out between the two countries in late
 1986, and since that time 164 have been returned. Those in
 Vientiane who follow refugee matters closely report that there
 is no perceptible difference in the way the Government treats
 those returnees who were screened out and those who returned
 voluntarily.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government.
 The LPRW fully controls the Government. The LPRP is run by a
 small elite who also occupy many of the principal government
 posts. - There ip neither freedom to participate in politics
 outside the party nor popular choice of policies. The new
 National Assembly elected in March includes a number of
 assemblymen who are,not formally LPRP members, although their
 candidacies, were approved by the party.- Some 121 candidates
 ran for a total of 79 seats, and each electoral district had
 more candidates than seats. This election followed elections
 for district and provincial officials in 1988. No other
 parties were permitted to organize and voting was mandatory.
 These elections, the first held since the LPDR was formed in
 1975, reprgesent an effort by the LPRP to legitimize the
 Government and may represent some political liberalization.
 The new National Assembly is expected to finish writing a
 constitution in 1990 which may then be approved by a
 plebiscite. This new constitution would serve as a framework
 for the criminal code and laws establishing a judiciary and
 would also serve as a basis for additional laws.
 
 
 906
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Laos generally does not cooperate with private international
 human rights organizations. However, it does occasionally
 permit visits by officials of international humanitarian
 organizations and has communicated with them by letters. No
 domestic human rights monitoring groups are permitted.
 Section 5 Discrimination-Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Approximately half of the population in Laos is ethnic Lao;
 also called "lowland Lao;" 20 percent are tribal Thai; 15
 percent are Phoutheung (or Kha); and another 15 percent are
 other highland groups (Hmong, Yao, and others). The
 Government is attempting to integrate these groups through
 voluntary programs and to overcome traditional antagonisms
 between lowland Lao and minority groups. Although the LPRP
 and the Government are dominated by lowland Lao, efforts have
 been made to include-ninorities in the political and
 governmental elites. -For instance, 43 of the 121 candidates
 for the National Assembly were from minority groups.
 The Hmong are split along clan lines. During the years of
 insurgency, many were strongly anti-Communist; others sided
 with the Communist Pathet Lao and the Vietnamese. The
 Government represses all groups that fought against it,
 especially those continuing to resist its authority by force.
 The Hmong tried to defend some of their tribal areas after
 1975, and some continue to support anti-LPDR resistance
 groups. Lao armed forces conduct operations against
 resistance groups.
 The Government wants to resettle in the lowlands some ethnic
 minorities from mountainous areas. After resettlement they
 would be under closer government control and engage i-n settled
 agricultural production rather than the present slash-and-burn
 techniques. For this purpose, the Government has reportedly
 relied on a voluntary program based on material inducements
 and has begun several large-scale projects with foreign donors.
 Local ethnic Chinese have encountered government suspicion and
 surveillance since 1979 when Sino-Lao relations deteriorated
 seriously. This has abated, however, since relations between
 Laos and the People's Republic of China were normalized in
 1988. A majority of the Chinese community departed in the
 post-1975 period, largely for economic reasons. Those who
 remain have maintained government-approved Chinese schools in
 Vientiane and Savannakhet and Chinese associations in several
 provincial capitals.
 Traditionally, women in Lao society have been subservient to
 men and often discouraged from obtaining an education. Today
 the active, government-controlled Lao Women's Federation has
 as one of its goals the achievement of equal rights for
 women. The Government claims that a higher percentage of
 women make up the school population now than before 1975, and
 that women are being encouraged to assume a greater role in
 economic and state-controlled political activity.
 There is no pattern of widespread domestic or culturally
 approved violence against women. Both lowland Lao and hill
 tribes tend to hold women in lower esteem than men.

 LAOS
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The overwhelming majority of workers are employed by the
 State, and they are very poorly paid. Labor laws do not
 exist. Labor unions exist but are small and have no right to
 strike. All unions are controlled by the Federation of Lao
 Trade Unions, which in turn is controlled by the LPRP. The
 Federation is a member of the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions.
 The LPDR is a member of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO), but has not ratified ILO Conventions 87 on freedom of
 association, 98 on the right to organize and bargain
 collectively, or any other conventions related to the worker
 rights covered in this report. In its 1989 report, the ILO
 Committee of Experts cited the LPDR for failing to respond to
 its requests for information concerning pending complaints.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions play no discernible role in ameliorating the low
 salaries and wages, for instance, of public employees, the
 largest single category of employment. Under the foreign
 investment code published in 1988, some worker rights are
 guaranteed, such as the right to have job responsibilities
 defined, to be .paid for that job and not another, to be paid
 more for overtime, and for overtime to be approved by the
 authorities as well as by the investor. There are no economic
 incentive zones or special industries where labor standards
 differ from those elsewhere in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While there is no published code of laws concerning protection
 from forced labor, there is no general pattern of forced labor
 in Laos. Prisoners in reeducation camps, or in prison camps
 (the former for "ideological" crimes, the latter for
 "economic" or 'social" offenses) are expected to do hard
 labor. In addition, there are reports that some of these
 prisoners, when released, are restricted to the general area
 of the camp (always in rugged and mountainous terrain) and
 expected to work there on state enterprises.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no minimum age for employment of children. In
 practice children in this rural economy commonly assist in the
 work of their families.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Workplace conditions are not systematically exploitative, but
 they sometimes fail to protect workers adequately against
 sickness o'r accident. There is no specific system of laws or
 regulations relating to worker safety. Working hours do not
 exceed 48 hours a week, except during urgent roadbuilding or
 construction projects. It is unclear whether such urgent
 labor is compulsory. There is no minimum wage legislation;
 wages are low, particularly in the state sector and are, in
 fact, not sufficient to live on unless supplemented by other
 sources of income. Some workers receive paid 2-week vacations.
