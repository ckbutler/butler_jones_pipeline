 KAZAKESTAN
 In its third year of independence, Kazakhstan continued to grapple uncertainly
 with the task of shedding Soviet-era authoritarian political institutions and a cen-
 tralized command economy. President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in his third year of
 a 5-year term in office, remained the leading political figure in the country and
 sought to bolster his position in multiparty elections in March for the Supreme So-
 viet (legislature) and local councils. The elections were seriously compromised by
 fraud and judged by international observers as not free and fair. Nevertheless, the
 Supreme Soviet's independence as a separate branch of government was strength-
 ened by some reformist deputies and by conservatives who showed loyalty to re-
 gional interests. It rejected certain economic and social policies as well as some ap-
 pointees put forward by the President. In October, blaming top ministers for poor
 progress on economic reform, Nazarbayev replaced Cabinet members with a largely
 younger and more reformist group.
 The Ministry of Internal Affair supervises the criminal police, who are poorly
 paid and corruptible. The Committee for National Security (KN) sought to legiti-
 mize its role by focusing on efforts to counter terrorism, organized crime, and official
 orruption. Efforts to build a small, modern army were imppeded by the shortage of
 funds, the flight of ethnic Russian officers to Russia, and continued brutal hazing
 of conscripts.
 Kazakhatan is rich in natural resources, such as oil and minerals, but its state-
 dominated economy continued to decline sharply in 1994, with high inflation, falling
 production, and a budget deficit of one-tenth of the gross domestic product. Agricul-
 tural production remained largely collectivized. Bureaucratic restraints, high taxes,
 and rampant government corruption hampered the small but dynamic private sec-
 tor. Privatization, a vital necessity for economic recovery and growth, gained mo-
 mentum, but abuses and lack of openness led to strong public concerns. While gen-
 eral macroeconomic stabilization came in 1994, faster microeconomic, or structural,
 reforms are needed.
 Massive fraud in the March elections effectively deprived citizens of the right to
 change their government (see Section 3). The Government turned over Uzbek dis-
 sidents to security forces of the Government of Uzbekistan (see Section 1.d.). Crimi-
 nal police continued to beat some detainees and search homes without warrants,
 and prison conditions deteriorated fiurther due to budget restrictions. Freedom of the
 media is extensive and the press frequently criticized the Government despite gov-
 ernment control o? printing facilities and supplies. Freedoms of assembly and reli-
 gion were generally respected, but the Government refused to register associations
 and political parties based on ethnic and religious criteria. The 'propiska" system
 of permits for residence in the capital is still used to restrict internal freedom of
 movement. Although Kazakh discrimination against non-Kazakhs continued, such
 practices decreased as ethnic Slavs became more vocal. Domestic violence against
 women continued. While seeking to become somewhat more independent and critical
 of the Government, state-sponsored unions continued to subject independent trade
 unions and their members to harassment and pressure.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial K1lling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law prohibits these practices, there were credible reports that police
 beat and otherwise treated detainees abusively to obtain confessions.
 Prison conditions deteriorated further in 1994 due to diminishing budget re-
 sources and an increase in the number of persons incarcerated. According to human
 rights groups, in one Almaty prison, for example, 3,900 prisoners occupied a facility
 designed for 1,800. The prison diet is inadequate. Prisoners are allowed to receive
 only one visit every 6 months, but additional visits may be granted in emergency
 situations. Juveniles are kept in separate facilities.
 
 
 According to press reports and human rights observers, inadequate diet and medi-
 cal supplies have led to outbreaks of tuberculosis and dystrophy in many of
 Kazakhstan's prisons. Lice and scabies are common. Some 40 prisoners in
 Karaganda and 35 in Atyrau reportedly died from conditions aggravated by
 malnourishment and lack of basic medical treatment. Prison guards, who are poorly
 paid, steal food and medicines from the prisons, leaving little for the prisoners. Vio-
 lent crime among prisoners is routine. There was an unconfirmed report of cannibal-
 ism in a prison in Semipalatinsk in which five prisoners killed and ate a cell mate.
 According to the Kazakhstan-American Human Rights Bureau, there were 85,000
 prisoners in Kazakhstan in 1994, of whom 6,000 suffered major illnesses because
 of inadequate diet and sanitation. About 1,150 prisoners died of those illnesses dur-
 "'L.Ar~trary Arrest, Detention, or Exle.-Because of the slow pace of legal reform,
 Kazakhstan continued to use the Soviet legal system, with some modifications, in
 1994. The law sanctions pretrial detention. Prosecutors issue arrest warrants. Ac-
 cording to the Criminal Procedure Code, police may hold a detainee for 3 days be-
 fore bringing charges. After 3 days, police may continue to hold the detainee with
 the approval of a prosecutor, but no ionger than 10 days without bringing charges.
 In practice, however, police routinely hold detainees for more than the legal 10- ay
 limit.
 The maximum length of pretrial detention is 1 year. Pretrial detainees comprised
 about 30 percent of the total prison population in 1994. Detainees are not held in-
 communicado. Defendants in criminal cases have the right to choose an attorney
 and to appeal the legality of their arrest to the prosecutor before trial. If the defend-
 ant cannot afford an attorney, the State will provide one free of charge. There is
 no provision for bail; defendants remain incarcerated until trial. Some lawyers fear
 reprisals if they represent a client unpopular with the Government, but there were
 no reports of such reprisals in 1994. Many lawyers, nevertheless, remain reluctant
 to defend clients of whom the Government is suspicious.
 There were instances of arrest without the filing of specific charges. In May the
 Government arrested 3,000 to 4,000 people in what it announced was an emergency
 measure against crime. Ninety percent were eventually released without being
 charged.
 In 1994 members of Uzbekistan's security services in two instances attempted to
 arrest Uzbek dissidents in Kazakhstan. The first occurred in May during a human
 rights conference in Almaty when Uzbek security agents openly sought Uzbek dis-
 sidents at their hotels. The Government reactedswiftly, publicly announcing that
 the Uzbek agents had been located and that they had departed, and that it would
 guarantee the safety of all those attending the conference.
 The second incident occurred in June when the Uzbekistan Government, acting
 under the Minsk Convention of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on
 cooperation among the security services of CIS member states, requested the arrest
 of two Uzbek dissidents, Murat Dzhurayev and Dzhakhangir Mametov, on charges
 of murder. Kazakhstani authorities permitted Uzbek agents to arrest Dzhurayev
 and another Uzbek dissident, Erkin Ashurov (but not Mametov), and take them to
 Uzbekistan. Once in Uzbekistan, Uzbek authorities dropped the murder charges and
 instead charged the two with distributing illegal literature and conspiring to over-
 throw the Government of Uzbekistan. In August the Uzbekistan National Security
 Service asked the Kazakhstani KNB to interrogate four Kazakhstani citizens whose
 names were found among belongings of the arrested dissidents. The KNB interro-
 gated the four but did not arrest or otherwise harass them. Kazakhstani human
 rights groups and several Supreme Soviet deputies protested the interrogations.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria!.--Government interference and pressure com-
 promise the court system's independence. During the campaign for the March Su-
 preme Soviet elections, local officials in a number of areas around the country pres-
 sured local courts to rule against opposition candidates who contested the refusal
 of local election commissions to register them as candidates. Several independent
 trade unions have claimed that local courts often rule against them and that they
 can expect a fairer hearing if they appeal to a higher court.
 There are three levels in the court system: the local level, the oblast (province)
 level, and the Supreme Court. The President recommends nominees for the Su-
 preme Court for Supreme Soviet approval. Heads of oblasts recommend nominees
 for oblast soviet (council) approval. Regional or city councils elect, at least nomi-
 nally, lower level judges. Judges are appointed for 10-year terms. The Constitutional
 Court, established in 1992, interprets the Constitution, resolves legal conflicts be-
 tween oblasts, and rules on interethnic problems. The law provides for due process,
 including the right to a public trial, the right to counsel, the right to call witnesses
 for the defense, and the right to appeal a decision to a higher court.
 
 
 859
 Local courts try less serious crimes such as petty theft and vandalism
 (hooliganism, in the old terminology). Oblast-level courts handle more serious
 crimes, such as murder, grand theft, and organized criminal activities. The oblast
 courts may handle cases in rural areas where no local courts are organized. Judg-
 ments of the local courts may be appealed to the oblast-level courts, while those of
 the oblast courts may be appealed to the Supreme Court. A special arbitration court
 handles disputes between state enterprises.
 There were no known political prisoners in 1994.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 KNB and Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the concurrence of the Procuracy, may
 arbitrarily interfere with privacy, family, home, and correspondence, a legacy of So-
 viet rule. The law requires criminal police, who remain part of the internal security
 structure, to obtain a search warrant from a prosecutorb efore conducting a search,
 but they sometimes search without a warrant. There were credible reports in 1994
 that police occasionally planted evidence.
 The KNB has the right to monitor telephone calls and mail, but under the law
 it must inform the Procuracy within 3 days of such activity.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the 1991 press law pro-
 vide for freedom of the press. The Government continued to own and control print-
 ing and distribution facilities and to subsidize periodicals, including many sup-
 posedly "independent" ones. However, the opposition press, while dependent on gov-
 ernment control of printing supplies, was not subject to intimidation or harassment.
 Although self-censorship continued, some print media increasingly criticized Su-
 preme Soviet and presidential decisions, the Government's performance, and official
 corruption. The independent newspaper, Karavan, was particularly successful in ex-
 panding its circulation (to about 300,000) and sharply criticized many government
 policies and actions. Most political opposition groups issue their own publications.
 There are many radio and television companies, both governmental and private,
 but the Government controls broadcasting facilities. In April President Nazarbayev
 restructured state television and radio into a corporation, which encouraged inde-
 pendent stations to join it in exchange for national broadcast time. Fearing govern-
 ment control, leaders of independent television and radio immediately objected to
 joining the corporation. Their op sition, in which some members of Parliament and
 even the Ministry of Press anVass Media joined, was strong enough to prevent
 the corporation from gaining control over the independents.
 During the parliamentary election campaign in the winter and early spring of
 1994, the television station Telemax went off the air for several days when local au-
 thorities, upset by broadcasts critical of Almaty's mayor and other city officials, shut
 off electricity to the station. The station owners moved to an undisclosed location
 and continued to broadcast criticism of the local authorities. Later in the spring,
 when the independent television station from which Telemax had purchased brad-
 cast time expanded its programming and took back the broadcast time, Telemax
 went off the air, but its affiliate radio stations continue to broadcast news critical
 of local and national government.
 Laws insulting the President and Supreme Soviet deputies remain on the books,
 but according to government officials the provisions for punishment for "insulting"
 have been dropped. No one was prosecuted for "insulting" in 1994.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, but there are some significant restrictions.
 Local authorities must approve a demonstration 10 days in advance, or else they
 consider it illegal The court sentenced five organizers of a demonstration outside
 the Supreme Soviet in May to 3- to 15-day jail terms for organizing an illegal dem-
 onstration.
 To participate in elections, a political party must register with the Government.
 To register, a party must submit a list of at least 3,000 members from a minimum
 of 11 (out of 19) different oblasts. The list must provide personal information about
 the members, including date and place of birth, address, and place of employment.
 Submitting such personal data to the Government recalls for many Kazakhstanis
 old-style KGB tactics and inhibits them from joining parties. The nationalist and
 pan-Turkic Alash Party and the Social Democratic Party have refused to register
 on the principle that they should not have to submit personal information about
 their members to the Government. Members of unregistered parties may run for
 elected office as individuals but not as party members.
 Organizations or movements that conduct public activity, hold public meetings,
 participate in conferences, or have bank accounts must also register with the Gov-
 ernment. Registration on the local level requires a minimum of 10 members and on
 
 
 860
 the national level a minimum of 10 members in at least 11 oblasts. The Govern-
 ment's refusal to register religious and ethnic-based parties and movements is not
 a stated polcy, although some officials refer to Article 55 of the Constitution, which
 prohibits public associations proclaiming or demonstrating in practice racist, nation-
 alist, social, or religious intolerance or elitist exclusivity. In November the Ministry
 of Justice suspended the activities of the Semirechye Cossack Society for para-
 military activities and promotion of ethnic intolerance. The Society organized a
 peaceful but unauthorized demonstration in Almaty on November 19. Two organiz-
 ers were arrested.
 According to the new Civil Code adopted in December, political parties, trade
 unions, and social organizations "engaged in political activity" are prohibited from
 receiving financial assistance from foreign sources.
 Government officials have justified decisions not to register ethnic-based parties
 and movements on the grounds that their activities could spark ethnic violence. Un-
 registered parties and movements are, nonetheless, able to hold meetings and pub-
 lish newspapers, although these groups frequently appear to have more difficulty
 obtaining printing supplies than other publishers.
 c. reedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 various denominations worship without government interference. However, a new
 Civil Code passed by the Supreme Soviet in December requires state authorities to
 approve the appointment of the Kazakhstan director of any religious organization
 operating in Kazakhstan.
 The Islamic Mufti and the Russian Orthodox Archbishop have appeared together
 publicly to promote religious and ethnic harmony. Foreign missionaries, unwelcome
 to some Orthodox and Muslim Kazakhstanis, have complained of occasional harass-
 ment by some low-level government bureaucrats.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right to emigrate, which is respected
 in practice.
 The propiska system of residence permits, a holdover from the Soviet era, re-
 mained in effect in 1994. Since 1992, citing ecological and health reasons, the
 Almaty city administration has limited the transfer of residences in Almaty to peo-
 ple already living there. According to human rights activists, the rising demand to
 live in Almaty (because of its greater relative affluence) has resulted in a bribery
 market for propiskas ranging from $1,000 to $3,000. Obtaining a propiska for other
 parts of the country was generally routine. There is considerable favoritism toward
 ethnic Kazakhs in the allocational transfer of residences. For example, the Almaty
 city administration is more likely to give permission to sell or trade a residence if
 a Kazakh is to receive the property.
 An exit visa is required for travel abroad, although refusals are exceptional. There
 have been reports of some officials demanding bribes for exit visas.
 The Government accords special treatment to Kazakhs and their families who fled
 Kazakhstan during Stalin's time and wish to return. Kazakhs in this category are
 encouraged to return to Kazakhstan, are entitled to Kazakhstani citizenship, and
 may retain any other citizenship they may already have. Anyone else, including eth-
 nic Kazakhs who are not considered refugees from the Stalin era, such as the de-
 scendants of Kazakhs who moved to Mongolia during the previous century must
 apply for permission to return and must renounce any other citizenship. Ethnic
 Kazakh citizens already living in Kazakhstan, as well as nonethnic Kazakh citizens,
 are not permitted to obtain another citizenship without losing their Kazakhstani
 citizenship.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 While the Constitution provides for this right, the Government infringed it in
 fraudulent March 7 elections for the Supreme Soviet and local councils (maslikhats).
 In December 1993, the Supreme Soviet voted to advance the date of parliamentary
 and local elections (scheduled to be held at 5-year intervals) from autumn 1994 to
 March 7. This left little time for the Government to prepare a new election law and
 for parties and candidates to prepare election campaigns.
 The Government invited the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
 (CSCE) and other international observers to monitor the elections. The CSCE ob-
 servers concluded that the elections did not meet international standards for free
 and fair elections for the following reasons:
 (1) the requirement that voters choose about 20 percent of the deputies from
 a list of names chosen by the President (the "state list");
 (2) manipulation of errors and ambiguities in the hastily written election law
 in favor of progovernment candidates;
 
 
 (3) the stuffing of ballot boxes in many locations;
 (4) denial of the right to register many opposition candidates;
 (5) court support for the refusal of election commissions to register opposition
 candidates- appeals to the Constitutional and Supreme Courts were ineffective;
 (6) the abettng of election rigging by the Central Electoral Commission, thus
 compromising its integrity;
 ('7) a number of pollng placs were "closed" to observers;
 (8) and harassment andintimidation by the authorities of independent media
 which were critical of the activities of local election commissions, particularly
 in Almaty and Karaganda.
 There is some irony in the fact that this fraud, presumably intended to ensure
 a more progovernment and compliant Parliament, was somewhat counterproductive
 because so many of those elected showed more loyalty on some issues to their re-
 gions (which were suffering from the economic crisis) than to the central Govern-
 ment. For example, in June Parliament registered a vote of no confidence in the
 Cabinet's economic and social policies.
 In October Parliament rejected President Nazarbayev's proposed candidate for
 deputy prime minister for political and social affairs on the grounds that he was
 corrupt, and then voted down a second candidate because he was perceived to be
 too young to occupy such a senior position. Late in 1994, parliamentary opposition
 forced President Nazarbayev to abandon his bid to create a bicameral legislature,
 with a more malleable upper house. Parliamentary opposition to the Government's
 policies comes from both genuine democratic reformers and from conservatives who
 are protecting parochial or local interests. On some issues they join forces. The com-
 bined effect of this opposition has been to make the Parliament more independent.
 The next presidential elections (also held every 5 years) are scheduled for 1996.
 All men and women above the age of 18 have the right to vote. President
 Nazarbayev was elected by 98 percent of the vote in an uncontested election in
 1991.
 The number of seats in the Supreme Soviet is 177: 135 elected directly, and 42
 (2 from each oblast or special administrative area) elected from the "state list" of
 candidates chosen by the President.
 There are four legally registered political parties: the Socialist Party; the People's
 Congress Party (formed by poet an  environmentalist Olzhas Suleymenov); the Na-
 tional Democratic Party (the political arm of the Kazakh nationalist movement
 Azat); and the Communist Party, reregistered in July 1994. The Union of People's
 Unity (SNEK), a registered social movement created by President Nazarbayev to
 support his presidency, has the largest number of deputies of any group in Par-
 liament. Only about 80 members of the Supreme Soviet are affiliated with a political
 party, movement, or social organization. President Nazarbayev, although officially
 not a member of any party, has accepted the formal endorsement of the SNEK.
 U   eitered opposition parties and movements include the Social Democrats, the
 Alash Party, and the conservative Kazakh nationalist Republican Party. The Gov-
 ernment has refused to register any party or movement whose platforms it claims
 will foment ethnic tensions.
 There are no legal restrictions on women participating in politics and government.
 Owing to prejudice and traditional attitudes, however, few women are professionally
 active in these fields. Of 177 Supreme Soviet deputies, 22 are women. The Constitu-
 tion guarantees equal political rights for all citizens regardless of ethnicity or sex.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The most active of several local human rights organizations are the Helsinki
 Watch Group and the Kazakhstan-American Human Rights Association which oper-
 ated without government interference. The Helsinki Watch Group has limited orga-
 nizational and financial means to observe, contest, and report human rights viola-
 tions. The Kazakhstan-American Human Rights Association receives assistance
 from the Union of Councils of Soviet Jews. The two goups cooperate closely on
 human rights issues, such as the arrest of Uzbek dissidents (see Section .d.). The
 Kazakhstan-American Human Rights Association sponsored human rights con-
 ferences in Almaty in May and in November in which government officials and par-
 liamentarians participated.
 The Government permitted representatives of foreign nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) dealing with human rights and the environment to visit and meet
 with opposition and environmentalist groups as well as some government officials.
 However, Kazakhstan law currently has no provision for registering foreign NGO's.
 In November the Government signed an agreement formalizing registration of U.S.
 NGO's. For periods of time in 1994, the Government interfered with telephone and
 
 
 862
 
 facsimile (fax) communications of the International Republican Institute, the Na-
 tional Democratic Institute, and Isar, an environmental NGO. The new Civil Code
 prohibits organizations, including political parties and trade unions, from receiving
 financial assistance from foreign sources. Some government officials assert that the
 work of foreign NGO's with Kazakhstani political and labor groups promotes insta-
 bility. Some human rights observers complained that the Government monitored
 their movements and telephone calls.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4rion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Article 1 of the Constitution states, "Citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan are
 guaranteed equality of rights and freedoms, regardless of race; nationality; sex; lan-
 guage; social, property, and official status; social origin; place of residence; attitude
 to religion; convictions; membership in a public association; as well as previously in-
 curred- criminal punishment. Any form of discrimination against citizens is forbid-
 den."
 Women.-There is no legal discrimination against women, but women are severely
 underrepresented in higher positions in government and state enterprises and over-
 represented in low-paying and some menial jobs. Women are disadvantaged in pro-
 motions, but they generally have access to higher education.
 According to human rights groups, there is considerable domestic violence agit
 women, and wife beating is common, particularly because of widespread alcohol
 abuse among men. Police are often reluctant to intervene in cases of spousal abuse,
 considering it to be the "family's business," unless they believe the physical abuse
 is life-threatening. The maximum sentence for wife beating is 3 years, but few such
 cases are prosecuted. The Government has not specifically addressed the problem
 as one requiring new policies or government actions.
 Children.-The Government is committed in princi Is to children's rights, but, as
 in many other areas, the absence of a tradition of civi liberties, together with budg-
 et stringencies, severely limits its effectiveness in dealing with children's rights is-
 sues. There is no established pattern of governmental or societal abuse against chil-
 dren. There were credible reports of the use of child labor during harvests, particu-
 larly during the cotton harvest in the south (see Section 6.d.).
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Kazakhstan's population of about 17 million
 is about 44 percent Kazakhs and 36 percent Russians, with Slavs and many other
 ethnic groups represented.
 The Government continued to discriminate in favor of ethnic Kazakhs in employ-
 ment, in government and state-controlled enterprises, as well as in education, hous-
 ing, and other areas. Although some officials are Slavs, ethnic Kazakhs increasingly
 predominate in government and in higher positions in state enterprises. The per-
 centage of non-Kazakhs in the new Supreme Soviet increased, however, from 22 per-
 cent to 40 percent. President Nazarbayev has publicly emphasized that all nationali-
 ties are welcome in Kazakhstan, but most non-Kazakhs are anxious about what
 they perceive as expanding preferences for ethnic Kazakhs. Many ethnic Kazakhs,
 however, believe they were second-class citizens under Russian domination for a pe-
 riod of 200 years and that they must take affirmative action to reverse this. Under
 Communist rule, Soviet authorities repressed Kazakh and other minority languages
 and cultures, and ethnic Slavs had better opportunities for advancement.
 Most of the population speaks Russian; only about half of the ethnic Kazakhs can
 speak Kazakh fluently. The January 1993 Constitution provides that Kazakh would
 be the state language, that Russian would be the language of interethnic commu-
 nication, and that there would be a transition period (the duration of which was left
 undefined) for the majority of the population to learn Kazakh. The Government is
 encouraging more education of children in the Kazakh language but has done little
 to provide Kazakh-language education for adults. Although still an important politi-
 cal issue, the economic crisis, corruption, and the demand of many ethnic Russians
 for dual Kazakhstan-Russian citizenship eclipsed the issue of language.
 At the end of 1994, Kazakhstan andRussia initialed agreements that established
 broad legal rights for the citizens of one country living on the territory of the other,
 and provided for expeditious naturalization for citizens of one country who move to
 the other. These agreements--which remain to be ratified-represent a pragmatic,
 positive step toward resolution of the difficult issue of citizensp and may well re-
 duce pressure for dual citizenship.
 People With Disabilities.-According to the Constitution, citizens with disabilities
 are entitled to assistance from the State. As a result of inflation, people relying on
 state disability benefits experienced severe economic hardship. There is no legal dis-
 crimination against people with disabilities, but in practice employers do not give
 them equal consideration. The Government so far has not legislated or otherwise
 
 
 863
 mandated accessibility for the disabled. Issues affecting the disabled are low prior-
 ities in the current economic crisis.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1993 Labor Code, along with the Constitution,
 provides for basic workers' rights, including the right to organize and the right to
 strike. The law does not, however, provide mechanisms to protect workers who join
 independent unions from threats or harassment by enterprise management or from
 the state-run unions. Kazakhstan joined the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 in 1993, but the Supreme Soviet has not yet ratified any ILO conventions. Further
 according to the new Civil Code, trade unions would be forbidden to accept financial
 assistance from foreign sources.
 Most workers remained members of the system of state-sponsored trade unions
 that was established during the Communist period. Membership was obligatory. At
 most enterprises, the state-sponsored unions continue to deduct automatically 1 per-
 cent of each worker's wage as dues. In addition, the government pension fund with-
 holds 30.2 percent of each worker's wage and the state unions, which have the au-
 thority to allocate funds for disability and sick pay, housing, and the use of vacation
 retreats, take 7.3 percent. The state unions under the Communist system were, and
 for the most part still are, organs of the Government, and use their power coercively
 to enforce labor discipline and to discourage workers from forming or joining inde-
 pendent unions.
 The Constitution entitles workers to join or form unions of their own choosing and
 to stop the automatic dues deductions for the state unions. To obtain legal status,
 an independent union must apply for registration with the local judicial authority
 at the oblast level and with the Ministry of Justice. Registration is generally
 lengthy, difficult, and expensive. The decision to register a union appears to be arbi-
 trary, with no published criteria. Judicial authorities and the Ministry of Justice
 have the authority to cancel a union's registration.
 Workers who have joined independent trade unions are subjected to various forms
 of harassment, including dismissal, transfer to lower paying or lower status jobs,
 threats, and intimidation. State unions often take an active part in the harassment
 to inhibit challenges to their hegemony and to pressure new unions.
 The independent unions have suffered because national laws are not enforced at
 local levels. For example, in Tekele, after nearly 2 years of court battles, the Tekele
 mine construction administration is still automatically withholding dues for the
 state-sponsored union from members of the Independent Miners' Union of Tekele.
 The Independent Trade Union Center of Kazakhstan claims membership of about
 500,000 out of a total work force of about 5,600,000.
 Unions have the legal right to strike, and several took place during 1994.
 Many enterprises in 1994 continued to pay part or all wages in scrip rather than
 in cash, a practice at odds with Article 3 of NL Convention 95 on the protection
 of wages, which prohibits payment of wages other than in the legal currency with-
 out the express consent of the workers. Enterprise directors claimed that the enter-
 prises were not being paid in cash by their traditional trading partners in other
 parts of the former Soviet Union, which were also experiencing cash flow difficulties
 as a result of the general economic crisis. The scrip was often not accepted at stores
 or was accepted only at devalued levels.
 By law, unions may freely join federations or confederations and affiliate with
 international bodies. Most independent trade unions in Kazakhstan belong to the
 Independent Trade Union Center (ITUC) headquartered in Almaty. The Independ-
 ent Miners' Federation of Kazakhstan, along with the State Miners' Union of
 Karaganda, are members of the Miners' International Federation. The unions be-
 longing to the ITUC are not members of international federations but do maintain
 contacts with European and US. trade union federations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are significant limits
 on the right to organize and bargain collectively. Most industry remained state
 owned in 1994 and was subject to the state's production orders. Although collective
 bargaining rights are not spelled out in the law, in some instances unions success-
 fully negotiated agreements with management. If a union's demands are not accept-
 able to management, it may present those demands to an arbitration commission
 comprised of management, umon officials, and independent technical experts. There
 is no legal protection against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones. Several free economic zones enjoy all the
 privileges of export processing zones, as well as other tax privileges and abatements,
 but labor conditions there appear to be no different than elsewhere in Kazakhstan.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor. In
 some places, however, compulsory labor is used. Some persons were required to pro-
 
 
 vide labor or the use of privately owned equipment with no, or very low, compensa-
 tion to help gather the annual grain harvest.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 16. A child under age 16 may work only with the permission of the local adminis-
 tration and the trade union in the enterprise in which the child would work. Such
 permission is rarely granted. Abuse of child labor is generally not a problem, except
 that child labor was reportedly used, especially during the cotton harvest in the
 south.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The official minimum wage, set by the Su-
 preme Soviet, is about $3.70 (200 tenge) per month, far from sufficient for a worker
 and family to live on. Rampant inflation made fixing and enforcing a minimum
 wage unrealistic.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours, although most enterprises maintain
 a 40-hour workweek, with at least a 24-hour rest period.
 Working and safety conditions in the industrial sector are substandard. Safety
 consciousness is low. Workers in factories usually do not wear protective clothing,
 such as goggles and hard hats, and work in conditions of poor visibility and ventila-
 tion. Management largely ignores regulations concerning occupational health and
 safety, enforceable by the Ministry of Labor and the state-sponsored unions. Lack
 of management concern and economic dislocation have resulted in shortages of safe-
 ty equipment. Workers, including miners, have no legal right to remove themselves
 from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
