 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a federation of 13 states with a parliamentary system of government
 based on periodic multiparty elections in which the ruling National Front coalition
 has held power since 1957. Opposition parties actively contest elections, but face ob-
 stacles in competing with the long-entrenched ruling coalition. Opposition and inde-
 pendent members hold roughly 12 percent of the seats in the Federal Parliament.
 An opposition party controls one state government. The Constitution provides for an
 independent judiciary; however, government action, constitutional amendments, and
 legislation have undermined judicial independence and increased executive influ-
 ence. The impartiality of the judiciary continued to deteriorate.
 The Royal Malaysian Police have primary responsibility for internal security mat-
 ters. The police report to and are under the effective control of the Minister of Home
 Affairs. At year's end, the Prime Minister held the Home Affairs portfolio. Some
 members of the police committed serious human rights abuses.
 Malaysia is an advanced developing country. Although the economy is largely
 market-based, the Government takes an active role in economic development and
 industrialization, and maintains price controls on certain basic commodities. Manu-
 facturing accounts for 44.2 percent, services 44.8 percent, and agriculture 11 percent
 of gross domestic product (GDP). Principal manufactured products include semi-
 conductors, consumer electronics, electrical products, textiles, and apparel. Palm oil
 exports and production of natural rubber, cocoa, and tropical timber also are signifi-
 cant. Per capita GDP in 1997 was approximately $4,431. Anticipating increasing un-
 employment as a result of the economic downturn, the Government has indicated
 that it plans to repatriate or redeploy an estimated 2 million foreign unskilled work-
 ers-one-quarter of the labor force.
 The Government's previous record of respect for the human rights of its citizens
 worsened in a number of areas. In a late March mass deportation of Indonesian ille-
 gal alien detainees, police used excessive force, resulting in a number of deaths and
 injuries. Some detainees injured in the deportation did not receive medical care. Po-
 lice killed roughly 80 suspects in the course of apprehension, some under question-
 able circumstances. Police on occasion tortured, beat, and otherwise abused sus-
 pects, detainees, and ordinary citizens. Poor conditions of detention posed a serious
 threat to the life and health of illegal alien detainees. Police continued to arrest and
 detain many persons without trial, including former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
 Ibrahim and a number of his allies. (Anwar subsequently was charged and is on
 trial; his associates were released.) Police beat Anwar while he was in detention.
 Prolonged pretrial detention is a problem. A prominent opposition party leader was
 imprisoned on questionable sedition and publications charges. The judiciary refused
 to stay a libel sult against a United Nations special rapporteur, despite the U.N.'s
 assertion of the rapporteur's immunity and referral of the matter to the Inter-
 national Court of Justice. The trial of a prominent human rights activist on charges
 arising from her criticisms of conditions in alien detention camps continued. A West-
 ern journalist continued to appeal a 1997 conviction for contempt of court stemming
 from an article that raised questions of possible judicial favoritism. These cases and
 other factors led to serious doubts over the independence and impartiality of the ju-
 diciary. Authorities infringed on citizens' privacy rights. Harsh government state-
 ments about critics and-police threats of possible detention or investigation stifled
 freedom of expression. Government pressure and intimidation led to a high degree
 of press self-censorship. The editors in chief of two of the country's leading dailies
 and a television operations director were removed, apparently because of govern-
 ment pressure. The Government attacked the foreign press for its allegedly biased
 reporting on Malaysia. A government crackdown on opposition meetings and on
 demonstrations at which citizens called for political reform restricted freedom of as-
 sembly. The Government continued to restrict freedom of association. Religious free-
 dom is subject to some restrictions, in particular the right of Muslims to practice
 beliefs other than Sunni Islam. The right of Muslims to change their religion faced
 many practical obstacles. The Government continued to impose long-term restric-
 tions on movement without due process hearings. Government restrictions prevent
 opposition parties from competing effectively with the ruling coalition. Nongovern-
 mental organizations (NGO's) came under increasing criticism from senior govern-
 ment officials, who ascribed seditious or treasonous motives to NGO critics. The
 Government also amended legislation in order to facilitate the disbandment of
 NGO's. Societal discrimination and violence against women, and sexual abuse of
 children remain problems. Malaysia is a source, destination, and transit country for
 the trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation. Longstanding policies give
 preferential status to the ethnic Malays and other indigenous people in business,
 
 
 education, and other areas. Some discrimination against indigenous people and eth-
 nic minorities, and some restrictions on worker rights persisted. Child labor per-
 sists, although the Government has taken vigorous action against it.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. However, police committed a number of extrajudicial killings.
 On March 26, riot police conducted a mass deportation of Indonesian illegal alien
 detainees (see Section 2.d.). At the Semenyih detention camp, detainees from the In-
 donesian province of Aceh violently resisted deportation and killed a police officer
 in the ensuing struggle. After the death of the police officer, police responded with
 force and killed an unknown number of detainees (Police stated that 8 detainees
 died, while NGO's and the Western press reported that the number of dead was at
 least 24). A leaked police photograph that appeared in the Western press showed
 that some of the dead persons were handcuffed. It is not known when the handcuffs
 were placed on these persons. Press reports from Indonesia indicated that a large
 number of Acehnese injured during the rioting in Malaysian detention camps, in-
 cluding some with gunshot wounds or injuries from severe beatings, did not receive
 medical care before their deportation. Police have denied any misconduct and are
 not investigating officers' actions during the riot. (The police did investigate the leak
 to the Western press of the photograph showing handcuffed victims, and prosecuted
 the police photographer responsible.) After the violence, the Deputy Home Affairs
 Minister stated that security personnel would no longer treat illegal aliens "softly."
 The press reported that police killed approximately 80 alleged criminals in the
 course of apprehension during the year. Some of these killings appeared to be justi-
 fied; but others were hard to explain based on public reports. For example, on Janu-
 ary 28, police shot and killed a group of seven suspects (with none wounded) in two
 cars who allegedly were planning to rob a supermarket. On March 21, police shot
 and killed three suspected kidnapers (with none wounded) in a car while the victim,
 in the same car, was unharmed (a fourth suspect was shot and killed separately).
 Relatives of one of the alleged kidnapers claimed that the deceased had been an ac-
 quaintance of the victim and that police had shot the wrong man. On October 3,
 police killed five alleged kidnapers in a house, including a woman who was 8
 months pregnant. On October 4, police shot and killed six men in a van who alleg-
 edly were involved in the smuggling of drugs and firearms. The leader of the eth-
 nically Indian political party called on the police to conduct a thorough inquiry into
 the last two shootings and questioned whether suspects had been given a chance
 to surrender or explain. In the March kidnaping case, police investigated and found
 no misconduct. None of the other cases are known to be under investigation.
 After approximately 40 police lethal shootings from January to March, the presi-
 dent of a prominent Malaysian human rights organization in an April press article
 questioned whether police had become too "trigger-happy" and were acting as
 "judge, jury, and executioner." He called for the establishment of a mechanism to
 review each use of lethal force by police. The Prime Minister called the charge of
 police being trigger-happy "grossly unfair," and the Inspector General of Police stat-
 ed that the human rights group was trying "to protect criminals." Subsequently, a
 police official said that if criticism by an NGO "causes people to lose confidence in
 the police or question the law," police would investigate the NGO under the Soci-
 eties Act (see Section 2.b.). Following the April article, lethal police shootings sharp-
 ly decreased for several months. Later in the year, after the controversy surround-
 ing the lethal shootings of a total of 11 suspects on October 3-4, the number of inci-
 dents again dropped steeply. The police have not accepted the suggestion to estab-
 lish a mechanism to review the use of lethal force.
 There were numerous allegations that inhuman conditions of detention caused the
 deaths of illegal aliens (see Section 1.c.).
 In July four soldiers who beat to death an illegal alien during a June 1997 raid
 were acquitted of charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The Prime
 Minister said in August, that several officers of the police field force would be dis-
 ciplined for their conduct during a conflict in Bakong, Sarawak that led to an Iban
 village chief being shot and killed in December 1997. The police have not announced
 what disciplinary actions were taken.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 No constitutional provision or law specifically prohibits torture, although laws that
 prohibit "committing grievous hur' encompass torture; however, some police tor-
 
 
 988
 tured and abused persons, and reports of instances of abuse were worse than in pre-
 vious years.
 Police continued to abuse detainees. There were instances in which police officers
 subjected criminal suspects and illegal alien detainees to physical and psychological
 torture during interrogation and detention. During the trial of former Deputy Prime
 Minister Anwar Ibrahim, senior police officers testified that police had institutional-
 ized techniques to subject some detainees to coercive and abusive treatment. A sen-
 ior officer said that police simply did not consider whether such tactics were legal.
 In some cases authorities have investigated police officials for such abuses; however,
 because the Government does not release information on the results of the inves-
 tigations routinely, whether those responsible for abuses are punished is not always
 known.
 When former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was arraigned on criminal
 charges following 9 days of Internal Security Act (ISA) detention (see Section 1.d.)
 without access to family or attorneys, he stated that police had beaten him into un-
 consciousness during his first day of detention. Eyewitnesses reported that Anwar's
 face, arms,. and neck were bruised badly. Anwar stated that after the beating he
 had suffered unclear vision and faulty balance. Police investigated Anwar's claims
 and submitted a report to the Attorney General in November. The Attorney General
 later acknowledged that police caused some of Anwar's injuries, but did not identify
 those responsible.
 Other figures associated with Anwar's case also alleged police mistreatment. Dur-
 ing Anwas trial, the two authors of a poison pen letter against Anwar alleged that
 police had used coercive and abusive tactics agalnst them to force retractions of the
 letters allegations. (Police admitted to these charges, but no officers were charged
 for misconduct.) Two men convited of "gross indecency" for allegedly having been
 sodomized by Anwar, later recanted their confessions, and gave largely consistent
 descriptions of physical and psychological torture at the hands of police. In Novem-
 ber a lawyer for a business associate of Anwar alieged that prosecutors threatened
 his client with a death sentence on firearms charges unless he agreed to fabricate
 evidence against Anwar. Following this the Attorney General instructed prosecutors
 that all future plea bargain negotiations should be recorded in writing. The busi-
 nessman's trial on firearms charges that carry a mandatory death sentence was still
 pending at year's end. There were other credible reports of torture and abuse as
 well.
 In late September, police cracked down on demonstrations in support of political
 reform, breaking up many such gatherings and making many hundreds of arrests.
 Riot police often forcibly dispersed peaceful demonstrators, using truncheons, water
 cannon, and tear gas (see Section 2.b.).
 From January to April there were regular press reports of police brutality. After
 April press reports of such incidents dwindled to just a handful for the entire rest
 of the year. The press reports described beatings of those in custody, of those being
 arrested, and of ordinary citizens who for some reason angered police officers.
 NGO's also reported alleged incidents of police brutality. In March a police officer
 was charged for causing grievous hurt to a man in a private dispute. At year's end,
 this case was still pending. Also in March three policemen were charged with raping
 a woman whom they had lured to their quarters. The case against the policemen
 was given a discharge not- amounting to acquittal when the court learned that the
 woman had returned to Indonesia and was unable to testify. In August five police
 officers were charged with assaulting two men in a bar. The case was still pending
 at year's end.
 Criminal law prescribes caning as an additional punishment to imprisonment for
 those convicted of some nonviolent crimes such as narcotics possession, criminal
 breach of trust, and alien smuggling. Judges routinely include caning in sentences
 of those convicted of such crimes as kidnaping, rape, and robbery. The caning, which
 is carried out with a  2-inch-thick wooden cane, commonly causes welts, and some-
 times causes scarring. In theory even children can be caned. For example, in July
 a 15-year-old boy was sentenced to 10 strokes of the cane for a drug offense. The
 sentence was commuted.
 Prison -conditions generally meet minimum international standards. Prisons meet
 basic human needs, including medical care, sanitation, nutrition, and family access.
 Overcrowding is an increasingly serious problem. In May the prisons director-gen-
 eral urged courts to expedite processing to help ease overcrowding. At that time the
 director-general stated that prisons were holding 26,548 prisoners, while planned
 capacity was only 20,000. "Security" prisoners (see Section 1.d.) are detained in a
 separate detention center.
 Prison guards have been accused and convicted of criminal wrongdoing, mostly in
 nonviolent narcotics cases. In September the family of Lim Guan Eng, an opposition
 
 
 989
 leader convicted of sedition (see Section 2.a.), alleged that Lim was forced to sleep
 on a damp concrete floor, had no clean water to drink, had no opportunity to exer-
 cise, and did not have adequate reading materials. Lir's family also alleged that
 a bright light shone in Lim's cell at all times. The prisons director-general denied
 some of the allegations, confirmed others, and stated that Lim was being treated
 the same as any other prisoner in accordance with minimum U.N. guidelines, as
 well as with Malaysian prison regulations, which date from the colonial era.
 The Government holds many illegal aliens under inhuman conditions. Access to
 illegal alien camps is restricted and details are hard to prove. However, the volume
 and consistency of allegations of inadequate food, poor medical care, poor sanitation,
 and abuse by guards make credible the charge that detention conditions pose a seri-
 ous threat to life and health. There were numerous allegations that such inhuman
 conditions caused the deaths of an unknown number of illegal aliens.
 The Government has an agreement with the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) providing for visits to certain categories of prisoners and has not posed
 any objection to such visits. However, the ICRC has not visited for several years.
 Other NGO's and the media generally are not allowed to monitor prison conditions.
 Access to illegal alien detention camps is restricted and the Government in some
 cases even prevents representatives of foreign embassies from visiting their nation-
 als in the camps.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Suspects of some crimes (called "seizable
 offenses") may be arrested without warrants; suspects of other crimes ("nonseizable
 offenses") may be arrested only on the basis of a warrant from a magistrate. Sus-
 pects of some crimes ("bailable offenses") may present bail at the police station ac-
 cording to a schedule. Bail is not available for other crimes ("nonbailable offenses")
 and is sometimes also denied in other circumstances (e.g., great risk of flight). Police
 may hold suspects for 24 hours without charge. Police may request a magistrate to
 extend the period of remand without charge for 1 week and may then request a sec-
 ond extension of 1 week. After this second extension police must charge the suspect
 and seek an order of detention from a magistrate. While in remand, suspects have
 access to legal counsel, though not always to family visits. In general, police practice
 is in accord with these legal provisions.
 Crowded, understaffed courts and the legal safeguards and appeals available to
 the accused often result in lengthy pretrial detention, sometimes lasting several
 years. On May 31, the prisons director-general said that roughly half of the prison
 population were prisoners who had not yet been sentenced. The great majority of
 these prisoners either have been convicted and are awaiting sentence or are in the
 midst of their trials. Detainees awaiting trial constitute much less than half of all
 detainees.
 Three laws permit the Government to detain suspects without judicial review or
 the filing of formal charges: The 1960 Internal Security Act (ISA), the Emergency
 (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance of 1969, and the Dangerous
 Drugs Act (Special Preventive Measures) of 1985. The Government continued to use
 long-term detention without trial in cases alleged to involve national security as
 well as in narcotics trafficking and other cases. According to the Home Affairs Min-
 istry, on November 30, a total of 223 persons were being detained under the ISA.
 Subsequently, another person was arrested under the ISA after being freed from re-
 mand on charges of illegal assembly. From January through October, police de-
 tained a total of nearly 1,500 persons under the Dangerous Drugs Act (Special Pre-
 ventive Measures). It is not known how many of these still were detained at year's
 end. The Government has not disclosed how many persons are detained under the
 Emergency Ordinance.
 Enacted more than 30 years ago when there was an active Communist insur-
 gency, the ISA empowers the police to hold for up to 60 days any person who may
 act "in a manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia." The Minister of Home Af-
 fairs may authorize further detention for periods of up to 2 years. Those released
 before the end of their detention period are subject to "imposed restricted condi-
 tions" for the balance of their detention periods. These conditions limit their rights
 to freedom of speech, association, and travel outside the country.
 According to the Government, the goal of the ISA is to control internal subversion.
 On November 30, the Deputy Home Affairs Minister said that in the previous 10
 years no person had been detained under the ISA for political reasons (other than
 Communist activity) beyond the initial 60-day period. He said that of the 867 per-
 sons detained for more than 60 days, 359 were involved in Communist activities,
 447 falsified documents or otherwise abetted illegal alien smuggling, 21 were "reli-
 gious extremists," 9 "leaked intelligence secrets," and 1 was associated with the Free
 Aceh Movement. He further stated that of the 223 persons still detained, 131 were
 
 
 for document forgery, 89 for illegal alien smuggling, 2 for deviant Islamic teaching,
 and 1 for activities associated with the Free Aceh Movement.
 As these figures indicate, the ISA is often used against nonpolitical crimes. In the
 first half of the year, the Government depended heavily on the ISA in its campaign
 against illegal alien smuggling. The Government also frequently uses the ISA
 against Muslim sects that it considers "deviant." The ISA, and the threat of the ISA,
 are also used to intimidate and restrict political dissent. For example, the police de-
 tained former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and 27 of his followers under
 the ISA in the latter months of the year, after a series of largely peaceful
 antigovernment demonstrations. The Government claimed that the demonstrations
 threatened national security. NGO's, opposition parties, and the Malaysian Bar
 Council criticized the detentions. By year's end, Anwar and the other 27 either had
 been released or released and then again detained under regular criminal charges.
 In late September, police broke up many demonstrations in support of political re-
 form and arrested many hundreds of persons (see Section 2.b.).
 Security authorities sometimes wait several days after detention before informing
 an ISA detainee's family. Even when there are no formal charges, the authorities
 must inform detainees of the accusations against them and permit them to appeal
 to an advisory board for review every 6 months. However, advisory board decisions
 and recommendations are not binding on the Home Affairs Minister, are not public,
 and often are not shown to the detainee. In the past, some ISA detainees have re-
 fused to participate in the review process under these circumstances.
 Amendments to the ISA in 1997 sharply circumscribed judicial review of ISA de-
 tentions. Although the Malaysian Bar Council has asserted that detentions under
 the ISA are subject to judicial review on both procedural and substantive grounds,
 the courts have not concurred with this interpretation, and review ISA detentions
 only on technical grounds. Detainees freed on technical grounds nearly always are
 detained again immediately.
 Opposition leaders and human rights organizations continued to call on the Gov-
 ernment to repeal the ISA and other legislation that deprive persons of the right
 to defend themselves in court.
 Under the 1969 Emergency Ordinance, which was instituted after intercommunal
 riots in that year, the Home Affairs Minister can issue a detention order for up to
 2 years against a person if he deems it necessary to protect public order or for the
 "suppression of violence or the prevention of crimes involving violence." In fact the
 Government has used the Emergency Ordinance for other reasons. For example, in
 January eight police officers were detained under the Emergency Ordinance for
 criminal activities. In May police detained under the Emergency Ordinance a man
 being investigated for murder after a court ordered the man released because of in-
 sufficient evidence. The Government has not disclosed the total number of people
 detained under this law.
 Provisions of the 1985 Dangerous Drugs Act (Special Preventive Measures) give
 the Government specific power to detain without trial suspected drug traffickers.
 The suspects may be held for up to 39 days before the Home Affairs Minister must
 issue a detention order. Once the Ministry has issued an order, the detainee is enti-
 tled to a hearing before a court. In some instances, the judge may order the detain-
 ee's release. Suspects may be held without charge for successive 2-year intervals,
 with periodic review by an advisory board, whose opinion is binding on the Home
 Affairs Minister. However, the review process contains none of the due process
 rights that a defendant would have in a court proceeding. The police frequently de-
 tain suspected narcotics traffickers under the special preventive measures after the
 traffickers are acquitted in court on formal charges--often as they leave the court-
 room. From January through October, the Government detained nearly 1,500 per-
 sons under this law. It is not known how many remained detained at year's end.
 Immigration laws are used to detain possible illegal aliens without trial or hear-
 ing. The detainees are not accorded any administrative or legal hearings and are
 released only after their employers prove their legal status. Those who can produce
 legal documents normally are released immediately; those who cannot prove their
 legal status often are held for extended periods before deportation. In May the Im-
 migration Department warned all citizens to carry their identity cards or risk deten-
 tion as possible illegal aliens. Illegal aliens are kept in detention centers that are
 separate from prisons (see Section 1.c.).
 Law enforcement authorities also used the Restricted Residence Act to restrict
 movements of criminal suspects for an extended period. The act allows the Home
 Affairs Ministry to place criminal suspects under restricted residence in a remote
 district away from home for 2 years. The Ministry is authorized to issue the "ban-
 ishment" orders without any judicial or administrative hearings. Human rights ac-
 tivists have questioned the need for this law, which was passed more than 60 years
 
 
 991
 ago under very different circumstances, and have called for its repeal. The Govern-
 ment has continued to justify the act as a necessary tool and has used it primarily
 against vice and gambling offenses. For example, in March police stated that 37 per-
 sons had been banished since the beginning of 1997 under the act for illegal gam-
 bling. The Government has not disclosed how many persons are subject to the Re-
 stricted Residence Act, and no accurate estimate was available.
 In September 1997, the Malaysian Bar Council expressed its concern about 44
 prisoners held "at the pleasure of the Sovereign" for inordinate periods, often well
 exceeding the maximum sentences for their original crimes. In one case a prisoner
 had been held for 37 years. Most of these "forgotten prisoners" committed their
 crimes as minors or while of unsound mind. In April the Attorney General stated
 that the Government had expedited hearings on the cases. The results of these hear-
 ings, if any, are unknown.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Over the past decade, government action, constitu-
 tional amendments, and legislation restricting judicial review have undermined ju-
 dicial independence and strengthened executive influence over the judiciary. A num-
 ber of high-profle cases continued to cast doubts on judicial impartiality and inde-
 pendence, and to raise questions of arbitrary verdicts and selective prosecution.
 embers of the bar and other observers continued to express serious concern about
 these problems. In addition, the continuing deterioration of judicial independence
 has led to concern about the overall fairness of the judiciary. For example, in an
 April statement, a prominent Malaysian economics professor stated that, "it is now
 well known that not only foreign firms, but even Maasian companies, now insist
 on clauses in contracts providing for arbitration owing to the general decline in con-
 fidence in the judiciary.
 In August the Attorney General publicly cautioned judges to adhere to their code
 of conduct. He advised judges to avoid acts that could result in a conflict of interest,
 including hearing cases in which some of the participating lawyers are relatives,
 hearing cases from a firm that bears the judge's name, receiving free golf club mem-
 berships, and being involved in gambling. Some legal observers questioned the pro-
 priety of the Attorney General making such comments. The Chief Justice later en-
 dorsed the comment s s proper.
 In cases widely thought to be politically motivated, several large companies,
 prominent businessmen, and one prominent lawyer brought suits for libel and slan-
 der against the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Law-
 yersDatuk Param Curamaswamy, who is a Malaysian citizen, and against the Ma-
 laysian Bar Council's former secretary general Tommy Thomas. The charges
 stemmed from an article that alleged improprieties in the judiciary. The courts re-
 jected Param's request to have the suit dismissed before trial based on his claim
 of immunity as a U.N. Special Rapporteur, a claim supported by U.N. Secretary
 General Kofi Annan. In Augst the Government agreed to abide by a U.N. Economic
 and Social Council decistion te  th  a  t   e    e   t  al Court of Justice
 (ICJ) for an advisory opinion on Param's claim to immunity. However, the Court of
 Appeal defied this decision and refused to stay the case. The U.N. expressed alarm
 over the Court's decision. The ICJ heard Param's case in December, but has not yet
 made a ruling. The case against Tommy Thomas, who had no claim to immunity,
 was settled out of court in November. After Thomas told reporters that the settle-
 ment, which included a large cash payment and a humiliating apology, bad been
 forced on him by insurers, he was charged with contempt of court. In December
 Thomas was sentenced to 6 month's imprisonment, which was stayed pending ap-
 peal.
 The cases against Lir Guan Eng, Irene Fernandez, and Murray Hiebert (see Sec-
 tion 2.a.) also raised questions about judicial independence and impartiality.
 High courts have original jurisdiction over all criminal cases involving serious
 crimes and most civil cases. Civil suits involving automobile accidents and landiord-
 tenant disputes are heard by sessions courts. Magistrate's courts hear criminal
 cases in which the maximum term of sentence do not exceed 12 months. Juvenile
 courts try offenders under age 18. The Special Court tries cases against the King
 and the sultans. The Court of Appeal has appellate jurisdiction over high court and
 sessions court decisions. The Federal Court hears appeals of court of appeal deci-
 sions.
 The legal system is based on English common law. Islamic religious laws adminis-
 tered by state authorities through Islamic courts bind ethnic Maays and other Mus-
 lims in some civil matters. In 1997 the Government announced that it would har-
 monize Islamic law at the federal leveln appoint an Islamic law federal attorney
 general. However, the Government has not been able to obtain the agreement of all
 the states, and the proposal had not been implemented by years end. Indigenous
 
 
 people in Sarawak and Sabah also have a system of customary law to resolve mat-
 ters such as land disputes between tribes. Penghulu (village head) courts may adju-
 dicate minor civil matters, but these are rarely used.
 Trials are public, although judges may order restrictions on press coverage. De-
 fendants have the right to counsel, bail is sometimes available, and strict rules of
 evidence apply in court. Witnesses are subject to cross-examination. The defense in
 both ordinary criminal cases and special security cases is not entitled to a statement
 of evidence before the trial. Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence and may
 appeal court decisions to higher courts. In criminal cases defendants also may ap-
 eal for clemency to the King or local state rulers as appropriate. A single judge
 hears each criminal trial. There are no jury trials.
 In May Parliament passed amendments to the Courts of Judicature Act (1964)
 that limited the rights of defendants to appeal in some circumstances. The Govern-
 ment stated that these amendments would expedite the hearing of cases in the
 upper courts. The president of the Malaysian Bar Association sadthat the amend-
 ments imposed too many restrictions on appeals.
 The Attorney General may restrict the right to a fair trial in criminal cases, by
 invoking the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975. These regulations gov-
 erning trial procedure normally a pply only in firearms cases. In cases tried under
 these regulations, the standards soraccepting self-incriminating statements by de-
 fendants as evidence are less stringent than in normal criminal cases. Also, the au-
 thorities may hold the accused or an unspecified time before making formal
 charges. The Attorney General has the authority to invoke these regulations in
 other criminal cases if the Government determines that the crime involves national
 security considerations, but such cases are rare. There were no reported cases in-
 volving this restriction in 1998.
 Even when the Essential Reation   are not invoked, defense lawyers lack some
 legal protections against interference. For example, in November police raided the
 ofice of a defense attorney of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and
 searched through legal documents. In response to a defense complaint, the judge re-
 sponded that the police have the right to conduct investigations and defense attor-
 neys should stop "was  titime" by complaining. In December, after Anwar's defense
 team played a tape purportedly describing a conspiracy agalinst Anwar, police picked
 up for questioning a businessman linked to the tape. The presiding judge stated
 that no law allowed him to bar such conduct by the police.
 Following a number of high-profie corruption cases, the Government amended the
 Anticorruption Act in July 1997. The new law, which came into effect on January
 1, impinges on the p resumption of innocence and requires accused persons to prove
 that they acquired their wealth legally.
 Under the Evidence Act, the testimony of children is accepted only if there is cor-
 roborating evidence. This poses special problems for molestation cases in which the
 child victim is the only witness. In April a high court judge recommended that the
 Evidence Act be amended to accept the evidence of children.
 Lim Guan Eng, imprisoned under the Prning Press and Publications Act and the
 Sedition Act, is a political prisoner (see Section 2.a.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for these rights; however, provisions in the security legislation (see Section
 1.d.) allow the police to enter and search without a warrant the homes of persons
 suspected of threatening national security. Police also may confiscate evidence
 under these acts. In some cases each year, police have used this legal authority to
 search homes and offices, seize books and papers, monitor conversations, and take
 pheople into custody without a warrant. For example, acting under the authority of
 te ISA, poice searched without warrants the houses of an alleged associate of
 former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar and of Anwar himself, seizing many docu-
 ments and other materials. The law permits the Home Affairs Ministry to place
 criminal suspects under restricted residence in a remote district away from home
 for a 2-year period (see Section 1.d.). Police threatened to use the Child Protection
 Act to take away children from their parents who brought them to opposition dem-
 onstrations (see Section 2.b.).
 The Government bans membership in unregistered political parties, such as the
 Communist Party, and affiliated organizations (see Section 2.b.).
 A clause in the 1997 Anticorruption Act empowers the Attorney General to au-
 thorize the interception of mail and the wiretapping of telephones. Such information
 would be admissible as evidence in a corruption trial. Certain religious issues pose
 significant obstacles to marriage between Muslims and adherents of other religions
 (see Section 2.c.).
 Singaporean newspapers and magazines may not circulate in Malaysia (see Sec-
 tion 2.a.); these publications are available on the Internet.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and the press, some important legal limitations exist, and over the years
 the Government increasingly has restricted freedom of expression and intimidated
 the print and electronic media into practicing self-censorship.
 The Constitution provides that freedom of speech may be restricted by legislation
 "in the interest of security (or) public order." For example, the Sedition Act prohibits
 public comment on issues defined as sensitive, such as citizenship rights for non-
 Malays, the special position of Malays in society, and certain aspects of religion. In
 practice, the Sedition Act and some other laws have been used to restrict political
 speech.
 The Government filed criminal charges under the Sedition Act and the Printing
 Presses and Publications Act against opposition youth leader Lim Guan Eng before
 the 1995 general election. The charges stemmed from Lim's public comments about
 a statutory rape case involving a former chief minister of Malacca. In 1997 Lim was
 convicted under both acts and fined $5,555 (15,000 ringgit). In April Lim's sentence
 was increased on appeal (as permitted under the law) to two concurrent 18-month
 prison sentences instead of a fine. In his April oral decision, Appeals Court Judge
 Gopa Sri Ram stated, "it is time that the court sends a clear message that it cannot
 tolerate any attack on the judiciary." Gopal's remark led many senior members of
 the bar to state publicly that criticism of judicial decisions is permissible under the
 law. In August Lir's final a ppeal was denied and he was imprisoned. Lim's family
 later alleged that Li was detained under inhumane conditions (see Section 1.c.).
 Unless he is pardoned, Li also has lost the right to run for political office for 5
 years from the date of his release from prisor. The Prime Minister's daughter, wom-
 en's activist Marina Mahathir, made similar remarks about the same statutory rape
 case, but no action was taken against her, raising a concern about selective prosecu-
 tion of a  in       leader. Atr Li Guan Eng's imprisonment, NGO's, including
 the Bar Council, called for revision of the Sedition Act.
 In September police filed a report (a prelude to possible criminal charges) under
 the Sedition Act against former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for an inter-
 view that was critical of the Government (see Section 1.d.). Police also interviewed
 Anwar's wife after she made critical remarks in an interview with the foreign press.
 However, no charges had been fied as of year's end.
 On December 11, the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights, police in Johore arrested four members of two opposition parties for distrib-
 uting pamphlets advocating political reform. The case was still pending at year's
 end.
 In 1998 the Government generally was more intolerant of dissent than at any
 other time in the past decade. The Prime Minister, the Inspector General of Police,
 the Minister of Information, and many other government officials made numerous
 harsh statements ascribing seditious or treasonous motives to critics of government
 policies. Although many persons still criticized the Government publicly, the in -
 creasing belligerence of official statements toward critics made many individuals
 more cautious in exercising their rights of free speech. Police detained four ersons
 under the ISA in August and September for "cyber rumor-mongering." Po ice ac-
 cused the detainees ofspreading false reports of rioting and potential violence
 against Chinese Malaysians via the Internet. The four later were charged under a
 section of the Penal Code that prohibits statements that cause fear or alarm. In
 September a Malaysian Internet service provider shut down a pro-Anwar web site,
 forcing the sponsors to move the site to an overseas service provider. Also in Sep-
 tember, a Malaysian Intrnet service provider announced that it had identified to
 police a person alleged to have "incited racial hatred."
 The domestic mass media provide generally laudatory, uncritical coverage of gov-
 ernment officials and policies, and usually give only limited and selective coverage
 topoitical views of the opposition or political rivals. Editorial opinion almost always
 reflects government positions on domestic and international issues.
 Chinese-language newspapers generally are freer in reporting and commenting on
 sensitive political and social issues, but are not immune to government pressure.
 For example, in July the Prime Minister publicly asked the Chinese-language press
 to cease criticism of Indonesia over the reported rapes of ethnic Chinese women dur-
 ing rioting in Jakarta. The Chiese-language press complied instantly.
 However, the English-, Malay-, and Chineselanguage press all reported on some
 sensitive issues. For example, the firing of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
 initially was well covered in the press. Local newspapers and television initially re-
 ported many of Anwar's statements, even the most critical. However, later develop-
 ments were covered selectively and in a manner generally (but not uniformly) sup-
 portive of the Government's views.
 
 
 994
 The Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984 contains important limitations
 on press freedom. Domestic and foreign publications must appiy annually to the
 Government for a permit. The act was amended in 1987 to make the publication
 of "malicious news" a punishable offense, expand the Government's power to ban or
 restrict publications, and prohibit court challenges to suspension or revocation of
 publication permits. Government power over license renewal and other policies cre-
 ate an atmosphere that inhibits independent or investigative journalism and results
 in extensive self-censorship. In September the Minister of Information stated that
 the media "do not have a responsibility to provide "news coverage to people outside
 the Government." The Government often conveys its displeasure with press report-
 ing directly to a newspaper's board of directors. In addition, leading political figures
 in the ruling coalition, or companies controlled by them, own most major news-
 papers and all radio and television stations, thus limiting the range of views. At
 times, the susceptibility of the press to government pressure has a direct and public
 impact on media operations. For example, in July the editors of two of the country's
 largest daily newspapers and a television operations director were removed, appar-
 ently because of government displeasure. The removals apparently stemmed from
 political rivalries within the ruling party.
 The Government continued to prosecute human rights activist Irene Fernandez
 under the Printing Presses and Publications Act for charges that she made in 1995
 of mistreatment at illegal alien detention centers. Final judgment is still pending.
 In past years, the Government has on a few occasions used the defamation clauses
 of the Penal Code to prosecute newspapers and reporters that publish criticism of
 government officials. During the year, police investigated a case of criminal defama-
 tion against the author of a book that allegedly slandered former Deputy Prime
 Minister Anwar.
 Publications of opposition parties, social action groups, unions, and other private
 groups actively cover opposition parties and frequently print views critical of govern-
 ment policies. The circulation of the Islamic opposition party newspaper increased
 to over 300,000 during the year, making the twice-weekly pa per's circulation as
 large as that of some mainstream newspapers. However, the Government retains
 significant influence over these publications by requiring annual renewal of publish-
 ing permits and limiting circulation only to members of the relevant organization.
 In the case of the Islamic opposition party journal, in October the Government sum-
 moned the publisher to warn him about open distribution of the newspaper. The
 Government also threatened "stern action" against vendors who sold the newspaper
 to nonparty members. However, there were no cases of the denial of renewal re-
 quests in 1998. During the year, the opposition Democratic Action Party resumed
 publication of its party journal, The Rocket.
 The Official Secrets Act potentially also can restrict freedom of the press. Pointing
 out the dangers of abuse, the Bar Council and other NGO's have called for a review
 of certain provisions that grant considerable discretion to the authorities.
 The foreign press has come under increasing government criticism for allegedly
 biased reporting. The Prime Minister in September accused the foreign press of
 "spreading lies" and stated that the foreign press wanted to see violence in Malay-
 sia. The police inspector general also made harsh attacks on the foreign press. On
 several occasions, the Information Minister made remarks aimed at pressuring Ma-
 laysian employees of foreign news organizations; he also threatened foreign cor-
 respondents who "broke the law" by working with improper accreditation. Local tele-
 vision stations refused on several occasions to transmit to satellite foreign press vid-
 eotapes of the demonstrations in support of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar.
 However, foreign journalists covering the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation eco-
 nomic leaders meeting in November were unhindered.
 In 1997 Far Eastern Economic Review correspondent Murray Hiebert was con-
 victed of contempt of court and sentenced to 3 months' imprisonment. Hiebert, who
 is still free pending appeal, had written an article that implied that the plaintiff
 in a civil suit had received preferential treatment in scheduling a trial date because
 she was the wife of a prominent judge. Hiebert is not free to leave Malaysia pending
 the result of his appeal. This case, the first in which a foreign correspondent has
 been sentenced to jail for contempt in the ordinary course of his duties, raises seri-
 ous questions of freedom of the press and of judicial impartiality.
 A government censorship board censors films for profanity, nudity, sex, violence,
 and certain political and religious content. Television stations censor programming
 in line with government guidelines. The Government bans certain books for political
 and religious reasons or because of sexual or profane content. Some foreign news-
 papers and magazines are banned (see Section 1.f.) and, infrequently, foreign maga-
 zines or newspapers are censored, most often for sexual content. However, the in-
 creased prevalence of the Internet is undermining such restriction. The Government
 
 
 maintains a "acklist" of local and foreign performers, politicians, and religious lead-
 ers who may not appear on broadcasts of Malaysian television or radio.
 The Government generally respects academic freedom in the areas of teaching and
 publication. Academics are sometimes publicly critical of the Government. However,
 there is a degree of self-censorship among public university academics whose career
 advancement and funding are prerogatives of the Government. Private institution
 academics also practice self-censorship due to fear that the Government may revoke
 licenses for their institutions. Legislation also imposes limitations on student asso-
 ciations and student and faculty activity (see Section 2.b.). Government officials reit-
 erated warnings against student political activity in September during disturbances
 connected with the ouster of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar.
 In 1997 the Government prohibited academics from making any public statements
 or publishing any writings on Malaysia's air pollution crisis. The Government ap-
 ears to have feared that unauthorized remarks on the air pollution crisis might
 arm the country's image and hurt tourism. Academics and others openly protested
 this order. The gag order remained in effect during the year, but the Government
 did not enforce it vigorously.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of freedom of peaceful assembly, but there are significant restrictions.
 These rights may be limited in the interest of security and public order, and the
 1967 Police Act requires police permits for all public assemblies except for workers
 on picket lines. In practice, the police use a restrictive policy in granting permits
 to government critics, but grant permits easily to government and ruling coalition
 supporters.
 In the past, the police generally had not required closed-door, indoor, opposition
 meetings to obtain ermits. In the summer, the police began to enforce the permit
 requirement on predominantly ethnic Chinese opposition party's meetings and broke
 up several meetings for lack of a permit, ofen arresting several persons. Police also
 prevented the holding of an NGO meeting on Kuala Lumpur's water crisis after the
 meeting's permit was revoked. A police official later advised the public not to turn
 to NGO's to resolve their water problem. Opposition and NGO applications for per-
 mits often went unanswered. Permits, when granted, often carried severely restric-
 tive conditions. This restrictive policy generally was not enforced on progovernment
 or proruling party gatherings.
 r his removal as deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim held several large lec-
 tures and rallies without a police permit. In a number of instances permits were
 requested but police either refused to grant them or did not respond to his requests.
 In September following a large gathering in Kuala Lumpur, police arrested Anwar
 under the ISA (see Section 1.d.). After Anwar's arrest, his supporters continued to
 hold demonstrations and gatherings in support of political reform. In late Septem-
 ber, police cracked down on these demonstrations and broke up many such gather-
 ings, resulting in many hundreds of arrests. Riot police often forcibly dispersed
 peaceful gatherings using truncheons, water cannon, and tear gas. Police also
 threatened to use the Child Protection Act to take away children from their parents
 who brought the children to opposition demonstrations. Police also served Anwar's
 wife with an order under the ISA forbidding her to hold public meetings. By the
 end of the year, the authorities largely had succeeded in preventing peaceful
 "proreform" assemblies from being held.
 Tian Chua, a leader for a new NGO coalition formed after the ouster and deten-
 tion of Anwar, was arrested in the Kuala Lumpur neighborhood of Kampung Baru,
 which had been the site of demonstrations earlier that day. Eyewitnesses said that
 Tian was arrested while talking to foreign journalists and diplomats several hours
 after the demonstrators had dispersed. After posting bail on charges of "illegal as-
 sembly," Tian was rearrested and also may face sedition charges.
 Since government critics have great difficulties obtaining timely police permits,
 police prosecution of "unlawful" assemblies effectively amounts to a prohibition on
 such meetings. However, police tolerated some opposition meetings that proceeded
 without police permits, and on rare occasions refused permits to progovernment
 groups.
 In April 1997, police detained 55 opposition party members who demonstrated in
 protest of an Israeli team's participation at an international cricket championship.
 The case against the demonstrators is still pending.
 Government and opposition candidates campaign actively. There are, however, re-
 strictions on freedom of assembly during campaigns. In the aftermath of the inter-
 communal riots in 1969, the Government banned political rallies. During the actual
 campaign period, political parties submit lists of times and places for proposed dis-
 cussion sessions. In past campaigns some opposition discussion group meetings have
 been canceled due to lack of a police permit, most recently during the 1996 Sarawak
 
 
 996
 state election campaign. These restrictions and the ban on political rallies handicap
 the opposition's ability to campaign effectively.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, but there are significant re-
 strictions. For example, certain statutes limit this right. Under the Societies Act of
 1966, only registered, approved organizations of seven or more persons may func-
 tion. The Government sometimes refuses to register organizations, or may impose
 conditions when allowing a society to register. For example, the Government pro-
 hibits the Communist Party and affiliated organizations (see Section 1.f.). The Gov-
 ernment also has not allowed Amnesty International to set up a branch in Malaysia.
 The Government also has the power to revoke the registration of an existing society
 for violations of the act, a power it has enforced selectively against political opposi-
 tion groups. This threat of possible deregistration inhibits political activism by pub-
 lic or special interest orgamzations.
 To avoid the burdensome requirements of the Societies Act, many NGO's register
 as companies under the Companies Act. Amendments to the Companies Act passed
 in April empowered the Registrar of Companies to refuse registration of a proposed
 company if he is satisfied that the company is likely to be used for any purpose prej-
 udicial to national security or-public interest. The Registrar also can cancel the reg-
 istration of an existing company and disband it on the same grounds. Opposition
 parties and NGO activists charged that the sweeping. owers granted to the Reg-
 istrar of Companies were designed to stifle criticism. The Government denied such
 charges and stated that financial irregularities were the amendments' main target.
 Government claims were undercut somewhat by later police statements that alluded
 threateningly to the status of certain NGO's under the Companies or Societies Acts.
 On November 28, the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs said that police were inves-
 tigating NGO's that had engaged in activities prejudicial to national security. The
 Deputy Minister stated that police were looking into the foreign links of such NGO's
 and repeated the legal registration requirements. NGO activists believe, that this in-
 vestigation is a prelude to an attempt to deregister several NGO's.
 In a separate initiative, the Ministry of National Unity and Social Development
 announced that it would examine the books of over 800 NGO's for financial irreg-
 ularities. It is unclear whether NGO's critical of the Government are being targeted
 specifically. The Ministry also investigated whether any NGO's that receive govern-
 ment grants had links with "bad" foreign NGO's.
 The various measures being taken against NGO's come in an increasingly hostile
 political climate. The Prime Minister on several occasions accused NGO's of working
 with foreigners to slander or undermine Malaysia. Other senior officials, including
 the Information Minister and the Human Resources Minister, echoed these charges.
 The Inspector General of Police stated in May that the police would not tolerate the
 "spreading of lies" by NGO's:,
 Another law that affects freedom of association is the Universities and University
 Colleges Act. This act mandates university approval for student associations and
 prohibits student associations, as well as faculty members, from engaging in politi-
 cal activity. In September six students were suspended for their role in the opposi-
 tion victory in a by-election. Police also warned in September that students must
 not engage in the "reform" movement led by former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar.
 Such restrictions are not enforced as vigorously on students who participate in pro-
 ruling coalition political activities. A university vice chancellor must approve cam-
 pus demonstrations. Human rights organizations assert that the act inhibits the
 free flow of ideas and exchange of views and have called for its repeal.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and re-
 ligious minorities, which include large Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian com-
 munities, generally worship freely, although with some restrictions. Islam is the of-
 ficial religion; however, the practice of Islamic beliefs other than Sunni Islam is re-
 stricted severely. Adherence to Islam is considered intrinsic to Malay ethnic iden-
 tity, and therefore Islamic religious laws administered by state authorities through
 Islamic courts bind all ethnic Malays in some matters. Government funds support
 an Islamic religious establishment, and it is official policy to "infuse Islamic values"
 into the administration of the country. However, the Government has not imposed
 Islamic religious law beyond the Muslim community.
 The Government generally respects non-Muslims' right of worship. However, state
 governments carefully control the building of non-Muslim places of worship and the
 allocation of land for non-Muslim cemeteries. Approvals for such permits sometimes
 are granted very slowly. After a violent conflict in Penang between Hindus and
 Muslims in March, the Government announced a review of unlicensed Hindu tem-
 ples and shrines. However, implementation does not appear to be vigorous.
 The right of a Muslim to leave -Islam to adhere to another faith is a very con-
 -troversial question, and in practice it is very difficult for a Muslim to change reli-
 
 
 gion. The case of a young Muslim woman who tried to leave Islam and adopt the
 religion of her Catholic fianc6 sparked a nationwide furor. The issue of Muslim
 "apostasy" became very controversial and proposals were floated inside and outside
 the Government for various punishments for "apostates." In August the Government
 stated that apostates would not face punishment as long as they did not defame
 Islam after their conversion.
 Proselytizing of Muslims by members of other religions is prohibited strictly,
 though proselytizing of non-Muslims faces no obstacles. For a long time, the Govern-
 ment has discouraged-and in practical terms forbidden-the circulation in penin-
 sular Malaysia of Malay-language translations of the Bible and distribution of
 Christian tapes and printed materials in Malay. However, Malay-language Chris-
 tian materials can be found. Some states have laws that prohibit the use of Malay-
 language religious terms by Christians, but the authorities do not enforce them ac-
 tively. Malay-lanuage Christian materials face few restrictions in east Malaysia.
 Visas for foreign Christian clergy are restricted severely.
 As part of its campaign to infuse Muslim values, in September the military for-
 bade the sale of alcohol on all military installations, including to non-Muslims.
 For Muslim children, religious education according to a government-approved cur-
 riculum is compulsory.
 The Government opposes what it considers deviant interpretations of Islam. In
 the past, the Government has imposed restrictions on certain Islamic sects. The
 Government continues to monitor the activities of the Shi'ite minority. In 1997 the
 Government proposed amending the Constitution to make Sunni Islam the country's
 official Islamic sect. This would make illegal the practice of other forms of Islam.
 This proposal still was being discussed but had not-yet been implemented by year's
 end.
 In November 1997, 10 persons, 2 of whom were over 75 years old, were detained
 under the ISA for spreading Shi'ite teachings. Two of the prisoners later were re-
 leased on a technicality, but were detained again (also under the ISA) just minutes
 after they left the courtroom. Two of these detainees remain under ISA detention
 (see Section 1.c.). In September the Government stated that it was monitoring the
 activities of 55 religious groups believed to be involved in "deviant" Islamic teach-
 ings.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens generally have the right to travel within the country and live
 and work where they please, but the Government restricts these rights in some cir-
 cumstances. The east Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak have the right to con-
 trol immigration into their territories and to require citizens from peninsular west
 Malaysia and foreigners to present passports or national identity cards for entry.
 In July the Court of Appeal ruled that Sabah and Sarawak, despite their autonomy,
 still are bound by the federal Constitution in all matters. Thus, the Court voided
 Sabah's expulsion of a west Malaysian attorney who had previously been involved
 in several lawsuits against the state government. The Sabah state government is
 appealing the ruling. The federal Government regulates the internal movement of
 provisionally released ISA detainees. The Government also uses the Restricted Resi-
 dence Act to limit movements of those suspected of some criminal activities (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.).
 The Goverrnent generally does not restrict emigration. As a belt-tightening
 measure in the wake of the country's sustained economic problems, the Government
 prohibited civil servants from taking tourism trips abroad without (rarely granted)
 permission. Other citizens generally were free to travel abroad, though in Septem-
 ber the Government, as part of a currency control scheme, limited the amount of
 ringgit that travelers could exchange for foreign currency.
 Citizens must apply for the Government's permission to travel to Israel. Travel
 to Jerusalem for religious purposes is allowed explicitly.
 Malaysia has not ratified the 1957 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Ref-
 ugee Convention and does not accept that the convention reflects customary inter-
 national law. In March the Government reversed a long-standing tacit policy of not
 deporting Acehnese back to Indonesia, and forcibly returned several hundred per-
 sons. Despite representations from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and the international community, and evidence that Acehnese might face
 persecution upon return to Indonesia, the Government refused to acknowledge that
 any Acehnese might have a claim to refugee status (see Section L.a.). International
 human rights organizations reported that three Acehnese refugees deported by Ma-
 laysia and suspected of separatist activity by the Indonesian Government were tor-
 tured as they were being transported back to Indonesia by Indonesian authorities.
 According to the reports, the three were chained to inner tubes and dragged across
 
 
 the Strait of Malacca behind the Indonesian vessel that was transporting them. One
 of the three reportedly died.
 The Government generally did not restrict the access of undetained potential asy-
 lum seekers to the UNHCR and cooperated in the resettlement of some refugees.
 However, the Government only infrequently granted the UNHCR and other humani-
 tarian organizations access to detained aliens. There were forced expulsions of asy-
 lum seekers and refugees among non-Indonesians as well, including Algerians,
 Iraqis, and Sri Lankans. The Government did not provide first asylum during 1998.
 Although the Government gave first asylum in past years to approximately 254,000
 Vietnamese the Government closed its last camp for Vietnamese refugees in 1996.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 By law citizens have the right to change their government through periodic elec-
 tions, which are procedurally free and fair, with votes recorded accurately. In prac-
 tice, however, it is difficult for opposition parties to compete on equal terms with
 the governing coalition (which has held power at the national level since 1957) be-
 cause of legal restrictions on campaigning, as well as severe restrictions on freedom
 of assembly, of association, and of the press. Nevertheless, opposition candidates
 campaign actively. Both voting and the counting of votes are relatively free and fair,
 though there are sometimes irregularities. The Government coalition controls 12 of
 13 state governments. An Islamic opposition party controls the northern state of
 Kelantan.
 The Constitution states that parliamentary constituencies should have roughly
 equal numbers of eligible voters, though the same section states that greater weight
 should be given to rural constituencies. In practice, these guidelines are often ig-
 nored. In Sabah, for example, constituencies are strongly weighted against the
 state's large Christian population. Nationwide, the constitutional provision giving
 greater weight to rural constituencies greatly dilutes the voting power of urban resi-
 dents. Finally, the single member, winner-take-all system diminishes the- political
 power of the minority ethnic Indians. Ethnic gerrymandering of parliamentary con-
 stituencies, used against the opposition in the past, may no longer be as effective.
 Students face certain restrictions on political activity (see Section 2.b.).
 Malaysia has a parliamentary system of government. National elections, required
 at least every 5 years, have been held regularly since independence in 1957. In the
 1995 general election the ruling coalition won 82 percent of the parliamentary seats.
 Several members of the opposition camp have joined the coalition since, increasing
 its representation in the Parliament to approximately 88 percent.
 The Malay-based United Malay National Organization (UMNO) party dominates
 the ruling National Front coalition. In the past, within UMNO there had been active
 political debate. In 1998 various attempts to enforce "no-contest" rules for leadership
 positions, organized and compulsory ritual public affirmations of leadership policies,
 and generally increased intolerance of dissent severely limited UMNO's role as a ve-
 hicle for public debate. After the removal of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar, intoler-
 ance of dissent within UMNO increased. In December an extraordinary UMNO as-
 sembly approved a series of measures designed to limit independent grassroots ini-
 -tiatives.
 The Parliament in 1995 amended its rules to strengthen the power of the Speaker
 and curb parliamentary procedures heavily used by the opposition. The amendments
 empowered the Speaker to ban unruly members for up to 10 days, imposed limits
 on deputies' ability to pose supplementary questions and revisit nongermane issues,
 and established restrictions on the tabling of questions of public importance. The
 amendments have restricted the opposition's ability to criticize the Government in
 Parliament. Further measures in 1997 and 1998 limited even more severely opposi-
 tion members' opportunities to question and debate government policies. Nonethe-
 less, government officials often face sharp questioning in Parliament, although this
 usually is not reported in detail in the press.
 After the 1969 intercommunal riots, the Government abolished elected local gov-
 ernment in favor of municipal committees and village chiefs appointed by state gov-
 ernments. Some politicians and NGO activists have advocated reintroduction of local
 government. Even some ruling party municipal officials have noted that local bodies
 are simply "rubber stamps" for the Government. Because of racial and political fac-
 tors (non-Malays are more concentrated in urban areas), the Government is not ex-
 pected to reintroduce elected local government soon.
 Women face no legal limits on participation in government and politics, but re-
 main underrepresented due to social and other factors. At year's end, 2 of 24 cabi-
 net-level ministers were women. Women hold 15 of 192 seats in the elected lower
 house of Parliament and 15 of 69 seats in the appointed upper house. Women also
 
 
 999
 hold some high-level judgeships. In March the Minister of National Unity and Social
 Development stated that the country would not achieve its goal of 30 percent female
 representation in the Government by 2005. The Minister stated that the current
 rate of participation (defined as the percentage of female representatives in Par-
 linment and in state assemblies) is 6 to 7 percent.
 Ethnic minorities are represented in cabinet-level positions in government, as well
 as in senior civil service positions. Nevertheless, the political dominance of the
 Malay majority means in practice that ethnic Malays hold the most powerful senior
 leadership positions. Non-Malays fill 9 of the 28 cabinet posts. An ethnic Chinese
 leader of a component party of the ruling coalition holds executive power in the
 state of Penang. In Sabah, the chief minister is an ethnic Kadazan also leader of
 a ruling coalition component party.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of NGO's, including the Bar Council and other public interest groups,
 devote considerable attention to human rights. The Government generally tolerates
 their activities but rarely responds to their inquiries or press statements. Several
 new human rights-oriented organizations were formed after the ouster and deten-
 tion of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Government officials harshly
 criticize local NGO's for collaborating with foreigners, including international
 human rights organizations. The tone of government criticism was more severe in
 1998, and government officials on several occasions warned that the organizations
 formed after Anwar's ouster were not registered and thus illegal. However, at year's
 end no group had been banned or decertified. In November-the leader of one of the
 new organizations, Tian Chua, was arrested for "unlawful assembly" (see Section
 2.b.). After posting bail, Tian immediately was rearrested (charges still have not
 been detailed). Tian posted bail again in December and at year's end he was still
 free. Public apathy and racial divisions (most human rights NGO's had been domi-
 nated by non-Malays) limited the effectiveness of NGO's in past years. However,
 during the year, public discontent over the removal of Deputy Prime Minister
 Anwar gave some impetus to NGO agendas, particularly among the Malay commu-
 nity.
 The Government amended the Companies Act to grant the Registrar of Compa-
 nies wide powers to block or disband organizations deemed prejudicial to national
 security or the national interest (see Section 2.b.).
 The Government generally does not allow international human rights organiza-
 tions to form branches; however, it generally does not restrict access by representa-
 tives of international human right organizations. For example, a foreign representa-
 tive of Amnesty International attended some sessions of the trial of Lim Guan Eng
 (see Section 2.a.). Several foreign human rights observers also attended sessions of
 the trial of former Deputy Prime Minster Anwar Ibrahim. The Government did not
 restrict the participation of the foreign NGO's in the "people's summit" which was
 held parallelto the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation economic leaders meeting in
 Kuala Lumpur in November.
 The Government has discussed appointing an official national human rights com-
 mission in accordance with its obligations in the Association of Southeast Asian Na-
 tions human rights working group. Thus far, however, no national commission has
 actually been formed.
 The U.N. Human Rights Commission strongly criticized the Government on sev-
 eral occasions over its refusal to grant immunity to U.N. Special Rapporteur Param
 Cumaraswamy (see Section I.e.).
 In December a delegation from the Interparliamentary Union investigating the
 imprisonment of Lim Guan Eng (see Section 2.a.) stated that it regretted the Gov-
 ernment's lack of cooperation. The delegation described the Government's conduct
 as very unusual and stated that it had not been granted appropriate appointments
 with government officials or permitted to visit privately with Lim Guan Eng. The
 Government made no public response.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal protection under the law and prohibits dis-
 crimination against citizens on the basis of religion, race, descent, or place of birth.
 Although neither the Constitution nor laws explicitly prohibit discrimination on the
 basis of sex or disabilities,'the Government has made efforts to eliminate discrimi-
 nation against women and promote greater public acceptance of the disabled. Gov-
 ernment policies give preferences to ethnic Malays in housing, home ownership, the
 awarding of government contracts, educational scholarships, and other areas.

 Women.-Reports of rape are common in the press and among women's rights
 groups and NGO's, although the Government has not released comprehensive statis-
 tics. The press reported in May that 94 Government hospitals had set up crisis cen-
 ters where victims of rape and domestic abuse could make reports without going to
 a police station. NGO's and political parties also cooperated in providing counseling
 for rape victims. Nonetheless, cultural attitudes and a perceived lack of sympathy
 from the largely male police force lead many victims not to report rapes.
 Spousal abuse is a serious problem that has drawn considerable government,
 NGO, and press attention. Awareness of the severity and prevalence of this problem
 is growing. Police in 1997 -(the last year for which -statistics have been published)
 investigated 5,730 cases of spousal abuse, made 800 arrests, and charged 693 sus-
 pects, of whom 495 were tried and 198 sentenced. The 1996 Domestic Violence Act
 was designed to address spousal abuse. However, women's groups criticized the im-
 plementation of the Domestic Violence Act as inadequate. Obtaining a restraining
 order against an abusive spouse is a lengthy and cumbersome procedure. Moreover,
 enforcement of the order is split between the police and the Welfare Department
 so that violations often go unpunished.
 Although the Government, NGO's, and political parties have formed shelters and
 offer other assistance for battered spouses, activists assert that support mechanisms
 remain inadequate. Police responses to complaints of domestic violence were more
 professional and sensitive than in previous years, but problems remain and cultural
 attitudes are still an impediment. For example, in late 1997-a (male) government
 deputy minister joked about spousal abuse in remarks to Parliament.  "
 The relation of the Domestic Violence Act to Shari'a (Islamic) law is still unclear.
 Domestic violence complaints are'rare in Shari'a courts (six cases in 1997). Some
 Shari'a law experts have urged women to be more aware of the provisions of Shari'a
 law that prohibit spousal abuse and provide for divorces on grounds of physical cru-
 elty. Nonetheless, Shari'a law generally (each state has a separate Shari'a code) pro-
 hibits wives from disobeying lawfal orders of their husbands. These provisions often
 present an obstacle to women pursuing claims, including charges of abuse, against
 their husbands.
 Spousal rape is not a crime in Malaysia, although presumably it might form one
 element of a charge of spousal abuse.
 An International Labor Organization (ILO) study estimated that roughly 40,000
 to 140,000 prostitutes work in Malaysia. The Government heatedly disputed this es-
 timate and the police stated that they would investigate NGO's that might have pro-
 vided information that formed the basis of the study. Sex tourism is not legal, and
 the level of such activity is not high.
 Malaysia is a source, transit, and destination country for trafficking in women for
 sexual exploitation. In May the Deputy Home Affairs Minister stated that 2,250 for-
 eign prostitutes had been arrested in Malaysia. Indonesian, Philippine, Thai, and
 Chinese women make up the bulk of foreign prostitutes. Malaysian women have
 been apprehended for prostitution in several foreign countries. The Deputy Home
 Affairs Minister stated in May that 4,200 Malaysian girls and young women were
 reported missing in 1997. Political parties and NGO's estimate that a significant
 portion of these women and girls were victims of traffickers.
 A few government officials may provide bogus documents illicitly to traffickers (al-
 though no specific cases were reported), but the Government investigates and pun-
 ishes such cases. The Government provides assistance to underage girls and has res-
 cued some kidnaped women. However, NGO's and women's activists complain that
 police have no coherent policy to protect victims of trafficking. Rather than pros-
 ecute traffickers, police generally arrest or deport individual women for prostitution.
 In June the press quoted an anonymous police official as saying that Malaysia had
 become a "safe haven" for traffickers. A police spokesman asked for official comment
 responded by questioning whether press reporting on trafficking of women was in
 the national interest.
 A Women's NGO stated in late October that the economic downturn was forcing
 more women into prostitution. The NGO cited government statistics showing an up-
 turn in the number of arrests for prostitution. A government source disputed this
 claim saying that the increase in arrests was due to more vigorous enforcement.
 Sexual harassment received some attention in the press and in the Government.
 The Minister of National Unity and Social Development announced in July that the
 Government would set up a panel of government, NGO, and educational representa-
 tives aimed at providing the basis for enactment of a law on sexual harassment.
 Several sexual harassment cases (filed under current laws providing for the protec-
 tion of women) were reported in the press, as was information advising women of
 their right not to be harassed. Until a sexual harassment law comes into effect, the
 legal basis for sexual harassment charges remains inadequate. In addition, there
 
 
 1001
 are still many cultural obstacles to women who try to pursue sexual harassment
 charges. The Ministry of Human Resources stated in August that it had received
 reports of only six sexual harassment cases in the first 6 months of the year (the
 most recent statistics available) and only a total of about 30 since 1996.
 Women are still victims of legal discrimination. The cultural and religious tradi-
 tions of the major ethnic groups also heavily influence the condition of women in
 society. In family and religious matters, Muslim women are subject to Islamic law.
 Polygyny is allowed and practiced to a limited degree, and inheritance law favors
 male offspring and relatives. The Islamic Family Law was revised in 1989 to provide
 better protection for the property rights of married Muslim women and to make
 more equitable a Muslim woman's right to divorce. The number of women obtaining
 divorces under the provisions of Islamic law that allow for divorce without the hus-
 band's consent, while small, is increasing steadily.
 Non-Muslim women are subject to civil law. Changes in the Civil Marriage and
 Divorce Act in the early 1980's increased protection of married women's rights, espe-
 cially those married under customary rites. Nonetheless, many statutes like the
 Guardiansbip of Infants Act and the Women and Girls Protection Act still provide
 for paternalistic or discriminatory treatment of women.
 Government policy supports women's rights and the Government has undertaken
 a number of initiatives to promote equality for women. Specifically, the Government
 promotes the full and equal participation of women in education and the work force.
 Women are represented in growing numbers in the professions, but women's groups
 argue that the level of participation is still disproportionately low. In the scientific
 and medical fields, women make up more than half of all university graduates and
 the total intake of women into universities increased from 29 percent in 1970 to one-
 half of the student population in recent years. The participation of women in the
 labor force increased from 37 percent in 1970 to almost one-half in 1997.
 Children.-The Government has demonstrated a commitment to children's rights
 and welfare; it spends roughly 20 percent of its budget on education. The Govern-
 ment provides free compulsory education for children through age 15. Actual attend-
 ance at primary school is nearly universal (99 percent). Secondary school attendance
 also is high (82 percent). A variety of programs provide low cost health care for most
 children. An office in the Ministry of National Unity and Social Development over-
 sees children's issues.
 In October the Government threatened to use the Children's Protection Act to
 take children away from parents who brought their children to opposition dem-
 onstrations (see Section 2.b.). However, as of year's end, no such action had been
 taken.
 Sexual exploitation of children and incest are problems. In 1997 police announced
 a special effort to prosecute the crime of incest, which is particularly a problem in
 rural areas. Child labor also exists. Child abuse receives wide coverage in the press.
 The Government prosecutes cases of child abuse and child molesters receive heavy
 jail sentences and caning. The Ministry of National Unity and Social Development
 reported that in 1997 there were 1,117 reported cases of child abuse, while from
 January through August there were 600 cases.
 Many Malay female children receive a tiny ritual cut to the clitoris. Almost all
 Malay women, including Muslim women's activists, do not believe that this con-
 stitutes mutilation or reduces a woman's future capacity for sexual pleasure.
 Statutory rape occurs. Prosecution of statutory rape is sometimes complicated by
 Shari'a law provisions that consider a Muslim girl an adult after she has had her
 first menstruation. Such a girl can be charged with "khalwat" ("close proximity"-
 the charge usually used to prosecute premarital or extramarital sexual relations)
 even if she is under 18 and the man is an adult. Moreover, Shari'a courts sometimes
 are more lenient with males who commit khalwat. Thus, Shari'a law sometimes
 punishes the victims of statutory rape. For example, in May the press reported that
 two girls were caught having sexual relations with an adult male. The male and
 the two girls were all charged with khalwat in Shari'a court. The underage girls re-
 ceived a sentence of 3 years in a correctional home, while the adult male was sen-
 tenced to a fine of $263 (1,000 ringgit). Women's groups criticized the decision. In
 another case in November, four boys and two girls were arrested for allegedly en-
 gaging in group sex. A judge set bail at approximately $132 (500 ringgit) for each
 of the boys and approximately $263 (1,000 ringgit) for each of the girls. No reason
 for the discrepancy in the amount of the bail was given.
 Child prostitution exists. However, child prostitutes often are treated as
 delinquents rather than victims. The Minister of National Unity and Social Develop-
 ment stated in September that 150 to 160 underage girls are detained "each year"
 for involvement in immoral activities and sent to rehabilitation centers. Authorities
 
 
 1002
 
 prosecute traffickers in child prostitution vigorously. Statistics for apprehension of
 traffickers are not available.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not discriminate against phys-
 ically disabled persons in employment, education, and provision of other state serv-
 ices. However, few public facilities are adapted to the needs of the disabled, and the
 Government has not mandated accessibility to transportation or public buildings for
 the disabled. Special education schools exist, but they are not sufficient to meet the
 needs of the disabled population. The Government and the general public are be-
 coming more sensitive to the needs of the physically disabled. The Government has
 taken many initiatives to promote public acceptance of the disabled, to make public
 facilities more accessible to disabled persons, and to increase budgetary allotments
 for programs aimed at aiding them. New commuter trains, for example, are wheel-
 chair accessible. The Government also provides incentives for employers to offer em-
 ployment opportunities to the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Indigenous groups and persons generally enjoy the same con-
 stitutional rights as the rest of the population. In practice, however, federal laws
 pertaining to indigenous people vest almost total power in the Minister of National
 Unity and Social Development to protect, control, and otherwise decide issues con-
 cerning them. As a result, indigenous people have very little ability to participate
 in decisions. Under the Aboriginal People's Act, indigenous people (known as Orang
 Asli) in peninsular Malaysia who had been granted land on a group basis had no
 right to own land on an individual basis or to receive titles to land. The Social De-
 velopment Ministry announced in March 1996 that state governments, which make
 decisions affecting land rights, had agreed to issue titles to Orang Asli. Amend-
 ments were drafted to enable Orang Asli to hold titles on an individual basis. Some
 Orang Asli welcomed this development while others expressed reservations, saying
 that individual land titles might divide and weaken Orang Asli-communities. Gov-
 ernment officials stated in 1998 that further amendments to the Aboriginal People's
 Act were unnecessary.
 The indigenous people in peninsular Malaysia, 'who number fewer than 100,000,
 are the poorest group in the country; however, according to government officials,
 Orang Asli gradually are catching up to other citizens in their standard of living,
 and the percentage of Orang Asli who still were leading a nomadic lifestyle has
 dropped to less than 40 percent. The Government has said that allowing Orang Asli
 to own land in peninsular Malaysia would enhance their economic standing.
 In east Malaysia, although state law recognizes the right of indigenous people to
 land under "native customary rights," the definition and extent of these lands are
 in dispute. Indigenous people in the state of Sarawak continued to protest the al-
 leged encroachment by state and private logging and plantation companies onto
 land that they consider theirs because of customary rights. Laws allowing con-
 demnation and purchase of land do not require more than perfunctory notifications
 in newspapers to which indigenous people may have no access. The net result is
 that many indigenous people are deprived of their traditional lands with little or
 no legal recourse. A large project (Bakun dam) in Sarawak that would involve reset-
 tlement of a large number of residents in the area has raised several controversial
 questions regarding land disputes as well as potential environmental problems.
 NGO's and opposition politicians have called on the Government to address these
 issues before proceeding with the project. Although economic conditions forced in-
 definite postponement of dam construction, resettlement continues.
 Religious Minorities.-In March Hindus and Muslims had a violent confrontation
 in a Penang village over the location of a Hindu temple near a mosque. Police quick-
 ly restored order and handled the issue evenhandedly. The Government has since
 devoted considerable effort to resolving the underlying dispute.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government implements extensive pref-
 erential programs designed to-boost the economic position of the Malay majority,
 which remains poorer .on average than the Chinese minority. Such preferential pro-
 grams and policies limit opportunities for non-Malays in higher education, govern-
 ment employment, business permits and licenses, and ownership of land. According
 to the Government, these programs have been instrumental in ensuring ethnic har-
 mony and political stability. Indian Malaysians continue to lag behind in the coun-
 try's economic development.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-By law most workers have the right to engage in
 trade union activity, and approximately 11 percent of the work force belongs to
 trade unions. Exceptions include certain limited categories of workers labeled "con-
 fidential" and "managerial and executive," as well as defense and police officials.
 Within certain limitations, unions may organize workplaces, bargain collectively
 
 
 1003
 
 with employers, and associate with national federations. Foreign workers are not al-
 lowed to join trade unions (see Section 6.e.).
 The Trade Unions Act prohibits interfering with, restraining, or coercing a worker
 in the exercise of the right to form trade unions or in participating in lawful trade
 union activities. However, the act restricts a union to representing workers in a
 "particular establishment, trade, occupation, or industry or within any similar
 trades, occupations, or industries," contrary to ILO guidelines. The director general
 of trade unions may refuse to register a trade union and, in some circumstances,
 may also withdraw the registration of a trade union. When registration has been
 refused, withdrawn, or canceled, a trade union is considered an unlawful associa-
 tion. The Government justifies its overall labor policies by positing that a "social
 compact" exists wherein the Government, employer, and worker are part of an over-
 all effort to create jobs, train workers, boost productivity and profitability, and ulti-
 mately provide the resources necessary to fund human resource development and
 a national social safety net. Trade unions from different industries may join in na-
 tional congresses, but must register as societies under the Societies Act (see Section
 2.b.).
 Government policy discourages the formation of national unions in the electronics
 sector; the Government believes that enterprise-level unions are more appropriate
 for this sector. In, 1997 the Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) dropped its
 long-standing objection to restricting the electronics sector to enterprise-level
 unions. The MTUC stated that it would be better for the workers to have the in-
 house unions "than none at all."
 Unions maintain independence both from the Government and from political par-
 ties, but individual union members may belong to political parties. Although union
 officers may not hold principal offices in political parties, individual trade union
 leaders have served in Parliament as opposition members. Trade unions are free to
 associate with national labor societies, which exercise many of the responsibilities
 of national labor unions, although they cannot bargain for local unions. In 1997
 longtime labor leader Zainal Rampak joined the ruling party, and in December was
 appointed to the Senate.
 Although strikes are legal, the right to strike is restricted severely. The law con-
 tains a list of "essential services" in which unions must give advance notice of any
 industrial action. The list includes sectors not normally deemed essential under ILO
 definitions.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1967 requires the parties to notify the Ministry
 of Human Resources that a dispute exists before any industrial action (strike or
 lockout) may be taken. The Ministry's Industrial Relations Department then may
 become involved actively in conciliation efforts. If conciliation fails to achieve settle-
 ment, the Minister has the power to refer the dispute to the Industrial Court.
 Strikes or lockouts are prohibited while the dispute is before the Industrial Court.
 The Industrial Relations Act prohibits employers from taking retribution against a
 worker for participating in the lawful activities of a trade union. Where a strike is
 legal, these provisions would prohibit employer retribution against strikers and
 leaders. Although some trade unions question their effectiveness, it is not possible
 to assess fully whether these provisions are being enforced effectively, given the lim-
 ited number of cases of alleged retribution. Strikes are extremely rare.
 There are two national labor organizations. The MTUC is a federation of mainly
 private sector unions. CUEPACS is a federation of civil servant and teacher unions.
 Public servants have the right to organize at the level of ministries and depart-
 ments. There are three national joint councils representing management and profes-
 sional civil servants, technical employees, and non-technical workers.
 In September the Government announced plans to include foreign workers in the
 National Workers Compensation Scheme. Exclusion of foreign workers from this
 scheme had been a longstanding concern of the ILO.
 Enterprise unions can associate with international labor bodies and actively do so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the legal right
 to organize and bargain collectively, and collective bargaining is widespread in those
 sectors where labor is organized. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by em-
 ployers against union members and organizers. Charges of discrimination may be
 filed with the Ministry of Human Resources or the Industrial Court. Critics say that
 the Industrial Court is slow in adjudicating worker complaints when conciliation ef-
 forts by the Ministry of Human Resources fail. However, other critics point out that
 the Industrial Court almost always sides with the workers in disputes.
 Companies in free trade zones (FTZ's) must observe labor standards identical to
 those in the rest of the country. Many workers at FTZ companies are organized, es-
 pecially in the textile and electrical products sectors. The ILO continues to object
 to legal restrictions on collective bargaining in "pioneer industries."
 
 
 1004
 c. -Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and the Government enforces this prohibition. In theory, cer-
 tain laws allow the use of imprisonment with compulsory labor as a punishment for
 persons who express views opposed to the established order or who participate in
 strikes. The Government maintains that the constitutional prohibition renders these
 laws without effect. However, some women and girls were forced into prostitution
 by traffickers in women for sexual exploitation (see Section 5).
 The constitutional prohibition applies as well to forced and bonded labor by chil-
 dren. The press reported in April the case 15-year-old girl forced into bonded labor
 to settle a debt of her parents. Police rescued the girl. Bonded labor is rare and not
 condoned by the Government.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Chil-
 dren and Young Persons (Employment) Act of 1966 prohibits the employment of
 children younger than the age of 14. The act permits some exceptions, such as light
 work in a family ente *prise, work in public entertainment, work performed for the
 Government in a school or training institutions, or work as an approved apprentice.
 In no case may children, work more than 6 hours per day, more than 6 days per
 week, or atnight.
 Child labor occurs in certain sectors of the country. A 1993 joint report by the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the Asian and Pacific Re-
 gional Organization put the child work force at 75,000. However, government offi-
 cials maintain- that this figure is outdated, since it was based on a nationwide sur-
 vey of child labor undertaken in 1980, which estimated that more than 73,400 chil-
 dren between the ages of 10 and 14 were employed full time. There is no reliable
 recent estimate of the number of child workers. Most child laborers work in the
 urban informal sector in food businesses, night markets, and small-scale industries,
 as well as on rubber and palm oil plantations. Government officials do not deny the
 existence of child labor but maintain that foreign workers largely have replaced
 child labor and that the Government vigorously. enforces child labor provisions.
 Forced and bonded labor by children is constitutionally prohibited and is not com-
 mon. Child prostitution exists (see Sections 5 and 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage, but the
 Wage Councils Act provides for a minimum wage in those sectors or regions of the
 country where a need exists. Under the law, workers in an industry who believe
 that they need the protection of a minimum wage may request that a wage council
 be established. Few workers are now covered by minimum wages set by wage coun-
 cils and the Government prefers to let market forces determine wage rates. Mini-
 mum wages set by wage councils generally do not provide for a decent standard of
 living for a worker and family. However, prevailing wages, even in the sectors cov-
 ered by wage councils, are higher than the minimum wages -set by the wage councils
 and do provide a decent living.
 Under the Employment Act of 1955, working hours may not exceed 8 hours per
 day or 48 hours per workweek of 6 days. Each workweek must include one 24-hour
 rest period. The act also sets overtime rates and mandates public holidays, annual
 leave, sick leave, and maternity allowances. The Labor Department of the Ministry
 of Human Resources enforces these standards, but a shortage of inspectors pre-
 cludes strict enforcement.
 Foreign workers, approximately one-forth of the work force, are not allowed to join
 trade unions. The MTUC stated in 1997 that foreign workers should be unionized.
 The Government responded that it did not "encourage" foreign workers to join
 unions and that labor laws were adequate to protect foreign workers' interests.
 Significant numbers of contract workers, including numerous illegal immigrants,
 work on plantations and in other sectors. Working conditions on plantations for
 these laborers compare poorly with those of direct hire plantation workers, many
 of whom belong to the National Union of Plantation Workers. Moreover, immigrant
 workers in the construction and other sectors, particularly if they are illegal aliens,
 generally do not have access to the system of labor adjudication. Government inves-
 tigations into this problem have resulted in a number of steps to eliminate the
 abuse of contract labor. For example, besides expanding programs to regularize the
 status of immigrant workers, the Government investigates complaints of abuses, en-
 deavors to inform workers of their rights, encourages workers to come forward with
 their complaints, and warns employers to end abuses. Like other employers, labor
 contractors may be prosecuted for violating the labor laws.
 In 1993 Parliament adopted an Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA),
 which covers all sectors of the economy, except the maritime sector and the military.
 The act established a national Occupational Safety and Health Council, composed
 of workers, employers, and government representatives, to set policy and coordinate
 occupational safety and health measures. It requires employers to identify risks and
 
 
 1005
 
 take precautions, including providing safety training to workers, and compels com-
 panies that have more than 40 workers to establish joint management-employee
 safety committees. The act requires workers to use safety equipment and to cooper-
 ate with employers to create a safe, healthy workplace. Trade unions maintain that
 relatively few committees have been established and, even in cases where they exist,
 that they meet infrequently and generally are ineffective.
 There are no specific statutory or regulatory provisions that provide a right for
 workers to remove themselves from dangerous workplace conditions without arbi-
 trary dismissal. Employers or employees violating the OSHA are subject to substan-
 tial fines or imprisonment for up to 5 years.
