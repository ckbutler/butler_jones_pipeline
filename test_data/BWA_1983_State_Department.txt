 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multiparty parliamentary democracy, with
 constitutionally guaranteed universal suffrage. Elections,
 held every five years, are scheduled again in October 1984,
 and as many as six political parties are expected to participate.
 The constitutional rights of individuals in Botswana are
 .protected by an independent judiciary. The police force and a
 small, well-disciplined army provide internal and external
 security. Botswana has progressed economically in its 17 years
 of independence, despite the minimal infrastructure inherited
 at independence, a lack of skilled manpower, and climatic
 constraints imposed by irregular and insufficient rainfall.
 Botswana has followed a program of private enterprise and
 free trade. All citizens, including those whites who accepted
 Botswana citizenship, are free to participate in the economic
 and political life of the country. For the past several years,
 Botswana has been a haven for refugees from the political and
 military strife of neighboring countries. After a gradual
 decline in the number of refugees in 1981 and 1982 to about
 800, an additional 2,800 Zimbabweans sought refuge in the
 first half of 1983.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Botswana has a good reputation for protecting human rights.
 However, in October 1982 a young man died in police custody,
 apparently from treatment received by the police while charges
 against him were being investigated. There was considerable
 comment in the local press, and the Government conducted an
 inquest which received wide publicity. The magistrate, a senior
 official seconded from the British judicial service, ruled that
 while the man had expired in police custody and the body showed
 evidence of a beating, there was no proof that the police were
 responsible. No other instances or allegations of murder by
 either official government or opposition political groups are
 known.
 b. Disappearance
 The Botswana Constitution provides for the protection of personal
 liberty. There have been no allegations of secret arrests or
 clandestine detentions in Botswana during 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law. with the exception of the
 incident mentioned under Section la above, no other allegations
 involving torture have been made. No summary executions have
 occurred. Prison conditions allow for adequate diet, health
 care, and visits from family members. Jails can, however, be
 crowded and inmates who have no relatives to see to their needs
 may encounter difficulty in arranging for maintenance. Flogging
 is permitted for infractions of prison rules. It is also used
 (39)

 by tribal courts, whose jurisdiction is limited to minor
 offenses. A law passed in 1982 provided for compulsory
 corporal punishment for persons (male or female) convicted of
 rape, attempted rape, causing grievous bodily harm, armed
 robbery, burglary, housebreaking, and other related offenses.
 The constitutionality of this law was challenged and upheld by
 the High Court in December 1983.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Botswana Constitution contains provisions protecting
 citizens from arbitrary arrest. There are no political prisoners
 in Botswana and preventive detention is illegal. Habeas corpus
 exists in practice, with a requirement that the police bring a
 suspect before a magistrate for charging within 48 hours of his
 arrest. Suspects must be released after 48 hours unless the
 magistrate issues a warrant of detention, which is valid for 14
 days. Every 14 days, the police must appear before the magistrate
 and show they are making progress in the case. To date, there
 have been no known instances of abuse of this system. No citizens
 are known to be in exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair, public trial is provided by law and is
 honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsell
 consultation between defendants and counsel may be held in
 private. The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 military. The High Court has ruled that one may not be
 compelled to testify against oneself. Moreover, silence cannot
 be construed as guilt, and the burden of proof remains with the
 prosecution. All trials are held in public. Provisions exist
 for conducting closed hearing trials relating to security
 cases, but no such trials have occurred in recent years.
 There are no special courts to deal with security or political
 offenses. Although the Botswana Defense Force Act provides
 for military courts, none as yet has been established, and
 cases over which the military has jurisdiction normally are
 referred to the Attorney General and the civilian court system.
 There are problems in the administration of justice,, but they
 center mainly on the difficulty in recruiting a sufficient number
 of qualified judicial personnel and court reporters.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are safeguarded by law and respected in practice.
 A search warrant issued by a magistrate is required for an
 official to enter a private residence except in cases of
 suspected diamond theft or drug trafficking. There have been
 no reported instances when this authority was used during this
 year.
 A bill introduced to Parliament during 1983 would allow police,
 with a warrant from a magistrate, to inspect bank accounts
 where reasonable grounds exist to suppose that the accounts
 may afford evidence as to the commission of an offense.
 Although the bill would cover all offenses, the main targets
 are people suspected of involvement in drug traffic.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and the press are guaranteed by the
 Constitution and are respected. During the past 15 months,
 two independent weekly newspapers began publication, but
 one has since failed due to lack of funds and personnel.
 The government-owned, four page, daily newspaper covers the
 statements of opposition parties and airs the views of
 opposition candidates. The Government has encouraged the
 free exchange of ideas and has permitted considerable latitude
 in the media. In the only incident approaching censorship, the
 Government seized or ordered the return of soae 50 copies of
 a publication printed privately by a recently discharged and
 disgruntled expatriate employee of the Ministry of Agriculture.
 Due to the allegedly libelous nature of several allegations
 contained in the publication, the Government claimed that it
 had a right and a duty to protect loyal employees and so ordered
 the seizure. The expatriate left the country before any charges
 could be levied against him. Botswana has signed the Kadoma
 document which bans entry of journalists based in South Africa.
 However, the Government has not taken any active steps to
 implement the resolution nor hindered the movement of journalists
 in their efforts to collect information or report on events.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is a well-established tradition in Botswana
 exemplified in the Kgotla, communal meetings, similar to New
 England town meetings, where citizens freely question leaders
 and voice opinion on local policies. Large gatherings require
 local police approval, which is routinely given. Demonstrations
 are permitted so long as order is maintained. Organizers are
 required to submit a detailed plan for any demonstrations and
 are personally responsible for insuring that the plan is
 followed. Unions have the right to strike after following due
 process, which requires that the Government be invited to
 attempt to arbitrate disputes. The last strike occurred in
 1976. Unions are permitted to organize and operate freely,
 though they have chafed under strong government regulations
 concerning the status of union leadership and the sources of
 funds available to unions.   (Basically, laws prohibit any union
 funds from outside Botswana.) Unions associate freely with
 international organizations and members attend international
 conferences.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. Open practice of religion is
 permitted and encouraged. While most residents are Christians,
 active groups of Muslims, Hindus, Bahais, and others practice
 their faiths freely. Religious affiliation is neither an
 advantage nor disadvantage politically or socially.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Botswana citizens are subject to virtually no restrictions
 on emigration or repatriation. Domestic and foreign travel
 
 
 is unrestricted as well. Passports, in general, are easily
 obtained. Refugees documented by the U.N. High Commissioner
 for Refugees (U.N.H.C.R.) are required to live in a settlement
 at Dukwe in northern Botswana. The settlement's housing,
 infrastructure, and other amenities are generally markedly
 superior to those which are available in nearby villages
 (largely due to contributions from international donor
 organizations). Refugees may be authorized to live elsewhere
 for reasons such as employment or schooling. In cooperation
 with international agencies the Government provides educational
 programs, sports, and recreational programs, and business
 opportunities for the refugees at Dukwe. As with other
 foreigners in Botswana, refugees are not permitted to accept
 employment opportunities which could be filled by a citizen.
 While consistent with local policy, this position is not in
 keeping with U.N. standards on treatment of refugees. During
 the last year the number of refugees has increased from fewer
 than 1,000 to about 4,000 because of crises in neighboring
 countries.  In addition to maintaining its open-door policy
 toward these recent arrivals, Botswana has resisted increasing
 political pressure from its neighbors to repatriate the refugees
 forcibly. While allowing representatives from those countries
 to plead with refugees to return, the Government has consistently
 maintained that refugees will be repatriated only at their own
 wish and with their consent.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change their Government
 Botswana citizens participate in politics by voting, engaging
 in party activities, running for office, and publicly advocating
 new policies. Four parties contested the 1979 election;    as
 many as six may contest elections scheduled for late 1984.
 Only the Botswana Democratic Party is nationally organized to
 contest each of the 32 seats; the other parties are regional
 in nature so that the Botswana Democratic Party usually faces
 only one opposition party in each constituency. In the 1979
 election the Botswana National Front contested 16 seats, the
 Botswana People's Party 14, and the Botswana Independence Party
 only five seats. The Botswana Democratic Party carried 29
 seats, the Botswana National Front two, and the Botswana
 People's Party one. In byelections held in some constituencies
 in May and June 1983, the Botswana Democratic Party was never
 unopposed but won all elections handily. Local independent and
 government-owned newspapers report the speeches and activities
 of all parties.
 The political rights of women and minority groups generally are
 observed. The two female members of Parliament are both
 ministers;  the Executive Secretary of the Botswana Democratic
 Party is a woman. The one white member-of Parliament is a
 minister;  the speaker of the National Assembly, a prominent
 businessman, is also white. Only the Basarwa or 'Bushmen"
 remain unrepresented in government and generally ignored.
 While the Government does not oppress them or deny them rights,
 it does little to help or protect a minority whose way of life
 is rapidly changing due to the recent economic development in
 Botswana.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Botswana's record of cooperation with international agencies
 concerned with human rights has been very good. Relations with
 the office of the U.N.H.C.R., the only international human
 rights organization active in Botswana, are friendly and open.
 There are no Botswana-based organizations set up to observe,
 report, or contest human rights violations. The Botswana
 Government consistently responds promptly and forthrightly to
 the inquiries it receives from international human rights
 organizations about the human rights situation in Botswana. As
 a thinly populated country surrounded by larger and more
 powerful neighbors, Botswana seldom comments publicly on
 alleged human right violations in those countries. Botswana
 does join with other African governments in condemning apartheid
 in South Africa, however. Amnesty International did not report
 on Botswana in 1983. Freedom House rates Botswana "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 When Botswana became independent in 1966, its developed in-
 frastructure was negligible, and the per capita gross national
 product (GNP) was estimated at only $69. Despite these initial
 handicaps, the Government has been extremely successful--
 primarily due to exploitation of mineral resources--in bringing
 about economic development and improving the economic and
 social welfare of its people. The Government has been persistent
 in its efforts to meet the health and nutrition needs of its
 citizens. The percentage of the population with access to
 potable water increased from 29 percent in 1968 to 45 percent
 in 19751 the increase in access to safe water was greater in
 urban areas, from 71 percent to 95 percent, due in great part
 to the fact that Botswana's rural population is widely scattered.
 It is estimated that in 1977, 94 percent of the calorie supply
 required for Botswana's population was available in the country.
 Due to the drought which has afflicted Botswana and all southern
 Africa during the past two years, the country has become
 heavily dependent on imported foodstuffs, either purchased or
 donated. Life expectancy increased from 41.0 years in 1968 to
 49.9 years in 1980.
 Women hold approximately 24 percent of paid employment positions.
 An estimated 41 percent of central government employees are
 women, many of them in high-level positions. While there is
 little overt discrimination, statistics suggest that social
 custom elevates rights and privileges of men above those
 of women. Some 40 percent of rural households (84 percent of
 the total population is rural) are female headed, and generally
 their economic situation--access to capital, seeds, labor, and
 draught animals--is significantly worse than that of male-headed
 households. Women about to marry may choose civil marriage, in
 which all property is held in common, or customary marriage
 which recognizes individual property brought to a marriage.
 Most women are not aware, however, of the implications of these
 alternatives. Often, a married woman is unable to obtain a
 bank loan without the signature of her husband, or an unmarried
 woman without the signature of her father. Few women apply for
 financial assistance because they perceive such programs as
 being for men.
 
 
 44
 Strong pressures encourage women to accept roles as dependent
 wives and mothers. While 60 percent of students in seventh
 grade are girls, only 40 percent of those graduating from
 secondary school are girls. It has been suggested that as
 girls mature and become more educated, they become more
 aware of conflicting roles (marriage vs. career) and perhaps
 face more pressure from family to opt for marriage, thus
 encouraging them to drop out or fail at higher levels of
 schooling.
 Starting from a very poorly developed base, Botswana has
 made considerable progress in providing educational opportunities.
 The adjusted primary school enrollment ratio increased from 56
 percent in 1968 to 89 percent in 1978 and rose to 93 percent in
 1979. The difference in the 1978 ratios for boys (80 percent)
 and girls (98 percent) is due primarily to the custom of using
 school-aged boys to herd cattle. Botswana has almost succeeded
 in attaining its goal of universal primary education and is now
 seeking to increase access to secondary education. The adult
 literacy rate is estimated to be approximately 35 percent. In
 1978 per capita GNP was $620. By 1980 this figure had risen to
 $910, followed by a slight decrease to $902 in 1981, primarily
 as a result of fluctuations in mineral prices, which are the
 most important influence on Botswana's economy at present.
 Rural incomes are much lower than urban incomes, which has been
 one factor leading to increased rural migration during the past
 decade. The urban population has increased from eight percent
 in 1971 to 17 percent in 1981. Despite general improvement in
 the economy during the past decade, poverty still afflicts a
 large proportion of the population. The most recent estimates
 in 1979, which take into account an annual population growth
 rate of between 3.5 and 5.0 percent, are that 55 percent of the
 rural population and 40 percent of the urban population have
 incomes below the absolute poverty level. Progress in this
 area is made difficult by the substantial number of the country's
 citizens who are only marginally involved in the money economy.
 To overcome problems of unemployment and population increase,
 the Government encourages labor intensive industries and
 projects.
