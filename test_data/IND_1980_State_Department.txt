 INDIA
 India has a multi-party democratic political system, an
 independent judiciary, and a flourishing free press.
 Fundamental human rights are guaranteed in the constitu-
 tion, and discrimination on the grounds of religion,
 race, caste, sex or place of birth is prohibited.
 india's constitution mandates the promotion of the educ-
 ation and economic interests of the disadvantaged sections
 of society. These aims are reflected in economic policies
 which give priority to developing India's rural areas and
 to increasing employment opportunities.
 One of the aims of government since independence in 1947
 has been the promotion of harmony among, and the advance-
 ment of, India's diverse peoples and castes. Over the
 years, legislation and government programs have helped to
 reduce the negative effects of the traditional social and
 economic systems.
 India is also a diverse country whose many regions are at
 varying stages of development. Popular expectations about
 the fruits of modernization have been rising steadily;
 inevitable frustrations have led to increased social ten-
 sions in some areas and among some groups. The Indian
 system is federal in nature with distinct spheres reserved
 for the national and 22 state governments. The latter are
 primarily responsible for maintenance of law and order,
 local development and education. The states also have
 their own judicial systems. The responsibility of the cen-
 tral government is to apply the constitution and to chart
 out policies based on constitutional directives and commit-
 ments with implementation resting primarily with the states.
 Thus, there may exist considerable variation in human rights-
 related conditions from one state or region to another,
 particularly where the fulfillment of vital human economic
 and social needs is concerned.
 In 1980 the focus of human rights debate in India was on
 police brutality and rights of women, particularly where
 violence was involved. There was also continuing attention
 to "undertrials" (i.e., prisoners awaiting trial in Indian
 jails), widespread support for stronger anti-rape laws, and
 better legal protection for women. Women's organiza-
 tions and lawyers have made rape a focus of a national debate,
 urging re-examination and reform of the Indian Penal Code, the
 Evidence Act and the Criminal Procedure Code. Following the
 August 1980 outbreak of severe clashes between Muslims and
 predominantly Hindu police in parts of northern India, and
 agitation elsewhere, the central government legally introduced
 and extended preventive detention authority in order "to
 restore law and order and assure the supply of essential com-
 modities." Although the government has exercised this
 authority in only a few cases, they have led to debate whether
 
 
 972
 it will again be used against political opponents.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Indian Code of Criminal
 Procedure (1973) (Sections 161 (3), 163 (1), 164 (2)).
 The Indian Evidence Act, Sections 25-27, requires a
 valid confession to be made in the presence of a magis-
 trate. Article 20 (3) of the Indian constitution states
 that no one may be compelled to testify against himself.
 There is also ample case law extending over many decades
 demonstrating that recourse to torture in India for any
 purpose is contrary to law and that the introduction of
 confessions or information extracted by use of torture
 or force in trial procedure is inadmissable.
 Nonetheless, there is widespread circumstantial evidence
 that torture by the police does occur. Amnesty Interna-
 tional (AI) in August 1980 cited newspaper reports asserting
 that "third degree" methods were used in a high percentage
 of cases of police custody in West Bengal. Al also noted
 that it had written to the Chief Ministers of Karnataka,
 Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal about alle-
 gations of police ill-treatment and torture in those states.
 Other press reports by reliable journalists have cited wide-
 spread reliance on police torture in Punjab, Bihar and
 Haryana. On April 1, 1980 a bench of the Supreme Court of
 India, in rejecting the appeal of a police officer convicted
 of murdering a prisoner in his custody, urged the states to
 stamp out "the vice of third degree" investigative methods,
 and referred to the "terrible scare" to citizens of the
 "diabolical recurrence of police torture."
 A vivid illustration of brutal police methods was the reve-
 lation in late November that policemen had used needles and
 acid to blind some 31 prisoners awaiting trial in a rural
 distriqt of Bihar. The Prime Minister and other government
 officials expressed shock and revulsion at the blindings and
 have ordered a full investigation of the incidents and
 punishment of those responsible.
 A survey of the Indian Express newspaper (August 11, 1980)
 of 45 police custody deaths in seven states and New Delhi
 reported what it stated was their usual pattern: The victims
 invariably are poor. Often they are not arrested on specific
 charges but on suspicion or bad luck. The paper alleged that
 in Punjab and Haryana charges usually follow admission of
 guilt. In a large majority of cases, murder charges were
 registered against the policemen (these are still under pro-
 cessing). In others, no action was taken beyond a transfer
 of some policemen. The same article also noted the lack of
 systematic review of police custody deaths whether by govern-
 ment, civil rights groups or the press.
 
 
 973
 Al notes that allegations of police custody deaths have
 been made for many years. There is no suggestion that
 such deaths are due to government policy; rather, there
 is often lack of effective supervision of police.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or.Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment or punishment is proscribed by law, and
 there are no known instances of summary execution in
 India. Varying terms of imprisonment rather than physical
 punishment are imposed for crimes committed, as spelled
 out by the Criminal Code of India and the states. Persons
 convicted of murder can receive the death penalty. A more
 serious public issue in India, and widely discussed in
 1980, are prison conditions. The continued presence of
 large numbers of undertrials has resulted in the crowding
 of jails in many parts of the country and the deterioration
 of conditions for all prisoners. The Supreme Court of
 India in April 1980 directed the government to conduct a
 judicial enquiry into conditions prevailing in the Tihar
 jail, New Delhi, and to develop recommendations on ter-
 minating abuses in the jail.
 A feature of imprisonment inherited from the British
 colonial period, and still in effect in India, is a sys-
 tem of classification of prisoners related to differential
 prison conditions and special privileges. Thus, while
 ordinary (or class C) prisoners enjoy no special treatment,
 foreigners (class B) and political prisoners (class A) are
 entitled to less crowded cells, better food and amenities.
 Income tax paying (i.e. middle class) prisoners are also
 often segregated from ordinary prisoners and granted more
 privileges. The special privileges for political prisoners
 date from the independence struggle when large numbers of
 respectable people courted arrest through a minor infraction
 of the law. Support for these principles remains widespread
 in India. For example, the Bihar Jail Reform Committee in
 April 1980 defended special treatment for political prison-
 ers, referring to people "who come to jail for activities
 not guided by self-interest but by a spirit of public
 service and welfare."
 c. Disappearances
 No instances have been reported of the abduction, secret
 arrest, clandestine detention, or "disappearance" of
 individuals at the hands of public authorities in India.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution provides that a person detained in custody
 must be informed of the grounds for arrest as soon as pos-
 sible, and shall have the right to be represented by counsel.
 
 
 974
 Such persons must be brought before a magistrate within
 24 hours of arrest and not be detained further without
 the magistrate's authority. No credible information has
 been received in 1980 suggesting that these provisions
 are not generally respected in practice.
 However, the constitution also permits the enactment of
 preventive detention laws to "prevent threats to the
 public welfare and safeguard the national security."
 It requires that these laws provide for certain limits
 on the length of detention and for review of such
 detention.
 In February 1980 parliament ratified a preventive deten-
 tion ordinance enacted in November 1979 (The Prevention
 of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Essential Supplies
 Act) permitting the arrest of suspected "economic offen-
 ders." In September 1980 following severe rioting in
 Northern India, a National Security Ordinance (NSO) was
 adopted authorizing the central and state governments to
 order detention of individuals to prevent action "preju-
 dicial to the defense or security of India, or to the
 maintenance of public order or the availability of sup-
 plies and services essential to the community." The
 ordinance was ratified by parliament in December as the
 National Security Act. Its provisions parallel similar
 preventive measures adopted by several states. Each of
 these measures requires that written notification about
 the reason for detention be provided within five days
 of arrest, Detainees also are permitted legal counsel.
 Review boards appointed by the Chief Justice of individual
 state High Courts and consisting of active or retired
 judgeg or persons qualified to be judges must review each
 case of detention to determine the necessity of detention.
 Under the NSO, imprisonment is for 12 months, but this
 time may be extended or shortened. The decision to imple-
 ment the Ordinance is left to the states.
 In many cases, detainees are held only a short time and
 released, particularly where detention follows serious
 rioting. There is no evidence that these measures have
 been used against political opponents of the current
 administration. The latest available government figures,
 describing the situation as of November 10, 1980, indicate
 that 250 people had been detained, of whom 193 were still
 under detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no constitutional guarantee of public trial; The
 Criminal Procedure Code provides for open trial but also
 permits the judiciary to close the proceedings in part or
 in whole. The Official Secrets Act also permits proceedings
 to be closed on the plea that publication of any evidence
 or statements would be prejudicial to the safety of the
 state. The Act requires, however, that the passing of
 sentence take place in public.
 
 
 975
 In India, there are effective legal procedures to assure
 fair trial. One problem, however, is that of "undertrials,"
 the large number of prisoners awaiting trial, in some cases
 for as long as ten years. In many states, the percentage
 of undertrials to the jail population varies from 50 to 80
 percent. In March 1979, the Indian Supreme Court ruled
 that speedy trial was a fundamental right of the citizen
 and ordered two state governments to release all undertrial
 prisoners who had been in jail longer than they would have
 been had they been tried and convicted. The Court directed
 five other states to furnish details of undertrials held
 in their prisons for more than six months.
 There are no comprehensive data concerning the implemen-
 tation of the Supreme Court's directive. Bihar is reported
 to have released 18,000 undertrials but data on other states'
 implementation of the Supreme Court directive do not exist.
 The government told parliament August 6, 1980, that it had
 requested state governments to set 6p review committees on
 the cases of undertrials and to appoint legal officers to
 provide legal aid to indigent prisoners. Newspaper reports
 indicate that no significant progress in reducing the number
 of undertrials in Indian prisons has been made. A current
 estimate is that 58 to 65 percent of prisoners in India
 currently fall in that category.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Criminal Procedure Code requires warrants for searches
 and seizures, but it also permits the police in the course
 of a criminal investigation to institute searches without
 warrant if otherwise there would be undue delay. In such
 a case, the officer must state in writing the grounds for
 making the search without a warrant and specify the object
 of the search. There is no indication that this provision
 has been abused in practice, nor that other forms of viola-
 tion of the home have occurred in India.
 2. Government    Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Section IV of the Indian constitution enumerates the direc-
 tive principles of state policy which are "the duty of the
 state to apply ... in making laws."  The Indian government
 is enjoined to "endeavor to minimize inequalities in income
 ... and in status, facilities, and opportunities" for all
 citizens of India. Among these the constitution lists "the
 right to work, to education, to public assistance, to secure
 a living wage ... and a decent standard of life."  The
 constitution established detailed guidelines for affirmative
 action on behalf of socially disadvantaged groups. Called
 Scheduled Castes (or Untouchables), and Scheduled Tribes,
 both the central and state governments grant them preferen-
 tial access to special benefits.
 
 
 976
 Indian development and general economic policies emerged
 out of a series of five year plans, the first beginning
 in 1950, which have sought to establish a framework for
 realization of these objectives.
 India has a mixed economy in which key industries are
 vested in the public sector. A basic objective has been
 to achieve rapid industrialization and self-sufficiency
 in all main aspects of economic growth. Though India
 seeks to promote a "socialistic pattern of society.' the
 right to ownership and disposition of property is recognized
 in the constitution. Agriculture is entirely private, while
 many important industries and most retailing is also in
 private hands.
 The scale and extent of human needs in India that are still
 to be met is brought out in the following data:
 1. Population (1980)            671 million (est.)

 Rate and Nature of Economic Growth. India's relatively
 poor growth performance has been a major cause of
 poverty. Between 1950-51 and 1977-78, overall income
 growth averaged only 3.6 percent per year and per capita
 income grew by 1.5 percent. Thip permitted per capita
 incomes to increase only by 40 percent during three
 decades of planning. Similarly, the long-term growth
 rates of agricultural production (2.9 percent) and of
 foodgrain production (3.2 percent) were only marginally
 above the long-term population growth rate (2.2 percent),
 allowing for relatively little improvement in diets.
 ov     . The government has adopted a poverty line related
 to minmum nutritional requirements of 2400 calories per
 person per day for rural areas and 2100 calories for urban
 areas. The poverty line (in 1977-78 prices) was $97.50
 equivalent for rural areas and $112.50 equivalent for
 urban areas. Based on this definition the govermant estimated
 the population below the poverty line in 1977-78 at 306
 
 
 978
 million (49 percent of the total 1977-78 population)
 including 57 million in urban areas (about 43 percent
 of the urban population) and 249 million in rural areas
 (50 percent of the rural population). Although there
 apparently has been no long-term increase in the
 percentage of the population below the poverty line,
 population growth has meant an increase in the number
 of people below the poverty line. If the poverty line is
 defined more broadly to include public expenditure on
 health, social welfare, education, and administrative
 services, the number below it would swell.
 Income Inequalities. The most important dimensions of
 economic inequalities in India are income disparities
 by class, caste, or occupational group and disparities
 by-region. While overall distribution of income in
 India improved in the 1950's and 60's (or at least did
 not deteriorate), income differentials among India's
 states seem to have widened considerably over time. As
 of 1975-76, for example, average per capita income in
 India's richest state (Punjab) was nearly 2.5 times the
 per capita income in the poorest (Bihar), whereas in
 1960 the ratio was 1.7:1. Again, while the aggregate
 per capita food supply in India is about 90 percent of
 the WHO/FAO recommended allowances, there is variation in
 food consumption by state and region. In general, the
 northern states have a higher caloric consumption in
 both urban and rural areas.
 Urban - Rural Differences. The greatest differences in
 access to the fruits of development and economic growth
 exist between urban and rural areas in all regions of the
 country. Thus, the rural crude death rate exceeds the
 urban rate by 42 percent and the rural infant mortality
 rate exceeds the urban rate by 43 percent. Both urban
 and rural areas have experienced a decline in the infant
 mortality rate since 1960 but the urban decline has been
 greater by 15 percent. Differential access to health,
 family planning, and nutritional services has been a
 serious barrier to reducing mortality and fertility in
 rural areas and particularly among the poor. Over 60
 percent of the government health and family planning
 budget is spent in urban areas and about two-thirds of the
 doctors and nurses live in the cities. As a result, the
 rural people are deprived of basic health care services
 and they rely primarily on private and indigenous care.
 Since 1975-76 the proportion of the budget devoted to
 rural services increased fourfold -- to about 42 percent.
 The government has embarked on a national minimum needs
 program which includes the provision of basic health and
 family-planning in the rural areas as a high priority
 program.
 Male-Female Differences. Women are expected to be major
 beneficiaries of these expanded services. A striking
 feature in India is the steady decline of the ratio of
 women to men over many decades, a trend which is likely
 to continue into the next century. This is attributed
 both to women dying at a faster rate than men, and to
 
 
 979
 more boys being born than girls. Female mortality rate
 has been higher than the male rate in the age groups
 0-8. Medical research traced this mainly to maternal
 mortality, and recorded births at 11 per 1000 live births.
 The combined incidence of miscarriage and still births may
 have been as high as 30 percent in 1972. Fatal cases of
 maternal malnutrition, iron deficiency and anemia are
 common in low income groups. Women also have a lower life
 expectancy then males in the 15-54 age group. Factors
 include preference for male infants, poorer nutrition,
 adverse effects of excessive child-bearing on females'
 health, higher incidence of diseases (including those
 specific to women), and poorer access of women to available
 health facilities.
 Education. The Indian educational system has expanded ra-
 pidly since independence. Primary school enrollments
 increased from 43 percent to 84 percent of the relevant
 age group between 1950-51 and 1975-76; enrollments at the
 middle and secondary levels increased from 13 percent to
 37 percent end 5 percent to 22 percent of the relevant
 age groups respectively. Literacy rose from 19 percent in
 1950-51 to 33 percent in 1971.
 Although progress in education has been rapid, it has been
 uneven. Urban areas are better endowed with schools than
 rural areas. Enrollment ratios for females are still
 lower than those for males, although the relative position
 of women has improved since independence.
 Enrollments tend to be lower for children of disadvantaged
 groups, such as landless laborers and Scheduled Castes and
 Tribes. Literacy rates vary widely by group and by region.
 Literacy among the Scheduled Castes end Scheduled Tribes is
 one-half and one-third the national average, respectively.
 Among India's states, literacy varies from a low of 19
 percent in Rajasthen to 60 percent in Kerala.
 The persistence of substantial inequalities can be attri-
 buted to a variety of factors. The great physical and
 climatic diversity of the Indian subcontinent contributes
 to the differential regional incidence of poverty. More-
 over, India's federal system of center-state relations
 reserves to the states the power over many relevant areas
 (e.g. agriculture, land reform, local administration and
 taxation, health, education). This has not only prolonged
 the staying power of local elites, but has contributed to
 uneven development performance among states. In most parts
 of India, traditional elites were successful initially in
 preventing any rapid shifts, and likewise found ways to
 preempt a large share of the benefits of most development
 programs for their own groups.
 Caste. Caste factors also contribute to inequality. Most
 rural castes are engaged directly or indirectly in agricul-
 ture. The key variables are the degree of access members of
 a caste may have to land and its produce, and the extent to
 which they, themselves, engage directly in cultivation.
 Wealth, power, and prestige normally converge but positions
 of caste can change over time - many formerly low-ranking
 castes have used increased wealth to gain greater status
 and power.
 
 
 980
 Scheduled Castes and Tribes pose a special problem. The
 Scheduled Castes comprise   an estimated 15 percent of the
 population. Scheduled Tribes are 7 percent. Government
 efforts to improve the position of the Scheduled Castes
 and Tribes since independence have so far met only modest
 success. These groups continue to constitute a large
 proportion of India's "poorest of the poor." Muslims,
 about 12 percent of the population, also tend to be poor,
 and their relative socio-economic position has not changed
 markedly since India's independence in 1947.
 Progress in Reducin Poverty. India's record in meeting
 vital needs under six five-year plans has been mixed. Real
 per capita GNP has increased only slowly and there has been
 little progress in lowerinq the proportion of the population
 below the poverty line. Yet, income inequalities have not
 increased within rural areas generally. India also has
 avoided the greater rural-urban inequalities often asso-
 ciated with the early phases of industrialization. Data on
 life expectancy and infant mortality show that improvements
 in some aspects of living standards have been fairly broadly
 based. These indicators, combined with literacy rates, form
 the "physical quality of life index" (PQLI) which has in-
 creased from 14 in 1951 to 43 at present. while this is
 low, it is a comparatively_ high figure for India's level of
 per capita GNP. Thus, India's efforts to improve access to
 health and education services have been fairly impressive
 given the resource constraints imposed by slow income growth.
 Stress on-agriculture. India began shifting away from the
 heavy emphasis on industrialization by the late 1960's,
 when it adopted a "new strategy of agricultural development"
 based on high-yielding foodgrain varieties (HYV). Many of
 the initial biases against small farmers in India have been
 largely overcome, particularly with respect to water, credit,
 fertilizer and extension advice.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution of India guarantees freedom of speech and,
 by extension, press, religion, and assembly. These guarantees
 were honored in practice in 1980. No distinction is made on
 the basis of sex, religion or social background. There is
 no censorship of the media in a general sense. Material
 deemed inciteful of religious or communal hatred is proscribed
 and occasionally some publications will have offending issues
 banned or seized. A censorship board screens films before
 their distribution is licensed, and material deemed offensive
 to public morals or to religious and communal sentiment may
 be excised. The government-controlled All India Radio has
 a monopoly of radio and television broadcasts and is often
 accused by opposition parties of slanting its broadcast
 material to favor the ruling party. There is no censorship
 of domestic and foreign books or publications nor of artistic
 works. There have been no restrictions in 1980 on criticism
 
 
 981
 of the government in India. Barring an isolated and
 well-publicized incident in Karnataka in September,
 there is'little evidence of harassment or intimidation
 of Indian journalists. The press revelations of the
 police blindings of prisoners awaiting trial in Bihar
 is a good example of courageous investigative reporting.
 The only limits on public meetings are those connected
 with crowd control -- e.g., advance notification to police
 and permits in some instances. Groups and parties of all
 persuasions are allowed to assemble freely and no hin-
 drance is imposed on their efforts to attract as large a
 participation as can be organized. Ethnic tensions in
 northeast India-and Assam have led to local and illegal
 efforts by authorities to restrain minority demonstrations.
 Trade unions in India operate without restrictions on their
 rights to organize, negotiate and strike. Professional
 groups, particularly doctors, lawyers and teachers, have
 frequently gone on strike in 1980.
 Under the Indian constitution, India is a secular state
 in which all religious groups are allowed to worship freely.
 While communal tensions based on different religious affi-
 liations occur frequently, and may lead to local injustice
 or violence against particular communities, the weight of
 government policy and practice does not favor one religious
 community over another. Muslims often have complained that
 they are under-represented in government, in military organ-
 izations, and in the police. in particular, many Muslims
 allege bias against recruitment of Muslims in the police
 and military forces. They constitute only a small percentage
 of these security forces (1-5 percent versus 12 percent of
 the national population).
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Since Indian independence in 1947, millions of refugees from
 neighboring countries have been admitted into India. These
 include Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan, Tibetans from China,
 Bengali Hindus from present-day Bangladesh and, currently,
 Afghans. The great majority of them have been granted
 Indian citizenship and integrated into the society and eco-
 nomy. As such, they are no longer regarded as refugees and
 data on their numbers are not available. Tibetans form a
 more distinct ethnic and religious group and tend to be
 concentrated in a few areas. In 1980, they are numbered
 officially at 64,562.  An estimated 20,000 Afghan refugees
 have entered India in 1979-1980. There is no evidence of
 forcible repatriation of any of these groups of refugees.
 For its part, the Indian government has accepted the repatri-
 ation of many thousands of people of Indian origin from Burma
 (209,000), Sri Lanka (328,000) and lesser numbers from Uganda
 and other countries in East Africa where they were either
 stateless or had retained Indian nationality. Ethnic Indians
 who hold other countries' nationality are considered to have
 no special claim on the right of repatriation to India. There
 is no evidence of refugees fleeing India since the Muslim
 exodus in 1947-48.
 
 
 982
 There is full freedom of movement within India for all
 citizens, except for a long-standing requirement for
 permits to enter sensitive border areas. Foreign travel
 and emigration are without political restrictions. The
 rules for obtaining a passport have been liberalized,
 new regional passport offices have been opened and the
 procedure regarding the issuance of passports has been
 simplified. Foreign exchange regulations aimed at con-
 serving foreign exchange restrict Indian nationals to
 $500 in foreign exchange conversion privileges every two
 years. Some 1.2 million Indians were issued passports
 in 1978, as against 981,075 in 1977. There are 3 million
 Indian citizens living abroad, and their number continues
 to increase.
 There are no special restrictions on internal or external
 travel, emigration, or repatriation which are applied to
 women or other groups.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is universal adult suffrage for all male and female
 citizens over 21 under the Indian constitution. Citizens
 have a variety of opportunities and avenues through which
 to participate in the political process. These include
 periodic elections at the village (or panchayat) level,
 municipal and state assembly polls and national parlia-
 mentary elections. The latter were held in January 1980
 in 525 districts throughout India. Fifty-seven percent
 of the electorate participated, (62 percent of males voted;
 51 percent of females). State assembly elections in ten
 states were held in 1980.
 Elections in India are free and impartially administered
 and supervised by an election commissioner whose respon-
 sibilities are defined in the constitution and who is
 responsible to the President alone. A multitude of local,
 state and national parties are in active opposition to
 the Congress (I) party presently in national and state
 offices. They freely contest elections at all levels.
 Opposition parties of every ideology are represented in
 the state assemblies and in the national Parliament. No
 groups in India, whether social, religious or linguistic,
 are denied political participation or suffrage. They are
 free to organize, agitate, publish, recruit, and to seek
 judicial redress in the event of perceived injustice.
 There are no problems of citizenship or nationality which
 impede political participation. The number of non-nationals
 residing in India is extremely small.
 Although there are no barriers to women candidates, their
 numbers have remained small through seven general elections.
 The present Prime Minister of India is a wcman, and cur-
 rently there are 28 women members of the Lower House of
 Parliament (Lok Sabha) of 525, and 25 in the Upper House
 (Rajya sabha) of a total membership of 244.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 No international investigations of the human rights situa-
 tion in India are known to have occurred since 1978.
 There are few private human rights monitoring organizations
 in India. Perhaps the most prominent is the People's Union
 for Civil Liberties (PUCL) based in New Delhi with chapters
 in some states and cities. There are also a few women's
 groups which monitor the status of women. The most signi-
 ficant channels for reporting human rights violations are
 parliament and the press. The latter has become increasingly
 active in its coverage of unjust social practices and exploi-
 tative economic relationships. It has been the main channel
 for focusing public and political attention on attacks in
 rural areas on low caste or Harijan people (Untouchables),
 on violence against women, including rape, on injustices
 perpetrated against tribal people, and on exploited labdr.
 The press has also taken the lead in some instances in
 examining the functioning of the preventive detention ordi-
 nances, jail conditions, and the problem of undertrials.
 Groups such as the PUCL also conduct their own investigations
 of specific situations and publish reports. In February
 1980, a PUCL group issued a report on the denial of civil
 and human rights in Assam to Bengali speakers and to commun-
 ists by agitators who were pressing for linguistic guarantees
 for Assamese. The government also informed parliament on
 March 26, 1980 of the establishment of a special unit in
 the Home Ministry to monitor the enforcement of the Civil
 Rights Protections Act of 1955. This act requires large
 scale affirmative action programs in employment and educa-
 tion by the central and state governments and mandates special
 protection of the rights of Scheduled Caste and Tribal people.
 During 1980, Amnesty International wrote separately to Prime
 Minister Indira Gandhi and to the Chief Ministers of several
 states concerning allegations of prisoners dying in police
 custody. Amnesty International also has written to the
 Prime Minister about the preventive detention measures adop-
 ted in 1979 and 1980. The organization received a letter
 from Mrs. Gandhi reporting the freeing of a prisoner detained
 in Kerala for three years without trial. No request for a
 visit to India was made by Amnesty International in 1980 nor
 by other external non-governmental human rights groups.
 India is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic,
 Social and Cultural Rights, both ratified by parliament in
 April 1979.
