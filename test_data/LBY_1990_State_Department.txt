 LIBYA*
 The Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a
 dictatorship ruled by Colonel Mu'ammar Al-Qadhafi. He is
 aided by extragovernmental Revolutionary Committees which
 operate at his behest. The governing principles of the
 society are expressed in Col. Qadhafi's "Green Book" rather
 than in a constitution. He has created a political system
 borrowing from pan-Islamic and pan-Arab sources and purporting
 to establish a "third way" superior to both capitalism and
 communism. In the past, he has used assassination and
 intimidation as ways to control his enemies abroad; he
 controls enemies at home in a variety of summary and judicial
 proceedings which are employed wherever popular resistance
 exists. Ethnic minorities, such as Berbers, are tightly
 controlled.
 Libya maintains an extensive security apparatus, consisting of
 several elite military units, including Col. Qadhafi's
 personal bodyguards. The local Revolutionary Committees and
 People's Committees also have security functions, designed to
 protect as well as monitor the populace. The result is
 multilayered, pervasive surveillance and control of individual
 activities.
 Despite recent government efforts at privatization, the Libyan
 economy remains essentially state controlled and is based
 primarily on the country's rich oil resources, which are its
 principal source of foreign exchange earnings. Libya has used
 its oil income to finance internal development (new schools,
 hospitals, roads), but much has been wasted on excessive
 military spending. Foreign exchange controls remained tight
 in 1990. Libya's economy began to benefit in late 1990 from
 increased oil production and higher crude prices resulting
 from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
 There was no change in the overall human rights situation in
 1990, and major human rights restrictions remained in effect.
 Legal freedoms and rights are generally lacking. As a
 practical matter, there are na effective rights to peaceful
 association or assembly, to freedom of speech, to change the
 Government or to express opposing views to it in any form, to
 form trade unions, or to strike. The same is true of personal
 rights such as the right to presumption of innocence, to a
 public or speedy trial, to be secure in one's home or person,
 or even to hold property. Some of these rights are guaranteed
 in principle by the Government, but there is no evidence that
 they are respected iu practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There was a report of tribal fighting in Sebha in June in
 which army elements joined both sides along tribal lines. A
 number of persons reportedly died in the fighting.
 *Because the United States has no.embassy in Libya and because
 the regime strictly limits access to information, it is
 difficult to comment authoritatively on conditions in Libya.

 LIBYA
 A large number of offenses, including political offenses, are
 punishable by death under Libyan law. For example, Law No. 71
 of 1972 provides for the death penalty for anyone involved
 with any group activity based on any ideology opposed to the
 principles of the revolution (see also Section l.e.). Despite
 his publicly stated intentions, Col. Qadhafi has not acted to
 abolish the death penalty for this offense.
 There were no reliable reports of assassination attempts
 against Libyan exiles during 1990, as had been the case
 between 1980 and 1987.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance in 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In recent years, prisoners in Libya reportedly have been
 tortured during interrogations or for discipline. Means of
 torture reportedly include: chaining to a wall for hours,
 clubbing, electric shock, corkscrews in the back, putting
 lemon juice in open wounds, breaking fingers and allowing the
 joints to heal without medical care, suffocation using plastic
 bags, deprivation of food and water, and beatings on the soles
 of the feet. It is not known to what extent such abuses were
 committed in 1990.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Libyan law, detainees may be held incommunicado for
 unlimited periods. Many political prisoners are held by
 members of the Revolutionary Committees in unofficial
 detention centers where prolonged periods of incommunicado
 detention are common. Many detainees allegedly are held
 without charge or trial, apparently as an example to other
 would-be opponents of the regime. While undergoing
 interrogation, sometimes for periods of several months,
 prisoners are not given access to legal representation.
 Exile is not practiced; to the contrary, Col. Qadhafi seeks to
 pressure Libyans working or studying abroad to return to
 Libya. The regime does, however, expel noncitizens
 arbitrarily.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most civilians are tried in regular courts, but their cases
 may be referred to less formal "people's courts," or to
 military or revolutionary courts, depending on the arbitrary
 decision of the security forces. Security forces have the
 power to judge persons guilty without trial, particularly
 "traitors to the people." Most ordinary trials are held in
 public but, particularly in political cases, trials can be
 held in secret and even in the absence of the accused. The
 traditional courts have been bypassed at times by people's
 courts and revolutionary courts, which have conducted
 occasional "show trials" on television, followed by public
 executions. The executions at times have also been
 televised. Appeals of regular court decisions are allowed.
 A 1981 law prohibits the private practice of law and makes all
 attorneys employees of the Secretariat of Justice. In practice
 
 
 1535
 
 LIBYA
 a defendant can refuse his court-appointed lawyer and pay
 another of his own choosing. The Union of Arab Lawyers,
 located in France, has expressed concern about the inability
 and lack of freedom of attorneys to provide legal defense for
 political prisoners while serving as government employees.
 Libya claims that it "guarantees prisoners all necessary means
 of defense and safeguards of justice adequate to the
 principles contained in the [Universal] Declaration of Human
 Rights" and provides for legal assistance "as soon as possible
 with respect to the exigencies of interrogation."
 Nevertheless, there continue to be reports that these rights
 are frequently denied.
 Alleged political offenses in the past often have been tried
 before ad hoc revolutionary courts rather tnan by civilian
 courts, with the opportunities to engage defense counsel
 severely restricted. A number of these trials have been held
 in secret. The regime's announcement in 1988 of the abolition
 of all "extraordinary" courts, including those operated by the
 Revolutionary Committees, does not appear to have been
 implemented.
 Some of the political prisoners known to be held in Libya were
 released in March 1988, and Col. Qadhafi declared then that
 there were "less than 100" political detainees. Amnesty
 International (AI) estimates the number at about 400.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not respect the right to privacy. The
 legal requirement that judicial warrants must be obtained
 before entering a private home reportedly is often
 disregarded. Local and international telephone calls are
 routinely monitored. The government informant network is
 extensive, encouraged by both security agencies and
 Revolutionary Committees. Libyan exiles report that mere-
 family ties to suspected regime opponents can result in
 harassment or even persecution and detention by the
 authorities. Property can be seized and burned if it belongs
 to "enemies of the people" or those who "cooperate" with
 foreign powers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While some difference of opinion is tolerated in People's
 Committee-meetings and at the General People's Congress, for
 the most part freedom of speech is severely limited. This is
 especially true with regard to any criticism of Col. Qadhafi
 or his regime. Fear of being informed upon by elements of the
 Revolutionary Committees and an underlying climate of mistrust
 at all levels of society further inhibit freedom of speech.
 Libyan media are owned and controlled by the State. There is
 a state-run daily newspaper, with a circulation of 40,000.
 Several smaller newspapers are run by the Revolutionary
 Committees-and the Islamic Call Society. JANA, the official
 news agency, is the designated conduit for politically
 acceptable opinions. Publishing opinions contrary to
 government policy is not permitted. Some issues of foreign
 publications are available in Tripoli, and foreign radio
 broadcasts can be received.

 LIBYA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public assembly is repressed unless it is government
 controlled and supportive of regime positions. The right of
 association is limited and granted only to institutions
 affiliated with the regime. Organizations such as independent
 trade unions and professional associations are viewed as
 unnecessary, since Col. Qadhafi has vowed not to "accept
 intermediaries between the revolution and its working forces."
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. Some minority religions (e.g.'
 Christianity) still are allowed to conduct services, but
 Islamic groups at variance with the state-sanctioned version
 are banned. In an apparent effort to eliminate any
 alternative power bases, the regime has banned the once-
 powerful Sanusiyya Islamic religious sect.
 During 1990, Col Qadhafi stepped up his campaign against
 Islamic fundamentalists. In a number of speeches he denounced
 them as threats to the Government. On June 7 he likened them
 to the Mafia and called them a threat to Arab existence. At
 the same time, reports reached the West of increased arrests
 of fundamentalists, harassment of bearded males, and an
 increase in surveillance of mosques. As a result of this
 campaign, many fundamentalists left Libya in 1990.
 Services in Christian churches are attended by the foreign
 community. There is a resident Catholic bishop and a small
 number of priests. Nuns reportedly are permitted to wear
 religious habit.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 With the exception of security areas, internal movement is not
 usually restricted for Libyan citizens. Traditionally, exit
 permits have been required for travel abroad, and currency
 controls have also served to restrict travel. Restrictions on
 travel abroad were eased significantly in 1988, but new
 restrictions on currency imposed in late 1989 had the
 practical effect of again curbing travel. Women must have
 their husband's permission for them or their children to
 travel abroad.
 At times in 1990, border checks on the frontier with Tunisia
 were tightened and then relaxed again. Members of the
 Revolutionary Committees maintain surveillance of some Libyans
 while abroad. The right of return of Libyan nationals is
 theoretically fully protected even for opponents of Col.
 Qadhafi, so long as they are prepared "to repent." However,
 this "right" often appears to be more nearly an obligation;
 the regime often calls for students, many of whom are under
 government subsidy, and others working abroad to return on
 little or no notice and without regard to the impact on their
 studies or work.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of Libya have no right to change their government.
 Major government decisions are controlled by.Col. Qadhafi
 himself, a few key figures around him, or by committees acting
 in his name. He appoints military officers and official
 
 
 1537
 LIBYA
 functionaries down to junior levels. Power flows through a
 small circle of trusted associates. Corruption and tribalism
 in the administration have been major problems, adversely
 affecting the efficiency of government.
 Popular participation in government is theoretically
 vouchsafed by the grassroots People's Committees which send
 representatives annually to the national General People's
 Congress (GPC). In practice, the GPC is a rubberstamp
 assembly, approving all recommendations made by Col. Qadhafi.
 Participation in elections is mandatoxy, and all candidates
 are cleared by the Revolutionary Committees from among persons
 who are not "merchants, contractors, tribal advocates,
 election brokers, officials of the former (pre-1969)
 government, or people who have been attacked by the power of
 the revolution." Political parties and tribal or local
 groupings are prohibited.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regardingp International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no independent human rights organizations in Libya
 to monitor the Government's performance. The Libyan Arab
 Human Rights Committee, a government organization, was created
 in May 1989, reportedly to implement reforms announced in
 1988. In its 1990 Report, AI noted that it had received no
 substantive response to appeals on behalf of detainees and
 requests for information it had addressed to Libyan
 authorities.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are frequent allegations of discrimination based on
 tribAl status, with particular discrimination alleged against
 Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in the south. Col.
 Qadhafi has often complained about the continued power of
 tribal and other groups, but he also utilizes them for
 political action when he sponsors proregime demonstrations.
 In 1990 Col. Qadhafi admitted that he had trained Tuareg
 dissidents as part of his multinational "Islamic Legion."
 Some of these Tuaregs are believed to have participated in a
 1990 rebellion against the Governments of Mali and Niger. He
 declared that all Tuaregs were of Libyan Arab origin and
 invited them to settle in Libya. In past years. he sought
 unsuccessfully to assure that Berbers married only
 non-Berbers, presumably in an effort to- erode their tribal
 identity.
 The conservative cultural attitudes of Libya's Islamic society
 serve to restrict the rights of certain groups. most notably
 women. Within the confines of Islam, Col. Qadhafi has led
 efforts to change the status of women and expand their access
 to educational and employment opportunities. Women currently
 receive basic military training and, with some exceptions, are -
 subject to the military draft. As noted in Section 2.d.,
 women need their husband's permission to travel abroad.
 Female circumcision is still reportedly practiced among tribal
 groups in remote areas of the south. No information is
 available on the extent to which violence against women is a
 problem in Libya.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right to form or join unions of their
 own choosing. The official trade union organization, the
 General Federation of Producers' Trade Unions, which was
 created in 1972, is under government control and administered
 through the People's Committee system. Although unions are
 assured the right to "safeguard their interests," there is no
 right to strike, and no strikes by Libyan workers have been
 reported for years.
 With government financing, the official trade union
 organization plays a leading role in the International
 Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the Organization of
 African TradeUnion Unity and exploits international trade
 union contacts to engage in propaganda efforts on behalf of
 the Government. Libya is a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). It ratified ILO Convention 98 on the
 Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively in 1962 (under the
 previous regime), but it has not ratified Convention 87 on
 Freedom of Association.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although the Libyan-Labor Code provides for collective
 agreements, there is no collective bargaining in Libya.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Libya has ratified the two ILO Conventions prohibiting forced
 labor. However, the ILO's Committee of Experts, in its 1989
 Report, noted that "persons expressing certain political views
 or views ideologically opposed to the established political,
 social or economic system may be punished with penalties of
 imprisonment.. .involving... an obligation to perform labor."
 It also noted that public employees in Libya can be imprisoned
 and sentenced to compulsory labor "...as a punishment for
 breaches of labour discipline or for participation in strikes
 even in services whose interruption would not endanger the
 life, personal safety, or health of the whole or part of the
 population."
 d. Minimum Age for Employment-of Children
 The minimum.age for employment of children is 18. Education
 is compulsory to age 15..
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Libya maintains a work force of around 1 million workers in a
 population. of 3.7 million. The minimumwage rate is
 approximately $316 per month. The legal maximum workweek is
 48 hours. Libyan labor law defines the rights and duties of
 workers and such aspects as compensation, pension rights,
 minimum rest periods, and length of the workday. There is
 reportedly some government effort to inspect the workplace for
 health and safety. Certain industries, such as the petroleum
 sector, try to maintain health and safety standards originally
 set by foreign companies.
 Libyan labor law does not apply to the 300,00 foreign workers
 in Libya, who do much of the blue-collar and technical work.
 Their permission to stay in the country extends only for the
 
 
 1539
 LIBYA
 duration of the contracts under which they are employed.
 Foreign workers are subject to arbitrary pressures, such as
 changes in work rules and contracts, with little option but to
 accept or to depart the country, often without full
 compensation for work already performed. The conditions of
 their employment are subject to negotiation between the worker
 and the employer. Foreign workers who are not under contract
 enjoy no protection.
 In July 1990, following negotiations with Egypt, Libya
 acknowledged that it owed $6 million to Egyptian laborers
 expelled in 1984-85 and promised them compensation. To date
 there is no evidence that the compensation has been paid.
