 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic with an elected head of state (president), par-
 lament, and head of government (prime minister), and with an independent judici-
 a%'e security apparatus is effectively controlled by elected officials and supervised
 by the courts.
 Finland has a mixed economy, primarily and extensively market-based.
 During 1994 there were no reported violations of fundamental human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Mllling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported cases of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law provides for freedom from torture an  cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment or punishment, and the Government fully respects these provisions. By law,
 prisoners must be treated justly and with respect for their dignity, without distinc-
 tion on the basis of race, sex, language, nationality, religious or political conviction,
 social position, wealth, or any other unfair grounds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for freedom from arbi-
 trary arrest, and the Government fully respects this provision. Police may hold a
 suspect without charge for up to 7 days. From the start the suspect has access to
 a lawyer of his or her choosing; the State provides lawyers for indigent suspects.
 Once arrested, the accused must be given a court hearing within 8 days in a city
 
 
 808
 or 30 days in a rural area. Circumstances surrounding arrest are subject to judicial
 review at the time the accused is brought to trial. If found innocent, the accused
 may apply to the same court for civil damages, and the arrest is deemed invalid.
 Bail as such does not exist in Finland. While persons accused of serious crimes
 must by law remain in custody pending trial, those charged with minor offenses
 may be released on personal recognizance at the court's discretion. Preventive de-
 tention is authorized only during a declared state of war for narrowly defined of-
 fenses such as treason, mutiny, and arms trafficking. Supervisory personnel from
 the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior, as well as the Parliamen-
 tary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of Justice, have authority to enter prisons and
 to order the release of prisoners held without charges. In 1993 there were 248 pre-
 trial detainees held for an average of 2.1 months. The entire prison population
 amounted to 3,421.
 By law, Finnish citizens cannot be exiled, and the Government respects this provi-
 sion.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for the right to fair public trial,
 and the authorities fully respect this. The President appoints Supreme Court jus-
 tices, who in turn appoint the lower court judges. Judges are appointed for terms
 limited only by mandtory retirement at age 70. The judiciary is effectively insu-
 lated from political interference.
 Local courts may conduct a trial behind closed doors in juvenile, matrimonial, and
 guardianship cases, or when publicity would offend morality or endanger the secu-
 rity of the State. In national security cases, the judge may withhold from the public
 any or all information pertaining to chares, verdicts, and sentences. The law pro-
 vides for sanctions against violators of such restrictions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family. Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for the right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, and it specifically
 prohibits eavesdropping and mail tampering. The authorities fully respect these pro-
 visions. The law authorizes police to conduct wiretapping under certain conditions
 of suspected criminal activity. Senior police officials, rather than judges, have the
 authority to issue search warrants; there is no indication this power is abused. By
 law, the police are subject to judicial scrutiny.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, including the broadcast media. The Government does not hamper
 this freedom. A law that allows the Government to censor films for foreign-policy
 reasons is not implemented.
 The Government also does not interfere with academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and the authorities fully respect this.
 For public demonstrations, the organizers must give prior notification to the police,
 who routinely pose no objections.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government does not hamper the teaching or prac-
 tice of any faith. A special tax supports the two state churches, Lutheran and East-
 ern Orthodox, but nonmembers can obtain exemption.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel within and from the country, to emigrate,
 and to repatriate.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees, and there were no reports
 of forced expulsion of those having a a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Finland is a multiparty parliamentary democracy in which all citizens over the
 age of 18 may vote and balloting is secret.
 Parliamentary and municipal elections take place every 4 years. Under legislation
 passed in 1991, the nation's first direct popular election of a president was held in
 February 1994, and presidential elections are to be held every 6 years.
 Women are fairly well represented in government. There are 77 in the 200-mem-
 ber Parliament, and 5 in the 16-member Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several domestic and international organizations in Finland monitor human
 rights matters, and the Government does not hinder their investigations.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits any discrimination based on race sex, religion, lan-
 guage, or social status, and the Government effectivel enforces these provisions.
 Women.-The government-established Council for Equality coordinates and spon-
 sors legislation to meet the needs of women as workers, mothers, widows, or retir-
 ees.
 The 1985 legislation on equal treatment for women in the workplace has not been
 fully implemented. Women earn about 80 percent of men's pay in comparable jobs,
 and   they  are  concentrated  in  lower-paying  occupations  while they   are
 underrepresented in top management positions. Women are not permitted to serve
 in the military.
 The Government's Equality Ombudsman monitors compliance with regulations
 against sexual discrimination. In 1994, 168 complaints of illegal discrimination
 against women were submitted to the Ombudsman, of which 38 were found valid.
 Redress for violation of equality laws includes mandated hiring and promotions, as
 well as other direct compensation to victims. Violators are subject to dismissal and
 fines.
 The law provides stringent penalties for violence against women, and the authori-
 ties enforce these provisions. The Union of Shelter Homes and various municipali-
 ties maintain in all a total of 55 government-subsidized shelters for battered per-
 sons.
 Each year, an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 calls to the police relate to domestic vio-
 lence; officials believe this is only about half the number of actual incidents. Studies
 show that most violence against women is perpetrated by family members. The lat-
 est statistics on rape are from 1991, when there were 60 convictions, of which 43
 were punished by unconditional prison sentences, averaging 19  months. Experts
 believe that rape, too, is underreported. Legislation which took effect on June 1
 treats spousal rape the same as nonspousal rape.
 Children.-The national consensus supporting children's rights is enshrined in
 law which provides extensive protection for them.
 gational/RaciallEthnic Minritie&-The law protects the customs and language
 of the Sanis (Lapps), who constitute under one-tenth of 1 percent of the population.
 The Government subsidizes Sami language teaching and traditions (mainly relating
 to reindeer herding). Samis have the same political and civil rights as other citizens,
 and participate in decisions affecting their interests.
 There have been isolated cases of violence against ethnic minorities, mainly as-
 saults by inebriated youngsters. The violations have been treated as common
 crimes, without regard to the question of whether they involved discrimination
 based on the victims nationality. Government educational programs seek to improve
 attitudes towards ethnic minorities.
 People With Disabilities.-Although since the 1970's the law has required that
 new public buildings be accessible to people with physical disabilities, many older
 buildings remain inaccessible to them. There is no such law for public transpor-
 tation, but each state subsidizes measures to improve accessibility to vehicles. Local
 governments maintain a free transport service that guarantees 18 free trips per
 month for a disabled person. The deaf and the mute are provided interpretation
 services ranging from 120 to 240 hours annually. The Government provides sub-
 sidied public housing to the severely disabled
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the rights of trade
 unions to organize, assemble peacefully and strike, and the Government respects
 these provisions. About 87 percent of te work force is organized. All unions are
 independent of the Government and political parties. The law grants public-sector
 employees the right to strike, with some exceptions for provision of essential serv-
 ices. In the first quarter of 1994 there were 26 strikes, of which all but 1 were wild-
 cat strikes.
 Trade unions freely affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivey.-The law provides for the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Collective bargaining agreements are usually
 based on incomes policy agreements between employees' and employers' central or-
 ganizations and the Government. Increasingly, however, collective bargaining agree-
 ments are being negotiated at sectoral levels instead. The law protects workers
 against antiunion discrimination. Complaint resolution is governed by collective bar-
 gaining agreements as well as labor law, both of which are adequately enforced.
 There are no export processing zones in Finland.

 c. Prohibition of Forced Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced or
 compulsory labor, and such practices do not occur in Finland.
 d. Minimum Age for Empoyment of Children.-Youths under 16 years of age can-
 not work more than 6 hours a day, or at night, and education is compulsory for chil-
 dren from age 7 to 16 years. The Labor Ministry enforces child labor regulations.
 There are virtually no complaints of exploitation of children in the work force.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated minimum wage, but the
 law requires all employers-including nonunionized ones--to meet the minimum
 wages agreed to in collective bargaining agreements in the respective industrial sec-
 tor. These minimum wages generally afford a decent standard of living for workers
 and their families.
 The legal workweek consists of 5 days not exceeding 40 hours. Employees working
 in shifts or during the weekend are entitled to a 24-hour rest period during the
 week. The law is effectively enforced as a minimum, and many workers enjoy even
 stronger benefits through effectively enforced collective bargaining agreements.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards, and the Labor
 Ministry effectively enforces them. Workers can refuse dangerous work situations,
 without risk of penalty.
