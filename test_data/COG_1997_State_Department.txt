 REPUBLIC OF CONGO
 The Republic of Congo's transition to democratic government ended in October,
 when the country's first democratically elected president, Pascal Lissouba was
 ousted by the former (1979-91) military strongman and president Denis Sassou-
 Nguesso. Lissouba was elected in 1992 after 28 years of one-party rule, and elec-
 tions for a multiparty legislature were held in 1993. However, on June 5 violent
 clashes broke out when government troops surrounded Sassou-Nguesso's Brazzaville
 home, in what appeared to be an attempt to eliminate his political faction. The Gov-
 ernment claimed that the action was a police operation aimed at arresting criminal
 suspects. The violence evolved into a civil war in the capital. There were also clash-
 es in the north, including the cities of Impfondo, Ouesso, Owando, and, briefly at
 the end of the war, in Pointe Noire. The fighting resulted in the postponement of
 the presidential elections scheduled for July and August. The newly established
 Constitutional Council decreed that President Lissouba should remain in office be-
 yond the expiration of his term and until elections could be held, but Sassou-
 Nguesso rejected the extension of Lissouba's term. In October Sassou-Nguesso forces
 defeated government and militia troops loyal to President Lissouba, and established
 a new Government. Shortly thereafter, the Sassou Government suspended the con-
 stitution. Several hundred Angolan troops intervened to assist Bassou-Nguesso
 forces in Brazzaville; more Angolan troops entered the country from the south and
 occupied the port city of Pointe Noire. Angolan troops also participated in operations
 in the south,-between Pointe Noire and Brazaville. Sassou-Nguesso announced the
 formation of a Government with 33 members, with Sassou as President and Defense
 Minister. There is no Prime Minister. The judiciary is overburdened, underfinanced,
 and at times subject to corruption and government interference.
 The distinction between the functions of the police and the military forces is not
 clearly drawn. The national police and gendarmerie have primary responsibility for
 internal security. The army and border guard are responsible for external security
 and some domestic security matters. In addition each of the major political leaders
 had aprivate militia. During the fighting in Brazzaville, there was no civilian con-
 trol of these militias. Under other circumstances, civilian authorities generally
 maintained effective control of the security forces. However, some members of the
 security forces committed human rights abuses even before the outbreak of civil
 war. During and after the fighting, the regular military forces, and especially the
 militias, were responsible for many human rights abuses.
 In the first half of the year, the Government continued to make modest progress
 in economic liberalization and privatization. The economy is heavily dependent on
 revenues from petroleum exports and on external assistance. Per capita Gross Do-
 mestic Product was estimated at $600 per year for 1996. Economic activity in the
 capital, however, was severely disrupted by the fighting. The civil war did not sig-
 nificantly affect the oil industry, which operates offshore.
 Prior to the outbreak of the civil war, the Government's human rights record was
 uneven, with improvements in some areas but deterioration in others. Security
 forces committed killings and continued to use severe beatings and abuse to extract
 confessions and as punishment. Security forces arbitrarily arrested and detained
 persons. During the fighting, government forces killed individuals because of their
 ethnicity and also beat and detained individuals for that reason. Government troops
 also persecuted foreigners. Prison conditions remain life threatening. Lengthy pre-
 trial detention is a problem. The judiciary is overburdened, lacks resources, suffers
 from corruption, and is subject to political influence. Societal discrimination and vio-
 lence against women are serious problems. Minority Pygmies face severe discrimina-
 tion and exploitation. Citizens sometimes resort to vigilante justice, killing those
 presumed to be thieves and "sorcerers."
 Once the civil war began, government soldiers and the militias that supported
 them, as well as the opposition militias against which they fought, engaged in wide-
 spread extortion and harassment of civilians. Opposition militias killed, beat, and
 detained. persons because of their ethnicity. Both sides, particularly the Govern-
 ment, targeted densely populated areas with heavy shells and rockets. Soldiers and
 militias engaged in heavy looting throughout the capital, causing 'reat property
 damage. As a result of the violence, thousands of persons, most of them civilians,
 were killed in Brazzaville, and hundreds of thousands were displaced.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were many confirmed killings
 by police during the year. At one point, the Brazzaville morgue held 15 bodies of
 
 
 79
 alleged criminals killed by police after the Minister of Security announced a crack-
 down on crime. Several of those killed had allegedly attempted to escape following
 their arrests. Police used excessive force and endangered the lives of bystanders in
 shooting a street merchant who sought to evade arrest or extortion by police in front
 of a diplomatic mission; the merchant later died. In February near the city of
 Ouesso, police used excessive force when they shot and killed a British citizen.
 There were reports of political and ethnic killings by overnment forces during the
 fighting in Brazzaville; exact figures are unavailable. Sme prisoners probably died
 as result of harsh conditions in prison facilities (see Section 1.c.).
 Both Lissouba and Sassou militias killed persons for political reasons during the
 fighting, as well as because of their ethnicity. After the war, the victorious Sassou
 Government's militias continued to apprehend and kill many of its political oppo-
 nents. The militia also killed suspected criminals and persons attempting to prevent
 looting by militia members.
 During the fighting, troops from both sides illegally entered, searched, and looted
 homes, in some cases killing the residents, in other cases causing them to flee (see
 Section l.f.).
 Civilians continued to take vigilante action against presumed thieves and "sorcer-
 ers," sometimes beating them to death. The perpetrators are generally not pros-
 ecuted.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 before the outbreak of fighting. After the fighting, there were reports that militias
 of both sides were responsible for politically and ethnically motivated disappear-
 ances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The suspended constitution prohibited the use of torture and cruel, inhuman, or de-
 grading treatment. In practice some security force members routinely beat detainees
 both to extract confessions and as punishment. Security force members generally
 acted with impunity. They intimidated and beat refugees in the Brazzaville area
 (see Section 2.d.). During the fighting in the capital, security forces beat citizens be-
 cause of their ethnicity.
 Opposition militia also beat persons because of their ethnicity.
 Prison conditions are dire and life threatening. The death rate and the incidence
 of disease and malnutrition are considerably higher than among the general popu-
 lation, and are probably attributable to the poor prison conditions. Buildings are di-
 lapidated and reportedly severely overcrowded. Medical care is poor to nonexistent.
 Prisoners depend upon family members to supplement inadequate prison meals, and
 are sometimes allowed to forage for food in areas near the prison. Rape and sexual
 abuse of women and children by prison guards are infrequent. Political or special
 security prisoners are held separately from the general prison population. However,
 their living conditions do not differ significantly.
 Human rights groups sometimes encounter difficulty in gaining access to prisons.
 There was no progress in the prison improvement program.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The suspended constitution prohibited
 arbitrary arrest and detention; however, security forces continued to arrest and de-
 tain persons arbitrarily. The Code of Penal Procedure requires that an individual
 be apprehended openly and that a lawyer be present during initial questioning. The
 Code further stipulates that warrants be issued before arrests are made and that
 detainees be brought before a judge within 3 days and either charged or released
 within 4 months. In practice the Government often violates these legal procedures.
 Detainees are usually informed of the charges levied against them; however,
 many wait in prison for several months before being brought before a judge. There
 are examples of detainees languishing in jail for years because of lost files and bu-
 reaucratic inertia. Lawyers and families generally have free access to detainees. Al-
 though the law provides a system of bail, the average detainee lacks the financial
 means to meet bail. Over half of all persons in custody are pretrial detainees. The
 Government often does not respect laws that provide for legal counsel for the indi-
 gent.
 During the fighting in the capital, militias on both sides detained many persons
 because of their ethnicity, and held them in deplorable conditions.
 The suspended constitution prohibited forced exile, and the Government does not
 use it.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The suspended constitution provided for an inde-
 pendent judiciary. However, the judiciary, not operational at the end of the war, was
 overburdened, underfinanced, and at times subject to corruption and political influ-
 ence.
 
 
 The judicial system consists of local courts, courts of appeal, the Supreme Court,
 and traditional courts. After his military victory, Sassou replaced all the members
 of the Supreme Court with judges unilaterally appointed by him.
 In general defendants are tried in a public court of law presided over by a state-
 appointed magistrate. The defense has access to and the right to counter prosecu-
 tion evidence and testimony. In formal courts, defendants are presumed innocent
 and have the right of appeal. The judiciary is overburdened with a caseload that
 far exceeds its capacity to ensure fair and timely public trials. Some cases never
 reach the court system, however. Judges are often inadequately trained, and the ju-
 dicial system suffers from inadequate budgets and corruption. It remains common
 practice for citizens to beat thieves caught in the act, sometimes to death (see Sec-
 tion L.a.). In rural areas, traditional courts continue to handle many local disputes,
 especially property and probate cases. Many domestic disputes are adjudicated
 under traditional law and within the extended family.
 The Supreme Court overturned the prison sentences of Colonel Bouissa Matoko
 and Professor Gabriel Longombe during the year and released them.
 The Government released Otto Mbongo, who was arrested for debts in connection
 with a bankrupt bank and allowed him to travel abroad for medical care. He has
 not returned, although the charges remain in force.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 suspended constitution provided for the privacy of homes as well as correspondence
 and telecommunications. Official searches of private properties and communications
 require a warrant, although that requirement is sometimes breached. There is gov-
 ernment surveillance of some telephone lines.
 During the fighting, troops from beth sides illegally entered, searched, and looted
 homes, in some cases killing the residents, in other cases causing them to flee (see
 Section 1.a.).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-The fighting that broke out in June was fundamentally an ethnic conflict be-
 tween northerners loyal to Sassou-Nguesso and southerners loyal to Lissouba. Dur-
 ing the fighting in Brazzaville, Lissouba's government forces and Sassou-Nguesso's
 opposition militias engaged in indiscriminate shelling of populated sections, result-
 ing in the deaths of thousands of persons. Both sides killed and beat members of
 different ethnic groups; captured combatants were frequently summarily executed.
 Following Sassou-Nguesso's seizure of power, his Cobra militia conducted house-to-
 house searches in the capital for members of the defeated government security
 forces, private militias, and Lissouba's political followers, killing dozens. The Cobras
 also engaged in large-scale looting after their victory.
 During the war, Lissouba forces repeatedly used helicopters piloted by foreign
 mercenaries to bomb areas controlled by Cobras, resulting in the deaths of many
 civilians as well as combatants. Near the end of the war, an Angolan MiG aircraft
 bombed Brazzaville, resulting in the deaths of an unknown number of civilians.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The suspended constitution provided for free-
 dom of expression and in practice individual freedom of expression is enjoyed. It also
 mandated an independent council to oversee private and electronic media and to
 safeguard speech and press freedoms. It was established during the year, but has
 not been very active.
 The Government retained its monopoly power over radio and television until
 June. At that time, rebel forces launched their own radio and television stations.
 After Sassou's ouster of Lissouba, the rebel radio station continued to operate, os-
 tensibly as a private station. The government radio station operated as the new gov-
 ernment's official station. The Government's television stations had not resumed op-
 erations at year's end.
 Journalists employed in the state-owned radio and television enterprises often
 practice self-censorship. Despite thb potentially restrictive 1996 Press Law, journal-
 ists working for opposition newspapers sharply criticize the Government prior to
 Lissouba's ouster. After the war, some newspapers resumed publication.
 There are no known abridgments of academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The suspended constitution
 provides for freedom of assembly; however, groups that wished to hold a public as-
 sembly were required to inform the Minister of Interior, who could withhold author-
 ization for meetings that threatened public order. There are no restrictions on trade
 associations or professional bodies, and affiliation with international bodies is per-
 mitted.
 
 
 The suspended constitution provided for freedom of association, and the former
 Government respected this Tight in practice. At year's end, the rights of assembly
 and association remained restricted, with the Government still engaged in disarm-
 ing local militias. Only late in the year did citizens circulate in the capital.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The suspended constitution provided for freedom of reli-
 gion, and the Government respected this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The suspended constitution provided for the right of all citizens to trav-
 el freely within the ounts', and it specifically prohibited roadblocks and barriers.
 The National Conference Charter of Rights provides all citizens the right to travel
 abroad and return. Nonetheless, military forces, political militias, and opportunists
 sometimes hindered free movement wit barricades, generally demanding money.
 Motorists refusing to give money were frequently detained for several hours or
 turned back.
 Refugees in Brazzaville continue to encounter harassment. Security forces some-
 times-subject beat, intimidated, or arbitrarily arrested them. The Government has
 not formulated a policy regarding first asylum. It requires refugees and asylum
 seekers to secure a pledge of financial support before it will process their claims.
 By year's end, the Government had not made a decision regarding asylum for refu-
 gees fleeing the former Democratic Republic of the Congo; some refugees were repa-
 triated within weeks of their arrival.
 There have been no reports -of human rights violations against Cabindan- refugees
 in the port of Pointe Noire.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights:. The Right of Citizens to Change'Their Govern-
 ment
 The constitution, -which. provided for popular election, of the President and Na-
 tional Assembly, was suspended by -the Sassou Government shortly after it took
 power. Citizens were not permitted -to change their government peacefully as presi-
 dentiaF elections were postponed after former President Sassou-Nguesso seized
 power by force.
 President Lissouba ;was elected in 1992. Legislative elections followed in 1993,
 and the first round of presidential elections were scheduled for July 27, but were
 postponed- indefinitely. -Byyear's .end, the Sassou Government had not announced
 'a date. for. new elections. It stated that the timing of;elections would be discussed
 in early 1998.
 The- suspended constitution divided power between the President and a govern-
 ment headed by a Prime Minister and formed with the approval of the National As-
 sembly. The new Government does not have a Prime Minister. The suspended con-
 stitution provided for 5-year terms of office for the President and National Assembly
 deputies, all elected by universal suffrage, and 6-year terms for senators, who are
 chosen by local councils. The President could dissolve the National Assembly and
 call for new elections before the end of the 5-year term. International monitors ob-
 served the last several rounds of the 1993 legislative elections and found them to
 be free and fair.
 - At year's end, the Senate and National Assembly were not functioning. The Gov-
 ernment-stated that it will replace them by a National Council for the Transition,
 the-members of which are to be "elected" during a National Forum in early 1998.
 There are no legal restrictions on representation by women or minority popu-
 lations. However, women are underrepresented in government and politics. In the
 former Lissouba government, women held 4 of the 185 seats in the Senate and the
 National Assembly. Women occupy 3 of 33 cabinet positions in the Lissouba Govern-
 ment. Indigenous Pygmies are excluded from the political process (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operated with minimal government restric-
 tion, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights problems. Govern-
 ment officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views, although non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's) sometimes encounter difficulties in making
 prison visits.
 There were no reported visits by international human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The suspended constitution specifically prohibited such discrimination, but it per-
 sists in fact,particularly against women and Pygmies.
 Women.-Domestic violence, including rape and beatings, is widespread but rarely
 reported. The problem is handled within the extended family and only in the most
 
 
 extreme instances is the matter brought to the police. There are no provisions under
 the law for spousal battery. There are no crisis centers or hotlines. The problem of
 violence against women is largely ignored by the general population and the media.
 During the civil war and its atermath, there were reports of numerous rapes car-
 ried out by both sides. There were also credible reports of rapes by Angolan troops.
 The suspended constitution provided for the equality of all citizens, prohibited dis-
 crimination based on sex, and endorsed the right of women to earn equal pay for
 equal work. In practice, however, women in the formal sector are underrepresented
 and encounter discriminatory promotion patterns. Most women work in the informal
 sector and thus have little or no access to credit. Women in rural areas are espe-
 cially disadvantaged in terms of education and wage employment, and are confined
 largely to family farm work, petty commerce, and childrearing responsibilities.
 Marriage and family laws overtly discriminate against women. For example, adul-
 tery is Zilega for women but not for men. Polygyny is legal; polyandry is not. While
 the Legal Code provides that 30 percent of the husband's estate goes to the wife,
 in practice the wife often loses all rights of inheritance. The symbolic nature of the
 brideprice set in the Family Code is often not respected, and men are forced to pay
 excessive amounts to the woman's family. As a result, the right to divorce is cir-
 cumscribed for some women because they lack the financial means to reimburse the
 brideprice to the husband and his family. This problem is more prevalent in rural
 areas than in urban centers.
 There are approximately 10 NGO's that work on women's issues. Their effective-
 ness varies widely, however, and none is physically located in rural areas. The Min-
 istry for the Integration of Women into Development is actively working with a
 number of NGO's to reform certain legal codes and to educate women regarding
 their rights.
 Children.-aThe suspended onstitution required the Government to protect chil-
 dren in accordance with international conventions. Child labor is illegal, and edu-
 cation is compulsory until the age of 16. In practice limited state resources hinder
 achievement of these objectives, particularly in rural areas.
 People With Disabiities.-The suspended constitution provided for specific meas-
 ures to protect the needs of the disabled. This prvision meant very little in practice
 as the ministry charged with the welfare of the disabled faces severe financial con-
 straints. There is no overt discrimination against the disabled in employment and
 education. There are no laws mandating access for people with disabilities.
 Indigenous People.-The suspended constitution provided the same rights for Pyg-
 mies, an ethnic minority, numbering in the tens of thousands, living primarily in
 the northern forest regions, as it did for other citizens. In practice Pygmies do not
 enjoy equal treatment in the predominately Bantu society. Pygmies are severely
 marginalized in the areas of employment, health, and education. They are usually
 considered social inferiors, have no political voice, and are completely outside the
 political process. Many have never heard of the concept of voting and have no ability
 to influence government decisions affecting their interests.
 Many Pygmies have a Bantu patron to whom they are obligated in perpetuity.
 Pygmies are inherited by their patron's eldest son, an arrangement rootedin the
 ancestral tradition of Pygmy slavery.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assciation.-The Labor Code affirms the right to associate freely
 and prohibits restrictions on the formation of trade unions. Most workers in the for-
 mal (wage) sector are union members, and unions have made efforts to organize in-
 formal sectors such as agriculture and retail trade. The suspended constitution pro-
 hibited members of the security forces from forming unions or striking. There are
 sin independent trade unions recognized by the Government, although not all are
 active.
 Unions are free to strike after filing a letter of intent with the Ministry of Labor,
 thereby starting a process of nonbinding arbitration under the auspices of a regional
 labor inspector from the Labor Ministry. The letter of intent must include the strike
 date, at which time the strike legally may begin, even if arbitration is not complete.
 Employers havee aright to fire workers if they do not give advance notice of a
 strie.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade unions, and they maintain co-
 operative accords with other African, European, and American trade union organiza-
 tions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colleetiesy.-cThe Labor Code allows for
 collective bargaining and this provision is freely practiced. The Government sets in-
 dustry-specific minimum wage scales, but unions are usually able to negotiate high-
 er wages for their members. Employers are prohibited from discriming against
 
 
 employees who join a union. There were no reported firings for union activities. By
 year's end, unions had not resumed functioning after the Sassou-Nguesso seizure of
 power.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition on Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including that performed by children, but such practices reportedly
 occur. There are allegations that Pygmies, possibly including children, experience
 exploitation by Bantu s (see Section 5). Upon the death of their patron, Pygmies are
 inherited by his eldest son, an arrangement rooted in the ancestral tradition of
 Pygtatus o7hild Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The sus-
 pended constitution prohibited forced and bonded labor by children under the age
 of 16. However, there were allegations of exploitation of Pygmy children (see Sec-
 tions r and 6.c.)..The Ministry of Labor, which is responsible for enforcing child
 labor laws, concentrates its efforts only on the formal wage sector. Children con-
 tinue to work in rural areas and in the informal sector in cities without government
 intervention.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The suspended constitution provided for rea-
 sonable pay, paid holidays, periodic paid vacation, and legal limits on allowable
 hours of work. The Labor Code stipulates that overtime must be paid for all work
 in excess of 40 hours per week, and that regular days of leisure must be granted
 by employers. However, the minimum wage is not adequate to provide a worker and
 family with a decent standard of living. High urban prices and dependent extended
 families oblige many workers to seek opportunities beyond their principal employ-
 ment. Although health and safety regulations call for twice-yearly visits by ins c-
 tors from the Ministry, of Labor, in practice such visits occur less regularly. While
 unions are generally vigilant in calling attention to dangerous working conditions,
 the observance of safety standards is often lax. Workers have no specific right to
 remove themselves from dangerous working conditions.
