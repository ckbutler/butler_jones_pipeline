 MALAWI
 The Government of Malawi is a one-man autocracy in which Life
 President Bastings Kamuzu Banda has held virtually unchallenged
 power, based on a philosophy combining nationalism and tradition-
 alism, since independence in 1964. The President has maintained
 nearly undisputed control over political life and government
 and heads the sole political party, the Malawi Congress Party.
 Opposition to the Government is banned, and challenges to the
 system are suppressed. Total loyalty, not merely passive
 acceptance of party and government policy, is demanded under
 penalty of suspicion, if not detention by the authorities.
 Civil liberties exist at the sufferance of the authorities
 and are highly circumscribed. Political activity is limited
 to participation in the sole leal party and conforming with
 its views and practices. The party's women's and youth branches
 assist in funneling grassroots interest and concerns to the
 leadership and act as a conduit for implementation of decisions
 taken by the leadership. Participation is mandatory for those
 aspiring to positions of political, governmental, or even
 economic-social leadership and is circumscribed by and subordi-
 nated to the prevailing political, economic, and social philo-
 sophy of the Life President. The Government emphasizes economic
 development which, it maintains, can be accomplished only in an
 atmosphere of "peace and calm, law and order.' Strict limi-
 tations on human rights exist--and there are at times severe
 violations but they are not particularly harsh in their impact on
 the population at large. There are an estimated 50 political
 prisoners. Relative freedom of association exists in other than
 the political sphere.
 At independence in 1964, Malawi had a per capita gross national
 product (GNP) of about $100. Prom that time until the end
 of the 1970's, GNP grew at real rate of about seven percent
 annually, resulting in a 1983 per capita GNP of $230. The
 Government's priority has been the economic development of the
 land and its six and one-half million people.
 Malawi inherited a parliamentary form of government from
 Great Britain. OElections' are held every five years but all
 candidates must be members of the Malawi Congress Party and
 hold views consistent with the prevailing political philosophy
 of the President, whom the party proclaimed Life President in
 1970. Constitutional amendments and laws passed by the 101-member
 parliament, in effect, reflect decisions already taken by the
 President.
 Military, police, and party security apparatuses form a pervasive
 network throughout the land, assure the security of government,
 and are largely responsible for the human rights violations which
 do occur.
 Malawi pursues a basically market-oriented philosophy, with
 substantial government involvement in the form of interventions
 through government-controlled enterprises. Individuals are rela-
 tively free to operate private businesses, hold property, and
 travel. The low level of economic development has resulted in
 de facto restraints on economic opportunities for most citizens.

 This year was not particularly good for the advancement of
 human rights in Malawi. The trial and sentencing by a
 traditional court of captured Malawian dissident leader
 Orton Chirwa and his wife, and the continued detention of
 their son without charges, generated considerable concern
 abroad. Earlier, four former cabinet ministers perished
 under dubious circumstances.
 In 1983, there also were credible reports of ill-treatment of
 detainees in prisons and the alleged detention and torture
 of "dissidents."
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The deaths of four former cabinet ministers, ostensibly in
 a car accident, is widely believed to have been politically
 inspired by unknown person(s)/authorities. There have been
 no other allegations of politically-motivated killings
 within the country during 1983. Many attribute the murder
 in neighboring Zimbabwe of Attati Mpakati, a dissicent group
 leader strongly opposed to the rule of President Banda, to
 Malawian security forces under instruction from the highest
 authorities.
 b. Disappearance
 Surreptitious detentions by the police, acting at the behest of
 the party, are not unknown. Such disappearances usually are of
 relatively short duration (i.e., a few weeks--several months) and
 are carried out in the name of either national security or
 party discipline. There are no known instances where such
 detentions have led to death.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is not officially condoned but nonetheless is practiced
 by both party and police officials. It generally takes the form
 of beatings out of public view by police at the time of detention
 or arrest, or during interrogation. Incidents are not publicized
 but are widely known and even expected by many citizens.
 Persons convicted of violations of the law are sentenced to
 prison terms of varying lengths or are executed for capital
 offenses by hanging. An unknown number of political prisoners
 is said to be under a loose form of detention such as house
 arrest. Less severe and dangerous offenders frequently are
 sent to prison farms. Prison terms with hard labor are the
 norm for common criminals, with political detainees normally
 receiving less harsh or degrading treatment. Prison conditions
 are generally poor.
 
 
 219
 There have been credible reports of inhumane treatment in
 maximum security facilities of prisoners considered to be
 incorrigible criminals. These conditions reportedly include
 severely reduced food rations, lack of medical care, absence
 of sanitary facilities, and extended periods of confinement
 in shackles. Such treatment has caused general deterioration
 of the prisoners' health and, it is believed, some deaths.
 Whether such treatment results from official government
 policy, the will of police/prison officials in general, or
 of individual prison authorities, is unclear.
 There exists in Malawi another form of punishment that may
 be considered cruel and certainly unusual, namely, forfeiture.
 The Forfeiture Act permits the Government to revoke the
 property rights of those suspected of economic crimes
 without recourse to appeal. It is an executive fiat with no
 judicial review. When the Forfeiture Act is invoked, the
 individual loses all his wordly possessions, including
 business, financial holdings, and personal possessions.
 Often meted out to Asian businessmen, invocation of the act
 against an individual does not extend, however, to the
 family.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 At any given time there may be numerous detainees held with-
 out charge, who have been arrested arbitrarily for real or
 perceived offenses against the party or Government. A Malawi
 resident (including Africans and those of Asian extraction)
 may be "picked up' almost at the whim of the authorities,
 "put in" for varying lengths of time, beaten, and usually
 released after several weeks or months. The usual cause for
 such treatment is suspected disloyalty to the Life President
 or expression of views which differ even slightly from the
 accepted norm. Rarely are those so detained charged
 officially and brought before either traditional or modern
 courts. A suspect, however, may be held without charge for
 a long period of time while authorities develop a case. It
 is impossible to estimate the number of arbitrary detentions
 and arrests made in Malawi in 1983; the Government does not
 admit to such activities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Those charged with criminal offenses are tried in either the tra-
 ditional or modern court system, depending on the nature of the
 charge. Lawyers are usually not permitted to assist the defendant
 in traditional court cases, but legal counsel is permitted in the
 modern court system. In the latter case, the defendant has the
 right of access to the counsel before and during the judicial
 proceeding. Government and party exert little control over the
 trial system in cases tried before the High Court or magistrate
 courts; hence, the modern judiciary is almost totally independent
 of the executive branch, other than the fact that the President
 appoints the Chief Justice of the High Court who, in turn,
 appoints other modern court justices. These courts are open
 to the public, and defendants are charged publicly. There is
 little concrete evidence with respect to Government/party
 control over traditional court proceedings. Traditional court
 "justices" are appointed directly by the President; consequently,
 there is more room for potential or actual executive influence.
 
 
 220
 It is generally believed that there is little executive inter-
 ference in traditional court cases dealing in matters of
 customary law, and there is no evidence of indirect executive
 pressure on traditional courts adjudicating cases of a political
 nature. Although the decision is that of the Director of Public
 Prosecution or the Attorney General, the recent trend indicates
 that political cases are likely to be tried before a traditional
 court. There is a right to appeal in both the modern and
 traditional court systems, although in the latter case, the right
 of appeal presumably exists at the sufferance of the political
 authorities. Alleged violations of the military codes of justice
 are tried in military courts.
 Former Malawi Minister of Justice and captured leader of the
 banned Malawi Freedom Movement, Orton Chirwa, and his wife
 Vera were tried and found guilty of treason (conspiracy to
 overthrow the Malawi Government) by a traditional court. They
 appealed the May 6 verdict, which carries a mandatory death
 sentence; the National Traditional Appeal Court has yet to
 render its decision. The case has generated considerable
 attention in the United States and other countries, with many
 charging that the Chirwas have not received a fair trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In the routine conduct of his private life, the average citizen
 or alien resident is not unduly affected by government authority.
 Malawi law calls for the issuance of individual warrants before
 entry of the home, but this is not always observed in practice.
 Police and paramilitary groups enter houses of real or imagined
 suspects at will under special entry authority to conduct
 searches for people or incriminating evidence. Other violations
 of the home generally do not occur. Membership in the only
 political party is not mandatory, but is expected of those who
 aspire to government/party positions or even professional
 success. Access to government services, and even to some non-
 government services, such as a local market, is frequently based
 upon party membership.
 There is both official and self-censorship. Correspondence is
 monitored (mail is opened and read) by the authorities and those
 violating prescribed norms are punished.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Criticism of the Government and its policies is not tolerated.
 This proscription extends even to the parliament, where the
 expression of total loyalty to the President and his Government
 is both expected and enforced under threat of expulsion or worse.
 In the last parliament, several former ministers who vociferously
 had supported a committee report which criticized ranking civil
 servants for various alleged abuses of their office met with
 death under dubious circumstances.
 
 
 221
 All media are under direct or indirect government control. The
 two newspapers and sole radio station disseminate news directly
 authorized by the Government information agency and operate under
 informal self-censorship guidelines. Recently both media have
 exhibited increasing candor in coverage of international issues.
 In practice, the principal focus of government censorship is on
 material deemed critical of the Government. Freedom of inquiry
 into the natural and social sciences exists at the university
 level, and includes examination of political ideologies at
 radical variance with those of the Government, provided this
 does not extend to explicit criticism.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals and organizations generally are free to meet and
 associate as long as the purpose is not to protest against
 government or party policy or practices. Professional,
 fraternal, and service organizations exist and are encouraged
 by the Government. No political meetings are permitted other
 than those of the party. Labor unions exist, but their
 activities are highly circumscribed and they are generally
 ineffective. Strikes are not legally prohibited but rarely
 occur, and when they do they are not publicized. Labor
 unions are under the Malawi Trade Union Congress which, in
 in turn, is subject to direction by the Ministry of Labor.
 The Congress is thus a mass organization largely controlled
 by the Government. With government permission and supervision,
 the trade union organization is permitted to associate with
 international organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is freedom of religion in Malawi as long as particular
 religious tenets do not preclude recognition of the temporal
 authority of the state. There is no state or preferred
 religion, and conversion from one religion to another is per-
 mitted. There are no restrictions on religious observances
 and ceremonies which do not impinge on government authority.
 Religious groups may establish places of worship and train
 clergy. There is no licensing of religious groups, but their
 publications, like all others, are subject to government censor-
 ship. Religious groups are free to establish and maintain links
 with co-religionists in other countries, and religious travel
 may be undertaken. Similarly, missionaries from abroad are
 permitted to enter Malawi and proselytize. There is no tie
 between a particular religion and the Malawi Congress Party.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Few restrictions have been observed on movement within Malawi, but
 denial of passports to some on political grounds frequently ex-
 tends to family members of persons in political disfavor and to
 those persons whom the Government suspects may prove embarrassing
 to it when travelling abroad. Legal provisions exist for restric-
 ting the movement of those convicted of political or criminal
 offenses. Formal emigration is neither restricted nor encouraged.
 With the exception of a small group of political dissidents,
 there is no outward flow of Malawian refugees from the country.
 
 
 222
 Expatriates born in Malawi may return. Citizenship may be
 revoked, but in practice this is not done. Malawi does not
 accord official refugee status, but has treated de facto refugees
 from neighboring countries generously, and has pursued a policy
 of persuading rather than coercing such refugees to return to
 their own lands. Asian residents and citizens are free to
 travel within the country, but must reside and work in one of
 three urban areas (Lilongwe, Zomba, and Blantyre/Limbe). Within
 some of these urban centers, strict rules governing where Asians
 may own property result in de facto limitations on where they may
 reside. Asian residents, whether Malawian citizens or not, have
 been compelled to transfer ownership of specific categories of
 business to ethnic African Malawian citizens. The list of such
 businesses continues to grow, with the result that more and
 more Asians are being *forced" to seek opportunities outside
 the country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Malawi is ruled by one man, the Life President, through the appa-
 ratus of the sole political party and government, which are
 closely linked. Decisions are taken either directly by the
 President or those few closely associated with him. No
 opposition political parties or movements are permitted.
 One must be a party member to participate in the political
 life of the nation, to be a member of parliament, or to be a
 civil servant. Nearly half of the population are at least
 nominal party members, but active party membership is oblig-
 atory if one aspires to higher levels of leadership. This
 prescription does not apply to the military per Se, but
 adherence to party policy and directives is expected of
 all. The party's pervasiveness and broad based structure
 provide for some choice among candidates for party, parlia-
 mentary, and other offices. For example, as was the case
 in the 1983 election, there are often three candidates for
 election to a parliamentary constituency, but all nominees
 are selected by the party and submitted to the President for
 vetting. Active campaigning is not permitted. All candidates
 represent the same ideology and must be of the same political
 persuasion as the national leadership. Alternative policies,
 programs, or even outlooks are not tolerated. Hence, elections
 permit the voter to select only among the similiar candidates
 or not to vote, and the latter is regarded with suspicion. The
 National Assembly (parliament) consists of both *elected" and
 nominated members and is mainly concerned with ratifying
 government policy. Its powers are broadly based in law but
 highly circumscribed in practice. Others can do little more than
 attempt to exert limited influence upon the leadership, basically
 through advancement in either party or government position.
 There is no question of popular participation in decision-making
 in the western tradition, nor is it possible or even conceivable
 to change the Government by lawful means.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit organizations such as the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International to
 visit and conduct investigations. There are no non-governmental
 organizations devoted to the furtherance of human rights permitted
 to exist. Expressions of interest in alleged human rights
 
 
 223
 problems by outside groups or individuals are usually ignored.
 Pew in Government are even willing to discuss the subject of
 human rights, and fewer still appear willing or able to act
 on allegations of human rights abuses. The Government appears
 to take the position that such expressions are unwarranted
 intrusions into its sovereignty. In this regard, Freedom House
 considers Malawi 'not free." Amnesty International has con-
 tinued to express concern about the use of detention without
 trial and the lack of effective safeguards against ill-treatment
 of political detainees.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Governed by free market forces, the economy is predominately
 agricultural. A small estate sector produces primarily
 export crops, while a smallholder sector produces the country's
 food crops. The industrial and manufacturing sector has
 developed primarily in terms of import substitution and the
 processing of agricultural produce. Fiscal and monetary policies
 of the Government tend to be conservative: trade policies are
 pragmatic especially in terms of dealing with the region's
 major economic power, the Republic of South Africa; employment
 and wage policies accurately reflect the nation's abundance of
 young and unskilled labor. Public ownership of enterprises
 is substantial and reflects the lack of domestic capital for-
 mation and managerial skills, and the limited foreign invest-
 ment in Malawi.
 The country's internal stability and pragmatic economic policies
 were major factors in the impressive real growth rate of six
 percent per annum until the late 1970's. Since 1979, however,
 a combination of events has caused a marked deterioration in
 economic performance. Droughts in two successive years led to
 the temporary importation of maize in 1981, although Malawi
 resumed exporting maize in 1982. Insurgent activity and poor
 maintenance of the rail routes through Mozambique have dis-
 rupted the movement of imports and exports, raised transport
 costs, and led to shortages of fuels, fertilizers, and other
 critical imports. Increased petroleum costs in 1979, coupled
 with sharp declines in the prices received for major export crops
 (tea, coffee, and sugar), resulted in a substantial decline in
 the terms of trade and a growing debt servicing problem.
 In coping with these economic problems, the Government has deval-
 ued its currency by approximately 25 percent since early 1982,
 increased some agricultural producer prices, limited its foreign
 and domestic borrowing, and substantially cut public expendi-
 tures. These measures may restore a considerable degree of
 confidence in the Government's macro-economic management abili-
 ties. Nevertheless, the short term economic outlook is dim.
 External constraints, such as continued depressed world prices
 for Malawi's export crops and disruptions of the transport links
 to seaports, probably will continue to limit the nation's economic
 growth rate to near the growth rate of population.
 
 
 224
 Since independence, the Government's development priorities have
 emphasized increasing rural income and well-being through greater
 rural productivity. Other long term development priorities of the
 Government have been to expand the provision of basic social
 services (primarily educational and health services), rural infra-
 structure (roads), and to lessen the disparity between the
 economic conditions in the three major regions of the country.
 However, as these development priorities begin to make a
 measurable impact on the nation, the current economic situation
 is prompting cuts in social programs. Somewhat at variance with
 the stated national priorities, the Government also has
 channeled investment into prestigious national projects, such
 as sports stadiums, an international airport, and elite
 schools. However, the downturn of the national economy coupled
 with recently adopted fiscal management practices has reduced,
 if not eliminated, investment in such projects.
 Between 1980 and 1981 officially listed employment in Malawi
 increased two percent to 365,000; since then there has been
 little new employment. The literacy rate remains at approxi-
 mately 25 percent. About 60 percent of the primary school
 age group is enrolled in school. Spaces in secondary
 schools are available for only 10 percent of those eligible
 from primary schools, but overall enrollment in Malawi's
 educational institutions increased in 1981. Primary enrollment
 was up four percent to approximately 810,000 pupils, secondary
 school enrollment increased nine percent to about 18,000
 students. University enrollment grew by six percent to
 1,720 students, but enrollments in teacher training colleges
 and technical schools declined slightly in 1981 to 2,400
 students.
 In rural areas, about 2.4 million people (40 percent) out of-
 6.5 million are estimated to have access to safe water. In urban
 areas, the percentage of persons having access to safe water is
 estimated to be 70 percent. Life expectancy at birth is 44.22
 years; infant mortality is 163.6 per 1,000 live births.
 The Malawian economy still has a significant number of partici-
 pants of expatriate European and Asian descent. The Government's
 long-standing policy is to increase indigenous Malawian partici-
 pation in the national economy and replace expatriates in the
 public sector with indigenous Malawians. In addition to restrict-
 ing areas where Asians may live and work, the Government is
 curtailing Asian involvement in certain economic activities
 (e.g., rural commerce and domestic trucking) it deems the
 proper domain of indigenous Malawians.
 A definite sex bias against women exists in terms of access
 to the full range of public services. As mothers, women
 have enjoyed a high degree of access to the traditional
 health services and to extension programs geared toward
 improving women's homemaking abilities. Such programs,
 while beneficial, have failed to recognize the important
 role women play as agricultural producers in the rural
 sector and the potential role women can have in the modern
 sector. To rectify this situation, extension programs have
 been developed which address problems women face as agricultural
 producers. A third of the positions in the public education
 system have been reserved for women. Although males still
 have a comparative advantage in terms of educational and
 employment opportunities, the Government has initiated
 sufficiently broad-scale programs to begin to rectify the
 discrimination which exists.
 
 
 225
 Women are entitled to party membership and voting rights, and can
 hold elected and appointed positions. At present, women hold
 five out of 101 elected seats in parliament and several nominated
 seats. No women hold ministerial-level appointments.
 Within Malawi's traditional and primarily matriarchal tribal
 leadership structures, there are several small ethnic groups
 wherein women possess fewer rights and privileges and where
 female circumcision is occasionally practiced.
 Malawi enjoys a considerable degree of ethnolinguistic uniformity.
 Ethnic and regional differences exist but have not been a dis-
 ruptive element within the society. Over 75 percent of the
 population speaks and/or understands Chichewa, the language of
 the Chewa and Nyanja, who together constitute over 90 percent of
 Malawi's population. Chichewa became the national language of
 Malawi in 1968, but English is the official language for
 government and business. Malawi's indigenous groups are
 sufficiently alike in culture and social organization to
 permit relatively easy interaction, including intermarriage,
 mixing in agricultural settlements, and mixed grouping for
 political purposes.
