 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy,
 with an elected President, a bicameral legislature,
 and an independent judiciary. The current government
 is headed by President Joaguin Balaguer, now in his third
 four-year term of office. The Dominican newspapers
 operate freely. The virtual disappearance of insurgency
 attempts, kidnappings, and assassinations since the
 early 1970s has resulted in a substantial reduction
 in incidents of military and police repression. The
 Dominican Government has officially promoted a number
 of human rights improvements, has co-sponsored with
 the United States the resolution on human rights at
 the June 1977 Assembly of the OAS, and has signed the
 American Convention on Human Rights. Over a dozen
 political parties are officially recognized and freely
 active, although the 1974 elections were marred by
 incidents of military intervention on behalf of the
 President's re-election.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Althoughcommon' under the Trujillo regime (1930-1961),
 torture does not appear to be practiced now.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Most prisoners do not experience cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment. However, physical
 abuse of some prisoners occurs in the Dominican Republic
 (although not condoned by the Dominican Government) but
 appears to have decreased. Prisoners or their families
 occasionally complain of severe beatings by prison guards
 and degrading conditions. When such complaints come to
 public attention, often through the press, the Government
 has responded to ameliorate conditions somewhat. Improper
 actions or abuse of power by police officers are normally
 investigated, and numerous policemen have been dismissed
 for cause. However, prisoner discontent over conditions
 led to disturbances in La Victoria prison in October
 1977. In February 1977, the Government announced plans
 to construct several new prisons.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 (151)
 
 
 152
 Opposition members have sometimes been arrested and held
 for several weeks or months and then released. Charges
 are usually filed promptly, however. The Napoleonic Code,
 on which Dominican law is based, gives greater authority
 to the state than does the common law system to arrest
 and hold individuals suspected of criminal violations.
 The total number of political prisoners has been reduced
 from several hundred in the early 1970s to an estimated
 few dozen in 1977. Most, if not all of these political
 prisoners were convicted of politically-motivated crimes
 of violence, including kidnapping and murder. Some viola-
 tions of human rights, including arbitrary arrest, con-
 tinue to occur.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Laws providing for fair public trials are generally
 respected. Trials of persons accused of politically
 motivated violence, while public, sometimes drag on for
 months or years.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The legal safeguards against arbitary invasion of the
 home are-usually, but not always, observed.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Dominican Government development programs give high
 priority to agricultural production through credits,
 training and technical assistance to small farmers.
 The Government maintains a network of "economy dining
 halls" and local charities operate under official
 auspices. The Government operates hospitals, maternity
 homes, and a mental asylum. Revison of basic social
 security and health insurance legislation is currently
 under study. The Government has constructed extensive
 urban housing for working class families. Primary edu-
 cation is obligatory between the ages of 7 and 14. The
 Government maintains over 4,700 primary schools attended
 by about 1 million youth. Reform of the primary education
 system is currently under study. The above programs are
 subject to budgetary restraints which limit actual
 benefits.

 Corruption in the Dominican Republic is traditional and
 does not appear to have diminished in recent times.
 Political favoritism in Government hiring and granting
 of contracts probably results in the diversion of some
 resources from the poor.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Freedom of thought, speech and religion are respected.
 The Dominican newspapers are categorized by the Inter-
 American Press Association (IAPA) as among the freest
 in Latin America. The IAPA held its 33rd annual assembly
 in Santo Domingo in October 1977. No prior consent is
 required for meetings of political parties and labor
 groups. Outdoor public rallies require official permits.
 Some rural political meetings of opposition parties
 have experienced harassment. Four trade union confeder-
 ations exist, as well as numerous unaffiliated unions.
 Labor organizations carry out organizational activities
 relatively freely, but they are inhibited by a labor
 code, dating from Trujillo rule, giving wide latitude
 to management. The latter is usually favored by the
 Government in disputes with labor.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Movement within the country and to most countries over-
 seas is unrestricted. Travel to Communist countries
 is permitted only with official authorization. During
 1977, however, passports were returned to several hundred
 individuals who travelled to Communist countries without
 authorization. Also, prohibitions against the return
 of almost 300 exiles have been lifted by decree. There
 is freedom to emigrate.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Dominican law sets forth procedures for free elections.
 Elections in 1966 and 1970 were generally recognized as
 free, although intimidation of some opposition members
 did occur in the latter campaign. The 1974 elections
 were marred by some incidents of military intervention
 
 22-145 0 - 78 - 11
 
 
 on behalf of the President's re-election by harassment
 of opposition political parties. As a result, the opposi-
 tion withdrew its candidates. In October 1977 the leading
 opposition party complained that elements of the Domini-
 can military were again hindering some of its activities
 and exerting pressure for the re-election of President
 Balaguer in the May 1978 general elections. The President
 issued a statement that the Dominican Armed Forces
 had received strict orders to remain neutral, and military
 personnel had been sanctioned for disobeying these orders.
 At present 14 political parties are officially recognized.
 Pro-Trujillo parties are illegal, but the Dominican
 Communist Party was legalized by legislation enacted
 in November 1977.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Amnesty International Report 1977 was critical of
 human rights practices in the Dominican Republic. The
 Report also stated that President Ealaguer wrote to
 the Secretary General of Amnesty International in April
 1977 adiitting that "Dominican justice, like that of
 most of our countries, suffers from many faults   ... "
 The President's letter asserted that adequate facilities
 for prisoner re-education were lacking. He also admitted
 that there are sometimes regrettable delays in the
 hearing of judicial trials," but he claimed that these
 were not due to reasons of a political nature but rather
 to the court work load and "to the fact that the public
 authorities find it impossible to stop spurious interests
 which often interfere in the healthy administration
 of justice."
 In April 1977, President Ealaguer agreed to a visit pro-
 posed by Amnesty International. Subsequently, however,
 he suggested that the visit be conducted by a third-party
 observer. Thus far such a visit has not taken place.
 The Dominican Republic signed the American Convention
 on Human Rights in September 1977.
