 ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS
 St. Christopher and Nevis (commonly called St. Kitts) which
 received independence from the United Kingdom in 1983, has a
 government modeled on the British parliamentary system with
 elections at least every 5 years. The political opposition is
 active and vocal. The Constitution provides the smaller
 island of Nevis considerable self-government, as well as the
 right to secede from the federation if certain enumerated
 procedures, including 6-months notice, are followed.
 Security forces consist of a small police force which includes
 a small Special Service Unit with some paramilitary training.
 St. Christopher and Nevis has a mixed economic system. Most
 commercial enterprises are privately owned, but the sugar
 industry--the country's largest--and 85 percent of all arable
 land are owned by state corporations.
 The country's human rights record continued to be good during
 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No political killings were reported in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 No politically motivated abductions, extralegal detentions or
 disappearances were reported in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Law enforcement authorities abide by the constitutional
 prohibitions against the use of torture or cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment. Prisoners are housed in an
 outmoded jail; family members, attorneys, and clergy are
 permitted to visit detainees regularly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention.
 Habeas corpus provisions require that persons detained be
 brought before a court within 48 hours. Opposition
 politicians have made unsubstantiated charges that the present
 Government has been involved in politically motivated
 arrests. There were no reported cases of exile. Although
 there is no known legal provision against it, forced or
 compulsory labor is not known to take place in St. Christopher
 and Nevis.
 e.    Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution requires that every person accused of a crime
 receive a fair, speedy, and public trial. The judiciary is
 highly regarded and independent. Like most of the
 English-speaking Caribbean, St. Christopher and Nevis is
 served by the West Indies Court of Appeal. Legal assistance
 is available to indigent defendants.

 f.    Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence
 Neither the Government nor police interfere arbitrarily in the
 private lives of individuals. Warrants are required to search
 private homes.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the
 press. St. Christopher-Nevis does not have a major daily
 newspaper. Each of the large political parties publishes a
 weekly or biweekly newspaper, and there are regional
 church-funded newspapers. International news publications are
 readily available. The Government owns and operates the only
 television station, but opposing political views are freely
 debated on television as well as on the commercial radio
 station.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right of peaceful assembly.
 Organized demonstrations, rallies, and public meetings
 sponsored by political parties occur regularly without
 government interference. Labor unions are free to organize
 and to negotiate for better wages and benefits for union
 members.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion,
 and there are no restrictions on religious practices. Most
 church members belong to Protestant denominations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel inside and outside of the federation is unrestricted.
 Kittitian citizens resident in other countries are free to
 return at any time.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The multiparty political system encompasses a wide variety of
 political views. Suffrage is universal over age 18.
 Political parties are free to conduct their activities, and
 every party holds some type of annual convention.
 The current Government is a coalition of two of the three
 major political parties: the People's Action Movement, led by
 Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds, and the Nevis Reformation
 Party, headed by Simeon Daniel, the Premier of Nevis and
 Minister of Natural Resources and Environment. In June 1984
 national elections, the coalition strengthened its mandate by
 winning 9 of the 11 elected seats in the federal Parliament.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Internationally recognized human rights organizations have not
 commented on the human rights situation, nor has anyone

 ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS
 requested an investigation or called for inquiries into
 alleged violations. The Government is firmly committed to the
 promotion of human rights and takes criticism related to human
 rights seriously.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The nation's economy is emerging from a period of decline.
 The world recession of the early 1980s, coupled with a steep
 decline in sugar prices, resulted in economic stagnation.
 Total government revenues needed for capital development
 projects fell. Per capita gross national product (GNP) was an
 estimated US $824 in 1982.
 The Government has developed a program of economic
 diversification to increase earnings in tourism,
 manufacturing, and agricultural production other than sugar.
 The sugar industry remains the single most important revenue
 producer in the economy, accounting for 11.9 percent of the
 gross domestic product (GDP) in 1983.
 The population, estimated at 41,000, had a negative growth
 rate in 1985, averaging minus 1.2. percent. The nation's
 birth rate is 24 per 1,000; the infant mortality rate remains
 high at 39.5 per 1,000 live births.
 The minimum legal working age is 14. The work week is 40
 hours in 5 days, and workers are guaranteed a minimum vacation
 of 2 weeks. Although a minimum wage is established by law, it
 is arguably less than that on which a person can be reasonably
 expected to live.
 The role of women in society is not restricted by law.
 Women's particpation in public life got a boost in the June,
 1984 election, when Constance Mitcham won a seat in
 Parliament, defeating the leader of the opposition. Ms.
 Mitcham was then named Minister of Women's Affairs.
