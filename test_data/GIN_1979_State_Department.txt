 GUINEA
 Guinea is a one-party socialist state. Sekou Toure has
 been its only President since Guinea's decision to break
 away from the French community and declare its indepen-
 dence in 1958. The sudden break with France seriously
 injured the economy of the new nation, which subsequent-
 ly had a long struggle for survival, punctuated every
 year or two by reports of a coup plot or imminent foreign
 attack. A sea-borne invasion by Portuguese mercenaries
 and Guinean emigres in November 1970 heightened Guinea's
 external security concerns. It led to a zealous investi-
 gation of all suspected traitors and to the arrest and
 imprisonment of many. A general amnesty of all Guinean.
 "exiles" was issued in July 1977, and thousands of emigres
 have been accepted back without discrimination. The re-
 gime's continuing fears for its survival were laid to rest
 in March 1978 with normalization of Guinea's relations
 with neighboring Senegal and Ivory Coast. Internal security
 controls have been relaxed and cross-border movement of
 goods and people has been eased.
 Sekou Toure's socialist philosophy and policies have em-
 phasized ideological commitment rather than material re-
 wards as an incentive for production, but the opening up
 of the private market economy in 1977-78 has tempered
 ideological appeals with a new pragmatism. The Govern-
 ment of Guinea views domination of blacks by whites in
 southern Africa as Africa's primary human rights prob-
 lem. Within Guinea, official pronouncements emphasize
 the rights of the community over individual human rights,
 although the Government in January 1978 ratified the In-
 ternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
 Rights. Past threats to Guinea's security reinforce this
 preoccupation with survival and the rights of the community,
 and are considered by the Government to justify its broad
 police powers and maintenance of a pervasive security
 apparatus. While exact information is not available, the
 number of political prisoners is probably well under 1,000.
 Several hundred have been released over the past two years.
 No allegations of new arrests have been received recently.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture, which is not prohibited by Guinean law, has occurred
 in the past as noted in last year's report. The Department
 of State has had no reports of torture during the past two and
 a half years.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Prison conditions in Guinea are generally very poor. Pri-
 soners not being held in solitary confinement are normally
 supplied with food by family or friends. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross has not been given access to
 detaicees. Amnesty International in 1977 described Guinean
 prison conditions as "extremely bad." Prisoners released
 
 
 during the past year have spoken of efforts to improve
 prison fare and fatten up prisoners before they are released.
 Police handling of suspects is frequently rough. Public
 beatings for thievery or other offenses have occasional-
 ly occurred. Those forced to confess political crimes have
 been denounced publicly in a degrading manner.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There is no legal prohibition against "preventive detention"
 and no provision for habeas corpus.  Persons can be arrested
 and held without charge. In the past, the Government purged
 those suspected of plotting against it. Some public officials
 who fell into disfavor were subject to detention for unfixed
 terms.
 As noted above, there have been no reliable reports of
 political arrests for at least the past two and a half
 years. Amnesty International reported in 1977 that there
 were at least 1,000 political prisoners in Guinea. Since
 May 1977 hundreds of prisoners have been released, including
 senior government officials, some of whom have been reinstat-
 ed. Some estimate that fewer than 100 Guinean political
 prisoners are still being detained. It has stated that
 "many" remain, and that "no precise estimate of their
 numbers can be given." The release of the best-known
 political prisoner, Archbishop Tchidimbo, August 7, 1979
 followed a political prisoner amnesty in May 1979, when
 perhaps 13 persons were released. The Department of State
 has no reports of recent political arrests. Once a person is
 imprisoned, it is often difficult to get information about
 his status and condition.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Ordinary citizens have access to the courts, but most civil
 complaints are handled at-the local administrative level
 before they reach the courts; this procedure corresponds to
 African tradition and provides considerable scope for testi-
 mony by complainants, defendants and witnesses. Guinean
 courts are under the influence of the party-government. In
 both civil and criminal cases constitutional and statutory
 procedures exist, but do not seem to be consistently applied.
 Guinean law does not permit professional lawyers in private
 practice. Generally, defendants appear without benefit of
 legal counsel, although Guinean law does provide for the
 selection of well-educated private citizens to act as ad hoc
 defense counsel in civil proceedings when requested by
 defendants. Those charged with security or political offenses
 in the past have had no such protection, however, and were
 required to make their own defense without being aware of the
 charges or evidence against them. No political trials are
 known to have taken place in Guinea since the 1976 "Foulah
 plot."
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The Department of State is not aware of any laws protecting
 the sanctity of the home. The police may enter homes without
 warrants in pursuit of suspects or to obtain evidence. This
 policy is defended by officials who have stressed the security
 concerns of society as a whole over safeguards for individuals.
 
 
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Great changes in economic life and in the psychological
 atmosphere within Guinea have occurred with the end of
 repression by the economic police, the removal of roadblocks
 on internal highways, the resumption of private market
 activity and the greatly increased availability of food and
 consumer goods. Ideology remains a predominant factor,
 however, and while the avowed goal of public policy has been
 the fulfillment of vital human needs, the government's
 ideological approach has frequently served to limit options
 for orderly, rational economic development. The question of
 providing adequate incentives to farmers, especially those
 on the state farms, remains unresolved, and smuggling of
 agricultural products to neighboring countries is a serious
 problem. Most corruption appears to be petty.
 The Guinean Government has devoted substantial resources to
 educational facilities -- which are free at all levels --
 throughout the country. The literacy rate has increased
 since independence from less than one percent to ten percent.
 Merit plays a large part in selecting candidates for techni-
 cal training or advanced education abroad, but the Guinean
 Government has full control over the application procedure
 Education in rural areas still is inferior, but college
 courses in agronomy are now offered at several centers in
 the countryside. The number of college students in Guinea
 has increased from virtually none at the time of indepen-
 dence to over 4,000 in 1979. Basic housing and health
 care remain serious problems, the former in urban areas and
 the latter particularly in rural regions. Both housing and
 health care are currently the focus of sizable UN and bi-
 lateral development programs for Guinea. Income disparities
 in Guinea are not large, and income tax rates are progressive.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Guinean Government does not tolerate dissent from its
 political and ideological tenets. Islam is officially
 supported, and Christianity is tolerated. There appears
 to be a campaign against animistic practices but no persecu-
 tion of any organized religious groups. Assembly is subject
 to police controls. All the media are government-controlled,
 and no opposition views are aired, although the media from
 time to time criticize Government offices and agencies, making
 public cases of corruption or other shortcomings. Few
 publications are available and all are censored.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement is not guaranteed by law but has trad-
 itionally been part of African custom; families and tribal
 groups are frequently spread across state frontiers. Internal
 movement was in the past subject to extensive police control
 but has remained substantially free since early 1978.
 While legal entry into and exit from the country are still
 
 
 87
 subject to control, their enforcement has become notably
 relaxed, and Guineans appear to be able to move without great
 difficulty across borders with neighboring states. More than
 one million Guineans are believed to have left the country
 since 1958 because of unfavorable political or economic
 conditions. That movement has now been reversed, and, as
 noted above, thousands of Guineans have returned.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Guinean people are regularly exhorted by their leaders to
 participate in the political process and adhere to a continu-
 ing "revolution" which the single party-state conducts in
 their name under the authoritarian leadership of President
 Toure. 'There is little freedom to dissent or to avoid taking
 part in the regime-directed political activity which guides
 many aspects of national life. President Toure sees many
 petitioners and supplicants, and the Government contends that
 the party-state structure, with its constant meetings down to
 the level of the local communities, and popular referenda
 provide adequate reflection of the people's wishes.
 Labor unions do not constitute an independent force in
 Guinean society. They are firmly controlled by the Govern-
 ment, and their potential political role is entirely taken up
 by the party, headed by Sekou Toure, who was the founder of
 the Guinean labor.movement in the 40's.
 Since independence, the Guinean Government has made a conscious
 effort to improve the position of women in society. There is
 no legal discrimination against women, but there does remain
 a fundamental tradition against far-reaching emancipation of
 women.   Ministry of Social Affairs is largely staffed by women,
 and the Minister is a woman who previously served as Guinean
 Ambasador to the United Nations. Women are integrally involved
 in the professional fields of education, medicine and social
 work, are becoming more prominent in the police and military,
 and are influential in the non-govermental and market sector
 of the economy. In 1977 market women rioted and forced an
 end to market police harassment, spurring the re-emergence
 of private market activity, and bringing the government to
 realize more clearly the need for economic development.
 4.   Governmental Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The United Nations investigated the 1970 mercenary attack on
 Guinea, and in recent years the Guinean leadership has
 expressed willingness for outsiders to observe its humani-
 tarian practices, particularly if other African countries
 accept similar visitations. In 1977 Amnesty International
 sought contact with Guinean authorities to intervene on
 behalf of political prisoners and to send a mission to
 Guinea. The Guinean Government did not respond. A repre-
 sentative of the International Committee of the Red Cross was
 received in Guinea in March 1978, but the Government appears
 reluctant to permit a follow-up visit that would investigate
 prison conditions. The Guinean Government rejects charges
 leveled at it by the International League for Human Rights
 and by Amnesty International, maintaining that its political
 prisoners are convicted traitors whose activities represent-
 ed a threat to the survival of the regime.
