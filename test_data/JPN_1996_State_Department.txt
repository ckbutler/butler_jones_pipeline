 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy based on a 1947 Constitution. Sovereignty
 is vested in the people, and the Emperor is defined as the symbol of state. Executive
 power is exercised by a cabinet, composed of a prime minister and ministers of
 state, responsible to the Diet, a two-house Parliament. The Diet, elected by univer-
 sal suffrage and secret ballot, designates the Prime Minister, who must be a mem-
 ber of that body. The Government, formed in November, is a loose coalition led by
 the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in which the Social Democratic Party and the
 New Party Sakigake cooperate with the LDP from outside the Cabinet. The judici-
 ary is independent of the Government.
 A well-organized and disciplined police force generally respects the human rights
 of the populace and is firmly under the control of the civil authorities. However,
 there continued to be credible reports of harsh treatment of some suspects in cus-
 Re industrialized free market economy is highly efficient and competitive in
 world markets and provides residents with a high standard of living. In 1996 eco-
 nomic growth picked up from the slow pace ofthe previous 4 years.
 A just and efficient legal system generally assures observance of constitutionally
 provided human rights. However, there continue to be some reports of physical and
 psychological abuse of prisoners or detainees. Officials are sometimes dismissed for
 such abuse but are seldom tried, convicted, and imrisoned. The Burakumin (a
 group historically treated as outcasts), the Ainu (Japan's indigenous people), women,
 and alien residents experience varying degrees of societal discrimination, some of it
 severe and longstanding.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment. However, reports by several Japanese bar associa-
 tions, human rights groups, and some prisoners indicate that police sometimes use
 physical violence, including kicking and beating, as well as pschological intimida-
 tion, including threats and name calling, to obtain confessions rom suspects in cus-
 tody or to enforce discipline. In Japan confession is regarded as the first step in the
 rehabilitative process. Although under the Constitution no criminal suspect can be
 compelled to make a self-incriminating confession, roughly 90 percent of all criminal
 cases going to trial include confessions, reflecting the priority that the system places
 on admissions of guilt. The Government points out that the high percentage of con-
 fessions, like the high conviction rate, is reflective of a higher standard of evidence
 needed to bring about indictment in the Japanese system. Since a system of arraign-
 ment does not exist in Japan, a suspect, if indicted, will be brought to trial even
 if that person has confessed to the crime. This results in a higher conviction rate
 than would otherwise be the case.

 Appellate courts have overturned several convictions in recent years on the
 ground that they were obtained as a result of forced confession. In addition, civil
 and criminal suits have been brought against some police and prosecution officials,
 alleging abuse during interrogation and detention. Finally, there were scattered al-
 legations of beatings of detainees in immigration detention facilities.
 The Japanese Federation of Bar Associations and human rights groups have criti-
 cized the prison system, with its empbasis on strict discipline and obedience to nu-
 merous rules. Guards sometimes selectively enforce rules and impose punishment,
 including "minor solitary confinement," which may be imposed for at least 1 and not
 more than 60 days and in which the prisoner is made to sit (for foreigners) or kneel
 (for Japanese) motionless in the middle of an empty cell.
 Some human rights groups allege that physical restraints, such as leather hand-
 cuffs, have been used as a form of punishment and that prisoners have been forced
 to eat and relieve themselves unassisted while wearing these restraints. Ministry
 of Justice officials state that restraints are used inside the prison only when pris-
 oners have been violent and pose a threat to themselves and others, or when there
 is concern that a prisoner might attempt to escape.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Constitutional provisions for freedom
 from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment are respected in practice. The law provides
 for judicial determination of the legality of detention. People may not be detained
 without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate before
 trial that pro able cause exists in order to detain the accused. Under the Code of
 Criminal Procedure, a suspect may be held in police custody for up to 72 hours with-
 out judicial proceedings. Preindictment custody may be extended by a judge for up
 to 20 additional days.if an indictment follows, the suspect is transferred to a crimi-
 nal detention facility. Bail is available in only about 25 percent of cases.
 The bar associations and human rights groups have criticized the practice of "sub-
 stitute detention." Although the law stipulates that suspects should be held in
 "houses of detention" between arrest and sentencing, a police detention facility may
 be substituted at the order of the court. This provision was originally added to cover
 a shortage of normal detention facilities. According to the most recent Ministry of
 Justice White Paper on Crime, published in 1995, normal detention facilities were
 filled to 53 percent of capacity in 1994. Critics charge that allowing suspects to be
 detained by the same authorities who interrogate them heightens theptential for
 abuse and coercion. The Government counters that adequate safeguards to prevent
 abuse, including strong judicial oversight, have been built into the system. Preven-
 tive detention does not exist.
 The length of time before a suspect is brought to trial depends on the nature of
 the crime but rarely exceeds 3 months from date of arrest; the average is 1 to 2
 months. Critics charge that access to counsel is limited both in duration and fre-
 quency, although the Government denies that this is the case. The Criminal Proce-
 dure Code grants the prosecution and investigating police officials the power to con-
 trol access to attorneys before indictment when deemed necessary for the sake of
 the investigation. As a court-appointed attorney is not approved until after indict-
 ment, suspects must rely on their own resources to hire an attorney for counseling
 before indictment. In addition, counsel may not be present during interrogation at
 any time before or after indictment. Beyond this, the Government affirms that the
 right of the accused to seek legal counsel is fully respected and that attorneys are
 almost always able to see clients without obstruction. Local bar associations provide
 detainees with a free counseling session prior to indictment. Counsel is provided at
 government expense after indictment if the arrested person cannot afford one.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent and free from execu-
 tive branch interference. The Cabinet appoints judges for 10-year terms, which can
 be renewed until judges have reached age 65. Justices of the Supreme Court can
 serve until the age of 70 but face periodic review through popular referendum. A
 defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision of a trial court of first instance may,
 within the period prescribed by law, appeal to a higher court. There are several lev-
 els of courts, with the Supreme Court serving as the highest judicial authority.
 There is no trial by jury.
 The Government respects in practice the constitutional provisions for the right to
 a speedy and public trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases. The defend-
 ant is informed of charges upon arrest and assured a public trial by an independent
 civilian court with defense counsel and the right of cross-examination. The Constitu-
 tion provides defendants with the right not to be compelled to testify against them-
 selves as well as to free and private access to counsel, although the right to such
 access is sometimes abridged in practice. For example, the law allows prosecutors
 to control access to counsel before indictment, and there are persistent allegations
 
 
 683
 
 of coerced confessions. Defendants are also protected from the retroactive applica-
 tion of laws and have the right of access to incriminating evidence after a formal
 indictment has been made. However, the law does not require full disclosure by the
 prosecutor, and material that the prosecution will not use in court may be sup-
 pressed.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made upon separate warrant is-
 sued by a judge. Standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard against arbi-
 trary searches. There were no reports that the Government or any other organiza-
 tion arbitrarily interfered with pnvacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and is respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shintoism are the two major reli-
 gions, there are many others, including several Christian denominations. Some tem-
 ples and shrines receive public support as national historic or cultural sites.
 The Government does not require that religious groups be licensed. However, to
 receive official recognition as a religious organization, which brings tax benefits and
 other advantages, a  eup must register with local or national authorities as a "reli-
 gious corporation." In practice, almost all religious groups register, and until this
 year the procedure was little more than a formality. In response to a series of
 crimes committed by the Aum Shinrikyo religious sect, the Diet amended the Reli-
 gious Corporation Law to give governmental authorities increased oversight of reli-
 gious groups and to require greater disclosure of financial assets by religious cor-
 porations. These amendments entered into force on September 15.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have the right to travel freely both within Japan and abroad,
 to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. Japa-
 nese nationality may be lost by naturalization in a foreign country, or by failure of
 people born with dual nationality to elect Japanese nationality at the required age.
 e Government has granted asylum in only a small number of cases to those
 claiming fear of persecution if they return to their homeland. It believes that most
 people seeking asylum in Japan do so for economic reasons. According to the Justice
 Ministry, from 1982 to Augnst 1996, it was determined that 208 of 1,255 applicants
 met the required standard for asylum. None of the 93 applications for asylum filed
 between August 1995 and August 1996 was approved. The Government has shown
 flexibility in dealing with visa extensions for Chinese student dissidents, although
 it continues to be reluctant to grant permanent asylum.
 Strict administrative procedures contribute to the roughly 20-percent rate of ap-
 proval of asylum applications. For example, appeals of initial denials are reviewed
 by a separate authority of the same body, and decisions are rarely overturned. Asy-
 lum seekers and some critics claim that the processing of asylum applications is not
 readily understandable, making it difficult for applicants to comply with government
 procedures. Also, the Government'a "60-day rule" requires applicants to appear at
 an immigration office within 60 days of arrival or within 60 days of the time they
 learn they are likely to be persecuted in their home country; most asylum seekers
 arrive in Japan without knowledge of this requirement and can inadvertently waive
 their claim by not acting promptly. In an effort to make procedures clearer to appli-
 cants, the Government has revised the English-language pamphlet it distributes to
 those interested in the asylum process.
 In September 155 Vietnamese asylum seekers were returned to Vietnam from
 Japan. The Vietnamese put up minimal resistance to boarding the flight although
 three individuals had to be carried on board. One immigration official was slightly
 injured. An additional 14 Vietnamese asylum seekers remain in Japan. They have
 been determined to be refugees and are being considered for eventual third country
 resettlement.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right peacefully to change their government and are able to ex-
 ercise this right in practice through frequent, free, and fair elections on the basis
 
 
 684
 of universal suffrage by secret ballot. A parliamentary democracy, Japan is governed
 by the political party or parties able to form a majority in the lower house of its
 bicameral Diet. From 1955 until 1993, all prime ministers and almost all cabinet
 ministers were members of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which enjoyed a
 majority in the lower house throughout this period. Since 1993, except for a brief
 period of non-LDP coalition government from August 1993 to June 1994, the LDP
 has been part of successive coalition governments. Local and prefectural govern-
 ments are often controlled by coalitions.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government and poli-
 tics, but cultural attitudes are not favorable to their participation. Women hold 23
 seats in the 500-member lower house of the Diet, and 19 seats in the 252-member
 upper house. As of November, the 21-member Cabinet had 1 female member.
 Women make up 21.8 percent of all national government workers, but hold less than
 0.9 percent of top (director level and higher) government posts. In 1991 the Prime
 Minister's Office promulgated an action plan to increase the number of women in
 leadership positions on government advisory panels to 30 percent by the end of fis-
 cal year 1995. However, the target was later cut to 15 percent, a step apparently
 reflecting slower than anticipated progress. Only 117 of the 205 existing panels have
 met the 15-percent target.
 There is one Ainu member of the Diet (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of local and international human rights organizations function freely,
 without governmental restrictions or impediments, investigating and publishing
 their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative
 and responsive to their views, although the Government restricts access to prisons
 and detention facilities by human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, sex, social
 status, or family origin, and, in general, the Government respects these provisions.
 Women.-According to the National Police Agency, 474 incidents of spousal abuse
 against women were reported to authorities in 1994. However, violence against
 women, particularly domestic violence, often may go unreported due to social and
 cultural concerns about shaming one's family or endangering the reputation of one's
 spouse or offspring. Typically, victimized women often return to the home of their
 parents rather than file reports with authorities. Therefore, National Police Agency
 statistics on violence against women undoubtedly understate the scope of the cur-
 rent situation. Many local governments are responding positively to a need for con-
 fidential assistance by establishing special women's consultation departments in po-
 lice and prefectural offices.
 There is no specific law on sexual harassment. Although a woman may sue for
 "unlawful conduct" against an individual, the employing company's responsibility is
 not at issue in such a suit. Sexual harassment in the workplace is widespread, as
 evidenced by a May survey by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, RENGO,
 which revealed that over 40 percent of working women have experienced sexual har-
 assment. Women in this survey complained about a range of actions including sexu-
 ally charged jokes, comments about physical features such as breast size, the dis-
 ay of    rnographic photos, molestation, and direct requests for sexual favors. The
 Tokyo nape Crisis Center stated that office rapes account for a "substantial share"
 of rape cases. In Japan media attention has focused on sexual harassment following
 an April equal employment opportunity complaint action against a U.S. subsidiary
 of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation.
 The number of illegal female workers decreased in 1995, paralleling the decrease
 in illegal male workers that began in 1993. According to the Ministry of Justice, 3.4
 percent of illegal female immigrants work in occupations involving prostitution.
 However, human rights groups estimate that the figure is actually much higher.
 The Government is working to reduce the foreign prostitution problem by enforcing
 existing antiprostitution laws as well as provisions in the Immigration Control and
 Refugee Recognition Act directed against anyone "encouraging a person to engage
 in illegal work." In recent years, police, especially in Tokyo, have conducted a num-
 ber of sweeps against bth foreign prostitutes andtheir employers.
 The position of women in socie ty, although significantly improved during the last
 few decades, continues to reflect deep-seated traditional values that assign women
 a subordinate role in the workplace. Although discrimination by private employers
 against women is prohibited by the Constitution, it persists. Legislation has been
 
 
 685
 enacted over the past 30 years to accord women the same legal status as men. The
 Equal Employment Opportunity Law of 1986 was aimed at eliminating sex discrimi-
 nation in such areas as recruitment, promotion, and vocational training. Yet the law
 does not expressly forbid discrimination in recruitment, hiring, assignment, and pro-
 motion of workers; it merely states that "employers should endeavor" to avoid it.
 Under this law and other regulations, the Ministry of Labor attempts to encourage
 corporate compliance with its objectives by positive inducements; it does not enforce
 compliance through fines or other punitive measures.
 Although the Equal Employment Opportunity Law prohibits discrimination
 against women in wages, female workers on average earned only 62 percent of aver-
 age male earnings. Much of this disparity results from the "two-track" personnel ad-
 ministration system found in most larger companies. Under this system, newly
 hired employees are put into one of two categories: managerial track (those engaged
 in planning and decisionmaking jobs and with the potential to become top execu-
 tives), or clerical track (those engaged in general office work). According to a 1995
 Ministry of Labor survey, 72 percent of companies responding said they hired only
 male workers for managerial track jobs. Female workers have also suffered dis-
 proportionately from the continued sluggishness of the economy: in 1995 only 28
 percent of companies hired both male and female managerial track workers, down
 from the 46 percent that did so in 1992.
 Public awareness of discrimination against women and sexual harassment in the
 workplace has increasedL A growing number of government entities are establishing
 hot lines and designating ombhudsmen to handle complaints of discrimination and
 sexual harassment. Nevertheless, sexual discrimination and stereotyping in the
 workplace continue to be major problems for women.
 In 1993 the Prime Minister publicly acknowledged and apologized for the former
 Imperial Government's involvement in the army's practice of forcing an estimated
 200,000 women (including Koreans, Fiipinas, Chinese, Indonesians, Burmese,
 Dutch, and Japanese) to provide sex to soldiers between 1932 and 1945. Five cases
 concerning the "comfort women" problem are pending in the Tokyo District Court.
 In four cases the plaintiffs are seeking monetary compensation; in one case the
 plaintiff is seeking an official apology from the Government.
 The Asian Women's Fund was established in July 1995 as a private, government-
 sponsored fund to compensate former comfort women. The fund will support three
 projects. The first will provide direct compensation payments to individual victims
 and will be financed entirely through private donations. A second project will pro-
 vide medical and welfare assistance to individual comfort women. A third will fund
 projects to improve the general status of women and girls in Asia. The second and
 third projects will be funded by the Government and administered by the fund. The
 Asian Women's Fund is having trouble reaching its funding goals and finding
 former comfort women willing to accept compensation payments. In August four
 former comfort women from the Philippines agreed to accept compensation pay-
 ments from the fund. Each received a lump-sum payment of $18,600 (2 million yen)
 and a letter of apology signed by Prime Minister Hashimoto.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare, and in
 general, the rights of children are adequately protected. Boys and girls have equal
 access to health care and other public facilities. There is no societal pattern of abuse
 against children.
 In recent years, the problem of severe bullying, or ijime," received greater public
 attention. It involves verbal or physical abuse in middle and high schools. In 1995,
 56,601 cases of bullying in elementary and secondary schools were reported to the
 Education Ministry, but many cases go unreported. The Education Ministry also re-
 ported five suicides among elementary and secondary school students related to bul-
 lying in 1995, but the actual number of cases was probably higher. In August 1994,
 the Ministry of Justice established the Office of Ombudsman for Children's Rights
 to cope with bullying and other children's issues. In addition to compiling statistics
 on bullying and consulting with various groups concerned with children's welfare,
 the Office of Ombudsman provides counseling services for children 18 years of age
 and younger who have been victims of bullying.
 People With Disabilities.-Although not generally subject to overt discrimination
 in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services, the disabled
 face limited access to public transportation, =mainstream" public education, and
 other facilities. Japan has no national law protecting the rights of the disabled, in-
 cluding access andemployment, but some prefectures and cities have enacted their
 own legislation addressing the issue. Despite the disabled's lack of legal protection,
 there is growing societal awareness of the issue.
 Indigenous People.-The Ainu, a people descended from the first inhabitants of
 Japan, now probably number fewer than 100,000; almost all of them live on
 
 
 686
 Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands. Their primary occupa-
 tions are fishing, small-scale farming, and jobs in the tourism industry. As a result
 of a law passed in 1899, the Former Aborigines Protection Act, the Ainu today con-
 trol only approximately 0.15 percent of their original landholdings. Ainu leaders
 continue to express grievances about this situation. Meanwhile, the Ainu continue
 to face societal discrimination while engaging in an uphill struggle against complete
 assimilation.
 The Government has done little in response to Ainu grievances. An interagency
 study group opened hearings in January 1990 with the stated goal of reviewing
 Ainu history and making recommendations, but it has not been active. In March a
 special advisory council headed by former Supreme Court Justice Masami Ito, which
 was appointed during the Murayama administration, issued a report calling for new
 legislation to address the situation of Japan's Ainu minority. Some Ainu activists
 are critical of the report because it did not recommend that the Ainu be formally
 designated as an indigenous people. Other Ainu leaders, however, are satisfied with
 the report and believe that pus ing harder for special recognition will be counter-
 productive. The Hashimoto Administration has set up an interagency committee to
 study the Ito report and possible new Ainu legislation. The committee plans to have
 its proposals ready for Diet consideration in 1997.
 In 1994 Shigei Kayano became the first Ainu member of the Diet when he
 gained a seat in the upper house. Kayano has drawn attention to Ainu issues.
 Nation l/RaciaI/Ethnic Minorities.-The ethnocentric nature of Japanese society,
 reinforced by a high degree of cultural and ethnic homogeneity and a history of iso-
 lation from other cultures, has impeded the integration of minority groups. This pri-
 marily affects Burakumin, Koreans, and alien workers.
 The Burakumin (descendants of feudal era "outcasts" who practiced "unclean" pro-
 fessions such as butchering and undertaking), although not subject to governmental
 discrimination, are frequently victims of entrenched societal discrimination includ-
 ing restricted access to housing and employment opportunities. They are estimated
 to number approximately 3 mlion, but most prefer to hide their identity. Beginning
 in 1969, the Government introduced with some success a number of social, eco-
 nomic, and legal programs designed to improve conditions for the Burakumin and
 hasten their assimilation into mainstream society. In recent years, however, some
 within the Burakumin community have questioned whether assimilation is an ap-
 propriate goal. The Government has extended basic legislation to provide funding
 for Burakumin programs until 1997, but the Burakumin continue to lobby for a new
 law that will expand current programs.
 Despite improvements in Japan's legal safeguards against discrimination, Korean
 permanent residents (most of whom were born, raisedL and educated in Japan and
 who are estimated to number approximately 700,000) are still subject to various
 forms of deeply entrenched societal discrimination. In 1993 the Government halted
 the fingerprinting of permanent foreign residents. Instead of fingerprinting, the
 Government has established a family registry system that uses the residents pic-
 ture and signature and contains information on parents and spouses living in
 Japan, a system similar to that used for Japanese nationals. The current law leaves
 intact the requirement that all foreign residents carry alien registration certificates
 at all times.
 In recent years, the Government has enacted several laws and regulations provid-
 ing permanent resident aliens with equal access to public housing and loans, social
 security pensions for those qualified, and certain public employment rights. Some
 immigrants reportedly face police harassment and discrimination in obtaining hous-
 ing, jobs, and health care. In recognition of the difficulties faced by foreigners in
 these areas, the city of Tokyo has issued a law to prevent housing discrimination
 against foreigners.
 The January 1991 Memorandum Between the Japanese and South Korean Gov-
 ernments extended employment rights to local government positions, giving each lo-
 cality the authority to decide which jobs may be held by non-Japanese nationals.
 Local governments are also being urged by the Government to allow Korean resi-
 dents to take the Teacher Entrance Examination and to employ them on a full-time
 basis. Private-sector employment and societal discrimination are still common. Anti-
 discrimination laws affecting Korean residents were initiated as government guid-
 ance and are not supported by penalty provisions. In May, in the first court test
 of the antidiscrimination laws, the Tokyo District Court ruled against a second-gen-
 eration Korean nurse who sued the Tokyo Metropolitan Government on the grounds
 that she had been refused consideration for promotion because she is not Japanese.
 The Court held that constitutional guarantees of freedom to choose one's career do
 not apply to the employment of foreigners in local civil services. The nurse has ap-
 pealed to a higher court.
 
 
 In May the Kawasaki city government and several other local governments agreed
 to allow resident foreigners, most of whom are Koreans, to take civil service exams
 for nonsupervisory jobs. In response to this development, the Home Affairs Ministry
 sent a letter to all prefectural and municipal governments on June 3, citing the
 Tokyo District Court ruling and urging these governments not to drop a Japanese
 nationality requirement for their employees. However, the Home Affairs Ministry
 has no legal authority to interfere in the personnel decisions of local governments,
 and there is no law stipulating Japanese nationality for jobs with prefectural or
 local governments. Apparently in response to pressure from the Home Affairs Min-
 istry, the Kochi prefectural government and the Osaka city government dropped
 plans to allow foreigners to apply for civil service jobs.
 By law, aliens with 5 years of continuous residence are eligible for naturalization
 and the simultaneous acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right to vote.
 In fact, however, most eligible aliens choose not to apply for citizenship, in part due
 to fears that their cultural identity would thereby be lost. De facto obstacles to natu-
 ralization include broad discretion available to adjudicating officers and great em-
 phasis on Japanese language ability. In February 1995, the Supreme Court ruled
 that the Constitution does not bar permanent foreign residents from voting in local
 elections. However, the court also ruled that existing laws denying voting rights to
 foreign residents are not unconstitutional.
 The Immigration Bureau of the Justice Ministry estimated that, as of May 1,
 there were 284,500 foreign nationals residing illegally in Japan, a decrease of 0.8
 percent from the previous year. Illegal immigrants come primarily from: South
 Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, China, Peru, Iran, Malaysia, and Taiwan.
 While many illegally resident foreigners came in search of better paying manufac-
 turing and construction jobs, these opportunities decreased during the economic
 slowdown. Thus, more of the foreign workers are unemployed or marginally em-
 ployed. Some illegal alien workers have been exploited. Activist  u  claim that
 employers can easily discriminate against foreign workers, who oftn have little or
 no knowledge of the Japanese language or their legal rights. The Government at-
 tempts to deal with the problem of ilegal workers within the bounds of existing law.
 It has tried to reduce the inflow of illegal foreign workers by prosecuting employers.
 Recent revisions of the Immigration Law provide for penalties against employers of
 undocumented foreign workers. Suspected foreign workers may also be denied entry
 for passport, visa, and entry application irregularities. The Government continues
 to study the foreign worker issue, and several citizens' groups are working with ille-
 gal foreign workers to improve their access to information on worker rights.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of workers
 to associate freely in unions. Approximately 24 percent of the active work force be-
 longs to unions. Unions are free of government control and influence. Most unions
 are involved in political activity as well as labor relations, but they are not con-
 trolled by political parties. The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (RENGO),
 which represents 7.8 million Japanese workers and was formed in 1989 through the
 merger of several confederations, is the largest labor organization. There is no re-
 quirement for a single trade union structure, and there are no restrictions on who
 may be a union official. Members of the armed forces, police, and firefighters are
 not permitted either to form unions or to strike. These restrictions have led to a
 long-running dispute before the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee
 on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations over observance of ILO
 Convention 98 concerning the right to organize and bargain collectively. The Com-
 mittee has observed that these public employees have a limited capacity to partici-
 pate in the process of determining their wages and again in June asked the Govern-
 ment to consider any measures it could take to encourage negotiations with public
 employees.
 Unions are active in international bodies, most notably the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions and maintain extensive international contacts. The
 right to strike, implicit in the Constitution, is exercised. During 1994, 85,000 worker
 days were lost to strikes. The law prohibits retribution against strikers and is effec-
 tively enforced. Public employees do not have the right to strike, although they do
 have recourse to mediation and arbitration. The Government determines the pay of
 government employees based on a recommendation by the independent National
 Personnel Authority.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain CoUectiely.-The Constitution provides
 unions with the right to organize, bargain, and act collectively. These rights are ex-
 ercised freely, and collective bargaining is practiced widely. The annual "Spring
 Wage Offensive," in which individual unions in each industry conduct negotiations
 
 
 simultaneously with their firms, involves nationwide participation. Management
 usually consults closely with its enterprise union. However, trade unions are inde-
 pendent of management and aggressively pursue the interests of their workers.
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law, and adequate mechanisms exist for
 resolving such cases as do exist. As noted above, the collective bargaining rights of
 public employees are limited.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Standards Law pro-
 hibits the use of forced labor, and there are presently no known cases of forced or
 compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the revised Labor Stand-
 ards Law of 1987, minors under 15 years of age may not be employed, and those
 under the age of 18 years may not be employed in dangerous or harmful work. The
 Labor Inspection Division of the Ministry of Labor rigorously enforces child labor
 laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are set on a regional (prefec-
 tural) and industry basis, with the input of tripartite (workers, employers, public
 interest) advisory councils. Employers covered by a minimum wage must post the
 concerned minimum wages, and compliance with minimum wages is considered
 widespread. Minimum wage rates, which averaged approximately $50 (5,388 yen)
 per day in 1995, are considered sufficient to provide workers and their families with
 a decent living. The Labor Standards Law provides for a 40-hour workweek for most
 industries and mandates premium pay for hours worked over 40 in a week, or 8

 The Ministry of Labor effectively administers various laws and regulations gov-
 erning occupational health and safety, principal among which is the Industrial Safe-
 ty and Health Law of 1972. Standards are set by the Ministry of Labor and issued
 after consultation with the Standing Committee on Safety and Health of the Tri-
 partite Labor Standards Commission. Labor inspectors have the authority to sus-
 pend unsafe operations immediately, and the law provides that workers may voice
 concerns over occupational safety and remove themselves from unsafe working con-
 ditions without jeopardizing their continued employment.
