 SAINT VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 A member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organization of Eastern Car-
 ibbean States, St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a parliamentary democracy. Prime
 Minister James F. Mitchell and his New Democratic Party (NDP) returned to power
 for an unprecedented third term in free and fair elections held in February 1994.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police, the only security force in the country, includes a
 Coast Guard and a small Special Services Unit with some paramilitary training.
 The force is controlled by and respnsive to the Government, but there continued
 to be occasional reports of the use of force and other extralegal means to elicit con-
 fessions from suspects.
 St. Vincent has a market-based economy in which most of the work force is em-
 ployed in agriculture. The leading export product is bananas, which also represents
 the major source of foreign exchange earnings. The banana industry throughout the
 Windward Islands continues to suffer from relatively low prices on the world ba-
 nana market, and St. Vincent has not escaped the negative impact. Efforts toward
 nontraditional economic diversification met with some success in new agricultural
 products, luxury tourism expansion, and in some industrial sectors.
 The country's human rights problems continued to include persistent allegations
 of police use of physical force to extract confessions, the Governments's failure to
 punish those involved in such abuse, inadequate and overcrowded prisons, and an
 overburdened court system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kidling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. However, a very high percentage of convictions (estimated
 at 90 percent by the regional human rights group, Caribbean Rights) continue to
 be based on confessions. Many of these confessions resulted from unwarranted police
 practices, including the use of physical force during detention, illegal search and sei-
 zure, and not prorrly informing those arrested of their rights. There were no
 known instances of the Government trying, convicting, and punishing police officers
 involved in such abuses.
 There is no independent review beard to monitor  lice activity and to hear public
 complaints about police misconduct. Caribbean Rights has advocated such a board
 to protect the rights of citizens complaining of these activities.
 Inadequate and overcrowded prisons remain a serious problem. These conditions
 are particularly harsh for juvenile offenders. There is a small facility for delinquent
 boys, but it is seriously inadequate and is generally used for those already convicted
 through the criminal system. Although separate legal statutes exist for youthful of-
 fenders, there are no separate magistrates or prosecutors to handle such cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.*The Constitution provides for persons de-
 tained for criminal offenses to receive a fair hearing within a reasonable time by
 an impartial court. Although there are only two official magistrates, the registrar
 of the High Court and the p residing judge of the family court now effectively serve
 as magistrates when called upon to do so. While this reduced the backlog, com-
 plaints remain regarding police practices in bringing cases to court. Some defense
 attorneys claim this has caused 6- to 12-month delays in preliminary inquiries for
 serious crimes.
 There were no reports of instances of arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile.
 
 
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for public trials before
 an independent and impartial court. The court appoints attorneys for indigent de-
 fendants only when the defendant is charged with a capital offense. Defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty and may appeal cases to a regional high
 court system and ultimately to the Privy Council in the United Kingdom. There are
 no separate security or military court systems. There were no reports of political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary search and seizure or other government intrusions
 into the private life of individual citizens, and there were no reports of such abuses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Seeh and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. There are two major newspapers and numerous smaller, partisan
 publications; all are privately owned, and most are openly critical of the Govern-
 ment's policies. There were no reports of government censorship or interference with
 the operation of the press.
 The lone television station in St. Vincent is privately owned and operates without
 government interference. The Government controls programming for the govern-
 ment-owned radio station, which was ordered by the high court to omit certain
 words from a popular calypso song supporting capital punishment. The injunction
 was sought by the president of the St. Vincent and Grenadines Human Rights
 Group. There are no call-in talk shows; the Government canceled such a show in
 1988, claiming it was politically slanted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 inpractice.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. There
 were no reports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status;
 however, government practice remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through regularly scheduled
 free and fair elections. St. Vincent has a long history of multiparty parliamentary
 democracy. During the last elections in 1994 the two opposition parties united to
 challenge the ruling New Democratic Party. he effort was successful to the extent
 that the "Unity" coalition won 3 of 15 parliamentary seats-the NDP held all 15
 prior to the election. The opposition continues to charge that the ruling party has
 not complied with what the opposition asserts is a constitutional obligation to an-
 swer questions it puts forth. In August a long-dormant party, the People's Party
 (PP), was reactivated in response to alleged financial misconduct by the Attorney
 General. The PP, however, holds no seats in Parliament.
 Two of the 15 members of Parliament are women. The same two women hold min-
 isterial portfolios in the current Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Opposition political groups and the Vincentian press often comment on human
 rights matters of local concern. The St. Vincent and Grenadines Human Rights As-
 sociation, affiliated with the regional body Caribbean Rights, closely monitors gov-
 ernment and police activities, especially with respect to treatment of prisoners, pub-
 licizing any cases of abuse. The Government is generally responsive to public and
 private inquiries about its human rights practices. In February human rights
 groups strongly criticized the Government over the executions of three prisoners on
 death row. The    ups charged that the process was conducted in virtual secrecy
 and pushed for clemency procedures to be clearly established for the benefit of death
 row prisoners across the region.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law regardless of race,
 sex, or religion and the Government adheres to this provision.
 Women.-A focal human rights group reports that violence against women (par-
 ticularly domestic violence) is a major problem. The Government has failed to take
 
 
 524
 steps to determine the seriousness of the problem. To speed up the judicial handling
 of such cases, the Government established a family court under the Domestic Vio-
 lence Act of 1995.
 Depending on the magnitude of the offense and the age of the victim, the penalty
 for rape is generally 10 or more years in prison. In May the legislature amended
 the child support law to allow for payments ordered by the courts even though no-
 tice of an appeal has been filed. Previously, fathers who had been ordered to pa
 child support could appeal decisions and not pay while the appeal was being he
 This resulted in a huge backlog of appeal cases and effectively reduced the number
 of mothers and children receiving support payments.
 The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Women's Affairs has a women's desk which
 assists the National Council of Women with seminars, training programs, and pub-
 lic relations. The minimum wage law specifies that women should receive equal pay
 for equal work.
 Children.-The Social Welfare Office is the government agency responsible for
 monitoring and protecting the welfare of children. The police are the enforcement
 arm-the Social Welfare Office refers all reports of child abuse to the police for ac-
 tion. A progress report on government implementation of the Convention on the
 Rights of the Child was under preparation at years end. Marion House, a social
 services agency established by the Catholic Church in 1989, provides counseling and
 therapy services. The legal age of consent in St. Vincent is 15.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation covering those with dis-
 abilities. Most severely disabled people rarely leave their homes because of the poor
 road system and lack of affordable wheelchairs. The Government partially supports
 a school for the disabled which has two branches. A separate, small rehabilitation
 center treats about five persons daily.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-By law, citizens have the right to form unions, orga-
 nize employees, and strike; these rights are generally respected in practice. A move
 toward unification reflects the need for unions to combine in order to survive. There
 were no major strikes. Unions have the right to affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-There are no legal obstacles
 to organizing unions; however, no law requires employers to recognize a particular
 union as an exclusive bargaining agent. Some companies offer packages of benefits
 with terms of employment better than, or comparable to, what a union can normally
 obtain through negotiations. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employ-
 ers against union members and organizers. Generally effective mechanisms exist for
 resolving complaints. The authorities can order employers found guilty of antiunion
 discrimination for firing workers without cause (including for participation in union
 activities) to reinstate the workers.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children-The law sets the minimum work-
 ing age at 16, although a worker must be 18 to receive a national insurance card.
 The labor inspection office of the Ministry of Labour monitors and enforces this pro-
 vision, and employers generally respect it in practice. There is no known child labor
 except for children working on family-owned banana plantations, particularly during
 harvest time.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages, which were last
 promulgated in 1989. They vary by sector and type of work and are specified for
 several skilled categories, including attendants, packers, cleaners, porters, watch-
 men and clerks. In agriculture the wage for workers provided shelter is $0.82
 (EC$2.25) per hour, skilled industrial workers earn $7.36 (EC$20) per day, and un-
 skilled workers earn $3.68 (EC$10) per day. In many sectors the minimum wage
 is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for workers and their families,
 but most workers earn more than the minimum. There is no legislation concerning
 the length of the workweek; however, the generalapractice is to work 40 hours in
 5 days. The law provides workers a minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks.
 According to the Ministry of Labour, legislation concerning occupational safety
 and health is outdated. The most recent legislation, the Factories Act of 1955, has
 some regulations concerning only factories, but enforcement of these regulations is
 ineffective due to a lack of inspectors. Workers can remove themselves from dan-
 gerous workplace situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
