 HONG KONG
 Hong Kong, a small, densely populated British dependency, is a free society with
 legally protected rights but without a broad democratic base. Its constitutional ar-
 rangements are derined by the Letters Patent and Royal Instructions. Executive
 powers are vested in a British Crown-appointed Governor who holds extensive au-
 thority. The judiciary is an independent body adhering to English common law with
 certain variations. Fundamental rights ultimately rest on oversight by the British
 
 
 966
 Parliament. In practice, however, Hong Kong largely controls its own internal af-
 fairs.
 A well-organized civilian police force maintains public order and respects the
 human rights of the populace.
 Hong    ong aree market economy continued its transition toward becoming a
 shipping, marketing, and finance center. It serves as an investment center of trade
 with China and as a communication and transportation hub for Asia. Annual per
 capita gross domestic product increased by 6 percent in 1992 to a projected $16,420.
 The Bill of Rights, passed in June 1991, continued to make an impact on legisla-
 tive process and-criminal law. The 1-year freeze, during which six laws relating to
 law and order were exempted from the bill, was lifted in June. Although the Gov-
 ernment established a subcommittee to educate the public on human rights, it re-
 jected calls for the establishment of a human rights commission which would have
 had oversight over the implementation of the bill. The impact of the bill has been
 limited by a court ruling that individuals may not invoke it in disputes with other
 private citizens.
 The principal human rights problem is the inability of citizens to change their
 government. Discrimination and violence against women are continuing human
 rights concerns.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kidling.-There were no reports that such
 killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of any disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other extreme forms of abuse are forbidden by law and subject to pun-
 ishment. In 1992 an investigation into allegations of police brutality during a dis-
 turbance in 1989 at a campior Vietnamese boat people resulted in disciplinary ac-
 tion against 42 officers. No criminal proceedings were recommended, largely because
 of a lack of clear evidence identifying the officers involved. Individual acts of police
 brutality occurred. From January to September, about 1,200 allegations of police as-
 sault were lodged. The total number of complaints against the police during this pe-
 riod numbered about 2,350. As of August, 41 cases were substantiated. Disciplinary
 action can range from criminal proceedings to dismissal or warnings. Complaints
 are investigatedby an internal police unit, subject to outside review. The authorities
 rejected calls from some legislators that investigations should be conducted by an
 independent body.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-British legal protections and common law
 traditions govern the process of arrest and detention and ensure substantial and ef-
 fective legalprotections against arbitrary arrest or detention. Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Hong Kong's judicial and legal systems are orga-
 nized according to principles of British constitutional law and legal precedent and
 feature, inter alia, an idepndent judiciary and trial by jury. The right to a fair
 public trial is guarsnteed and respected in practice. The Government expanded eli-
 gibility for legal aid. Various court decisions striking down several presumption of
 guilt provisions as incompatible with the Bill of Rights made a substantial impact
 on criminal rights. A court decision also ruled that defendants have the right to trial
 without undue delay.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right of privacy is generally respected and provided for by law. Some human rights
 groups maintained that the amendments to the ordinances governing the Independ-
 ent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) did not go far enough to curb its powers.
 The ICAC is vested with powers which are normally exercised only by a judicial offi-
 cer. The amendments deprived the ICAC of its independent authority to issue arrest
 or search warrants, (it must now go to the courts.) but it still operates on the as-
 sumption that any excessive, unexplainable assets held by civil servants are consid-
 ered ill-gotten until proven otherwise.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There is a tradition of free speech and press
 as practiced in Great Britain. Numerous views and opinions, including those inde-
 pendent or critical of the British and Hong Kong Governments, are aired in the
 mass media, in public forums, and by political groups.
 International media organizations operate freely in Hong Kong, but restrictions
 may be placed on the press under several ordinances of Hong Kong law. However,
 such restrictions are rarely imposed. Hong Kong media representatives have ex-
 
 
 pressed concern over the provision of a 1988 ordinance that permits the censorin
 of a film if it would seriously damage good relations with "other territorial unit.
 In April the People's Republic of China (PRC) criticized the showing of a film on
 Tibet at a film festival and succeeded in preventing the showing of a documentary
 on life in Beijing. In September the local PRC-controlled press launched an attack
 against government-owned Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) for producing a tel-
 evision drama series which was viewed as anti-China. These attacks led to concern
 that self-censorship was rising when publishers were dealing with matters where
 the PRC is involved. Some observers said that publishers are reluctant to print any-
 thing that would jeopardize their business relations with the PRC. The FRC also
 objected to the Government's proposal to "corporatize" RTHK, giving rise to concern
 that the PRC wants to use it as a propaganda organ after 1997, when control of
 Hong Kong will ass to the PRC.
 In June the Gvernment applied the less restrictive British 1989 Official Secrets
 Act in place of the 1911 version. Removing from criminal sanction the unauthorized
 disclosure of the great majority of official information, the 1989 Act made it an of-
 fense to disclose such information only in six specific categories such as security
 intelligence, and defense. Critics favored replacing the 1911 Act with locall enacted
 legislation since the 1989 Act will be void after Hong Kong reverts to PRC sov-
 ereiga
 The &vernment refused to consider freedom of information legislation.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are practiced
 without significant hindrance although the amended Societies Ordinance requires
 office holders to notify the authorities of the formation of a society.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Government policy and general practice ensure freedom
 Of RlIio.
 fL Pidom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Travel documents are obtainable freely and easily, subject to neither
 arbitrary nor discriminatory practices. There is freedom of movement within Hong
 Kong.
 By 1991 more than 200,000 Vietnamese had arrived in Hong Kong seeking refu-
 gee status. Prior to June 1988, they were automatically accorded refugee status.
 Thereafter they were screened to determine their status and were held in prison-
 like detention centers awaiting resettlement in other countries or repatriation to
 Vietnam. As of late November, 12 Vietnamese had arrived in 1992 following agree-
 ments reached in late 1991 that provided for the mandatory repatriation to Vietnam
 of those determined not to be refugees, the immediate screening of new arrivals, and
 the decision by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to cease provid-
 ing a reintegration subsistence allowance.
 A February riot claimed the lives of 24 Vietnamese who burned to death in a hut
 barricaded shut by other detainees. This clash, fueled by tensions between northern
 and southern Vietnamese, resulted in the trial of 42 (still ongoing in December) and
 a reexamination of camp management practices. A slow response by police, with an
 inadequate number of personnel on duty was blamed for the severity of the tragedy.
 Most of the 13 recommendations made by an independent commissioner appointed
 after the riot were implemented. A recommendation to add personnel to accelerate
 screening was aimed at keeping the camp population from languishing in a state
 of uncertainty. At year's end, even with augmented staff, the authorities had com-
 pleted determination of status only through 1989 arrivals. Reintegration assistance
 programs from the European Community, the Hong Kong Government, and most re-
 cently, the United States, provided incentives for those not eligible for resettlement
 to return to Vietnam. Of those found ineligible for resettlement or notyet screened,
 more than 12,000 persons voluntarily returned to Vietnam by ear's en
 The Government maintained its policy of forcibly returning Chinese citizens to the
 People's Republic of China, except in rare instances in which a person qualified as
 a refugee within the meaning of the U.N. Protocol Relating to the Status of Refu-
 gees. In 1992 an average of 88 illegal immigrants, mostly young men, were arrested
 every day and were returned.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 While Hong Kong is a free society, with most individual freedoms and rights pro-
 tected by law and custom, citizens of the territory do not have the right to change
 their government. The Governor is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the
 Crown. He is advised on policy by an Executive Council which he appoints. Legisla-
 tion is enacted and funds are provided by the Legislative Council, which also de-
 bates policy and questions the administration. Although the legislature has virtually
 no power to initiate legislation, it has become more assertive since the September
 
 
 968
 1991 direct elections. The Governor has ultimate control of the administration of
 Hong Kong, but, by convention, he rarely exercises his full powers. In practice, deci-
 sions are arrived at by consensus. Political parties and independent candidates are
 free to contest seats in free and fair elections. Representative government employing
 universal franchise, however, does not exist. Only 18 of 60 legislators were elected
 by universal suffrage. Of the rest, 21 were either appointed by the Governor or are
 themselves government officials. Another 21 were elected by functional groupings,
 e.g, lawyers. Functional constituencies disproportionately represent the economic
 and professional elites and, moreover, violate the concept o one  rson-one vote,
 since voters in functional constituencies may vote both in a functional and a geo-
 graphic constituency.
 In his first policy address in October, the Governor introduced several proposals
 to make the 1995 legislature more democratic. If ado ted b the Legislative Council,
 they will greatly increase the franchise by givin all eligible voters in the working
 population of 2.7 million a second vote in one of 30 functional constituencies. The
 Election Committee, which will elect 10 legislators, will draw all or most of its mem-
 bers from the local district boards, which will henceforth be directly elected, rather
 than one-third appointed, as is the case now. The number of legislators to be elected
 by universal suffrage will increase to 20. China has denounced these proposals and
 warned that any changes which do not 'converge" with the Basic Law, Hong Kong's
 post-1997 Constitution, will be dismantled after the PRC resumes its exercise of sov-
 ereignty in 1997. However, both the British and Chinese Governments earlier
 agreed that the number of legislators to be elected by universal suffrage in 1995
 will increase to 20.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no official barriers to the formation of local human rights groups. The
 Government has consistently cooperated with international and. nongovernmental
 organizations on human rights issues. The UNHCR and nongovernmental human
 rights organizations have full access to Hong Kong's camps for Vietnamese boat peo-
 ple.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Chinese language has egual status with English in many government oper-
 ations. The Government is continuing its efforts to place Hong Kong Chinese in sen-
 ior positions, but progress has been slow, especially in the legal and police depart-
 ments and the judiciary.
 Violence and discrimination against women remain significant problems. The only
 legislation to protect the rights of battered women is the 1987 Domestic Violence
 Ordinance, which enables a woman to take out a 3-month injunction on her hus-
 band. This may be extended to 6 months. In addition, domestic violence may be
 prosecuted as common assault under existing criminal statutes. The Government
 enforces these laws and prosecutes violators.-Nevertheless, women's action groups
 are pressing for better legal and government provisions for battered wives. They call
 for public housing to house women as soon as they leave their violent husbands.
 Harmony House, a private voluntary agency and the Social Welfare Department op-
 erate two homes which offer refuge to a small number of women.
 Many instances of domestic violence, however, are not reported, owin partly to
 cultural factors which frown on exposing family crises to the public eye tut also to
 a lack of well-publicized information about the assistance and resources available.
 In September the police, working with Harmony House, announced the availability
 of leaflets setting out new guidelines for the police to deal with the issue of domestic
 violence and providing victims with information about their legal rights and the as-
 sistance available.
 Women face discrimination in the areas of employment, salary welfare, and pro-
 motion. In March the Government set up a working group to look into the problem
 of discrimination against women in emplo  ent and toadIse whether the Govern-
 ment should extend the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against
 Women to Hong Kong. Nevertheless, the Government itself admitted that it was
 "cautious" in its response to calls to accede to the Convention and to set up a wom-
 en's commission. While a number of women hold senior appointive government posi-
 tions, only two women were elected to the legislature.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of association and the right of workers to
 establish and join organizations of their own choosing are guaranteed under local
 law. Trade umons must be registered under the trade unions ordinance. The basic
 precondition for registration is a minimum of 7 persons who serve in the same occu-
 
 
 969
 pation. The Government does not discourage or impede the formation of unions.
 During 1991, 21 new unions were registered. Nevertheless only about 489,000
 workers (or 17.5 percent) out of a total labor force of 2.8 million belong to one.of
 the 511 registered unions, most of which belong to one of three major trade union
 federations.
 Work stoppages and strikes are permitted. However, there are some restrictions
 on this right for civil servants. Employees hired on a contract basis may be fired
 for breach of contract if they walk off the job. Hong Kong labor unions may form
 federations, confederations, and affiliate with international bodies. Any affiliation
 with foreign labor unions requires the consent of the Government. All such requests
 have been granted.
 As a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, Hon Kong is not a member in
 its own right of the International Labor Organization (ILO). The United Kingdom
 makes declarations on behalf of Hong Kong conceri   the latter's obligations re-
 garding the various ILO conventions. To date, Hon orng has implemented provi-
 sions applying 29 conventions ih full and 18 others With modifications. In the Basic
 Law, the PRC undertook to continue to adhere to these conventions after 1997.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivey.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is guaranteed by law. Hong Kong laws pertaining to collective
 bargaining cover mainl the shipping, textiles, public transport, pubIgc utility, and
 carpentry trades and the catering, construction, public service, an teaching profes-
 sions. Wages are determined by market factors. While collective bargaining does
 take place, it is not widely practiced, and in general there are no mechanisms spe-
 cifically to encourage it. Unions generally are not powerful enough to force manage-
 ment to engage in collective bargaining. The Government does not encourage it,
 since the Government itself does not engage in collective bargaining with civil serv-
 ants' unions but merely "consults" them. Free conciliation services are afforded by
 the Labor Relations Division of the Department of Labor (DOL) to employers and
 employees involved in disputes dealing with arrears of wages, wages in lieu of no-
 tice, severance pay, breaches of contractual employment terms, etc. This division is
 charged with finding a mutually acceptable settlement, although it does not have
 the authority to impose a solution. The division is not required by law to allow
 unions to represent employees in these proceedings. Instead, union representation
 depends upon the mutual consent of both the employee and the employer.
 Workers are protected against antiunion discrimination under Hong Kong legisla-
 tion. Employees who allege such discrimination have the right to have their cases
 heard by the DOLs Labor Relations Division. Employers who attempt to prevent
 or deter an employee from joining a labor union, or who terminate an employee for
 joining a labor union, are liable to a fine of approximately $650. However, the em-
 loyer are not required to reinstate the employee or to compensate him. Individual
 fabor claims are also adjudicated by the labor tribunal, a part of the judicial branch,
 which is supposed to provide quick and inexpensive machinery for resolving certain
 types of disiutes. The tribunal complements the conciliation service provided by the
 Labor Relatins Division. Union leaders complain, however, that the tribunal takes
 too long-an average of 133 days-to hear workers cases.
 There are no export processing zones in Hong Kon.
 c. Prohibition  Forced or Compulsory Lbr.-Exsting labor legislation prohibits
 forced labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Employment of Children Reg-
 ulations prohibit the empo oent of children under age 15 in any industrial estab-
 lishment. Children aged 13 and 14 may be employed in certain nonindustrial estab-
 lishments, subject to conditions aimed at ensuring a minimum of 9 years' education
 and protecting their safety, health, and welfare. During 1991, 8 campaigns against
 the employment of children covered about 27,000 establishments and found 39 chil-
 dren working in violation of the law, according to the Annual Report of the Commis-
 sioner for Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage. Aside from a
 small number of trades and industries where a uniform wage structure exists, wage
 levels are customarily fixed by individual agreement between employer and em-
 ployee and are determined by supply and demand. In view of continued tightness
 in Hong Kong's labor market (unemployment averaged about 2 percent for 1992),
 wage increases were given to most workers, particularly those in the construction
 industry and service sectors. Many employees also enjoy a year-end bonus of a
 month's pay or mere. Some employers in the manufacturing sector provide workers
 with various kinds of allowances, free medical treatment, and free or subsidized
 transport.
 There are no legal restrictions on hours of work for men. The Women and Young
 Persons (Industry) Regulations under the Employment Ordinance control hours and
 
 
 970
 
 conditions of work for women and young people aged between 15 and 17. Hours of
 work are limited to 8 per day and 48 per week between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. for
 women and between 7 am. and 7 p.m. for persons age 16 or over. Overtime is re-
 stricted to 2 hours per day and 200 days per year for women and is prohibited for
 all persons under 18 in industrial establishments. The regulations also prohibit
 women and young persons from working underground or, with the exception of
 males aged 16 and 17, in dangerous trades. The  abr nsptorate conducts work-
 place inspections to ensure compliance with these regulations. During 1991 it car-
 ried out 220,828 inspections of almost 27,000 establishments in industrial and
 nonindustrial sectors, which resulted in 567 prosecutions of employers. The employ-
 ment of underaged workers is generally not a serious problem.
 The DOL. Factory Inspectorate sets basic occupational safety and health stand-
 arch, provides education and publicity, and follows up with enforcement and inspec-
 tion in accordance with the Fatories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance and
 subsidiary regulations. The Inspectorate pays particular attention to safety in high-
 risk areas of factories and construction sites. During 1991 inspectors visited 24,682
 factories and 1,181 construction sites and issued 1,393 summones. As part of a com-
 plementary effort, the DOL Occupational Health Division investigates claims of oc-
 cupational diseases and injuries at work, conducts environmental testing in the
 workplace, and provides medical examinations to employees in occupations that in-
 volve the handling of hazardous materials. The small number of inspectors-about
 200-and the inability of workers to elect their own safety representatives weaken
 the enforcement of safety and health standards at the workplace.
