 MOZAMIQUE
 Mozambique has a constitutional government headed by President Joaquirn
 Chissano who was elected in the country's first multiparty elections in October
 1994. President Chissano and the leadership of his party, the Front for the Libera-
 tion of Mozambique (FRELIMO), which has ruled the country since independence
 in 1975, control policymaking and implementation. The National Assembly is the
 only multiparty body besides the defense force, and it continued to provide useful
 debate on national policy issues and began to generate proposals independently.
 Further, the Assembly's FRELIMO majority began to exert some authority with the
 executive with regard-to policymaking. Although the foundations of democracy re-
 main fragile, Mozambique's political transition continued to be largely successful
 and reintegration of areas controlled by the Mozambican National Resistance
 (RENAMO) during the war continued, with tensions limited to only a few districts.
 The judiciary, on occasion, openly discussed its weaknesses, but it remained unable
 to implement constitutional provisions safeguarding individual human rights or to
 provide an effective check on the executive branch.
 The lack of resources and political will has hampered the development of a non-
 partisan professional military. There are several forces responsible for internal secu-
 rity under the Minister of Interior-the Criminal Investigation Police (PIC), the
 Mozambican National Police (PRM) and the Rapid Reaction Police (PIR). The State
 Information and Security Service (SISE) reports directly to the President. These ill-
 trained and ill-disciplined units continued to be the focus of much controversy.
 Members of the security forces committed numerous human rights abuses.
 Approximately 80 percent of the population is employed in agriculture, mostly on
 a subsistence level. Major exports are shrimp, sugar, cotton, and cashew nuts. The
 pace of transition to a market economy quickened. Privatization of state-owned en-
 terprises continued to advance. The gross domestic product grew 6.4 percent in 1996
 and was forecast to grow at a similar rate in 1997. Inflation fell to 4.6 percent in
 1997, down from 16.6 percent in 1996. Inflation through July was 5.3 percent. Al-
 though the general economic outlook improved with good rains and a good harvest,
 the economy and the Government's budget remained heavily dependent on foreign
 aid; the economy had a $575 million trade deficit in 1996, down from a $613 million
 trade deficit in 1995. Extensive corruption at all levels of the Government continued
 to be a problem. The annual per capita income of around $93 remains very low, and
 unemployment and underemployment are high.
 While the status of political and civil liberties improved, the Government's overall
 human rights record continued to be marred by a pattern of abusive behavior by
 the security forces and an ineffective judicial system that is only nominally inde-
 pendent from the FRELIMO-controlled executive. Poorly trained and undisciplined
 police forces and local officials continued to commit human rights abuses, including
 extrajudicial killings, excessive use of force, and arbitrary detention. Security forces
 and police routinely beat, tortured, or otherwise abused detainees, including street
 children. Extremely harsh prison conditions resulted in the deaths of dozens of in-
 mates. Arbitrary arrests and lengthy detentions without fair and expeditious trials
 remained problems. The judiciary lacks qualified staff and resources, is inefficient,
 does not ensure due process, and is subject to executive domination. The Govern-
 ment infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Government continued to restrict
 press freedom; the media remained largely owned by the Government and state en-
 terprises and manipulated by factions within the ruling party, but there was a
 greater criticism of government policies and an increase in thenumber of independ-
 ent media sources. Also, with increasd press and nongovernmental organization
 (NGO) scrutiny, even more abuses by security forces came to Iight than in previous
 years, and in some instances the Government investigated and punished those re-
 spnsible. However, in view of the common prce p tion that the police force is unreli-
 able and corrupt, many citizens resorted to mob justice. The Government limited
 freedom of assembly, and the law imposes some limits on freedom of association.
 A U.N. Development Program (UNDP) project to reform the police, which included
 
 
 training by the Spanish Guardia Civil, was suspended after an incident in which
 police shot and killed a Spanish doctor (see Section L.a.). The program was re-
 instituted later, and police retraining was expected to begin early in 1998. Societal
 discrimination and violence against women, and violence against children remain
 problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known cases of politi-
 cal killings, but there were reports of extrajudicial killings. In July a provincial
 RENAMO official charged that government officials killed two party members in
 Manica province.
 According to the Mozambican League of Human Rights (LDH), in July police were
 responsible for the death in police custody of Issufo Aly and Carlos Cossa, who were
 detained after trying to rob a motorist (see Section 1.b.). After the LDH sent a letter
 to Minister of the Interior Almerino Manhenje, the police stated that they would in-
 vestigate the matter. Later police officials reported that the two men died in a car
 accident while trying to escape. Their bodies were not recovered. The LDH reported
 that its investigation revealed that the two men were shot and beaten to death by
 police in a car in Matola, and that police agents intimidated and took money from
 s wife at her home the same night. Neither the police squadron commander nor
 the Interior Ministry provided further explanations.
 In July the LDH reported that Mendonca Rodolfo died after being beaten in a dis-
 cotheque by a police officer from the Catmbe police station. The case is still under
 investigation.
 In August a press report stated that police used truncheons to beat to death
 Carlitos Guambe, an alleged thief, in a Maputo precinct police station. Government
 officials have not investigated this Iqase.
 The LDH reported that 25-year-old Crescensio Sergio Muchange, an accused car
 thief, was beaten, tortured, and killed while in police custody at Matola a few days
 after his arrest on October 13. Muchange's family learned of his death in a radio
 broadcast and allowed the LDH to photograph his battered corpse at the central
 hospital morgue, where police failed to appear despite the League's appeal. The po-
 lice failed to report any investigation of the case.
 In January four police officers arrested and charged with the death of Frenque
 Tchembene in June 1996 were found guilty and sentenced to 7 years in prison. The
 tribunal court of the city of Maputo also ordered each officer to pay approximately
 $390 (39 million meticais) to the victim's family. At year's end, the victim's family
 had not received any money. The LDH reported that one officer was later released
 from custody pending an appeal, promoted, and transferred to another police sta-
 tion. Although in July the Interior Minister promised that he would reverse the pro-
 motion, this did not take place, and the officer still works at the police investiga-
 tions unit in Maputo.
 A policeman accused of killing a Spanish doctor in 1996 was found guilty of man-
 slaughter and sentenced to a year's imprisonment in December. He was also ordered
 to pay an indemnification of about $390 (39 million meticais) in compensation to the
 family of the victim.
 Extremely harsh prison conditions led to the deaths of many persons in custody
 (see Section 1.c.).
 Mob and vigilante killings continued to be common. For example, in August resi-
 dents of a Maputo suburb beat to death a man accused of robbery. Several inde-
 pendent press sources, as well as the LDH, reported that villagers in Macia district
 have buried alive at least three persons accused of theft or witchcraft. According to
 the LDH, Macia residents have also forced other suspected criminals to swallow bat-
 tery acid. There were reports during the year that Regulos (traditional chiefs) and
 Curandeiros (traditional healers) had imposed and carried out death sentences
 against persons accused of witchcraft, two of the cases in Macia.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 According to the League of Human Rights and family members, in July, Issufo
 Aly and Carlos Cossa were last seen alive in police custody. The LDH accused the
 police of killing the two men and disusing of their bedies. The authorities failed
 to conduct a thorough investigation, claiming that the men died while trying to es-
 cape. Aly and Cossa remained missing at year's end.
 According to the LDH, Abdul Mota, a suspected car thief who disappeared in 1996
 after an argument with an officer of the paramilitary "Lightning Brigade" died by
 fire in a mined area.

 There reportedly has been no investigation into the allegation that RENAMO
 holds kidnaped children in Niassa province.
 The fate of thousands of citizens who disappeared during the civil war still re-
 mains unresolved.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture and cruel or inhuman treatment, but
 the police forces continued to commit serious abuses. The police often used excessive
 force, and there were continuing reports that police routinely beat and whipped de-
 tainees. In July Benedito Zinocacassa, the PRM chief of general staff, admitted that
 police commit human rights abuses and violations. At a 5-week police training
 course in February, district and precinct police commanders admitted that various
 types of crimes and corruption are committed by police officers, including rape, ex-
 tortion, theft, and bribe taking. The Sunday week  paper Domingo reported in June
 that a [olieman in a Maputo suburb beat and kicked a pregnant woman for walk-
 ing in frnt of the precinct station. The precinct commander, Campiao Faduco, re-
 ported that the officer had been arrested.
 Corruption in the police forces extends throughout the ranks, and the PRM used
 violence and detention to intimidate people frm reporting abuses. In August during
 a course on human rights, Interior Minister Almerino Manhenje denounced the ille-
 gal and corrupt practices of the police force. In September the daily Diario de
 Mocambique reported that a police officer supplied carjackers with arms for a July
 carJacking incident. Other news sources reported similar cases of police collusion
 with caijackers. In July 1996, the Director of the Criminal Investigation Police
 (PIC), Domingos Maita, publicly stated that the police forces are infiltrated by crime
 syndicates.
 RENAMO officials continued to allege that on numerous occasions police har-
 assed, detained, and beat RENAMO members (see Sections 1.d., 2.b., and 3).
 The vast majority of these cases were never investigated. However, on occasion
 the Government took action to counter the abuses arising from police corruption and
 excessive use of force. In August Jacinto Cuna, spokesperson for the Maputo city
 police command, announced that in an effort to combat rampant corruption, the po-
 lice force had expelled 46 officers within the past 2 months for extortion, bribe tak-
 ing, and drunkenness. There were isolated instances of disciplinary action in other
 parts of the country. There were no developments in the case of the alleged police
 torturers of the workers of the Mozambican National Airlines in 1995. The trial has
 been delayed twice. Two of the victims are crippled for life.
 Police continue to extort money from street vendors (predominately widowed and
 divorced women), beating them and confiscating their produce. Police also continued
 to beat street children (see Section 5).
 In May the Government used force to break up RENAMO demonstrations. Police
 used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds.
 In December the Interior Minister attacked the generalized misconduct of the
 country's traffic police, especially for demanding bribes from motorists on the
 Ressano Garcia highway and other roads. While there were no new reports, there
 were credible 1996 reports that: the paramilitary "Lightning Brigade" guarding the
 Ressano Garcia-Maputo road continued to beat and torture suspected car thieves,
 keeping them shackled for days without due process.
 There were no reports of an official investigation into the 1996 allegations made
 by Tome Fernandes, a RENAMO official, that the police had intimidated RENAMO
 members in Cabo Delgado province. As the charges were made by RENAMO, such
 an investigation was unlikely.
 There was no new information available on the status of the criminal case against
 "PROTEG," a private security force, for torturing an official of the Commercial Bank
 of Mozambique in 1994; the victim received indemnification in a civil trial in 1996.
 Prison conditions throughout the country are extremely harsh and continued to
 deteriorate; they continued to pose a severe threat to inmates' life and health. Sani-
 tary conditions are below minimum international standards. There is little medical
 care and insufficient food. In July Francisco Macopa, a delegate from the Institute
 of Judicial Assistance (IPAJ), reported that authorities at the principal police sta-
 tion in Lichinga, Niassa province, fed the prisoners only once a day. A June report
 by Radio Mozambique indicated that authorities in the Maputo civil prison some-
 times feed the inmates only once a day and that 48 prisoners were suffering from
 malnutrition.
 In his March State of the Nation address, President Chissano acknowledged the
 necessity of prison reform. The prisons remain severely overcrowded, generally hold-
 ing four times, and in one instance, six times, as many prisoners as they were built
 to hold. Quelinane has 406 prisoners in a prison built to hold 90; Manica has 900
 in a prison built to hold 300; and Beira has 800 in a prison built to hold 200.
 
 
 Maputo central prison has 1,800 persons in a prison built to hold 800; Beira central
 prison has 532 in a prison built to hold 120; Tete provincial prison has 400 in a
 prison built to hold 90; Machava maximum security prison near Maputo has about
 2,000 prisoners in a facility built to hold 500.
 As in 1996, Minister of Justice Jose Abudo acknowledged that irregularities and
 abuses continued to take place in prisons throughout the country. In July members
 of the Parliamentary Commission on Social and Environmental Affairs reported the
 lack of sanitary conditions and overcrowding in the majority of Manica prisons that
 they visited. The deputies reported that most prisons lacked adequate water sup-
 plies because of burst pipes. Naariho Mourinho, a  a      .a provincial attorney, re-
 ported that the prisons in the provincial capital of Beira do not meet the minimum
 conditions for human habitation. In June Beira central prison inmates told Sofala
 province Governor Felisberto Tomas that a lack of proper medical care had led to
 outbreaks of sexually- transmitted and skin diseases.
 There were many reports of deaths in overcrowded prisons. For example, in Au-
 gust the administrative director of the Nampula civil prison reported that the ex-
 tremely poor sanitary conditions caused deaths due to diarrhea and tuberculosis. In
 May Joaquim Manuel reported that police had imprisoned him without charge for
 a month in the Machava central prison, where he contracted tuberculosis due to the
 extremely unsanitary conditions. After throwing up blood for 6 days, Manuel re-
 ported that the police sent him to the Machava general hospital, but ordered him
 to be handcuffed to his bed during his 3 months of treatment. He was later released
 from prison.
 In order to combat poor prison conditions, the Ministry of Justice continued to ex-
 pand the food cultivation program it began in 1996. For example, the Tete provincial
 prison superintendent, Marcos Cumbane, reported in July that prisoners are able
 to grow food on a prison farm and that they had harvested approximately 20 tons
 of corn durin the 996-1997 season. The Mozambican League of Human Rights re-
 ported that the Lichinga provincial prison also used prison farming to supplement
 inmates' diets. A January newspaper article reported that prison officials at the Rex
 prison, 13 kilometers from Nampula, had instituted prisoner farming in order to
 provide rice, potatoes, and fruits to inmates. The Ministry also attempted to in-
 crease the budgets of some prisons. For example, in July the Director of Zambezia
 Central Prison, Felix Nharregulas, stated that the Zambezia district jail in Gurue
 received a pproximately $8,500 for renovations.
 Although the majority of cases of abuse in prison are due to overcrowding and
 lack of food and medical attention, prisoners continued to report regularly police
 beatings, rapes, and demands for money in exchange for freedom. In June the
 Mozanibican League of Human Rights alleged that guards continued to torture in-
 mates in the Mac ava central prison. A January press article reported that guards
 at Machava central prison demand money from family members to deliver food to
 prisoners and threaten to keep prisoners in their cells with urine and feces unless
 the family members pay for its removal.
 Many pretrial detainees are minors who are incarcerated with adult inmates. For
 example, in July the Zambezia provincial prison director reported that at least 50
 male minors were in the main prison, and that all had been there for several
 months without trial or formal charges (see Section 5). The League of Human
 Rights stated that 14- and 15-year-olds were imprisoned in the Machava central
 maximum security prison, without being formally charged. Nazarinho Mourino re-
 ported that the Beira city prisons housed many children under the age of 16. As
 a result, child molestation and other violence against children were rampant in the
 country's prisons. In June Justice Minister Abudo acknowledged that during his vis-
 its to prisons, police were detaining minors. Military and civilian prisoners are held
 in the same prisons.
 International and national human rights grups are given access to prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution providet that the dura-
 tion of preventive imprisonment be set by law; however, the police continue to arbi-
 trarily arrest and detain citizens. Under Law 2/93, the maximum preventive impris-
 onment is 48 hours. Within that time period, a detainee has the right to have hisl
 her case reviewed by judicial authorities, after which he/she can be detained up to
 another 60 days while the case is investigated by the PIC. In cases where a person
 is accused of a very serious crime, such as a security offense or one requiring a sen-
 tence of more than 8 years, he/she may be detained up to 84 days without being
 formally charged. If a court approves, such detainees may be held for two more peri-
 ods of 84 days each while the police complete the investigation process. In practice,
 however, the authorities either are not aware of these reglations or ignore these
 rules, as well as a detainee's constitutional right to counseland to contact relatives
 or friends. For example, an August 30 Noticas article reported that the charging
 
 
 judge in a narcotics case incorrectly stated that the police could detain a person for
 up to 90 days before charges were filed. The Attorney General's office offered a cor-
 rection to this misconception in a September Noticias article. Although Law 19/91
 provides definitions of crimes against-the State, such as treason, terrorism, and sab-
 otalke, the Government retains the discretion to determine crimes that constitute se-
 cunty offenses.
 The law provides that if the prescribed period for investigation has been com-
 pleted and no charges have been brought, the detainee must be released. In prac-
 tice, however, this law is often ignored, in part because of the severe lack of admin-
 istrative personnel, trained judges, and sufficient lawyers to monitor the judicial
 system (see Section i.e.).
 Most citizens are unaware of their rights, particularly those granted under the
 Constitution, Law 2/93 and the Penal Process Code, and detainees can spend many
 months, even years, in pretrial status. In August the chief prosecutor for the city
 of Maputo; Joao Julio Mutisse, publicly announced that there were pretrial deten-
 tion irregularities in Maputo prisons, where prisoners can remain for more than 3
 weeks without attending a hearing presided over by a judge. He stated that in many
 cases the preventive detention period had expired without the authorities freeing or
 charging the detainees, but that this abuse was due to a severe shortage of qualified
 judicial authorities to review cases. In June detainees in the Beira central prison
 complained that most had been in jail for over 6 months without a trial.
 The bail system remains poorly defined, and prisoners, their families, and NGO's
 continued to complain that police and prison officials often take bribes to release
 those who can afford to pay. In an April 1996 letter by a group of inmates at
 Machava central prison to a national newspaper, the prisoners charged that police
 officers beat and tortured them, sexually abused prisoners and their wives, and de-
 manded money for food and sometimes freedom. In January several wives of in-
 mates in the Machava central prison alleged that guards were forcing sexual favors
 from them in return for food for their husbands.
 In March the National Assembly passed a new law that established judicial repu-
 lations regarding the trafficking and use of narcotics. The law specifies that the
 legal period of preventive detention in drug trafficking cases is 10 days. The law
 also authorizes a long period of investigation-up to 9 months-in cases involving
 drug smuggling, drug production and transfer, and criminal association.
 Authorities were unable to reduce the large backlog of prisoners awaiting trial.
 In May the provincial commander in Nampua,Armando Ossufo, admitted that the
 overcrowding in Nampula prisons was due to the delay in court hearings for detain-
 ees in preventive detention. The Tete provincial prison held 153 detainees among
 its 400 prisoners, and Machava central prison held 31 detainees among its 90 pris-
 oners. According to the Mozambican League of Human Rights, the Machava central
 prison held 667 detainees among its 2,000 prisoners, its female section held 18 de-
 tainees among its 30 prisoners. The Cuamba district prison held 19 detainees
 among its 25 prisoners.
 In July the RENAMO district representative in Murrupula, Patrico Jose Ussene,
 alleged that the district government was persecuting and detaining RENAMO mem-
 bers. In August a Newsfax article reported that police arrested 11 RENAMO mem-
 bers in a Maputo suburb for allegedly defaming the Government. No further infor-
 mation was available at year's end.
 In May the Government broke up RENAMO demonstrations and police arrested
 several demonstrators (see Section 2.b.).
 The Constitution expressly prohibits exile, and the Government does not use exile
 as a form of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution formally established an inde-
 endent judiciary and specifically states that the decisions of the courts take prece-
 ence over all other authorities and individuals and must be obeyed. Nevertheless,
 the executive, and by extension the FRELIMO Party, continued to dominate the ju-
 diciary. Judges largely owed their positions to the ruling FRELIMO Party, which
 continued to exercise significant influence on all aspects of public life through the
 executive and party organs.
 The President appoints the President and Vice President of the most important
 tribunal, the Supreme Court. The President also appoints the Attorney General.
 These selections are then sent to the National Assembly for approval. Although the
 Supreme Council of Judicial Magistrates assembles a list of qualified persons, the
 President selects the justices from the list. No National Assembly approval is need-
 ed for these choices. The National Assembly began to assert its prerogatives in the
 judicial area when it formulated a proposal for the combat of narcotic use and drug
 trafficking. This law established strict guidelines and judicial penalties for such il-
 licit behavior.
 
 
 There are two complementary formal justice systems: The civil/criminal system,
 which includes customary courts; and the military. A 1991 law empowered the Su-
 preme Court to administer the civil/criminal system; it also hears appeals, including
 military cases, although the Ministry of Defense administers the military courts.
 Below the Supreme Court there are provincial and district courts. There are also
 special courts that exercise limited subject matter jurisdiction, for example, adminis-
 trative courts, customs courts, fiscal courts, maritime courts, and labor courts. Mi-
 nors 16 years old and younger fall under the jurisdiction of a court system for mi-
 nors. Through this legal channel the Government can send minors to correctional,
 educational, or other institutions. The Penal Code contains legal guidelines for the
 judicial treatment of minors and forbids the imprisonment of minors below the age
 of 20. However in several instances (see Section 1.d.), credible reports indicated that
 the judicial system had ordered the incarceration of minors in common prisons
 throughout the country.
 As with the provincial and district courts, the specialized and minor court systems
 are ineffective because they suffer from a lack of qualified professionals. Civilians
 are not under the jurisdiction of, or tried in, military courts. Local customary courts
 handle matters such as estate and divorce cases.
 Persons accused of crimes against the State are tried in regular civilian courts
 under standard criminal judicial procedures. The Supreme Court has original juris-
 diction over members of the National Assembly and anyone else who is immune
 from trial in the lower courts. The Constitution calls for the creation of a constitu-
 tional council, but the Government has not yet passed implementing legislation for
 this council. In the absence of this body, the Supreme Court is tasked with ruling
 on issues of constitutionality.
 A judge may order a trial closed because of national security interests or to pro-
 tect the privacy of the plaintiff in cases concerning rape.
 In regular courts, all accused persons are in theory presumed innocent and have
 the right to legal counsel and the right of appeal, but the authorities do not always
 respect these rights. The great majority of the population is either unaware of these
 rights or does not possess the means to obtain any form of legal counsel. In his
 March State of the Nation speech, President Chissano acknowledged that there was
 a shortage of qualified judicial personnel. In 1996 Supreme Court President Dr.
 Mario Mangaze reported that there was only one licensed judge in Cabo Delgado,
 Gaza, and Zambezia provinces, respectively. He reported that there were districts
 with no courts or judges at all; he further acknowledged that lack of human and
 financial resources and problems with outdated legislation impeded the judiciary's
 effectiveness. In September Cipriano Nhane, the General Secretary of the Supreme
 Court, reported that the judicial system lacked the means to employ more mag-
 istrates. Re noted that the shortage of personnel was causing an enormous backlog
 of cases. For example, in Nampula province, the provincial court had one judge and
 a backlog of 3,655 cases. The President of the Supreme Court announced in Septem-
 ber that the court system was unable to render justice, given its severe shortage
 of resources. He added that the situation in the court system and the Attorney Gen-
 eral's offices was calamitous.
 The Government undertook several initiatives in order to combat this shortage.
 In March the Attorney General's office began a year-long training course for 30 per-
 sons to become district attorneys. With international financing, the Supreme Court
 established training courses for judicial magistrates, a 3-month revision course for
 licensed judicial magistrates, and a year-long initial training course for magistrates,
 both at the district level. International assistance is providing funds for the training
 of judicial magistrates and legal cadres at all levels.
 At the fifth ordinary session of the Judicial Council, the President of the Supreme
 Court stated that there were instances in which judicial personnel violated such
 human rights as the rights to a fair and speedy trial, to counsel, to humane treat-
 ment, and to equal protection of the law. The Higher Council of the Judicial Mag-
 istrate (CSMJ), the body responsible for overseeing professional behavior among
 magistrates, reported in September that 13 out of a total of 130 judges were dis-
 ciplined for corruption between 1994 and 1997. The report noted that the actual
 total could be higher, but that there was a lack of resources to investigate all the
 allegations of abuse. Some of the offenses cited included abuse of power, bribe-tak-
 ing, illegal release of prisoners, and delaying of cases.
 Exacerbating the judicial system's weakness is the lack of licensed attorneys, with
 fewer than 130 in the country and the vast majority centered in Maputo. In an ef-
 fort to replace the public organization previously responsible for providing counsel
 for indigent defendants, some NGO's, such as the Mozambican League of Human
 Rights and the Association of Mozambican Women in Judicial Careers, offered lim-
 ited legal counsel at little or no cost. In July the LDH announced the deployment
 
 
 of 16 paralegals in Maputo and Nampula provinces. These paralegals provide assist-
 ance for people in the defense of their legal and human rights.
 Despite the judicial system's infrastructural and personnel weaknesses, it has
 begun to take some initiative. In June the Attorney General's office requested hear-
 ings on three National Assembly deputies, all allegedly involved in criminal activi-
 ties. In August the Assembly's permanent commission granted this permission.
 In February, after a lengthy investigation, the Attorney General's office filed a
 case with the Supreme Court against the presiding judge of the Manica provincial
 court. He is accused of murdering his domestic servant. During the month-long in-
 vestigation, the judge continued to preside over the Manica court.
 Efforts to reintegrate RENAMO-controlled zones into central administrative struc-
 tures continued, but RENAMO still exercised informal control over a number of
 areas through a rudimentary form of civil administration and traditional courts,
 with extensive use of traditional authorities as judges. In April a report in Noticias
 alleged that local RENAMO officials in Zitundo, Matutuine district, Maputo prov-
 ince, were encouraging RENAMO members to disregard local governmental institu-
 tions. In June the Government sent a force of rapid intervention police to Maringue,
 one of RENAMO's strongholds during the civil war, in order to enforce local admin-
 istration.
 In March RENAMO deputies in the National Assembly called for a national truth
 and reconciliation commission to investigate all human rights violations in the coun-
 try since 1962. The suggestion led to considerable debate in the Parliament but ulti-
 mately was not approved.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right of privacy and expressly forbids the use of sur-
 veillance techniques. By law police need a warrant to enter homes and businesses.
 Although there are fewer reports of such activity, incidents of illegal telephone wire-
 tapping by government intelligence agencies allegedly still occur. Security forces
 keep watch on RENAMO members and supporters and other members of the opposi-
 tion.
 In a July session, Parliament forced the Government to withdraw an article from
 the proposed law on defense and security that called for people to collaborate with
 the SISE security police, essentially as citizen informants. The bill was passed in
 July without the objectionable provision.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution, the 1991 Press Law, and the
 1992 Rome Peace Accords provide for freedom of expression and the press but with
 restrictions in cases involving national defense considerations. Although there was
 an increase in criticism of Government policies and in the number of independent
 media sources, the Government continued to restrict press freedom. While criticism
 of the President is not legally prohibited, the 1991 Press Law holds that, in cases
 of defamation against the President, truth is not sufficient defense against libel. Al-
 though this law has not been tested in court, it has resulted in considerable self-
 censorship, and there was almost no direct criticism of the President. Some journal-
 ists faced legal action for defamation during the year, but these cases were based
 on allegations that private citizens were corrupt, not on libel against political fig-
 ures. Journalists who criticized government officials or policy were at times sub-
 jected to threats and intimidation.
 Media reporting on parliamentary debates and repeated delays in scheduling local
 elections covered all political viewpoints.
 The Government continued largely to dominate the media, which reflected a bias
 toward state interests. The Government and state enterprises own the greaterpart
 of the country's media, including Mozambique's two daily newspapers, the only Sun-
 day newspaper, the only weekly news magazine, and the national radio and tele-
 vision stations. However, there are also four independent daily faxed media, four
 independent weekly news magazines, plus independent radio and television stations.
 The Government's wire service, the Mozambican News Agency, includes reports
 from all independent media in its daily English and Portuguese transmittals. Radio
 Mozambique, the public's most important source of information, is government
 owned, but its news coverage is considered unbiased and fair. It receives the largest
 single subsidy from the state budget of any public company. Government media are
 showing greater transparency in reporting and some independence of editorial con-
 tent. The most partisan of the government-controlled print media, the weekly
 Tempo magazine, suspended printing early in the year. Independent media outside
 the two principal cities continue to develop, mostly with the financial assistance of
 international donors.
 
 
 Independent broadcast, print and faxed media are well established in the capital
 city, albeit precariously funded. One faxed news daily is directly linked to the prin-
 cipal opposition party, several other independent faxed dailies are nonpartisan; one
 faxed daily concentrates on economic and commercial news. Two independent week-
 ly newspapers appear regularly in Maputo and are trying to improve their circula-
 tion outside the capital.
 While the independent press carried opposition viewpoints and generally enjoyed
 far greater credibility, its influence (and that of the official press as well) is limited
 largely to Maputo and the provincial capitals because of the logistical difficulty of
 distribution of any publication in rural areas. Only a small minority of the popu-
 lation receives news through either television or the print media. Daily national
 newspaper sales average 84,000 in a nation of 15 million people mainly due to the
 high cost of newsprint.
 State-funded Radio Mozambique (RM) is the nation's most important source of in-
 formation. It broadcasts in Portuguese and a number of indigenous languages; its
 external service broadcasts in English as well as in Portuguese for the Mozambican
 community in neighboring South Africa. RM regularly airs public debates that in-
 clude a variety of participants with differing opinions. Voice of RENAMO (VOR)
 signed an agreement with British partners linked to British Greenland Television
 and now operates as Radio Terra Verde (RTV). There are also some church-spon-
 sored independent radio stations that now offer news broadcasts.
 Both the state television station (TVM) and the independent channel RTK TV
 have links with Portuguese television stations. TVM broadcasts live to Maputo and
 retransmits the following day in Beira and Nampula. Its coverage of Parliament and
 politicians extends to both sides of the aisle.
 The government-owned wire service, the Mozambican News Agency (AIM), pro-
 duces daily English and Portuguese language news summaries for export and sub-
 scription that regularly cite items from the nonpartisan independent as well as the
 government press and radio services.
 Members of the news media perceived a government warning in the form of ad re-
 buke by the state-controlled Higher Council of Social Communication (CSCS). The
 CSCS issued a communique criticizing some media elements for unethical behavior
 in response to two critical articles published by the state daily Diario de
 Mocambique and the opposition fax sheet Imparcial. The articles complained about
 government policy toward multinational corporations and supposed FREL bO con-
 trol of the journalists' union, respectively.
 The Government's disinformation campaigns against RENAMO continued and
 even increased because of forthcoming local elections.
 Government domination of newspaper printing presses led to allegations of official
 harassment of the independent press, but there was no evidence that this affected
 publication or content of the inaependent publications. Official harassment of the
 independent press has decreased slightly.
 The Prime Minister's information office continues to informally monitor press con-
 tent.
 Thee reae no formal restrictions on academic freedom. In practice, however, public
 school teachers routinely adhere to self-censorship since their employment depends
 on the State. Private educational institutions, both church related and secular, are
 well established and are continually expanding in several cities at the secondary
 and university level. Press reports on university forums routinely cite opinions from
 public as well as private university students and teachers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association; however, the Government limited this right on
 several occasions, The law regulates public demonstrations and establishes the judi-
 cial regime for the exercise of this right. The law does not cover private gatherings,
 held indoors and by individual invitation, nor does it cover religious gatherings or
 election campaigning.
 Although the law permits the exercise of the right to gather or demonstrate peace-
 fully, it prevents full exercise of this right through restrictive  te limitations. The
 law states that marches, parades, and processions can be held on Saturdays, Sun-
 days, holidays, or between 5:00 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. The law provides for possible
 exceptions to this regulation, if justified, but such decisions are not made in an open
 and established manner. Further, the law states that any organizers of gatherings
 or demonstrations must submit a notice, with at least 10 signatures, for the holding
 of any such demonstration, along with a justification of the purpose of the gather-
 ing, to civil and police authorities. The law stipulates that the Government must
 remit any objection to such propsals within 2 days of receiving the request, and
 that no reply within this period can be understood to mean governmental accept-
 ance.

 In May the Government forcefully broke up a series of demonstrations throughout
 the country organized by RENAMO provincial leaders. In some cases, the police
 used tear gas and rubber bullets to break up the crowds. In other cases, police ac-
 tion preempted the beginning of marches. Press reports indicated that the Govern-
 ment used the Rapid Intervention Polie (PIC), a well, trained and well armed elite
 unit with the PRM, to break up the demonstrations. Some reports stated that police
 fired live rounds into the air, but this was not confirmed.
 In the various locations, police arrested several demonstrators, including some of
 RENAMO'sprovincial and district representatives, as well as one parliamentary
 deputy. RENMO representatives stated that they had filed their notifications in
 a tim'ely manner and that the Government had not expressed opposition to the
 plans, or had expressed opposition to the plans after the 2 days stipulated in the
 law. Government officials insisted that RENAMO organizers had not filed notifica-
 tions as required by the law. In September the Nampula provincial court began tak-
 ing statements from the 15 persons detained in the May demonstration in Nampula,
 including RENAMO's provincial political official, Ossufo Momade. At year's end,
 there had been no conclusion to this case.
 In September the city government of Maputo approved an application for the
 Mozambican Campaign Against Landmines (CMCM), an umbrella NGO, to organize
 a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Maputo during business hours on
 a weekday. CMCM organizers reported that they had full government cooperation
 and a police escort during their demonstration.
 The law provides for freedom of association, albeit with some limitations. Legisla-
 tion romulgated in 1991 sets forth the process for the registration of political par-
 ties. There are over 15 registered, active political parties. Under 1992 legislation,
 a political party must demonstrate that it has no racial, ethnic, or religious exclu-
 siveness and secure at least 2,000 signatures of citizens in order to be recognized
 legally.
 Other groups and associations continued to organize themselves or become more
 active, including three new human rights groups (see Section 4).
 The Government requires nonpolitical groups, except religious organizations, to
 register, but it rarely rejects applications from new associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides that all citizens have the free-
 dom to practice or not to practice a religion and gives religious denominations the
 right to pursue their religious aims freely. The Government respects these rights in
 practice. The Government does not require religious organizations or missionaries
 to register and routinely grants visas to foreign missionaries. The Constitution also
 gives religious groups the right to own and acquire assets, and these institutions
 are allowed by law to operate schools.
 Relations between the Government and religious organizations continued to im-
 prove as the Government sought political support from these organizations in the
 multi party system.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right to live anywhere within national
 territory and to travel within the country and abroad. The Government no longer
 requires citizens to obtain permits from local authorities in order to travel within
 the country.
 Security force roadblocks and patrols continued to affect freedom of movement.
 Police harassment throughout the country's road network continued, with many in-
 cidents of officers demanding bribes. The police regularly stopped foreign pedestri-
 ans within Maputo city limits and ordered them to present original passports. In
 many instances, the police would not accept notarized copies. (People do not like to
 carry the originals of documents because there is a high risk they will be stolen.)
 Failure to produce passports resulted in fines. Confiscating people's possessions
 under flimsy pretexts also continued, especially on the main road to and from the
 South African border.
 During the year, Mozambique began to again play a role as a country of asylum
 for refugees from nearby countries. The Government cooperated with the UnitedNa-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organiza-
 tions in assisting refugees, including providing first asylum.
 In September, 85 Burundians sought refuge in Niassa province, reportedly after
 Tanzania and Malawi refused to grant them refugee status. Immigration officials in
 Niassa began to move the refugees to Maputo, where refugee claims are processed.
 Similarly, Tete city in Tete province experienced an influx of-refugees, primarily
 from Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Burundi. Tete migration
 director Jaime de Sousa reported in March that 298 persons from Somalia and the
 former Zaire arrived in Tete via Zambia between January and February. By May
 the number had increased to 371 persons, with 242 from Somalia, and 92 from the
 
 
 236
 former Zaire. De Sousa reported that most of these persons had no travel documents
 and were attempting to reach South Africa. In July the refugee support group direc-
 tor, Fernando Fazenda, reported that there were 400 refugees living at the Massaca
 H center near Maputo, a UNHCR facility.
 In June Minister of the Interior Almerino Manhenje reported that some of the
 asylum seekers from Burundi, Somalia, Rwanda, and Liberia were in fact smugglers
 or criminals rather than true political refugees.
 In May the Catholic Bishop of Tete, Paulo Mandlate, and the Episcopal Commis-
 sion for Refugees and Displaced People (CEMIRDE) reported that the refugees in
 Tete province were living under very poor conditions, with little space, inadequate
 sanitation facilities, and with a shortage of clothes, food, and tents.
 There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared
 persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides that citizens have the right to elect their representa-
 tives by universal, direct, secret, and periodic elections. In October 1994, citizens
 freely exercised for the first time their right to vote in multiparty elections, which
 United Nations and other national and international observers declared to be free
 and fair. President Chissano was elected, with the ruling FRELIMO Party winning
 129 of the 200 National Assembly seats. The largest opposition party, RENAMO,
 made a strong showing in the elections, winning majorities in the country's five
 most populous provinces. Although there is a FRELIMO majority in the Parliament,
 in the three 1997 sessions, the opposition parties succeeded in pressuring the Gov-
 ernment to withdraw several proposals for further evaluation, including in July the
 withdrawal of a key article in the defense policy bill.
 These developments demonstrated the continued institutional evolution of the
 Parliament. However, the FRELIMO majority ensured that the National Assembly
 did not provide any significant check on the power of the executive branch. The ex-
 ecutive continued to gain parliamentary approval on even the most controversial is-
 sues, such as the revision of the Land Law.
 The President and the FRELIMO leadership continued to control policymaking
 and implementation, and FRELIMO members hold all cabinet positions and provin-
 cial governorships, even the governorships in provinces where RENAMO had won
 overwhelming majorities in the 1994 elections. In September President Chissano an-
 nounced the 'reassignment" of the governor of Cabo Delgado province. No reasons
 were given for this removal, and no replacement was announced.
 During the year, there were tensions between the Government and RENAMO in
 some provinces. In July the Government sent over 100 rapid intervention police offi-
 cers to Maringue, RENAMO's former military stronghold, to ensure that the local
 government officials there were able to function freely. In turn, RENAMO par-
 liamentarians complained of a lack of support from provincial and district officials
 during visits to their constituencies. However, working relationships between the
 parties at the national and local level appeared to improve late in the year, and
 there was a reduction in the number of areas where FRELIMO administrators con-
 tinued to accuse RENAMO officials of running parallel government structures and
 harassing central government appointed officials.
 In December 1996, the National Assembly approved the Municipalities Law, the
 first in a series of legislative measures governing local elections. In April the Na-
 tional Assembly passed the remaining pieces of legislation, which set local elections
 for 1997 in 33 of 450 municipalities throughout the country. The FRELIMO majority
 in Parliament and the Government stated that these were the only areas presently
 able to sustain local governments, and in June the Government announced that
 local elections would be held in the 33 municipalities on December 27. However, on
 October 28, the Assembly amended the law to postpone the local elections, and on
 November 12 the Council of Ministers declared that May 29, 1998, would be the
 new date for local elections. This decree energized voter registration efforts, which
 began on November 10. There is no schedule for elections in any districts beyond
 the original 33.
 Although RENAMO National Assembly deputies voted against the proposal for
 elections in just 33 localities, by year's end they had accepted the concept of grad-
 ualism.
 While there are no legal restrictions hindering women's involvement in govern-
 ment, cultural factors inhibit their political advancement. In March Presidential
 Minister for Social and Economic Affairs Eneas Comiche reported that women are
 excluded from institutions of governance and power. Nonetheless, 62 of the 250 (28
 percent) National Assembly deputies are women, even though these female deputies
 
 
 237
 are not believed to play a significant role in either the Parliament's or the individual
 parties' decisionmaing. In April President Chissano ordered the resignation of the
 only woman in his Cabinet, Minister for Social Action Coordination Alcinda Abreu.
 There are five female vice ministers.
 In May at FRELIMO's Seventh Party Congress, party leaders mandated that at
 least 30 percent of the two FRELIMO governing bodies must be female. The Politi-
 cal Commission met this mandate, however, the Central Committee fell just short,
 with 28.2 percent.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no legal obstacles to the formation of local human rights groups. During
 the year, several new human rights groups were established: Human Rights and
 Development (DHD), the Center for Democratic Services and Human Rights, and a
 democracy institute. Foro Mulher, the umbrella women's NGO group, continued its
 activities, which included the publication of periodic newsletters. The Mozambican
 League of Human Rights (LHR) reported that its legal office's caseload had in-
 creased to 556 complaints of human rights violations in 1996. Among the complaints
 were homicides, allegedly by the police, and domestic violence, labor disputes, and
 land conflicts that were not investigated or adjudicated. In August the DHD orga-
 nized and launched a campaign to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Uni-
 versal Declaration of Human Rights. The LHR has focused efforts on educating the
 public regarding its rights. It uncovered many of the grave abuses within the prison
 system. The Government has permitted the League access to Maputo and Nampula
 prisons under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. The League also publicly
 criticized widespread abusive behavior by the police and sent a letter to the Minister
 of Interior regarding the disappearance of Carlos Cossa and Issufo Aly (see Section
 1.b.).
 DHD held a workshop in August for the PRM to demonstrate to officers the im-
 portance of human rights. Follow-on seminars for the police forces throughout the
 country were planned.
 The Government has been receptive to visits by international human rights mon-
 itoring groups, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and the
 International Commission of Jurists.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution forbids discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or disability,
 but the Government does not ensure in practice that such discrimination does not
 occur.
 Women.-Although official statistics are not kept, according to health officials,
 women's groups, and other sources, violence against women-particularly beating
 and rape-is widespread, especially in rural areas. Many women believe that their
 spouses have the right to beat them, and cultural pressures make it highly unlikely
 for most women to press for legal action against abusive spouses. However, the
 Mozambican League of Human Rights reported a total of 97 complaints of domestic
 violence in 1996, which was significantly more than the year before. A group of
 women   NGO's, including   Women    in  Law   and   Development (MULEIDE),
 Mozambican Women in Education (AMME), and the Mozambican Women's Organi-
 zation (OMM), organized a 1997 campaign entitled "Everybody Against Violence."
 In July Ana Piedade Monteiro, the campaign's coordinator for MULEIDE, stated
 that as a result of the campaign MULEIDE received 36 complaints of domestic vio-
 lence between January and June.
 Although there is an increased awareness and reporting of domestic violence, in
 most parts of society such violence continued. MULEIDE reported that the vast ma-
 jority of its domestic violence complaints consisted of sexual assault by men against
 women and children. While rape can be prosecuted in the courts, there is no civil
 law that defines domestic violence as a crime. The police do not normally intervene
 in domestic disputes. Cases that do reach the courts deal with specific charges such
 as rape, battery, and assault. When victims of physical abuse are brought to the
 hospital, such cases are rarely registered as caused by domestic violence.
 Despite constitutional protections providing for the equality of men and women
 under law in all aspects of political, economic, social, and cultural life, civil and com-
 mercial legal codes that predate independence frequently contradict each other and
 the Constitution. Under the Law of the Family (through both court interpretation
 and precedent), the husband (or father) is the head of the household, and women
 (both wives and daughters), must ensure male approval of any and all undertakings
 that women assume. For example, in order to start a business, a woman must first
 
 
 have the written approval of her husband or father (or closest male relative). With-
 out this approval, a woman is unable to lease a building, obtain a loan, or contract
 for goods and services. The legal domicile of a married woman is her husband's
 house, and she may work outside the home only with the express consent of her
 husband.
 Family law dictates that a couple's possessions belong to the husband, and he has
 full authority to decide on the disposition of these goods. Upon the death of a hus-
 band, a widow is only fourth in line (after sons, fathers, and brothers) for inherit-
 ance of the household goods. Although the law states that the widow is entitled to
 half of the goods acquired during the marriage, in practice women rarely know of
 or insist upon this right.
 Women's groups continued to argue that the Constitution discriminates against
 women because it grants Mozambican citizenship to the foreign wife of a
 Mozambican man, but not to the foreign husband of a Mozambican woman.
 Customary law or traditional law offers women even fewer protections than family
 law. Unless a marriage is registered, a woman has no recourse to the judicial
 branch for enforcement of the few rights provided to women by the civil codes. Al-
 though women are the primary cultivators of family land in rural areas, under cus-
 tomary law they have no rights to the disposition of the land.
 Women constitute 51.5 percent of the population and are responsible for 52.4 per-
 cent of active economic production. Of this 52.4 percent, according to the latest
 available data, 91.8 percent are in the agro-fisheries sector. Women constitute 69.6
 percent of the illiterate population.
 Women continued to experience economic discrimination in practice. In March
 Presidential Minister for Social and Economic Affairs Eneas Comiche reported that
 in the workplace women receive lower pay than men in the same positions. In Feb-
 ruary the Secretary General of the National Union of Chemical, Rubber and Print-
 ing Workers (SINTIQUIGRA), Joaquim Fanheiro, stated that women are first in
 line in cases of layoffs. He reported that the number of local women's committees
 in his union had declined from 71 in 1994 to 57 in 1997 due to the reduction in
 the number of female workers caused by retrenchment.
 Although the Labor Law entitles a woman to 60 days of maternity leave, employ-
 ers often violate this right especially in cases of stillbirth. Sexual harassment is also
 widespread. In July one of Maputo's assistant district attorneys reported that it was
 common for employers to force female workers into having sexual relations with
 them.
 The revised Land Law, passed by the National Assembly in July, included specific
 articles ensuring the rights of land tenure for women.
 Women continued to have less access than men to educational institutions above
 the primary level. Although roughly equal proportions of male and female children
 enter primary school, by secondary school only 36 percent of students are female,
 and by technical or higher levels, only 20 percent are female. Discrimination against
 women is most apparent in rural areas where over 80 percent of the population live,
 and where women are engaged mainly in subsistence farming and child rearing,
 with little opportunity for schooling or access to health care.
 Women's NGO's continued to be very active in their efforts to highlight a variety
 of women's issues, including domestic violence, legal inequities, and economic
 empowerment. For example, women NGO's were active in lobbying for inclusion of
 articles protecting women's land tenure rights in the new Land Law. Although these
 groups have organized successful programs, their effectiveness is often limited be-
 cause the programs are concentrated in Maputo or other urban areas while the vast
 majority of women live in the rural areas.
 The Ministry of Education implemented aproject for educating girls, with pilot
 programs in two districts in each province. The mortality rate for children under
 the age of 5 is 200 per 1,000, and in the health sector the Government targeted ma-
 trnity and infant health and focused on immunizations for fertile women.
 In December 1995, the Government formed the Operative Group, a group compris-
 ing representatives from the 12 ministries and NGO's. The Government tasked this
 roUP with the implementation of the platform of action from the 1995 U.N. Fourth
 orld Conference on Women in Beijing. In August the Government launched its
 post-Beijing Plan of Action 1997-2000. Among its objectives are 50 percent rep-
 resentation of w'men in Parliament, 40 percent in government bodies, and 30 per-
 cent in local governments. The Government also announced that it would ratify
 international conventions regarding women.
 In September Foro Mulher, an umbrella for women's NGO's, comprising approxi-
 mately 21 registered members, organized a regional post-Beijing Conference, a fol-
 low-up to the national conference held in Maputo in 1996.
 
 
 239
 Children.-The Government has not made children's rights and welfare a priority,
 but admits that some children are in trouble. The educational system is over-
 crowded and corrupt. It is widely reported that school children (or their parents)
 must bribe teachers for passing grades. The National Institute of Educational Devel-
 opment estimates that about 60 percent of the children over the age of 6 are in
 school, but that because of population growth, the percentage of children in school
 is now decreasing.
 In June the Ministry of Social Action Coordination reported that there were 4,000
 registered street children, 1,050 in Maputo alone, receiving assistance from a vari-
 ety of NGO's, such as Friends of Children and the World Medical Organization.
 However, while the Ministry acknowledged that the number of actual street chil-
 dren far exceeded the number registered, it said that it had no concrete figures.
 The Government has made little attempt to alleviate the plight of the increasing
 number of urban street children, many of whom were orphaned by the war. In
 March Minister of Health, Dr. Aurelio Zilhao reported that 300,000 children trau-
 matized by the war require social reintegration. Police beat street children; street
 children also are sexually abused. In January 1996, a credible press article reported
 that police in Maputo imprisoned a 15-year-old child for 9 days with no recourse
 to justice for allegedly stealing a tape cassette. The police allegedly gave the child
 12 lashes before releasing him. In February 1996, a parliamentary deputy discov-
 ered five street children detained in a Montepuez, Cabo Delgado prison. Numerous
 reports during the year indicated that children are held in many prisons throughout
 the country, contrary to the law (see Section 1.c.).
 In November National Assembly delegates questioned Mateus Katupha, Minister
 of Culture, Youth and Sport, on plans to improve the situation of young
 Mozamnbicans. The Minister dealt mostly with the problem of child prostitution, and
 he announced an imminent crackdown on child brothels, pornography, and pimps
 in Maputo.
 Street children are beaten by police and are often victims of sexual abuse. In Au-
 gust the Sofala provincial director for the Ministry of Social Action, Antonia Charre,
 reported that the rights of children were often ignored in the province. In Tete prov-
 ince, an official of the Ministry of Social Action reported in August that 30 girls and
 2 boys were undergoing treatment for abuses due to child prostitution. The Govern-
 ment formed a provincial task force composed of representatives from five organiza-
 tions, including three ministries and the Mozambican Youth Association, in order
 to investigate these incidents. No report of the investigation had been released by
 year's end.
 In September the daily Diario de Mocambique reported that children are often
 used as bargaining chips to settle financial and other disputes in rural areas. Ac-
 cording to Domingoa do Rosario, a sociologist with the Cultural Patrimony Depart-
 ment, children are sometimes used as labor to settle outstanding economic accounts
 in rural areas.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the Constitution expressly states that "dis-
 abled citizens shall enjoy fully the rights enshrined in the Constitution," the Gov-
 ernment provided few resources to make this a reality. In September Vice Minister
 for Social Welfare Filipe Mandlate acknowledged that discrimination against the
 disabled exists. The Welfare Ministry assisted 775 disabled people countrywide
 through the Community-based Assistance Program, (Attendimento Baseado na
 Comunidade) launched in 1993. The program provided individual assistance to the
 disabled and their families and promoted preschool integration of disabled children.
 The Government has largely relied on NGO's to assist the disabled. Founded in
 1991, the Association of Mozambican Disabled (ADEMO) addresses the social and
 economic needs of the disabled. Since then, smaller NGO's have formed, such as the
 Association of Handicapped Military and Paramilitary Mozambicans (ADEMINO),
 which represents disabled demobilized soldiers, and the Association of Blind and
 Visually Impaired Mozambicans (ACAMO). Early in the year, ACAMO initiated a
 program to create two artisan cooperatives employing blind workers. In November
 a new organization for hearing impaired people began to form in the northern city
 of Pemba. One of its first goals will be to standardize sign language for use in Mo-
 zambique to improve communication and employablity. Although poorly funded,
 these groups provide training, raise public awareness of the need to integrate the
 disabled into society, and lobby the Ministry of Labor to initiate legislation to sup-
 port the working rights of the disabled. In May 1996 ADEMIMO charged that the
 Government had not yet authorized medical pensions for disabled soldiers. Also in
 May 1996, the press reported that more than 9,000 disabled former military person-
 nel in Sofala province were living in dire conditions due to the Ministry of Planning
 and Finance's refusal to institute disability pensions. In December, on the occasion
 of World Disabled Persons Day, the state-controlled daily Noticias reported that
 
 
 ADEMIMO members in Sofala province again accused high government officials of
 robbing their pensions.
 The only provisions that the Government has enacted for accessibility to buildings
 and transportation for the disabled were in the electoral law governing the countrys
 first multiparty elections, which addressed the needs of disabled voters in the poll-
 ing booths. No special access facilities exist.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There was no systematic persecution or dis-
 crimination on the basis of race or ethnicity, although the FRELIMO Government
 has traditionally included at all levels a disproportionate number of southerners,
 mostly from the Shangaan ethnic group. However, the Government took some steps
 to address this imbalance by appointing provincial governors native to their respec-
 tive provinces. The Government also included more persons originally from the
 northern part of the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies that all workers are free
 to join or refrain from joining a trade union. The 1991 Labor Law further protects
 workers' right to organize and to engage in union activity at their place of employ-
 ment. The legislation gave existing unions the right to register independently from
 the Organization of Mozambican Workers (OTM).
 Until 1992 the only trade union federation was the OTM, which was affiliated
 with, and dominated by, the FRELIMO party. After passage of the 1991 legislation,
 three unions broke away from the OTM in 1992, and by 1994 had formed their own
 central union, the Free and Independent Union of Mozambique (SLIM). The SLIM
 maintains a working relationship with the OTM. The SLIM claims 60 percent work-
 er affiliation within its constituent unions, while the OTM claims 67 percent.
 In May 1994, the OTM declared itself free of commitments to any political party,
 companies, or religious groups and ruled that members affiliated with any political
 party could not hold elected union offices. Independent unions continue to charge
 that the OTM lacks independence from the Government.
 The Constitution explicitly provides for the right to strike, with the exception of
 civil servants, police, military personnel, and other essential services (which include
 sanitation, firefighting, air traffic control, health care, water, electricity, fuel, post
 office, and telecommunications). Throughout the year there were sporadic strikes
 around the country. Workers' demands usually centered on the issues of salary ar-
 rears or increases in wage levels. In July workers at the Maputo textile factory.
 TEXLUM briefly detained the factory manager and four other persons because of
 delays in paying the wages for July. In March workers protesting salary arrears and
 the dismissal of 71 employees went on strike for several weeks at the Angocaju
 cashew factory in Nampula, also detaining the factory manager. In the last quarter
 of the year, employees struck for back wages at an appliance manufacturer in
 Machava and a furniture factory in Maputo, as well as at shipyards in Beira and
 Maputo. Concern over worker safety sparked a strike at Matola's Tudor Battery fa-
 cility. Agricultural workers at the newly privatized Citrus Maputo in Moamba
 struck to demand that the State repossess the firm, which had not yet defined new
 conditions of employment. In December scores of casual workers from Maputo port
 savagely beat a director of the Mozambique Rail and Port company over its refusal
 to pay a new year bonus.
 The 1991 Labor Law forbids retribution against strikers, the hiring of substitute
 workers, and lockouts by employers. There were no known instances of employer
 retribution against striking workers. Specific labor disputes are generally arbitrated
 through ad hoc workers' committees, formally recognized by the Government.
 The Constitution and labor legislation give unions the right to join and participate
 in international bodies. The OTM is a member of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and the Southern African Trade Union Coordinating Council.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Law protects the
 right of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining. It expressly pro-
 hibits discrimination against organized labor. In 1991 the Government decreed that
 it would no longer set all salary levels. Negotiation of wage increases was left in
 the hands of existing unions. The Consultative Commission on Labor, which com-
 prises the unions, employers' associations, and the Government, has met periodi-
 cally to negotiate increases in the minimum wage. In November Parliament began
 a debate on the proposed revision of Mozambique's labor law, which would include
 important changes in wage and benefit provisions, women's rights in the workplace,
 sexual harassment standards, the relationship between employers and workers, and
 the financing of labor unions. Although the law was approved in its general form,
 debate and final voting on the details of the draft bill were suspended until the par-
 liamentary session in February 1998 to allow a full discussion of all provisions.
 
 
 Legislation provides for the creation of export processing zones; however, no firms
 have yet begun production.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law. The law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by
 children, and such practices are known to occur. Children in rural areas are some-
 times used as labor to settle economic accounts (see Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Child
 labor is regulated by the Ministry of Labor, although there are no specific child
 labor statutes. Forced labor by children is not specifically prohibited, but such prac-
 tices are known to occur in rural areas (see Section 6.c.).
 In the wage economy, the minimum working age is 18 years. Children between
 the ages of 15 and 18 may work with the permission of their parents and the Min-
 istry of Education. Children younger than age 15 are not permitted to work. The
 minimum wage laws apply to children and the maximum work week for children
 is 38 hours (compared with 44 for adults).
 Because of high adult unemployment, estimated at around 50 percent, few chil-
 dren are employed in regular wage positions. However, children, including those
 under age 15, commonly work on family farms or in the urban informal sector,
 where they perform such tasks as guarding cars, collecting scrap metal, or selling
 trinkets and food in the streets. The informal labor sector is unregulated. The Gov-
 ernment has not focused on the issue of child labor; it has focused on the children
 orphaned and traumatized by the war. Children are also employed in domestic posi-
 tions.
 Primary education is not compulsory, and only 60 percent of school-age children
 attend classes. Children not in school are frequently employed in the agricultural
 and informal sectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The industrial minimum wage is about $27
 (311,795 meticais) per month which is set by ministerial decree, although the level
 is recommended through an administrative process. There is also an agricultural
 minimum wage of about $18 (209,960 meticais) per month, which is set by ministe-
 rial decree after informal consultation with agricultural unions. The minimum wage
 is not considered sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for an average
 urban worker and family, and many workers must turn to a second job, if available,
 as well as work garden plots to survive.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing the minimum wage rates in the
 private sector, and the Ministry of Finance in the public sector. Violations of mini-
 mum wage rates are usually investigated only after workers register a complaint.
 It is customary for workers to receive benefits such as transportation and food.
 The standard legal workweek is 44 hours, with a weekly 24 hour rest period stip-
 ulated. In the small modern sector, the Government has enacted health and envi-
 ronmental laws to protect workers. However, the Ministry of Labor enforces these
 laws ineffectively, and the Government has only occasionally closed firms for non-
 compliance. In May the General Labor Inspector reported that there continue to be
 significant violations of labor legislation in many companies and services. The report
 also indicated that there were 459 workplace accidents in 1996, resulting in 5
 deaths. Workers have the right to remove themselves from work situations that en-
 danger their health or safety without jeopardy to their continued employment.
