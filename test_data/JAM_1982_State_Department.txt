 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy with a
 mixed economy which emphasizes increasing opportunity for
 private enterprise. Two major political parties, the Jamaican
 Labour Party and the People's National Party, have alternated
 in power since the first elections held under universal adult
 sufferage in 1944. The former party's leader, Edward Seaga,
 has been Prime Minister since November 1980. The Jamaican
 Constitution requires that general elections be held at least
 once every five years. Parliamentary elections are not
 expected until the end of 1985.
 Jamaicans have a high respect for human rights, which generally
 prosper in Jamaica's open society with its strong democratic
 traditions. Despite difficult economic circumstances and the
 political violence which occurred during the 1980 elections,
 Jamaica continues its strong record of observing human rights.
 Jamaica's legal system is based on English common law and an
 independent judiciary. The Constitution provides for, and
 there are, an independent director of public prosecutions to
 pursue criminal cases and an independent commission to oversee
 or inquire into allegations of official misconduct. The
 security establishment is small and generally apolitical.
 Several factors cause concern about how well Jamaica can
 preserve its democratic heritage and respect for human rights
 in the future. The Jamaican economy declined for close to a
 decade and, while showing some growth in 1981 and 1982,
 continues to require large amounts of foreign capital. Job
 creation and emigration are not keeping pace with increases in
 the size of the work force. The country's infrastructure,
 including its social, educational, security, and utility
 services, have badly eroded through years of neglect. Polit-
 ical divisions between the two major parties have sharpened in
 the past decade. Political violence drastically increased in
 the 1980 election, and there is an absence of consensus or
 dialogue between the two parties on major national issues.
 Together, these social, economic, and political factors point
 to possible increased political tensions and a less favorable
 environment for human rights, unless redressed.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Officially sanctioned murder of political opponents does not
 occur in Jamaica. Rivalries between the two principal polit-
 ical parties have led to increasing violence during election
 campaigns, although there are occasional incidents of
 politically motivated violence at other times. Both major
 political parties are believed to have supporters who employ
 violence for political purposes during election periods. Over
 the years election-related violence has steadily worsened,
 reaching a peak in the long and hotly contested 1980 campaign
 in which there were an estimated 600 politically inspired
 deaths. Because of intimidation and other factors, the legal
 and judicial systems have generally been unable to bring perpe-
 trators of political violence to justice. Neither the Govern-
 ment nor the opposition party condones the use of extra-legal
 violence. In 1982 there were unsubstantiated charges against
 
 
 563
 the police for using excessive violence against members of
 radical political groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of secret arrests, abduction, or clandes-
 tine detention by any official groups.
 c. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Legal prohibitions against cruel, inhuman, and degrading treat-
 ment or punishment are respected. Access to detainees by rela-
 tives, attorneys, physicians, and friends is routine. Prison
 conditions are austere. There have been occasional claims of
 beatings and other abuses by police. Some members of opposi-
 tion parties, especially the Communist Workers Party of
 Jamaica, have charged the police force with politically moti-
 vated harassment. Most observers concede that there is a small
 minority of individuals within the police force who, at times,
 have abused their authority, especially during operations
 against criminal gunmen. These instances are unusual and not
 official policy. Officials committing illegal acts are liable
 for punishment, although investigation and prosecution are
 often a lengthy and involved process. During the first 11
 months of 1982, seven policemen were charged with murder for
 acts committed while on duty. In several other trials in 1982,
 policemen charged with murder were acquitted.
 The police force complaints department conducts an initial
 investigation into charges, referring the complaint to the
 criminal investigations branch or the director of public prose-
 cutions when warranted. All complaints receive a written
 reply. In addition, complaints against the police are also
 directed to the Parliamentary Ombudsman and to the media. In
 several cases in 1982, groups of citizens demonstrated to
 protest alleged use of excessive force.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Jamaica. The Supression of
 Crime Act, which has been in force for several years as a means
 of increasing the authority of the security forces to deal with
 criminal and political violence, permits detention for brief
 periods, but requires an early appearance before a magistrate.
 Habeas corpus is guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 by the courts and the police. Opposition political spokesmen
 have charged irregularities in preventive detention practices
 by the police.
 Arbitrary detention without trial does not occur, but delays in
 trials are common. A "gun court" established in 1974 as an
 extraordinary means of dealing with the serious problem of
 violent crime, considers cases involving the illegal use or
 possession of firearms or ammunition. After arraignment the
 .gun court" has allowed some pretrial detentions lasting months
 and convictions carry a mandatory life sentence.
 Continuation of the "gun court" has been an increasingly
 controversial subject in Jamaica. In late 1982, important
 amendments to the Gun Court Act were approved by the House of
 Representatives. They eliminate the mandatory sentence of life
 
 
 564
 imprisonment, permit magistrates outside of the Kingston metro-
 politan area discretion in determining whether to refer cases
 to the "gun court", and remove entirely from the jurisdiction
 of the "gun court" cases involving children under the age of
 14. The Government regards these amendments as the beginning
 of a process to review and reform an act which the Minister of
 Justice has described as "a blot on the country's juridical
 history." Cases of 1,500 persons, whose average age is 21,
 serving life sentences under the Gun Court Act are to be
 reviewed and a Parliamentary Committee formed to study longer
 term changes in the legislation.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jamaica has an independent judiciary. In regular courts,
 accused persons receive a fair public trial in accordance with
 constitutional legal guarantees and standards. Legal counsel
 is provided to indigents in criminal cases. Restrictions on
 public attendance and less stringent rules of evidence apply in
 the "gun court" where cases are conducted before a judge,
 except in murder cases when the trial is heard by a jury. The
 Jamaican legal system, however, is overburdened, and many cases
 take years to come to trial.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Jamaican law requires judicial warrants before entry, except
 during those times when the Suppression of Crime Act is in
 force. The act is currently in force until January 1983 when
 it could be further extended at the initiative of the Govern-
 ment. Although the act authorizes Jamaica Defense Force
 personnel to operate alongside the police, since the violence-
 ridden 1980 election period, Defense Force personnel have only
 occasionally exercised this authority in operations against
 criminal gunmen. No search warrant is required under this act,
 but regulations approved by parliament in 1980 require that
 every effort be made by the security forces to have the owner
 or occupier of the premises present during the search.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed in the Constitution
 and are observed in practice within the broad limits of
 Jamaican libel and state secrets laws. There is no official
 censorship of the media, books, or art, nor is there interfer-
 ence in academic studies. Jamaica's principal privately owned
 newspaper, the "Daily Gleaner," has often been a critic of
 Jamaican Governments. The Government owns the "Daily News,"
 which generally supports the ruling party. However, it has
 been offered for sale as part of the Government's efforts to
 divest itself of many publicly owned entities. Several smaller
 newspapers and magazines are also published. The opposition
 Peoples' National Party and the Communist Workers' Party of
 Jamaica each publish newspapers. These two papers are highly
 critical of government policies. Foreign publications are
 usually available, but in a limited number of copies.
 Licensing of electronic media has always been tightly
 controlled by the Government. Jamaica's one television station
 is government-owned, although an intention to issue potential
 
 
 565
 competitors licenses has been announced. The government-owned
 television and radio network, Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation,
 has long been accused by the opposition party of the day of
 bias in favor of the Government. The second radio station,
 Radio Jamaica Rediffusion, while partially government-owned, is
 politically independent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association are guaranteed in
 the Constitution. Public demonstrations and rallies are inte-
 gral to Jamaican politics and are staged by all political
 parties without government interference. A large variety of
 professional groups exist and are free from any official
 harassment.
 Jamaica haa a strong, organized, and independent labor movement
 which contributes many leaders to the political process.
 These include the current Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
 Foreign Affairs Hugh Shearer and former Prime Ministers Michael
 Manley and Sir Alexander Bustamante. The right to form and
 belong to trade unions is constitutionally guaranteed, and
 trade unions are among the strongest and most active organiza-
 tions in the country. Approximately 25 percent of the work
 force is organized. The two major unions, the Bustamante
 Industrial Trade Union and the National Workers Union, are
 associated with the two major political parties, but operate as
 independent organizations, differing at times with both polit-
 ical movements. Both unions are affiliated with the Caribbean
 Congress of Labor and the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions. Numerous other unions exist. Unions participate
 extensively in labor-related policy decisions and make active
 use of the bargaining rights in the Labor Relations and Indus-
 trial Disputes Act of 1975. Jamaican workers, including
 government workers, have the right to strike, which they
 frequently exercise.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution. A great
 variety of churches and religious groups operate freely.
 Membership in a particular religious group confers neither
 advantage nor disadvantage.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of movement. There are no
 restrictions on foreign travel or emigration, although the
 Government has for some years restricted the amount of foreign
 exchange available to an individual for travel abroad. Few
 refugees have sought to work and settle in Jamaica. Jamaicans
 can settle and work in other countries without hindrance by the
 Jamaican Government. There is no evidence of discriminatory
 treatment of travelers based on nationality, race, or sex.
 Jamaica gives its nationals free right of re-entry and resi-
 dence in the country.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Jamaica has a multi-party political system.  Two parties have
 long been dominant, alternating in power in free elections
 every two terms. The leader of the party which wins the
 largest number of the 60 seats in the House of Representatives
 is appointed Prime Minister by the Governor General. The latter
 
 
 566
 represents the head of state, the British monarch.  Strong
 party discipline in parliament is traditional, and government-
 sponsored legislation, while often hotly debated, is almost
 always approved. The position of the leader of the opposition
 is provided for in the Constitution. All citizens 18 years of
 age and over are eligible to vote. No group is denied the
 right to participate in political activity. In recent years
 successful efforts to improve the integrity of the electoral
 process have been undertaken. Despite violence during the 1980
 campaign, 86 percent of the registered voters turned out at the
 polls.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Jamaica has not been the subject of resolutions, investiga-
 tions, or human rights actions by international organizations.
 Jamaica is a strong advocate for human rights in international
 fora. It is a member of the United Nations, the Organization
 of American States, and the Caribbean Community as well as
 other international bodies which protect human rights. A
 Jamaican is a judge on the Inter-American Court on Human
 Rights. As a government and a people, Jamaica frequently
 displays its deep concern for observance of human rights
 throughout the world. There has been little interest by inter-
 national or non-governmental groups in investigation of human
 rights in Jamaica, although Amnesty International in mid-1982
 wrote to the Government in opposition to capital punishment.
 Jamaica imposes no restrictions on human rights organizations.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Jamaica's economic recovery from the decline experienced in the
 1970's is continuing slowly, but the economic situation for a
 large portion of the Jamaican population remains bleak. The
 economy grew by two percent in 1981 in real terms, and a very
 small amount of growth was expected in 1982. The inflation
 rate, which had decreased to five percent in 1981, was expected
 to rise to approximately eight-ten percent in 1982. A
 depressed world bauxite market is likely to limit export
 earnings and constrain economic growth in 1983.
 The Seaga administration continues to be committed to the
 improvement of social and community services programs and has
 once again earmarked a substantial portion of the national
 budget to address needs in these areas. Although the average
 life expectancy in Jamaica is 70.9 years, health care services
 are still inadequate in many rural areas; government expendi-
 ture for health-related services will, therefore, increase
 markedly in 1982. The infant mortality rate is 28 per 1,000
 live births and approximately 86 percent of the population has
 access to safe water. Because the local demand for low-cost
 housing is still greater than the existing supply, the Govern-
 ment has committed itself to the task of ensuring that all
 Jamaicans are adequately housed. To achieve that goal, several
 new housing projects have been started and existing ones
 continued or expanded. Additionally, a three-year national
 housing plan will be developed to address future housing
 requirements.
 Jamaica's educational system is free, but the rise in the cost
 of living has meant continuing problems for families trying to
 provide books and uniforms. Primary education is in the
 
 
 567
 process of becoming compulsory in Jamaica, which is placing
 strains on existing educational facilities. The Government has
 placed a high priority on improving the conditions of schools,
 and education expenditures are the largest single item in the
 budget for social and community services. The official adult
 literacy rate is 86 percent, and 99 percent of primary school
 age children are enrolled in schools.
 Women have equal rights under Jamaican law and in October 1981
 (the date of the last available survey) represented 46.6
 percent of the island's labor force. However, in practice they
 suffer economic discrimination, particularly lower pay and more
 difficult access to jobs. Jamaican statistics show that the
 female unemployment rate was 40 percent in April 1982 while the
 male rate was 15.3 percent. Although the 1975 Employment Act
 states that males and females should receive equal pay for
 equal work, actual practice often diverges from the law. The
 Jamaican Government established a Women's Bureau in 1974 to
 formulate policy and design programs to cope with problems
 faced by women. The Bureau's responsibilities have grown since
 1974 despite a shrinking budget. It runs programs to train
 women in agricultural and technical skills and a secondary
 school for pregnant girls. The Bureau has been largely
 responsible for overseeing the adoption of legislation granting
 maternity leave to pregnant workers and legal status to
 children born out of wedlock.
 Increasing crime and violence have been a major social problem
 in Jamaica in recent decades. Rising unemployment, urbaniza-
 tion, lessened respect for authority, over-worked courts, and
 the deterioration of the security forces have contributed to a
 growing crime rate. The response of successive Jamaican
 Governments, with regard to enforcement, has been to pass the
 Gun tourt and Suppression of Crime Acts and to give high
 priority to crime fighting efforts by the security forces,
 especially the police.
