 ITALY
 Italy is a democratic, multiparty republic with a parliamentary
 system of government. Legislative power is vested in the
 Parliament, which is directly and freely elected on the basis
 of universal adult suffrage. Executive authority is
 concentrated in the Council of Ministers. Italy has an
 independent judiciary. The Chief of State, the President, is
 elected by Parliament and representatives of the regions.
 Terrorist violence of both the left and right has declined in
 recent years due to the effective work of police and
 magistrates and, in essence, the people's rejection. Although
 terrorism has yet to be completely overcome, its considerable
 reduction has freed law enforcement resources for the struggle
 against organized crime, which continues to be a serious
 problem.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy ranking among the
 top 10 in the world in gross national product. It is
 characterized by sizable government ownership in the primary
 industrial sectors and by a dynamic private sector, especially
 at the level of small and medium-sized companies.
 The drafters of Italy's post-World War II Constitution were
 strongly influenced by Roman Catholic and social democratic
 traditions. The Constitution contains guarantees of political
 and civil rights that are rigorously observed in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In 1985, there was one confirmed killing by an Italian
 terrorist organization, the Red Brigades. The victim was Ezio
 Tarantelli, a prominent labor economist. Efforts over past
 years by terrorists of the far left and far right to provoke
 the forces of order into taking extreme security measures have
 failed. Government and law enforcement agencies have used the
 emergency powers granted them to fight the terrorist threat
 with care and moderation.
 There are indications that Italian terrorists have received
 some support from outside the country, particularly from
 extremist Middle Eastern groups, and there are continuing
 allegations of direct or indirect East European support.
 Terrorist actions claimed by Middle Eastern groups, including
 bombings and attacks on individuals, increased in 1985 and
 resulted in 3 deaths and more than 60 wounded. A Middle
 Eastern connection is suspected in a number of incidents for
 which no group claimed responsibility. In addition, an Arab
 terrorist group killed 12 persons and injured many more in an
 attack on the Israeli airline passenger ticket counter at Rome
 airport in December.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no cases of disappearance linked to or
 condoned by the State or its agents. There were no
 kidnappings by political terrorist groups in Italy in 1985.
 However, an apparently foreign group continues to claim
 responsibility for the 1983 disappearance of a teenage Italian

 ITALY
 girl, Emanuela Orlandi. The group has called for the release
 from prison of Mehmet Ali Agca, who is serving a life sentence
 for the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in 1981.
 Ms. Orlandi is still missing.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Cruel and degrading punishment is forbidden by law
 and not employed by officials. Law enforcement officers
 accused bf breaking these rules have faced criminal charges.
 When a Mafia suspect died in police custody in August 1985,
 several officers were immediately suspended, and an
 investigation was begun. Conditions of confinement vary, and
 some places of detention are outdated and crowded but not
 inhumane or degrading. Prisoners charged or convicted of
 terrorist acts are generally separated from other prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police procedures in Italy are carefully circumscribed by law
 and judicial oversight. Arbitrary arrest is not practiced.
 Anyone detained by the authorities must be charged within 48
 hours. In normal criminal cases, the duration of pretrial
 detention permitted varies according to the gravity of the
 crime. Under reforms passed in 1984, the maximum that any
 person may be held in preventive detention, even for the most
 serious crimes, is 6 years and no more than 2 years at each
 step of the trial and the long appeals process. Maximum
 periods of preventive detention are substantially less for
 lesser crimes. As a safeguard against abuse, "Liberty
 Tribunals" are empowered to review evidence in cases of
 persons awaiting trial and to decide whether continued
 detention is warranted. Authorities hope that streamlined
 judicial procedures will help reduce the number of prisoners,
 currently about 20,000, awaiting trial or appeals in Italian
 jails. There is no forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial is assured by law and observed in
 practice. Counsel is provided for the accused, free if
 necessary. The judiciary is independent of the executive, and
 there are no political or security courts. All cases may be
 appealed to the highest appellate court, the Court of
 Cassation. There are no political prisoners.
 There was considerable debate in 1985 over procedures which,
 in certain types of cases, provide for reduced sentences for
 confessed offenders in return for testimony against associates
 and accomplices. This system proved very effective in the
 Government's effort to combat terrorism and is now in part
 being employed against organized crime. There is no evidence
 of any systematic abuse of the procedure by the authorities.
 However, critics maintain that the procedure allows too much
 latitude to individual magistrates, that it violates the
 principle of equal penalties for equivalent crimes, and that
 the testimony thus obtained, particularly in organized crime
 investigations, may not always be reliable. The issue has
 sparked a wide-ranging and spirited debate in the press,
 government circles, and other forums.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In Italy, the concept of the privacy of the home is legally
 safeguarded and generally respected by the authorities.
 Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only
 under judicial warrant and in carefully defined circumstances.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and a free press are assured under Italy's
 democratic political system, which allows full expression of a
 wide spectrum of political views. Although there is no
 censorship, publications may be seized for violations of
 obscenity laws or for defamation of state institutions. These
 powers are seldom invoked. Government-run radio and
 television are politicized at the administrative level but are
 open to widely differing views. A large number of private
 broadcasters air vigorous debate on political and social
 issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Italian citizens' right of free assembly is limited only in
 cases where security or public safety is endangered.
 Trade unions are not government-controlled, and their right to
 organize, engage in collective bargaining, and strike are
 fully protected. They associate with international labor
 bodies freely and without interference. According to
 government figures, about 40 percent of the work force is
 organized. Professional and employer associations also
 organize and represent their constituencies freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Italy's relations with the Roman Catholic Church are governed
 by an 1984 agreement (Concordat) between the Italian
 Government and the Holy See, ratified in 1985. The new
 agreement, replacing the Concordat of 1929, recognizes the
 rights and place of the Church but no longer accords it the
 position of Italy's state religion. The Roman Catholic Church
 continues informally to enjoy special standing in Italy
 because of the presence of the Vatican and because the
 overwhelming majority of Italians are at least nominally Roman
 Catholic. Nevertheless, all religions are free to organize
 and proselytize within the limits imposed by the laws
 governing public order. The Government is in the process of
 reaching agreements with other religious groups to define
 their rights and standing. Individuals are free to profess
 and practice any religious faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Italian citizens may travel freely both within the country and
 abroad. Emigration is unrestricted. Citizens who leave are
 guaranteed their right to return, and the Constitution forbids
 deprivation of citizenship for political reasons. Italy has
 been a haven for many persons fleeing persecution in other
 countries. There were no cases of forced repatriation of
 political refugees in 1985.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Italy is ruled democratically-under its free parliamentary
 system. Although the Constitution outlaws the Fascist Party,
 a wide range of organized and active political parties exists
 from the far left of the political spectrum to the far right.
 Election campaigns are free and open, and voting is by secret
 ballot. The two chambers ofParliamentand regional,
 provincial, and municipal councils are elected periodically.
 Opposition groups- are active and are frequently able to alter
 or reject government policies. The regions of Trentino
 Alto-Adige and Val d'Aosta are organized under special status
 aimed at safeguarding.the rights of their respective German-
 and French-speaking minorities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Italian Government and nongovernmental human rights
 organizations support human rights around the world. Italy
 participates fully in various international human rights
 organizations. -Nongovernmental organizations are free to
 investigate conditions in Italy, to attend trials, and to
 publish their findings. Political parties and religious
 groups participate in activities related to human rights.
 Organizations active in human rights affairs include Amnesty
 International,-the Official Interministerial Committee for the
 Rights of Man, the.Institute of Human Rights, and Caritas
 International.
 Amnesty International's principal concern in its 1985 Report
 (covering the year 1984) continues to be the excessive length
 of judicial proceedings-in what it called "political" cases.
 Freedom House rated Italy "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL,,AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Italy is a prosperous, developed country with a population of
 57 million (1985). Per capita gross national product in 1984
 was $6,843. As a country possessing an industrial market
 economy, Italy encourages the ownership of property alone or
 in association with others. The Government provides special
 funds for investment in southern Italy, whose development, for
 historical reasons, has been-slower than that of the north.
 Education and economic and social services are generally
 available to all without discrimination of any kind.
 According to 1985 statistics, life expectancy at birth was
 74.6 years and the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births
 was 11.2.
 Italy has a comprehensive body of law and regulation that
 outlaws child labor and ensures payment of a reasonable
 minimum wage and safe and healthy working conditions. Both
 government authorities and unions make significant efforts to
 ensure that these regulations are universally enforced. The
 proliferation of small-scale, family-run businesses and
 manufacturing enterprises in Italy's dynamic private sector
 means, however, that despite enforcement efforts, violations
 of these norms sometimes occur.

 ITALY
 Women generally have'equal status under the law, but they are
 engaged in a continuing effort to maintain and strengthen
 their rights. Women participate freely in social and
 political life and continue to expand their economic role,
 although they are underrepresented in the professions and
 management. There are legal limitations on women's property
 rights within marriage which derive from traditional Italian
 social values. Strong private-sector demand for female labor
 has ensured a very low level of unemployment among women who
 constitute about 27 percent of the labor force.
