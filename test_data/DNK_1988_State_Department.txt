 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a strongly
 established tradition of democratic parliamentary rule. Queen
 Margrethe II is titular Head of State; her role is mainly
 symbolic. A cabinet headed by the Prime Minister and
 accountable to the unicameral parliament (Folketing) has
 responsibility for government decisions. Since late 1982,
 Denmark has been governed by a minority coalition led by Prime
 Minister Schlueter's Conservative Party. The coalition is
 dependent on support from other parties to maintain a
 parliamentary majority.
 An advanced industrial state, Denmark has a mixed economy
 combining private and public ownership. Personal freedoms and
 the right to pursue private interests and to hold private
 property are protected by law and respected in practice.
 Deeply rooted democratic principles, a strong egalitarian
 tradition, a lively press, and highly developed education and
 social welfare systems have made Denmark a leading defender of
 human rights in the world.
 Human rights are highly respected and weIl protected in
 Denmark, both in principle and in practice. Any citizen who
 feels wronged or unreasonably treated hy any Danish national
 or municipal authority may appeal to the Folketing's
 Ombudsman. Internationally, Denmark participates actively in
 a number of commissions concerned with the protection and
 preservation of human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no abductions, disappearances, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detentions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was no torture or inhuman treatment. A rehabilitation
 and research center for torture victims established in
 Copenhagen in 1983 treats patients in the refugee community.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person in Denmark may be deprived of personal liberty
 without due process of law. Arrested persons must be taken
 before a judge within 24 hours of detention. The judge has
 the authority to determine custody or release pending trial.
 The Constitution provides for bail. Arrestees have access to
 legal counsel of their choice or court-appointed attorneys.
 Non-Danish speakers are given interpreters at government
 expense. There are no exiles.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally public; judges are allowed to make
 exceptions to this rule only in certain circumstances, such as
 paternity and divorce trials. In criminal cases, trials are
 only closed when it is necessary to protect the victim's
 privacy, such as in rape or child molestation cases, or when
 deemed necessary to protect a witness' identity. The rights
 of the accused are carefully protected. Indigent defendants
 have the right to an attorney at government expense and are
 free to change this attorney. Defendants have the right to be
 present, to confront witnesses, and to present evidence. They
 enjoy the presumption of innocence and have the right of
 appeal to a higher court. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits searches of the home, seizure and
 examination of papers, and breaches of the secrecy of
 communications in the absence of a judicial order, unless a
 particular exception is provided for by statute. These
 provisions are respected in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Denmark is a free and open society. A person may express an
 opinion in written or oral form on any matter, subject only to
 being held responsible in court for libel or malicious
 slander. Criticism of the Government is not a punishable
 offense. Academic freedom is respected. There is no
 censorship. Media representatives and private persons make
 full use of the freedom of expression. Television and radio
 have long been run by one state-owned company, but the
 Government does not exercise direct editorial control;
 programs critical of the Government appear regularly. A
 second nationwide television channel, privately run and
 one-third subsidized by the Government, opened in 1988.
 Private groups, principally the largest trade union, operate
 local low-cost radio and television stations throughout
 Denmark.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Danish residents are free to assemble and form associations
 for any lawful purpose. Permits are required for public
 meetings and are routinely given. Police are entitled to be
 present at public meetings or demonstrations which could
 endanger the public peace. All organizations are permitted
 relations or affiliations with recognized international bodies
 in their fields.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, the Evangelical Lutheran Church is the
 state church. However, religious freedom is guaranteed to
 all. No religion is banned or discouraged; conversion is
 unrestricted. No one may be discriminated against for
 religious beliefs. Missionaries are freely allowed entry but
 restricted in practice from staying more than 2 years. A
 
 
 1033
 DENMARK
 number of foreign clergy serve expatriate and Danish
 congregations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Danes have complete freedom to travel into, out of, and within
 Denmark. Danish authorities refuse to forcibly repatriate
 refugees to a country in which they have a reasonable fear of
 persecution. Measures designed to protect the rights of
 potential refugees or asylum seekers include the establishment
 of a Refugee Board and guaranteed access to legal counsel and
 interpreter service.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Prime Minister is appointe? by the reigning monarch after
 consultation with the political parties represented in the
 Folketing. The Folketing's 179 members are elected in free
 and open elections under a complex system of proportional
 representation designed to protect the rights of minority
 parties and to reflect the popular vote. A political party
 must get 2 percent of the total vote to obtain representation
 in the Folketing. Twelve parties competed in the last
 election (May 1988); eight, with a wide variety of political
 beliefs, obtained the required percentage and are currently
 represented. Danes over 18 years of age are allowed to vote.
 Elections must be held at least every 4 years. The Government
 also can be dissolved and elections called by a decision of
 the Prime Minister, a parliamentary vote of no confidence, or
 the resignation of the government in power.
 The territories of Greenland and the Faroe Islands have
 democratically elected, home rule governments with broad
 powers encompassing all but foreign and security affairs.
 They each have two seats in the Folketing. Greenlanders and
 Faroese are full Danish citizens and enjoy the same level of
 human rights as in Denmark.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no requests for investigation of human rights
 violations. Denmark is party to various international human
 rights conventions that promote and protect human rights.
 Human rights organizations operate freely. In 1987, the
 Danish Center of Human Rights, mandated by the Folketing, was
 established as a private government-funded institution to
 conduct research and provide information on a broad range of
 human rights issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Denmark provides food, shelter, health care, and education to
 all inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 Danes have successfully eliminated laws and regulations
 containing sex discrimination provisions. Women hold
 positions of authority at all levels of society and the
 political process, though they are somewhat less represented
 in top-level positions in business and commerce. Women head 4
 
 
 1034
 DENMARK
 cabinet ministries and hold 55 seats in the Folketing.
 Women's average wages in nonagricultural activities in 1986
 were 82.3 percent of those of men.
 Denmark has displayed a high degree of concern for the rights
 of the populations of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
 Greenland has a special criminal code designed for local
 customs and conditions. Native Greenlanders freely
 participate in international ethnic organizations such as the
 Inuit Circumpolar Conference. Despite periodic disagreements
 between home rule authorities and the Government, no
 accusations of human rights violations have been made against
 the Government.
 The growing number of ethnically dissimilar refugees
 (principally Iranians, Palestinians, Lebanese, and Sri Lankan
 Tamils) who require shelter, education, and public assistance
 has contributed to a rise in tensions between native Danes and
 immigrant groups. Although some politicians have suggested
 that aliens be obliged to assimilate, most emphasize the need
 for Danish tolerance of others' culture and religion.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely, and all (except
 those in essential services and civil servants) have the right
 to strike. Approximately 85 percent of Danish wage earners
 belong to unions. Trade unions operate freely domestically
 and internationally without government interference. They are
 an essential factor in political life and represent their
 members effectively.
 Greenland, an autonomous island with the Danish realm, has the
 same respect for worker rights, including full freedom of
 association, as does continental Denmark.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers and employers acknowledge each other's right to
 organize. Collective bargaining is widespread. Salaries,
 benefits, and working conditions agreed on in biennial
 negotiations between the Danish Employers' Confederation and
 the Danish Trade Union Federation, which has 1.4 million
 members (half of Denmark's labor force), are used as
 guidelines by the rest of the labor market. In case of
 disagreement, an issue may be referred to a labor court, made
 up of representatives of management, labor, and an independent
 member. The decisions of the court are binding. Labor
 legislation and practice are uniform throughout Denmark and
 Greenland.
 Labor relations in Greenland are conducted in the same manner
 as in Denmark. Working conditions are negotiated through
 collective bargaining, usually led by the largest Greenlandic
 union, SIK, which represents approximately 8,000 workers, or
 practically the entire indigenous salaried work force (out of
 a total of 23,000 wage earners). In the case of labor
 disputes, the Greenlandic courts are the first recourse, but
 the parties in dispute may also avail themselves of Danish
 mediation services or of the Danish labor court.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 15. The law,
 which is observed in practice, describes in detail specific
 limitations applicable to work which may be performed by those
 between 15 and 18 years of age.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Danish law prescribes acceptable conditions of work, including
 safety and health; the general duties of employers,
 supervisors, employees, and suppliers; the performance of
 work; rest periods and rest days; and medical examinations.
 The law also provides for a labor inspections service which
 ensures compliance with labor legislation. There is no
 minimum wage, but the lowest hourly wage level set in any
 national labor negotiation is roughly equal to $9.00, which
 provides a decent standard of living. Danes are guaranteed
 5 weeks' vacation per year. In 1988, the workweek was reduced
 to 38 hours.
 Similarly, wages, hours, vacations, and work conditions are
 negotiated by means of collective bargaining in Greenland.
 The pattern is similar to that of Denmark with some variations
 because of different levels of development. A major issue in
 collectiVe bargaining negotiations within Greenland is the
 wage differential between indigenous and temporary Danish
 workers which arises because of the need to attract skilled
 workers from Denmark. This differential is being
 discontinued. Another major difference is that no
 unemployment compensation is paid in Greenland unless a
 collective bargaining agreement specifically includes it. The
 Greenlander's tradition of spending part of his work year in
 hunting and fishing has slowed the evolution of the concept of
 unemployment. Because of this phenomenon and the lack of
 resources, Greenland has postponed establishing a
 legislatively mandated unemployment compensation system.
