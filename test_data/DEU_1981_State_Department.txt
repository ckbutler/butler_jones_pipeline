 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 The protection of basic human rights in the Federal
 Republic of Germany remained at a high level in
 1981. The West Germans are very conscious of the
 central importance of human rights and civil
 liberties because of the remaining memories of the
 atrocities of the Nazi period. There also are
 millions of living examples of the consequences of
 that period found In the divided families of East and
 West Germany and the ethnic German minorities of
 Eastern Europe. Consequently, there is fundamental
 agreement among the populace, and clear policy
 determination in the government, to protect and
 preserve human rights.
 Terrorist acts against Americans, other Germans, and
 other third country nationals continued occasionally
 to disturb a generally peaceful domestic political
 scene. But violent political or protest action has
 been denounced by virtually every known political or
 interest group in the country. All available
 evidence seems to indicate that the violence up to
 this point has been the work of disaffected
 individuals or very small groups.
 The openness of the Federal Republic to refugees
 continues -- more than 100,000 were admitted in
 1980. But at the same time, the German effort to
 prevent the granting of refugee status from being
 abused by economic migrants is starting to take
 hold. The figures for the first half of 1981 show
 nearly a 50 percent reduction in total refugee
 admissions.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is constitutionally prohibited in the Federal
 Republic. Article 104 of the basic law states, in
 part, "detained persons may not be subjected to
 mental nor to physical ill-treatment."  Insofar as is
 known, there have been no allegations of the use of
 torture in the Federal Republic during 1981.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no executions in the Federal Republic.
 Capital punishment was abolished by article 102 of
 the basic law. Physical punishments are not given or
 administered as sentences for criminal convictions.
 Conditions in West German places of detention are
 believed to be generally acceptable. Amnesty
 International has criticized the government for
 holding some convicted terrorists in long-term
 isolation, claiming that more than 100 prisoners have
 been subjected to such treatment at some time.
 Nevertheless, there is no systematic attempt to
 degrade any class or group of convicted criminals by
 detention under particularly harsh circumstances.
 c. Disappearances
 No reports have been received that persons are
 
 (783)
 
 
 784
 abducted, secretly arrested or secretly held by West
 German authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Prisoners and detainees are held in accordance with
 generally accepted principles. Freedom from
 arbitrary arrest is proclaimed in article 104 of the
 basic law and exists in practice. The same article
 creates the equivalent of the right of habeas corpus
 by requiring any person provisionally detained by the
 police to be brought before a judge within
 twenty-four hours.  (In certain rare circumstances
 the detention time may extend to forty-eight hours.)
 A detainee may not be held longer than twenty-four
 hours while awaiting formal charge, unless there is
 evidence that the detainee may seek to flee the
 country to avoid prosecution. Bail bond exists in
 the Federal Republic but is seldom employed, and
 individuals accused of a crime can be incarcerated
 for some time before the prosecution assembles
 sufficient evidence for a trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A defendant stands before the West German court
 system armed with fundamental protections provided in
 the basic law. Article 103 in effect prohibits ex
 post facto laws and double jeopardy and guarantees
 due process. A defendant must be charged by a judge
 within twenty-four hours after arrest. Article 104
 of the basic law, speaking of the defendant, states:
 "The judge shall inform him of the reasons for the
 detention, examine him, and give him an opportunity
 to raise objections.* Article 97 provides for the
 independence of the judiciary -- a provision which is
 clearly maintained in the Federal Republic. There
 are no political or security courts, also no military
 courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Sanctity of the home is guaranteed in the
 constitution (article 13) and respected in practice.
 A warrant signed by a judge is required in most cases
 before the police may make a forcible entry. The law
 permits public prosecutors to issue warrants in an
 emergency if a judge cannot be found. Some Germans
 have suggested that this *loophole' may have been
 abused in certain narcotics and terrorist cases in
 the past. Postal or telephone interception requires
 a court warrant, as well. Demolition of hor.es and
 forcible sealing of doors and windows do not occur.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Includings
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of speech and press is fully protected.
 Conversation is unrestricted and criticism of the
 government in both serious and satirical veins is
 widespread. There is no censorship of the media, a
 right specifically and successfully protected by
 articles 5, 17, and 18 of the basic law. Neither is
 there censorship of domestic or foreign books or
 
 
 785
 artistic works. There were no reports of
 intimidation of journalists in 1981. The government
 does not impede academic inquiry.
 The only important restriction on the right to
 assemble or demonstrate is the requirement to request
 and obtain a permit from the authorities -- unless
 there is good evidence that the demonstration was
 genuinely spontaneous.
 Labor unions have effective rights to organize,
 negotiate and strike -- although labor disputes
 seldom result in strikes. Professional associations
 and scientific bodies exist freely, and have not been
 harassed by the government or persecuted. There is
 no state religion in any formal or official sense.
 The government does, however, aid the major Christian
 denominations, e.g., by collecting revenue for them
 through the tax system -- if the individual taxpayer
 so chooses -- or through school subsidies. Articles
 3, 4, and 7 of the basic law guarantee freedom of
 religion. No evidence has come to light that any
 religious minorities are discriminated against or
 that adherence to any particular faith confers
 advantage or disadvantage in the various facets of.
 German life.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The Federal Republic is one of the chief defenders
 (and beneficiaries) of the right of repatriation.- A
 cardinal goal of its foreign policy is to enable as
 many as possible of the 3 million ethnic Germans
 living in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to
 obtain permission to emigrate to the Federal
 Republic, should they wish to do so. Conversely, the
 federal government, which under article 73 of the
 basic law has exclusive authority in West Germany to
 legislate on emigration policy, places virtually no
 restrictions on those citizens who wish to leave.
 The basic law's article 16 (supported by article 18)
 has provided the basis for one of the world's most
 open policies for refugees. The number of people
 taking advantage of this provision has risen sharply
 in the past few years: 1977 - 16,000; 1978 - 33,0001
 1979 - 51,000; 1980 - 107,000; 1981 (end of June) -
 25,000. These figures are for applicants who have
 somehow managed to arrive in West Germany, frequently
 coming from East to West Berlin, and thence to other
 parts of the country. Probably only 10 percent of
 all applications will be granted by the
 administrative courts. During the lengthy appeal
 process, however, the *new" arrivals reside in the
 country.
 The problem for the Germans is that many of the new
 *refugees" are clearly coming to get a job. Most of
 them are from Turkey, or developing countries of
 Southeastern Europe, whose history and culture are
 different from those of Western Europe.
 The West Germans already regard themselves as living
 in a crowded country. As the presence of the new
 economic migrants becomes even more obvious, some
 expressions of concern or opposition have begun to
 
 
 786
 emerge from various parts of the public. The
 prospect of heightened unemployment -- real or
 imagined -- is frequently mentioned. Resentment
 towards immigrants who do not conform to German
 cultural modes but retain their former way of life is
 not uncommon. On the other hand, the government has
 publicly pointed out that Germany has a continuing
 need for manual labor.
 In answer to public pressure, the federal government
 has taken a number of steps to control the influx of
 economic migrants. These include:
 -- a block on work permits for new asylum-seekers
 during the first year of their stayl
 -- cessation of child-support payments during the
 period of adjudication of the asylum application
 -- new visa requirements for travelers from
 Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Ethiopia and
 Somalia;
 -- changes in the federal law to speed the total
 processing/adjudication period for an asylum
 application.
 Freedom for West Germans to travel within their
 country or abroad is unimpeded. This is true for
 both women and men. The government places no
 restrictions on emigration and welcomes ethnic
 Germans from other countries who wish to
 immigrate/repatriate to West Germany.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Participation in the political system is open to all
 citizens, and this right is widely exercised.
 Opposition parties function freely and actively. The
 media are available to all parties, and public
 meetings are not restricted. There continues to be
 some public debate over the procedures for hiring
 federal and state employees and granting them
 permanent civil service status. There are periodic
 allegations of excessively strict interpretation of
 laws designed to bar extremists from public
 employment. Related to this problem is the fact that
 the individual states, which have responsibility for
 screening most applicants for civil service
 positions, do not administer the screening procedures
 uniformly. The only major group denied suffrage is
 the foreign workers. "Denied" is not entirely
 accurate, since most of the foreign laborers have not
 sought to change their citizenship status. The
 government continues to wrestle with the question of
 what nationality the children of foreign workers
 should possess (many of whom were born or educated in
 West Germany). Otherwise, problems of statelessness
 are largely non-existent. Article 16 of the
 constitution states that German citizenship may not
 be taken away except through specific legal process
 and only if the person is not left stateless.
 Spectacular incidents of terrorism (or extreme
 political protest) increased somewhat in 1981 over
 the previous year. U.S. military installations were
 
 
 787
 the targets on several occasions. But the level of
 terrorism or political violence did not reach that of
 the early 1970's.
 Terrorism in the Federal Republic remains the work of
 a tiny fringe element. The endemic low level of
 terrorism in the FRG had its origins during the
 so-called 'extra-parliamentary opposition' and
 student revolution of the late 1960's. Political,
 labor, religious and other recognized groupings in
 the country strongly condemn terrorism. Also, some
 part of the rise in violence may be a part of
 continuing growth of general crimes against property,
 including arson. The more recent terrorist incidents
 directed at U.S. military personnel and installations
 are an unsuccessful attempt by the Red Army (a
 radical fringe group, descendants of the former
 Baader-Meinhof gang) to gather support and sympathy
 from the peace movement in the FRG.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The government's attitude toward human rights
 investigations is generally open and cooperative. It
 has provided responses or information to all serious
 investigators. Most recently the government has
 cooperated with Amnesty International's review of the
 prison system. The latter organization is perhaps
 the best-known group active in human rights affairs
 in Germany, although the German chapter's focus is
 primarily on other countries. Amnesty International
 has local groups in every major city of the country,
 and operates openly with no personal or professional
 danger to its members. Another active organization
 is the Frankfurt-based Society for Human Rights.
 This group looks chiefly at the human rights
 practices in Eastern Europe and the German Democratic
 Republic.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The FRG has a weil-developed industrial market
 economy. Food, shelter, health care and education
 are available to all inhabitants, without regard to
 race, religion, sex, ethnic background or political
 opinion. Social services such as unemployment
 compensation, health insurance, and disability
 payments are well-established and available to all on
 a non-discriminatory basis.
 The following are relevant economic and social
 indicators: GNP per capita in 1979 was $11,732; life
 expectancy at birth for 1979 was 73; infant mortality
 rate per 100 live births in 1978 was 16; adult
 literacy rate for 1976 was 99 percent; population
 growth rate at an annual Average rate for 1978-79 was
 0.1 percent. Total fertility rate for 1979 was 1.5
 percentl the adjusted primary school enrollment ratio
 for 1976 was a total of 90 percent, and the percent
 of calorie supply available for consumption as a
 percentage of nutritional requirements for 1977 was
 127 percent.
