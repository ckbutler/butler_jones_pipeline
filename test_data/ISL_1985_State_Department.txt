 ICELAND
 Iceland is a modern democratic social welfare state with a
 parliamentary institution--the Althing--which is the oldest
 elected parliament in the world. Iceland's highly literate
 and educated people take an active interest in politics and
 participate in high percentages in the country's regular
 multiparty elections. Iceland has no military forces or
 political security apparatus. There is a small, professional
 police force. Icelanders enjoy a' fair and efficient civil and
 criminal justice-system andare strong defenders of individual
 human rights.
 RESPECT FOR"HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1,;Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killings have not occurred in Iceland.
 ;  b. Disappearance
 There have been no known cases of abductions or hostage-taking
 in Iceland in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are-prohibited by law and do not occur in
 practice . Prison conditions are excellent by international
 standards. The number of prisoners confined in Iceland is
 numbered in the tens, most of whom are held under light
 security conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Due process of law is guaranteed in Icelandic legal codes and
 observed in practice. The Constitution guarantees that any
 person detained by the authorities must be brought before a
 judge within 24 hours and charged, bound over, or released.
 There is no preventive detention or forced labor. There have
 been no allegations of arbitrary arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair and public trial is standard practice. Icelandic
 courts are free of political-control, though the lower court
 system is administered by the Ministry of Justice. The
 Supreme Court carefully guards its complete independence.
 There are no special or military courts. Right to counsel is
 guaranteed, and the state pays attorneys' fees when defendants
 cannot. Juries are not normally used, but multiple-judge
 courts are common, particularly on appeal. The small
 population allows a relatively informal administration of
 justice, but due process is rigorously observed. There are no
 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Icelandic law and practice are based on longstanding regard
 for the autonomy of the individual and the impropriety of

 government interference with the personal rights of citizens.
 Judicial warrants are required for entry into homes, except in
 cases of hot pursuit. Arbitrary intrusions by official
 entities, political organizations, or any other organized
 group into the personal liberties of Icelanders have not
 occurred.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In Iceland, a vigorous and independent press, a legal system
 which includes safeguards for individual rights, and a
 functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press. Censor~hip is applied to print
 and film materials to control public display of pornography
 and violence, but there is no government censorship of any
 news media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals in Iceland are free to join together formally or
 informally to promote nonviolent causes or to protest
 government policies or actions. An active web of voluntary
 organizations plays a large part in the social and political
 life of the country. All such organizations are free to
 maintain international contacts.
 Workers and employers in Iceland have and make extensive use
 of the right to establish organizations, to draw up their own
 constitutions and rules, to choose their own policies and
 representatives, and to be represented in negotiations on
 wages, working conditions, and the settlement of labor
 disputes. The labor movement is highly organized and
 democratic. It permeates the entire work force and spans the
 political spectrum. Labor unions are active and influential
 in national economic and political life and in the development
 and administration of a comprehensive social welfare system.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Lutheran Church is the established church of Iceland, and
 the vast majority of Icelanders are nominally Lutheran. There
 is complete freedom for other faiths. Religious affiliation
 is not a factor in political or social life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Icelanders have complete freedom to travel at home and abroad,
 emigrate, and return to Iceland at will.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The political system is a fully functioning parliamentary
 democracy with a high level of individual participation in
 politics. A wide range of voluntary organizations and
 interest groups represent diverse political interests and
 interact with the formal parliamentary structure. The last
 national election, in April 1983, resulted in the orderly
 transfer of power to a new coalition government composed of
 two political parties in May 1983. There are four political
 parties in the parliamentary opposition. Voter turnout is

 high for all elections. The use of party primaries,
 proportional representation in multimember districts, and a
 cultural insistence, on representation of the views of all
 parties in public affairs contribute to an active formal and
 informal political life.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There .are no known allegations of human rights violations in
 Iceland. Iceland, which-has an active interest in human
 rights matters, is represented on the European Human Rights
 Commission of the Council of Europe and has provided a judge
 to the European Human Rights Court. Several human rights
 organizations in Iceland, including Amnesty International,
 take an active interest in international human rights
 questions. Amnesty International did not comment on Iceland
 in its 1985 Report, and Freedom House rated Iceland "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 'Iceland-has an ethnically homogeneous population of 241,000
 'which enjoys a high standard of living.and the benefits of a
 social welfare state on the-Scandinavian model. The World
 Bank estimates that in 1985 Iceland's population growth was
 lpercent and its gross national product per capita in 1983
 was $10,260.
 Food,-shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 Icelanders without discrimination. Medical care and education
 through the university level are free or available at a very
 nominal cost. Consequently, the Icelandic people have a high
 rate of school enrollment (99.7 percent of children of school
 age in 1982), a low infant mortality rate (5.8 per 1,000 live
 births in 1985), and a long life expectancy (77 years at birth
 in 1985).
 In-addition to the right to organize unions, Icelandic-workers
 benefit from numerous laws protecting their health and safety
 andguaranteeing health and unemployment insurance, paid
 vacations, and minimum wages (currently $2.31 per hour). The
 employment of children below the age of 16 in factories, on
 ships, and in other places where hazardous conditions prevail
 .or hard labor is'required,.is prohibited by law.
 Icelanders are fiercely egalitarian. Women participate freely
 in social and political life. Nevertheless, women are
 underrepresented in the professions, management, and politics
 and are continuing efforts to expand their roles and rights.
 In the 1983 parliamentary election, a national women's list
 slate resulted in the election of 3 more women to the Althing,
 which now has 9 women out of a total membership of 60.
 Iceland's Chief of State is a woman.
