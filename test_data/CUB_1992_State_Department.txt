 CUBA
 Cuba is a totalitarian state dominated by President Fidel Castro who is Chief of
 State Head of Government, First Secretary of the Communist Party, and Com-
 mander-in-Chief of the armed forces. President Castro seeks to control all aspects
 of Cuban life through a broad network of directorates ultimately answerable to him
 through the Communist Party, as well as through the bureaucracy and the state
 security apparatus. The party is the only legal political entity and is headed by an
 elite group whose membership is ultimately determined by Fidel Castro. All govern-
 ment positions, including judicial offices, are controlled by the party. Though not a
 formal requirement, party membership is a de facto prerequisite for high-level offi-
 cial positions and professional advancement.
 The Ministry of Interior (MININT) is the principal organ of state security and to-
 talitarian control. It operates border and police forces, orchestrates public dem-
 onstrations, determines whether to recognize nongovernmental associations, inves-
 tigates nonconformity, regulates migration, and maintains pervasive vigilance
 through a series of mass organizations and informants. It also is charged with the
 suppression of dissent and opposition of any kind. The Ministry is under the de
 facto control of the levolutionary Armed Forces (FAR). The mass organizations at-
 tempt to extend government and Communist Party control over each citizen's daily
 activities at home work, and school. Neighborhood Committees for the Defense of
 the Revolution (CbR's) mobilize citizens, impose ideological conformity, and report
 suspicious behavior.
 The economy is highly centralized and managed by President Castro and a group
 of close advisors. The Government controls the means of production and is virtually
 the country's sole employer. In 1992 the economy continued to decline dramatically,
 reflecting the collapse in Cuba's economic relationship with the former Soviet Union.
 An annual $4 billion in Soviet aid in 1989 has been reduced to zero. Total foreign
 trade in 1992 was one-third of the 1989 level. The Government has not taken any
 economic reforms which could arrest the downward spiral in Cuba's tightly con-
 trolled economy. The Government continues its stringent austerity measures known
 as "the special period in peacetime," which calls for draconian efforts to establish
 economic self-sufficiency.
 The Government sharply restricts all basic human rights, including freedom of ex-
 pression, association, assembly, and movement, as well as the right to privacy, the
 right of citizens to change their government, and worker rights. Authorities often
 neutralize dissent through a variety of tactics designed to keep activists off balance,
 divided, and discredited by labeling them as mentally disturbed social misfits or
 hostile agents of foreign countries. It continues widespread use of 'acts of repudi-
 ation," which are attacks by mobs organized by the Government but portrayed as
 being spontaneous public rebukes of dissident activity. Crowds of people are
 
 
 372
 amassed outside homes of activists to harass and ridicule them, yell insults,. and
 vandalize property. At times, the targeted activist is forced through the crowd by
 police and beaten and spat upon. The Government also metes out exceptionally
 harsh prison sentences to activists who are considered a threat to its controL Ameri-
 cas Watch accurately reported that "The human rights situation in Cuba, where
 civil and political rghts are systematically violated in law and in practice, was
 punctuated in 1992 by reprisals against dissidents, particularly human rights mon-
 itors and peaceful prodemocracy activists.'
 In February, the U.N. Human Rights Commission   NHRC) passed a resolution
 endorsing the report of the UNHRC's Special Representi  which cited over 150
 cases of systematic human rigts abuses. The resolution notes with 'deep regret*
 Cuba's failure to cooperate with the UNHRC, and "profound concern" over 'numer-
 ous uncontradicted reports' of human rights violations. The resolution also man-
 dated establishment of a Special Rapporteur-a step reserved for the world's met
 serious human rights violators--to report on human rights in Cuba. Although Cuba
 did not allow the new Special Rapporteur like his predecessor, to visit, his interim
 report to the U.N. General Assembly (UNUA) in November contained strong and de-
 tailed criticism of Cuba'a gross violations of human r'ghts. It concluded with six
 steps Cuba must take to bring its human rights practices up to minimum inter-
 national standards. This report resulted in the December 4 passage of the first
 UNGA resolution ever on human rights in Cuba, which expressed profound con-
 cern at Cuba's human rights record. Six days later, on U.N. Human Rights Day,
 the Government unleashed a massive wave of repression against human rights ac-
 tivists, arresting, beating, threatening, placing under house arrest, or otherwise
 harassing virtually every leading activist. For most of the year, Cuba's human
 rights record remained as poor as in 1991. However, the sudden crackdown on De-
 cember 10 signaled a significant worsening in the Government's human rights
 record.
 RESPETr FOR HUMA RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Inluding Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Exajudicial Ki//ing.-Government agents were responsible
 for several extrajudicial killings. On May 10, policeman Juan Corrales Rego shot
 and killed Jose -rancisc Gonzalez Campo in Arroyo Naranjo as he was lyig d-
 fenseless on the ground, after Gonzalez was picked up for questioning relating to
 a bicycle accident. Jorge Guillen Linares, 13-year-old son of a human rights activist,
 and Maxim F      ede Martinez were shot and killed by police late in 1991.
 People were also killed or injured after the Government organized vigilance bri-
 gades to prevent people from stealing food. For example, a 12-year-old boy was
 kild and another nine boys wounded by a guard at a plantation in Gum-a de
 Melena while taking bananas, and an 11-year-old boy was seriously wounded by a
 guard at the Aranguito plantation also while trying to steal bananas. Several per-
 sons were shot and killed whe trying to steal sugar. -
 Felipe Timoneda, detained by police in a Havana suburb, died May 17 after an
 epileptic seizure, accordiq to police. When family members examined the body they
 discovered that Timonedas wrists had been handcuffed, his arms and thighs had
 dee pbruises, his back was injured, and his face appeared to have been severely
 beaten, The autopsy stated that he died of unknown causes.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no credible or verifiable reports of politically moti-
 vated disappearance in 1992.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits abusive treatment of detainees and prisoners. However,
 beatings, neglect, isolation, and other abuse by police and prison officials were often
 directed at detainees and prisoners convicted of political crimes (including human
 rights advocates) or who persist in expressing their views. The UNHRC Special
 Rapporteur found prison conditions, especially habitual beatings and the lack of food
 and medical care, to violate-jCuban law. The Government claims that prisoners have
 guaranteed rights, such as family visitation, adequate nutrition, pay for work, the
 right to request parole, and the right to petition the pAsn diectr. However, ac-
 cording to human rights workers, these purported rights are frequently and capri-
 ciously withdrawn, especially from political prisoners. There has roen no indication
 that authorities investigated reports of abuse or took disciplinary action against se-
 curity agents responsible for such abuse.
 Among the many reported cases of brutality by prison guards and police were
 those of Mario Lopez Reye, who suffered disfigurement after police sprayed a Mace-
 like substance in his face during questioning, Humberto Amengual Martinez, a
 former prisoner at Combinado del Sur penitentiary in Matanzas, who lost vision in
 
 
 373
 one eye after a beating in April by MININT officers; and Sergio Diaz Alvarez, an
 inmate at Aguicaprison in Matanzas province, who was severely beaten by prison
 guards in may after complaining about conditions. The beating resulted in three
 frctred ribs and a hematoma in one eye and the jaw. For weeks, he was refused
 medical attention.
 Human rights activists and political dissidents are systematically harassed, beat-
 en, and otherwise abused in public and private as a means of intimidation and con-
 trol. Those suffering such abuse included Juan Betancourt Morejon former head of
 the Pro-Human Rights Party (PPDH); Jorge Amores, also of the PPH; and activist
 and former university professor Rolando Prats, who was attacked May 29 by five
 men, who knocked him off his biycle, beat him and took documents from him con-
 cerning his human rights work. When passers by tried to help Prats, the men told
 them to leave because they were dealing with a 'counterrevolutionary carrying
 enemy propaganda."
 Authorities continued to use acts of repudiation to intimidate activists and as a
 pretext for their arrest. Activists are roughed up and, in some cases, suffer serious
 injury by government-organized mobs who chant slogans and vandalize their homes
 (see Section 2.b.). During such acts, activists are often arrested "for their own pro-
 tection,' then later charged with counterrevolutionary activity and sentenced to
 prison terms.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Article 245 of the Law of Penal Proce-
 dures requires police to file formal charges and either release a detainee or place
 him before a prosecutor within 96 hours of arrest. Authorities are also legally re-
 quired to provide suspects with access to a lawyer within 10 days of arrest. These
 procedures are routinely denied to those detained on state security grounds. The
 Constitution states that all legally recognized civil liberties can be denied anyone
 actively opposing the 'decision of the Cuban people to build socialism." Authorities
 invoke this open-ended article to justify lengthy detentions of activists on the
 grounds that they constitute 'counterrevolutionary elements." The UNHRC Special
 Rapporteur found that the legal system lacks the laws and institutions needed to
 protect due p rocess.
 The Penal Code contains several articles prohibiting 'ounterrevolutionary/ activ-
 ity. Activists are often imprisoned for 'enemy propaganda,' 'illicit association," "con-
 tempt for authority" (usually for riti g  deCastro), 'clandestine printing' or
 the broad charge of 'reblion." Rebellion has been used against those people advo-
 cating peaceful democratic change, as occurred with Yndamiro Restano (see Section
 I.e.). The Penal Code also includes the concept of 'dangerousness," defined as "the
 special proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in
 manifest contradiction of socialist norms." There were reliable reports that authori-
 ties intimidate activists by threatening prosecution under this article. If the police
 decide that a person exhiits such behavior, the offender may be brought before a
 court or subjected to 'therapy" or 'political reeducation" for 1 to 4 years.
 Reports of arbitrary arrests of human rights monitors continued unabated. The
 Government also preempts dissident activity by arbitrarily prolonging prison sen-
 tences by sentencing detainees on new charges for human rights activities allegedly
 committed during imprisonment.
 One index of the extent of repression is the high number of arrests for political
 crimes in recent years. According to reliable sources, from 1986 to 1990 4,568 peo-
 ple were arrested and imprisoned at Department of State Security (DSE) head-
 quarters at Villa Marista, an average of 95 per month. This grew to 160 a month
 during the April 1990-April 1992 period, a total of 3 989 arrests. Villa Marista han-
 dles only those arrested for illegal departure from te country and political crimes;
 furthermore, it has jurisdiction only over greater Havana. Each province has its own
 DSE facility, meaning that the number of arrests for political crimes is far higher
 than the number cited.
 Among the prominent cases of arbitrary arrest and long-term detention were
 noted activists Sebastian and Gustavo Arcos and Jesus Yanes Pelletier, detained on
 January 15 for alleged links to terrorists. Though Gustavo Arcos and Yanes were
 released a few days later the Government held Sebastian Arcos for 9 months before
 charging him; the trial followed days later. Sebastian Arcos was a founder of the
 Committee for Human Rights (CCPDH). Government officials told CCPDH members
 in January that he would be tried for rebellion. Unable to implicate Arcos in the
 activities of alleged terrorists captured in December, DSE subsequently tried to link
 him with convicted hijacker Arturo Suarez. Suarez was taken from prison to a well.
 appointed beach house near Havana, where his wife had been brought, and was told
 by a DSE major that DSE wanted to help him. When Suarez refused to testify
 against Arcos, he was taken back to prison and warned not to tell anyone what had
 happened. Arcos was then accused of enemy propaganda and tried October 5. Dur-
 
 
 374
 ing the trial, the prosecutor badgered Aros and defense witnesses, while prosecu-
 tion witnesses were instructed on what to say by MININT officials in a nearby
 chamber. Though no credible evidence was presented, Arcos was sentenced to 66
 months in prison. In December he was moved to a prison 3 hours from Havana, thus
 making it nearly impossible for his family to visit him, given fuel and transport
 shortages.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Cuban law and trial practices do not meet inter-
 national standards for fair and impartial public trials. Almost all cases are tried in
 less than 1 day. Although the Constitution provides for independent courts, it ex-
 plicitly subordinates them to the National Assembly and the Council of State, which
 is headed by Fidel Castro. Judges are elected by the rubber-stamp National Assem-
 bly and its lower level counterparts. The judiciary's independence is also com-
 promised by the subordination of the courts to the Communist Party. Americas
 Watch reported that "trials staged in courts that lack independence ended in convic-
 tions and prison sentences that rank among the stiffest for thought crimes in the
 last 10 years." There is no known case in which a court has ruled against the Gov-
 ernment on any political or security matter.
 Civil courts exist at municipal, provincial, and Supreme Court levels. All ae pre.
 aided over by panels composed of a mix of professionally qualified judges and lay
 judges. There are also military tribunals which assume jurisdiction for certain
 counterrevolutionary" cases. Most trials are public; however, trials are closed when
 state security is allegedly involved. Testimony from a CDR member may be intro-
 duced on behalf of a defendant and may contribute to either a shorter or a longer
 sentence. The law recognizes the right of appeal in municipal courts. In provincial
 courts some cases are appealable, such as those involving maximum prison terms
 or a death penalty. The law provides that an appeal must be filed within 5 days
 of the verdict.
 Criteria for presenting evidence, particularly in cases of human rights activists,
 are arbitrary and discriminatory. Often, the sole evidence provided, particularly in
 cases with political significance, is the defendant's confession. The confession is usu-
 ally obtained under duress and without legal advice or the knowledge of the defense
 lawyer. In Sebastian Areos's case (see Section 1.d.), the evidence consisted of an un-
 signed letter that was lost in a fire in MININT files before the case could be tried.
 A videotape of unsworn witnesses testifying aainst him was presented, and the
 rosecutor failed to recuse herself after revealing that she had been a childhood
 friend of Arcos' daughter and had often been in his home. Defense lawyers often are
 not allowed to meet with defendants until the day of the trial. Several activists who
 have served prison terms say they were tried and sentenced without defense counsel
 and were not allowed to speak on their own behalf.
 Cuban law provides an accused the right to an attorney, but the latter's impartial-
 ity and independence are compromised by the absence of a private bar association
 and by ideological controls exerted over members of the state-controlled lawyers' col-
 lectives, especially when defending persons accused of state security crimes. Observ-
 ers report reluctance among attorneys to defend such persons. Lawyers are discour-
 aged from taking political cases because of the persecution suffered by those who
 have done so.
 One noted lawyer, Rene Gomez Manzano, staunchly defended several human
 rights advocates in court. As a result he came under increasing government pres-
 sure to curtail his activities. In March he was the target of an act of repudiation
 at the National Assembly of Law Offices, in which the Assembl's members, includ-
 ing Justice Minister Carlos Amat, publicly denounced Gomez. There have been other
 cases of lawyers who were removed from the Assembly, in effect disbarring them,
 for defending activists too aggressively.
 The Government continues to use the judicial system to discredit human rights
 advocates by publicly associating them with foreign governments or violent activi-
 ties or by portraying them as subversive and dangerous. Harmony Movement presi-
 dent Yndamiro Restano, an avowed pacifist, was tried in May on charges of rebel-
 lion although his organization's stated goal is to advocate peaceful, democratic
 change. At the trial, diplomats, activists, and journalists were turned away, even
 though the law requires trials to be open to the public. Three of the Governments
 key witnesses recanted on the stand, saying that they wanted to retract sworn
 statements attacking Restano because they had been made under coercion from
 MININT officials. The Government was unable to provide any evidence linking
 Restano with violent activities; both defense and prosecution witnesses testified to
 that effect. The prosecutor noted the "dangerous" effect Restano's group would have
 if not stopped, comparing him disparag    with Mahatma Gandhi. Despite all this,
 Restano was convicted of rebellion and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.
 
 
 375
 Activist Omar del Pozo of the National Civic Union and two others were tried in
 August for revealing state security secrets. A MININT lieutenant had provided them
 with names of informants posing as activists. Hector Castaneda, who had worked
 as an activist, acknowledged at the trial that he was a MININT collaborator. The
 tribunal sentenced the lieutenant to 19 years, del Pozo to 15 years, and the two oth-
 ers to 13 and 9 years, respectively.
 There were als several summary trials for "economic crimes," such as hoarding.
 In February people were often stopped in the street and, if searches revealed sus-
 picious items, subjected to a "people's trial," usually in a local hall. Defendants were
 not given time to prepare, were not allowed counsel, and in general had no right
 to due process. The vast majority were found _guilty and fined or sentenced to jail.
 In March activist Felix Fleitas, president of the Association for a Constitutional
 Democracy (APDC), was arrested for trafficking in foreign currency, even though po-
 lice could not find any currency after searching his home. His trial is pending. In
 the December 10 crackdown, police threatened Fleitas with arrest if he continued
 his human rights activities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Despite
 Articles 56 and 57 of the Constitution dictating the inviolability of one's residence
 and correspondence, official intrusion into private and family affairs remain one of
 the most repressive and pervasive features of Cuban life. Mass organizations con-
 trolled b, the Communist Party permeate society. The State has assumed a virtual
 right of interference into the lives of citizens, even those who do not actively oppose
 the Government and its practices. These intrusions aim ostensibly at "improving"
 the citizenry, but are calculated to encourage ideological conformity.
 Authorities possess a wide range of social controls. The educational system teach-
 es that the State's interests have precedence over all other ties and commitments.
 Teachers, selected in part for their ideological commitment, emphasize Communist
 doctrine in the classroom and can penalize students whose families question ortho-
 dox opinion. Teachers are required to evaluate student's ideological character, which
 is noted in records carried by students throughout their education and which affect
 their future prospects.
 MININT employs an intricate system of informants and block committees (CDR's)
 to monitor and control public opinion. Guardians of social conformity, CDR's are
 neighborhood security committees tasked with closely monitoring the daily lives of
 individual residents. Participation in the 80,000 CDR's is described as voluntary; in
 cities, it is, in fact, obligatory. CDR's report suspicious activity, such as reception
 of foreign radio or television broadcasts in the home, conspicuous consumption, un-
 authorized meetings, or attitudes toward the Government and the revolution.
 Cubans do not have the right to receive publications from abroad and expect that
 their international correspondence will be read by state security. Overseas telephone
 calls are difficult to make and are monitored; conversations with foreigners are re-
 ported. Activists, foreign diplomats, and journalists report frequent surveillance by
 security agents.
 Authorities regularly search people's homes without probable cause for the pur-
 voses of intimidation and harassment. MININT officials warned Manuel Martinez
 Rodriguez, Secretary of the National Council for Civil Rights, to stop his human
 rights activities. When he persisted, 10 MININT officials returned with a search
 warrant and accused Martinez of being a drug trafficker. After searching the house
 for hours and finding nothing, they took Martinez in for questioning.
 As part of a massive crack down on human rights activists December 10, police
 broke down the doors and searched the offices of the Cuban Committee for Human
 Rights and National Reconciliation without a search warrant, confiscating files deal-
 ing with human rights violations in Cuba. The offices, located at the home of activ-
 ist Elizardo Sanchez, were surrounded by a rock-throwing mob, and police cordoned
 off the street. Police later found Sanchez, who was not home, at a friend's house,
 broke down the door, and assaulted him. He suffered cracked ribs, severe bruises,
 and a possible broken jaw. Police meanwhile sealed off his home for several days;
 his elderly mother and relatives received food through the windows of an adjacent
 building. His charges have been changed from "public disorder," based on the dis-
 turbance caused when police roped off his street, to "disrespect" which could carry
 a longer sentence. He was released December 28 after being fined the equivalent
 of almost a year's average salary.
 As part of the December 10 crackdown, the homes of at least seven leading activ-
 ists were cordoned off. No one could enter or leave these homes. At the homes of
 Gustavo Arcos and Vladimiro Roca (son of the late Secretary General of the Cuban
 Communist Party), gas, electricity, and water were also cut off. Arcos was told that
 the cordoning would last until he stopped his human rights activism. Despite the
 threat, the cordoning stopped in late December.
 
 
 376
 Government interference also extcnds to deciding what is permissible entertain-
 ment. On May 18 Frank Agrat was with friends in his apartment, where they
 played "Ya Viene Llegando" a pop song critical of the regime. It is by Willy Chirino,
 a singer of Cuban descent living in the United States, whose songs the Government
 has banned. An informant called police, who then broke up the party, confiscated
 the cassette, and arrested Agrat. He was fined and released.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms do not exist. The Government
 does not allow direct criticism of the revolution or its leaders. Laws are enforced
 against antigovernment propaganda, graffiti, and insults against officials. The pen-
 alty is 3 months to 1 year in prison. If Fidel Castro or members of the National
 Assembly or Council of State are the object, the sentence is 1 to 3 years. Local
 CDR's inhibit freedom of speech by monitoring and reporting dissent or criticism
 (see Section 1.f.).
 The Constitution states that electronic and print media are state property and
 "cannot become, in any case, private property. The media are controlled by the
 Communist Party and operate under party guidelines. They faithfully reflect gov-
 ernment views and are used to indoctrinate the public. No other public forum exists
 for airing views. Artistic, literary, and academic freedoms are also circumscribed by
 the Government. Education is the exclusive prerogative of the State. The school sys-
 tem follows Marxist-Leninist precepts as interpreted by the Government.
 The Government continued to assert control over foreign media representatives in
 Cuba, refusing visas to reporters from several U.S. newspapers. Moreover, several
 foreign journalists were harassed or expelled because of articles they wrote. Spanish
 reporter Joaquin barz, of Barcelona's La Vanguardia, had his visa canceled without
 explanation in October 1991. Spanish journalist Santiago Arca was expelled in Jan-
 uary after writing an article on one of the men arrestea in an attempted infiltration
 the month before. L Monde correspondent Bertrand La Grange was attacked by
 two men May 23 in front of the home of activist Vladimiro Roca. Eco, the Mexican
 TV information service, announced May 30 that it would close its Havana office be-
 cause there was "not enough freedom to carry out our journalistic assignment."
 Beyond the Government a tight control over the media, other forms of expression
 are rigidly monitored. The Government frequently arrests and imprisons people for
 the crimes of "enemy propaganda" and "clandestine printing." Marco Antonio Abad
 and Jorge Antonio Crespo were arrested in late 1991 and charged with "enemy
 propaganda" and "contempt" after making a film, smuggled out of Cuba and shown
 in Costa Rica, called "Un Dia Cualquief ("A Day Like Any Other"). The Govern-
 ment indictment asserts that the film "attacks the integrity of our Chief of State,"
 even though the film has never been shown in Cuba. The prosecution asked for 8
 years' imprisonment for both. Sentencing is pending.
 Academic publications and research may not conflict with government or Com-
 munist Party plicy. Thirteen professors at the "ISPJAE" Polytechnic Institute, in-
 cluding Nestor Castellanos, Rafael Gonzalez, and Pedro Rubio, signed a "Declaration
 of Principles" in Decenber 1991, calling for a "genuine political space" in which in-
 tellectu ala could contribute freely to socety, respect for human rights as established
 in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, amnesty for al prisoners of con-
 science, and the "democratization of political life." All were subsequently fired from
 the  university  because   of  their  association  with  a   subversive  and
 counterrevlutonary group." More than 25 professors and staff have so far been dis-
 missed; most remain unemployed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution does notpro-
 vide for freedom of assembly or association. Those freedoms are not permitted. Any
 assembly of more than three persons, even in a private home, is punishable by up
 to 3 months in prison and a fine. Though not uversally enforced, it is often used
 as a legal pretext to harass and impson human rights advocates. The UNHRC
 SpecialRapporteur found that even though activists act "perfectly peaceful' and
 respectfully towards authority, they are continuously the object of harassment and
 persecution." According to the Penal Code's Article 240, organizers of "illicit or un-
 recognized groups" may be sentenced to up to 9 months. There is no known instance
 of authorities approving a public meeting of a human rights group.
 Th Ce elde          c   208 forbids "illegal or unrecognzed groups. The M -
 isthr of Justice, in consultation with MININT, decides whether to recognize organi-
 zations. Apart from  oreco nb"zed     2 churches and one or two carefuly monitored
 groups such as the Masonc Order, small human rights  ooups represent the only
 associations outside the State and party. Authorities continued to ignore numerous
 applications for legal recognition by various human rights groups. Because the Gov-
 ernment has not recognized these groups, activists are often jailed for "illicit asso-
 
 
 377
 ciation." In addition, members of such groups and even their spouses are often fired
 from their jobs (see also Section 2.a.). Miguel Brito Capote, for example, was dis-
 missed in April from his position as a mechanic with the armed forces because he
 was "unreliable." The Government cited his membership in the CCPDH and con-
 cluded that his way of thinking was 'not in accordance with revolutionary prin-
 ciples." Mayra Gonzalez, girlfriend of Sebastian Arcos (see Section 1.d.), was fred
 April 23 from her job at the Sugar Cane Institute for 'unreliability" for having
 "close relations with a citizen who is hostile to socialism and who heralds capitalist
 ideas about human rights in Cuba."
 Another measure used to harass activists are acts of repudiation, officially spon-
 sored   mob    gatherings   staged   outside   the   homes     of   suspected
 "counterrevolutionaries.' Though the Government contends that such 'acts' are
 spontaneous demonstrations of the people's will, they are, in reality, well-orches-
 trated events whose sole objective is to intimidate dissident elements and the gen.
 eral public. Mobs often in the hundreds and largely comprised of MININT officials
 and members of local CDR's and "Rapid Reaction Bigades," are often bussed in by
 the Government to shout insults, throw rocks, and paint condemnatory slogans. The
 acts can last hours or even days.
 Several major acts of repudiation were staged against activists. From January 12-
 15 alone, there were at least five separate acts against activists. One of the more
 serious was against Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Commission for Human Rights
 and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN), in which over 400 people shouted slogans
 and insults and vandalized Sanchez's house, pouring paint on the walls and break-
 ing windows. The incident lasted past midnight. On U.N. Human Rights Day, De-
 cember 10, prominent activist Gustavo Arcos was the object of another act, during
 which 75-year-old CCPDH activist Jesus Yanes Pelletier briefly lost consciousness
 after being hit an was then kicked by crowd members, and activist Aida Valdez was
 pushed and insulted. Arcos, formerly Cuba's ambassador to Belgium, was wounded
 at Castro's side while fighting at Moncada in 1953, while Yanes, a former police-
 man, saved Castro's life by disobeying an order to poison him in prison in 1953
 On March 4, Elizardo Sanchez and Jose Luis Pujol were subjected to a violent
 act when at least 200 people converged on Pujors home. DSE officials thoroughly
 searched the house before arresting both men. Sanchez and Pujol were then slowly
 taken through the crowd, which beat them and yelled insults. One of Sanchez' eyes
 was severely bruised. During interrogation, the men were told they had 'exceeded
 the limits." Though Sanchez was released 2 days later, Pujol remained in custody
 until he was sentenced to 2 years for 'contempt" in September.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government made a series of legal changes which
 it claimed would enhance freedom of religion, following the October 1991 approval
 by the Fourth Party Congress of the admission of religious adherents to the Com-
 munist Party. In July the National Assembly amended the Constitution to prohibit
 discrimination based on religion. It also removed references to 'scientific material-
 ism," i.e., atheism, as the basis for the Cuban State, and deleted a section making
 it "illegal and punishable" for a religious belief to oppose the revolution. This action
 was praised by the Ecumenical Council, but the Catholic Church stated its concern
 over the gap between the Government's rhetoric and actions.
 Despite these changes, religious persecution continues. The Government uses the
 Penal Code to persecute Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh Day Adventists system-
 atically and overtly. Witnesses are often convicted of "clandestine printing' if a
 search of their home reveals religious materials or "illicit ssociation" for having re-
 ligious meetings. They have also been found guilty of contributing to the delin-
 quency of a minor (Article 316),for "not complying with the duties related to respect
 and love of country," and for "abuse of the freedom of religion" (Article 206) because,
 out of religious conviction, they refuse to honor symbols of the Cuban State.
 In addition, ther   e been several verified re frts that Seventh Day Adventists
 have begn to experience similar discrimination or their beliefs. For example,
 ias of Santiago                         act of repudiation at the  ospital
 wher   e works because he is an Adventist. The hospital administration had forbid-
 den other workers from changing shifts with him, making it impossible for him to
 attend church on Saturdays. It then made him see a psychiatrist for what it deter-
 mined was "schizophrenic paranoia."
 Members of these religions are watched by the CDR's and often harassed. The
 CDR's are instructed to maintain surveillance over 18 different categories of people,
 ranging from "counterrevolutionary ex-convict" and "common criminal" to "active re-
 ligious enemies of the revolution and "spiritualists (santeros) who give consulta-
 tions."
 The Government and the Communist Party continue to maintain restrictions and
 controls on church activities. Churches and other religious groups must register
 
 
 378
 with the Government and be officially  ecognized." Authorized religious organiza-
 tions may hold activities only at designated places of worship. Many churches have
 closed. Since 1961, when religious holidays were eliminated and political indoctrina-
 tion classes introduced on Sundays, the Government has prohibited religious proces-
 sions and only rarely allowed churches access to mass media.
 In July a group of women, including Paula Valiente and Hilda Cabrera, marched
 along Havana's Malecon carrying a statue of the Virgin of Regla. Stopped by lice
 and arrested, the statue was destroyed. Valiente was hit, dragged to a patrol car,
 and taken in for questioning. The women were released after several hours. Valiente
 and a larger group of women made another religious procession August 8. They
 were again stopped and asked for their permit. When they noted recent constitu-
 tional changes allowing religious freedom, the police arrested them. After 5 hours,
 the women were warned and released. In September the Catholic Church issued a
 pastoral letter decrying arrests made by plainclothes police inside churches during
 services. Churchgrs who shouted "liberty" were hustled away by agents. On De-
 cember 13, a mob of some 30 eople pelted a Havana church with eggs, and then
 assaulted and frisked a group of mothers of political prisoners called "Mothers of
 Dignity-Leonor Peres" as they left the church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no legal restrictions on domestic travel. The Government now
 allows persons over 20 to apply for permission to travel abroad, but approval is by
 no means automatic.
 The Government permitted a few thousand people, including hundreds of ex-polit-
 ical prisoners, to emigrate. Nevertheless, it continues to delay or deny, without ex-
 planation, exit permits to many persons or their relatives who have been accepted
 by immigration or refugee programs. These often include professionals who once
 tried to leave Cuba and who have since been banned from working in their occupa-
 tional field.
 Others are refused permission because the Government considers their cases sen-
 sitive. The wives and children of Orestes Lorenzo and Joaquin Movrino Perez were
 denied exit visas because their husbands were air force pilots who defected. Orestes
 Lorenzo made a dramatic rescue of his wife and children from a Cuban highway
 in a small plane on December 19. Several prominent human rights activists were
 also denied exit visas, such as Mario Chanes de Armas, a former Castro comrade.
 At the time of his release from 30 years in prison in 1991, he was the longest-serv-
 ing political prisoner in the Western Hemisphere.
 There is no right of repatriation. Exit permits for unofficial, temporary travel
 specify that the person must return to Cuba within 30 days, although extensions
 are available. Cuban emigrants must apply for permission to return for visits. Those
 who left prior to 1959 usually receive such permission. However, there is a yearly
 limit of 10,000 visitor's visas for emigrants who left between 1959 and 1980. Those
 leaving after 1980 are generally not permitted to return to visit.
 The National Council for Civil Rights, formerly the Council of Cuban Rafters, esti-
 mates that, in the first 9 months of 1992, some 7000-8 000 people were detained
 on charges of illegal departure for trying to leave the country. Despite such difficul-
 ties, over 2,000 Cubans made it to the United States in small boats and rafts in
 1992. Government forces sometimes use lethal force to prevent them. In May the
 Border Guard intercepted a group several miles off Matanzas, ordered their boat to
 stop, and then began shooting. Orlando Fernandez was killed and Humberto Colon
 seriously wounded. In April a fighter aircraft shot down a small plane heading to-
 ward the US. killing all seven passengers and the pilot, a decorated war veteran.
 Cuba enlarged and modernized its minefield surrounding the U.S. Naval Base at
 Guantanamo Bay. On January 12, a 15-year-old boy lost a leg while crossing the
 minefield with his family. On July 5, two Cubans were killed by the mines.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Cuban citizens have no legal right to change their government or to advocate a
 change. The Constitution's Article 5 states that the only political organization al-
 lowed is the Communist Party. A small group of leaders select members of its high-
 est governing bodies-the Politburo and Central Committee.
 When change is made, it is tightly controlled. The Government refused to hold
 a plebiscite in 1992 when the National Assembly approved changes to nearly half
 the Constitution in only 3 days, despite the fact that Article 137 mandates a plebi-
 scite.
 Article 131 was amended to permit direct elections to provincial and national leg-
 islatures for the first time since those bodies were created in 1976. However, before
 nomination, every candidate must be prescreened by a "candidacy commission" coin-
 
 
 379
 posed of representatives of party-controlled "mass organizations." Up to half of the
 candidates will be nominated by the party behind closed doors. Only one candidate
 per seat will be allowed. Furthermore, no more than half of all seats in the provin-
 cial and national legislatures may be occupied by delegates to the city councils,
 whose election, while carefully manipulated by the party and the "mass organiza-
 tions" at the grassroots level, at least includes an element of competition. These new
 procedures are designed to ensure that only those persons who follow the govern-
 ment line will be placed on the ballot. The formation of political parties is outlawed;
 campaigning is forbidden. The elections are set for February 24, 1993.
 President Castro repeatedly ignored calls for democratic reform and labeled activ-
 ists who proposed them "worms and traitors working to undermine the revolution.
 Any change judged not within the revolution is rejected, as are proposals by Cubans
 who seek nonviolent political change or open debate about the political system. The
 Government has retaliated against those who have sought to change the Govern-
 ment or its policies. For example, the massive December 10 crackdown brought
 about the arrest, beating, harassment, or house arrest of at least 20 human rights
 activists.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No domestic or international human rights groups are recognized by the Govern-
 ment or permitted to function legally. As noted previously, domestic human rights
 monitors are subject to intense intimidation and repression. The Government re-
 fuses to consider, in violation of its own statutes, applications for legal recognition
 submitted by several human rights groups. The four principal domestic human
 rights monitoring groups are the Cuban Human Rights Committee (CCPDH) the
 Cuban Pro-Human Rights Party (PPDH), the Council for Civil Rights, and the
 Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN). In
 addition, there is the Cuban Democratic Convergence, an umbrella organization
 which includes a number of smaller human rights groups.
 The Government also rejects international human rights criticism. In July 1991
 when, in response to a resolution adopted by the UNHRC, the Secretary Generai
 named Rafael Rivas Posada as Special Representative Cuba's U.N. representative
 stated that Cuba did not recognize the UNHRC mandate on Cuba and would not
 cooperate with the Special Representative, even though Cuba is a UNHRC member.
 Cuba ignored repeated requests by the Special Representative to visit Cuba to meet
 officials and citizens.
 After the UNHRC passed a further resolution in March 1992, mandating that the
 position of Special Representative for Cuba be upgraded to Special Ragporteur, the
 Government reiterated that it would not comply with "a single comma of the reso-
 lution. Moreover, in a February 25 speech to the UNHRC, Vice Foreign Minister
 Raul Roa stated that "we could not and cannot allow ourselves to have the appoint.
 ment of a Special Representative imposed on us." He then criticized human rights
 activists as "frustrated, mediocre, and socially uprooted individuals." The new Spe-
 cial Rapporteur, Carl-Johan Groth, has also not been allowed to visit Cuba.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Cuba is a multiracial society with a majority of people of black and mixed racial
 ancestry. The Constitution forbids discrimination based on race, sex, or national ori-
 gin, although evidence suggests that racial and sexual discrimination occurs.
 The Family Code of 1975 states that women and men have equal rights and re-
 sponsibilities regarding marriage, divorce, raising children, maintaining the home,
 and pursuing a career. The Maternity Law of 1974 provides 18 weeks of maternity
 leave and grants working women preferential access to goods and services. Some 39
 percent of all women work. They are well represented in the professions, although
 few are in positions with policy responsibility.
 Cuban law establishes strict penalties including the death penalty, for rape.
 These statutes appear to be enforced. Information from human rights groups and
 other sources indicates that domestic violence and sexual assaults occur, but no sta-
 tistics are available. Violent crime is rarely reported in the press. Due to cultural
 traditions, victims of mistreatment are reluctant to press charges.
 Information about cases of racial discrimination is not available. Blacks tend to
 occupy low-status jobs; few are in senior government and military circles. Leader-
 ship positions in Castro's Government have been dominated by whites from the
 start. Nonwhites make up only 4 of the 25 Politburo members; only 15 percent of
 the over 200 members of the Party Central Committee; only 1 of Cuba's 12 vice-
 presidencies; and only 6 of the 29 seats on the Council of State. Also, many black
 activists report being singled out for harassment. MININT officials have told them
 
 
 380
 during interrogations that they are "ungrateful" for not appreciating what the revo-
 ution has done for them. Other black activists have been insulted with racial epi-
 thets by MININT officials.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution fives priority to state or collective
 needs over individual choices regarding free association or prevision of employment.
 Decisions and choices of workers are subordinate to the "demands of the economy
 and society." The law does not permit strikes, nor are any known to have occurred
 in 1992. Established labor organizations are not trade unions in any real sense and
 do not act as a voice for worker rights, including the right to strike. Labor is orga-
 nized under the control of the State and Party through one umbrella group, the
 Confederation of Cuban Workers (CTC).
 The CTC is affiliated with the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade
 Unions and plays a leading role in its regional organization, the Permanent Con-
 gress of Trade Union Unity of Latin America. The   C serves primarily as a state
 instrument to enforce political and labor discipline, to encourage productivity and
 extended hours of "voluntar" labor, to hold down labor costs, and to conserve raw
 materials. However, some CTC labor organizations have served as debating forums
 for a limited range of labor issues, such as safety or working conditions.
 Independent unions are explicitly prohibited. in June International Labor Organi-
 zation (ILO) concluded that independent unions "do not appear to exist" and ruled
 that Cuba violated ILO norms on freedom of association and the right to organize.
 Those who attempt to engage in union activities face government persecution and
 harassment. On January I1, Rafael Gutierrez Santos, president of a fledgling alter-
 native trade union movement, was seized by a mob of government supporters and
 later arrested by police. He was interrogated and warned to stop his independent
 union activities before being released without charges 2 days later. The Inter-
 national Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) issued a statement express-
 ing its concern over a "widespread crackdown on union and human rights activists."
 In September eight members of another fledgling independent organization, the
 Confederation of Democratic Workers (CTD), were seriously beaten after they ap-
 peared at the CTC's offices to protest its failure to defend worker interests.
 The ILO Governing Body in November adopted interim conclusions in response
 to an ICFTU complaint, reminding Cuba that arresting trade unionists without a
 warrant or when no grounds for conviction exist is a violation of trade union rights.
 It also asked Cuba to explain the attack against Gutierrez, his detention and the
 Justice Ministry's failure to reply to his group's request for registration and recogni-
 tion.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Co/lectively.--Collective bargaining does not
 exist. The State Committee for Work and Social Security sets wages and salaries
 for the state sector. Because the CTC is a government instrument, antiunion dis-
 crimination is only relevant as it applies to government repression of attempts to
 form independent unions. There are no known export processing zones in Cuba.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Neither the Constitution nor the
 Labor Code prohibits forced labor. The Government maintains "correctional centers"
 where youth are sent for such crimes as illegal departure. They are forced to work
 in farming or on building-sites, usually with no pay and little food. Internees who
 do not cooperate are usually imprisoned.
 Special groups of workers, known as "microbrigndes," on loan from other jobs, are
 employed on special building projects. They have increased importance in the Gov-
 ernment's efforts to complete tourist and other facilities that have priority attention.
 Workers who refuse to volunteer for these often become victims of discrimination
 or risk losing their jobs. Microbrigade workers, however, are reportedly rewarded
 with priority listing for aprtments, a strong incentive for such work.
 For years, various IL bodies have concluded that governmental restrictions on
 the freedom to choose or change employment are incompatible with ILO conventions
 prohibiting forced labor.  .1
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum working age
 is 17. The Labor Code exempts 15- and 16-year-olds to allow them to obtain training
 or to fill labor shortages. However, all students above age 11 are expected to devote
 30 to 45 days of their summer holidays to farm work up to a maximum 8 hours
 per day. "Voluntary labor" by Student Work Brigades continues to be used exten-
 sively in the farming sector.
 e. Acceptable Conitions of Work.-The minimum wage is supplemented by social
 security consisting of free medical care and education and subsidized housing and
 food. Even with these subsidies, however, a worker must earn much mere than min-
 imum wage to support a family. This condition has worsened dramatically during
 
 
 381
 the :speciaI period in pescetime," which the Government declared in 1990 in the
 fac    deepening economic difficulties.
 The standard workweek is 44 hours, with shorter workdays in hazardous occupa-
 tions as mining. The Government has discontinued most routine work on alternate
 Saturdays and-has reduced workdays to 5 hours in many institutions in order to
 save energy. Worker safety and pollution control provisions appear to be inadequate.
 Effective control and enforcement mechanisms to ensure worker safety are lacking.
 Industrial accidents apparently are frequent.
