 MAURITANIA
 Since the military coup d'etat on July 10, 1938, the Mauritan-
 ian political scene has been marked by extraordinary instabil-
 ity. The newly installed Military Committee for National
 Salvation (CMSN) devoted much of its energies to seeking a
 solution to the conflict in the Western Sahara. In August
 1979, the CMSN signed a peace treaty with the Polisario
 (the Western Sahara Liberation movement), despite opposition
 from Morocco, its former ally. The perceived hostility of
 Morocco, however, has proved almost as worrisome for the
 government as did the former threat of Polisario attack.
 In addition, long simmering racial problems and a steady
 erosion of the military's popular support have made the
 government vulnerable.
 Under these circumstances, the Government has taken measures
 to severely restrict political activity. It has forbidden
 all assemblies organized for the purpose of political discus-
 sion, whether in public or in private dwellings. The ban has
 generally been strictly enforced, and suspected dissidents
 have been regularly detained, although normally for only
 short periods. Movement in major cities has been restricted
 by a midnight to six a.m. curfew. Some prominent citizens
 have also been refused permission to leave the country.
 At the same time, however, the government has generally
 adhered to sections of Mauritanian law which guarantee the
 integrity of the person. The government has not made mass
 arrests, nor has it been accused of using brutality or
 torture. As a humanitarian gesture, it accorded provisional
 releases in April to members of the former government of
 President Mokhtar Ould Daddah, who had been arrested follow-
 ing the 1978 coup d'etat. The former president himself was
 allowed, in September 1979, to go to France for medical
 treatment. Although the Constitution has been abolished, the
 administration of justice continues to be based both on the
 French Declaration on the Rights of Man and the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights. The CMSN has consistently
 indicated its intention to return the country to civilian
 rule as soon as the political situation stabilizes and a
 satisfactory economic recovery program has been implemented.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Mauritanian law prohibits the use of torture, and there
 are no reports that it has been practiced here.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no reports of such treatment or punishment or
 of summary executions.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 These practices are prohibited under the legal system
 and generally do not occur. Law enforcement authorities
 have the right to hold a suspect for 48 hours before he
 
 
 125
 must be either charged or released. This law is reportedly
 respected in practice.
 The Government also, however, is empowered under a law
 passed by the former civilian government to place in de-
 tention anyone whom it considers to be a threat to national
 security. The term of detention is defined as six months;
 however, upon expiration, it may be renewed for an additional
 six months. Since such detention for security purposes is an
 administrative measure entirely outside the legal apparatus,
 the suspect detainee has no recourse to trial and he cannot
 be held in normal prison quarters. The Military Committee
 has made use of these powers of detention on several occa-
 sions over the past year.
 The first to be confined under the decree, the members of
 the former civilian cabinet who were arrested following
 the July 10, 1978 coup d'etat, were given a provisional
 release in April 1979. The government, however, made it
 clear that the former ministers might still be tried for
 corruption, and it promptly sent the most prominent of the
 group to residences well removed from the capital. In
 September notable supporters of the former civilian govern-
 ment were detained following rumors of an attempted coup.
 Although most were subsequently released, the former Minis-
 ters of Foreign Affairs and of National Sovereignty are still
 under close watch, as are several other prominent members of
 the old regime.
 In late September 1978, the Government allowed former
 President Ould Daddah to seek medical treatment in France.
 Although Ould Daddah is apparently to be returned to Mauri-
 tania following completion of treatment, no date has been set
 for his return.
 Racial difficulties throughout the past year have led to
 periodic arrests of suspected agitators. In early 1979,
 perhaps as many as ten persons were detained for a week or
 two, and shortly before the end of the academic year in June,
 some eighty student activists were arrested. Some. of
 this latter group were transferred to detention centers
 outside Nouakchott. All were released following the first
 anniversary of the coup d'etat on July 10, 1979. Apparently
 no charges were ever preferred against any of those detained.
 Five former officials and perhaps as many as ten other
 suspected opponents of the regime are in preventive detention
 at various sites around the country. The movements of
 some other persons may also be closely restricted.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair and public trials are guaranteed by law. Although the
 Government is generally committed to prompt judicial proce-
 dures, an inadequate and underfinanced legal system sometimes
 means that criminal suspects are held for long periods before
 trial.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The law prohibits such intrusions and is respected in
 practice.

 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Government efforts to provide basic services to the popu-
 lation have been hampered by both a lack of resources
 and accelerating rural exodus following years of drought.
 Education and health services have reached a relatively
 limited proportion of the population (11 percent literacy
 rate and 17 percent infant mortality rate). To stem the
 growth of the urban sector, the Government has accorded
 top priority to extending more services and a greater
 development effort to the rural areas. However, only
 limited resources are available to accomplish that enormous
 task, and the country's very low population density makes
 the per capita cost of providing such services very high
 indeed. In the field of education, the Government's task is
 complicated by the very strong divisions between the Arabic
 speaking Moorish population and a sizeable black minority
 which has historically preferred to be educated in French
 rather than in Arabic. In October 1979, the Government, in
 recognition of the blacks' separate cultural heritage,
 virtually abandoned a long-standing policy aimed at the
 total Arabization of the educational system. The new policy
 calls for the transcription of local languages and allows
 the non-Arabic speaking population to be educated in French.
 Although Mauritania's economy is primarily agriculturally
 based, years of drought have led to a rural exodus which
 is one of the most rapid in the world. The transition may
 lead to an explosive situation in the cities, where the
 development of an industrial base cannot begin to keep pace
 with the inflow of job-seekers. The economy is basically
 capitalist, particularly in the commercial sector. However,
 the state is heavily involved in the industrial sector
 because the private sector does not have the means to make
 the necessary investment.   The income gap between the rich
 and the poor is large. The tax system is progressive,
 although few Mauritanians pay their true tax assessment.
 Property is privately owned and that right is respected.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Although Islam is the official religion of Mauritania
 (99 percent of the population is Moslem and the formal
 name of the country is the Islamic Republic of Mauritania),
 freedom of conscience and the right to practice one's
 religion are taken for granted. Non-Moslems have experienced
 no difficulty exercising their religion in Mauritania.
 There is a Roman Catholic bishop and several Catholic
 conqregations. There are no restrictions on religious
 expression or practice.
 The country's only newspaper and the radio station are
 operated by the Government. Their editorial content is
 controlled and criticism of Government policies is not
 allowed. However, foreign newspapers and magazines are
 freely sold on the street, and they are rarely censored.
 Foreign radio broadcasts are heard without interference.
 
 
 127
 The Government has, however, expelled two correspondents of
 the French Press Agency this year for filing unfavorable
 dispatches.
 Freedom of assembly has been suspended since the military
 takeover in July 1978. Following the reorganization of the
 Military Committee on April 6, 1979, the Government warned
 that political assembly, whether in public or in individual
 dwellings, would not be tolerated, and it imposed a curfew as
 one means of reducing such gatherings. At various times
 during the year, prominent citizens suspected of opposing
 official policies have been detained.  With the notable
 exception of several ministers of the former civilian govern-
 ment, most have been released shortly after being taken into
 custody. Such preventive detention has no fixed time period
 (there is no right of habeas corpus), however, and some
 have been held for monthswithout charge.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Movement is allowed freely within Mauritania. Foreign
 travel necessitates an exit visa from the National Police
 office. Some members and alleged sympathizers of the former
 government have been refused permission to leave the country,
 and in some cases have had their passports confiscated.
 Students who, following the deterioration of relations with
 Morocco, attempted to pursue their education in Morocco were
 denied permission to travel to that country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The July 10, 1978 coup d'etat resulted in the suspension
 of the political process. The military, which promised to
 return the country to civilian rule, has indicated that it
 plans to restore democratic institutions as soon as a
 national recovery plan, covering the resolution of the
 Saharan conflict and the resurrection of the economy, has
 been carried out. No timetable has been set, however.
 The role of Mauritanian women in government and other
 modern endeavors remains very limited, largely because of
 traditional social values. Certain women have risen to
 positions of prominence in the fields of health and educa-
 tion, and it is fairly common for female secondary school
 graduates to find jobs as teachers, as low or middle level
 government workers, or as clerks. The Military Committee
 has recommended the establishment of centers for women's
 affairs.
 Mauritania has one labor union, the Union of Mauritanian
 Workers (UTM). Prior to the 1978 coup d'etat, the union
 was officially tied to the single, Government-controlled
 political party. Although the union is now an independent
 entity, it continues to receive a small operational subsidy
 from the Government. Attempts by the UTH leadership to call
 an extraordinary union congress aimed at increasing grass-
 roots support have been steadfastly opposed by the Government.
 The UTM continues to work closely with the Government, and
 many of its leaders also have jobs. in the public sector.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 We are aware of no outstanding requests for outside in-
 vestigation of human rights conditions in Mauritania.
