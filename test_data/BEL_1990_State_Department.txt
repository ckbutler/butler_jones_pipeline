 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a longstanding parliamentary democracy under a
 constitutional monarch, King Baudouin I, whose role is largely
 ceremonial. The Council of Ministers (Cabinet), led by the
 Prime Minister, is responsible for government decisions. The
 Cabinet holds office as long as it retains the confidence of
 the democratically elected bicameral Parliament.
 National, municipal, and judicial police forces bear the
 primary responsibility for domestic security in Belgium. The
 armed forces play no role in domestic law enforcement.
 Belgium is a highly industrialized state with a mixed, free
 market-economy. A vigorous private sector, government
 participation in certain industries, and an extensive social
 welfare system combine to support a relatively high standard
 of living for most Belgians.
 Respect for human rights in Belgium-is provided for in the
 Constitution and laws and observed in practice. The Belgian
 Government is sensitive to allegations of human rights
 violations and in-1990 took steps to adjust national policies
 criticized by the European Court of Human Rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detentions are not
 known to occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of torture or inhuman treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is provided for
 by law and respected in practice. Arrested persons must be
 brought before a judge within 24 hours. Thereafter, pretrial
 confinement is allowed only under certain legally specified
 circumstances. The premise for such confinement is subject to
 monthly review by a panel of judges.
 Bail exists in principle under Belgian law but is rarely
 granted in practice. There is no limit on how long an accused
 may be held prior to coming to trial. In 1988 the European
 Court of Human Rights criticized Belgium for placing juveniles
 in prisons until accommodations could be found in special
 juvenile correction institutions. Legislative proposals to
 end this practice have been made but bot-enacted.- Exile of
 Belgian citizens is not permitted by law.
 As a result of perceived malfeasance by Belgian law enforcement
 agencies, a special parliamentary investigatory committee
 reported in June that Belgium's law enforcement structure
 
 
 1096
 
 BELGIUM
 suffers from lack of coordination, poor leadership, and rivalry
 among police organizations. It recommended a thorough
 revision, including reorganization of the law enforcement
 agencies, improved political oversight, and clarification of
 the codes of conduct for police forces.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial, including the right to counsel, is assured
 by law and honored in practice. A suspect is charged, if the
 evidence so warrants, once a preliminary judicial investigatory
 phase is completed. Charges are clearly and formally stated,
 and defendants enjoy the right of appeal. Imprisonment for
 political beliefs is prohibited.
 In March 1989, Belgium was criticized by the European Court of
 Human Rights for withholding evidence from defense attorneys
 for as long as 1 month after detainees had been arrested. New
 legislation has brought Belgian law in this area into
 compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy by the State
 is guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Search
 warrants issued by a judge are required, unless the inhabitants
 of a domicile agree to a search. Monitoring of telephones and
 interference with mail are prohibited. Draft legislation
 would allow judges discretion to order wiretapping in narrowly
 circumscribed cases to further judicial investigations into
 serious crime. There is no forced political membership or
 other coercive control of the population.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are assured by law and respected in practice.
 Varying political, religious, philosophical, and artistic views
 are permitted free public expression, subject only to slander
 and libel laws. There is no political censorship of the
 media. Statutes protect citizens' rights to reply to media
 criticism. Publications and productions held to undermine
 "public order" (e.g., explicit pornography and incitement to
 violence) are prohibited, however, and civil servants are in
 theory restricted from criticizing government policy, although
 in practice they do so freely. Academic freedom is respected.
 The Government operates several radio and television networks
 but does not control program content. Programs are supervised
 by boards of directors, which represent the main political,
 linguistic, and opinion groups. A government representative
 sits on each board but has no veto power. Private radio and
 television stations operate with government licenses. Most
 urban homes have access by cable to television from other
 European countries.
 Controversy arose in 1990 regarding the frequency allotted to,
 and shared by, five Arabic broadcasters. In their agreement
 with the government-owned radio network, the broadcasters had
 agreed that (a) 50 percent of their programming would be in
 French and 50 percent in Arabic, and (b) they would produce
 programming aimed at furthering the integration of immigrants
 into Belgian society. The Francophone Community Government
 
 
 1097
 BELGIUM
 has complained that at least 80 percent of the programming is
 in Arabic and much of it extremist. Since the outbreak of the
 Persian7Gulf crisis, critics have accused the station of
 transmitting pro-Iraqi propaganda.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association-
 Public assembly is subject to regulations concerning public
 order but is otherwise unrestricted. Groups protesting
 government policies oractions are free from harassment and
 persecution. Permits are required for open-air assemblies but
 are granted routinely, although there are restrictions on
 blocking major arteries to and from downtown Brussels.
 Belgians are free to form organizations and to establish ties
 to interqational bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Belgium has a long tradition of religious tolerance. The
 Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religions are accorded a
 "recognized" status in law and granted a government subsidy.
 Minority "nonrecognized" religions enjoy full freedom to
 practice and are not subject to harassment or persecution.
 By law, all officially "recognized" religions have the right
 to provide teachers to give religious instruction in the
 schools. Controversy currently focuses on whether the Islamic
 Community Center should have the authority to pass on teachers
 of Islam for the mostly Moroccan and Turkish community, or
 whether municipal governments should have that-authority.
 d. Freedom of Movement. Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Enigration, and Repatriation
 Belgians are free to travel both within Belgium and abroad and
 may return to Belgium at any time. Citizens are free to choose
 their places of work and residence. The Government does not
 force refugees to return to- countriesr where they face
 persecution- However, due to the heavy influx of immigrants-
 (e.g. Nigerians, Turks, and Moroccans), the Government in-
 1987 issued an exception to five municipalities which, because
 of the large immigrant proportion of their population
 (generally more than 40 percent), are not required to accept
 additional foreigners for residence.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Participation in the political system is open to all citizens.
 Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats (excluding 77
 of the 183 Senate seats apportioned by other means) are held
 at least every 4 years under a system of universal, secret,
 and compulsory suffrage for all adults (age 18 and over).
 Unweighted voting (one person/one vote) has been in effect
 since 1919 for men and 1949 for women. In law and practice,
 opposition parties are free to operate without constraints or
 repression. Seventeen political parties, representing the
 full range of the political spectrum, competed in the last
 general elections in December 1987. There are no
 restrictions, in law or in practice, on the participation of
 women in government or politics.
 The existence of Dutch-, French- and German-speaking
 communities poses significant problems for the State. All
 major institutions, including political parties, are divided
 
 
 1098
 BELGIUM
 along linguistic lines. There are special provisions for
 Dutch-, French-, and German-speaking councils at the regional
 level. Regional and linguistic needs are taken into account
 in national, political, and economic decisions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests have been made for outside investigation of the
 human rights situation in Belgium. Several active independent
 human rights groups exist. All consider the Government open
 to discussion of any human rights question. The Ministry of
 Justice and other governmental agencies are sensitive to
 allegations of human rights anuses and take steps to correct
 perceived shortcomings in national legislation. The Government
 is a party to various international human rights treaties and
 has been active in the United Nations and other international
 forums in promoting human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Belgium is a culturally vibrant, pluralistic society in which
 individual differences in general are respected, and linguistic
 rights in particular are protected. Some 57 percent of
 Belgians are native Dutch speakers living primarily in the
 northern provinces that constitute Flanders. The 42 percent
 of the population who are French speakers live mostly in the
 capital, Brussels, and the.southern provinces of Wallonia. A
 small minority of German speakers lives along the eastern
 border. Language differences have been the subject of
 hundreds of laws over the last century, leading to a fairly
 rigid structure designed to protect each language group from
 cultural, economic, or political dominance by the others.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 residents regardless of race, sex, religion, language, social
 status, or ethnic background. Some 27 percent of the residents
 of Brussels, the largest city, are foreigners. Many of these
 are North African and Turkish immigrants. Encouraging the
 further assimilation of the immigrant population--generally
 poorer, less skilled, and less well educated than average--is
 increasingly the focus of public debate.
 Belgium is a leading advocate of women's rights both within
 the country and in international meetings on the subject. A
 number of commissions have been established to ensure that
 women's rights are protected and to oversee women's education
 and working conditions. To highlight the importance attached
 to promoting women's rights internationally, a Consultative
 Commission for the Condition of Women was established within
 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 Physical abuse of women is punishable by law, and the law is
 enforced. Until recently, however, little factual evidence
 was available concerning the extent of abuse. According to a
 1988 government study, 25 percent of Belgian women had
 encountered some form of physical abuse, while 13 percent had
 suffered "moderately serious" physical abuse, and 3 percent
 "very serious" abuse. In reaction to the study, the
 Government improved coordination among the various institutions
 involved in combating the abuse of women, provided better
 training to police on domestic and sexual violence, and
 
 
 1099
 BELGIUM
 organized an extensive publicity campaign designed to raise
 national awareness about the abuse of women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike. With
 an estimated 70 percent of its labor force organized, Belgium
 is one of the most unionized countries in the world and has a
 long tradition of democratic trade union elections. Unions
 striking or protesting government policies or actions are free
 from harassment and persecution. In certain narrowly defined,
 circumstances, such as the provision of essential public
 services, the public employees' right to strike may be limited.
 Labor unions are strong and independent of the Government but
 have important informal links with and influence on many of
 the major political parties. Unions in Belgium are affiliated
 with the major international bodies representing labor, such
 as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions-and
 the World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is recognized
 and exercised freely. The right to due process and judicial
 review are guaranteed for all protected activity. Effective
 mechanisms exist for adjudicating disputes between labor and
 management. Belgium maintains a system of labor tribunals and
 courts which hear disputes arising from labor contracts,
 collective bargaining agreements, and other matters.
 There are no export processing zones, and labor legislation
 and practice are uniform throughout Belgium.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 16; children may
 work and study part time from age 16 to 18. The labor court
 effectively monitors compliance with national laws and
 standards.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Belgian working hours, mandated by law and through collective
 bargaining agreements, are among the shortest in Europe. A
 maximum 40-hour workweek is mandated by law, although many
 collective agreements call for workweeks between 36 and 39
 hours. The legal minimum wage, currently about $1,129 per
 month for full-time workers over age 21, provides an adequate
 minimum standard of living. By law, workers in the private
 sector receive at least 24 days of vacation per year and an
 annual vacation bonus equal to approximately 14 per cent of
 their annual wage. Unemployment benefits are guaranteed.
 Comprehensive health and safety legislation is supplemented by
 collective bargaining agreements. Health and safety
 committees and works councils are mandated by law in companies
 with more than 50 employees. Labor courts effectively monitor
 compliance with national laws and standards.
