 NIGERIA
 A military coup brought the Federal Military Govern-
 ment (FMG) to power in 1966. After the 1967-70
 civil war, amnesty was extended to all but a few
 secessionist leaders, and Nigeria achieved note-
 worthy success in bringing about internal recon-
 ciliation and the reintegration of secessionist
 elements. On July 29, 1975, a bloodless coup
 resulted in a change of government leadership. On
 February 13, 1976, the head of state General Murtala
 Muhammed was assassinated in an aborted coup. The
 present leader of the government is Lt. General
 Olusegun Obasanjo.
 Chapter III of the 1963 constitution contains broad
 human rights guarantees which generally remain in
 force. From time to time, however, FMG decrees
 circumscribe some rights. A ten-year old state of
 emergency remains in force though many of its pro-
 visions appear to be held in abeyance.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Torture
 The right to freedom from torture is observed.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The right to freedom from cruel, inhuman or de-
 grading punishment is observed with the exception
 that armed robbers convicted by civilian trial are
 executed in public, as a deterrent measure, and some
 of those adjudged by a military tribunal guilty of
 complicity in the February 1976 coup attempt, which
 resulted in the murder of the chief of state, were
 subsequently publicly shot. However, death sentences
 imposed by civilian courts normally are not carried
 out in public. Nigerian prisons lack many modern
 facilities but prisoners are generally treated well.

 Family members are permitted liberal access to pri-
 soners and are allowed to provide food, clothing and
 other basic needs.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The right to freedom from arbitrary arrest or im-
 prisonment generally is observed although there have
 been exceptions when the government believed a ques-
 tion of internal security or other emergency existed.
 To the best of our knowledge, there currently are no
 political prisoners in Nigeria.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are almost always available.
 However, an eleven-year old state of emergency remains
 in effect, as do the decrees (particularly the Armed
 Forces and Police Special Powers Decree No. 24 of 1967
 and the Supremacy and Enforcement of Powers Decree No.
 28 of 1970) which prevent the judiciary from ques-
 tioning the substance of the Federal Military Govern-
 ment authority to detain persons without trial. The
 Public Officers (Special Provisions) Decree of March
 2, 1976, denies dismissed public officials the right
 to seek redress in court. In recent years, the state
 of emergency provisions have rarely been invoked, and
 the ordinary Nigerian continues to receive justice
 from the courts under both traditional and statutory
 law.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The right to be free from invasion of the home is
 observed, though there has been one case in the past
 year in which the home of a prominent Nigerian citizen
 was entered by the Nigerian government with neither
 the consent of the owner nor a search warrant. How-
 ever, the government's action in this instance is
 being challenged in the courts which can and do rule
 against the government.
 
 
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 The FMG has taken positive steps to develop and
 implement programs to fulfill basic needs for food,
 shelter, improved health care, and education. A
 primary goal of the 1975-80 development plan and the
 current annual budget is to accelerate economic
 growth and improve the living conditions of the poor.
 One feature of the development plan, the National
 Accelerated Food Production Project, is a project
 designed to increase food production. Another, the
 Universal Primary Education scheme, is an ambitious
 program to provide free primary education to all
 Nigerian children. Additionally the FMG announced
 that effective this fall it will provide secondary and
 university education without direct charge.
 The government consistently condemns corruption and
 has taken legal actions to discourage its occurrence.
 However, corruption does divert private and public
 resources from needed development projects.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech,* Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These liberties are generally observed despite the ban
 on political parties. There are few recent instances
 of censorship of print or broadcast media in Nigeria,
 whether of foreign or domestic origin. All TV and
 radio broadcast organizations are now wholly owned by
 the government, and only two major newspapers remain
 independently owned. All of these media are used for
 the presentation of government views but they are also
 frequently critical of the government's foreign and
 domestic policies and the government is attentive to
 such criticism and public reaction to it.

 Ostensibly in the interest of the public welfare and
 because of a past history of alleged corruption, the
 FMG has sharply curtailed the right of workers to
 associate freely, organize trade unions, and choose
 their own leaders. The government has imposed a
 reorganization of all trade unions into new group-
 ings determined by the government. In August 1976,
 the government proscribed 11 labor leaders from all
 future trade union activity. This decree is not
 subject to appeal. However, under the terms of an
 amendment to a government proposed Trade Union Code
 of Conduct, Nigerian labor leaders will be allowed
 to take part in partisan politics when the ban is
 lifted in 1978 and trade unions are permitted to
 draft their own constitutions. In light of the
 above official actions, the FMG was charged by the
 International Labor Organization with violating ILO
 conventions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 These basic freedoms are respected.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 There has been a ban on political parties and
 national political activity since 1966, but a return
 to civilian rule has been promised by October 1,
 1979. The FMG appears determined to maintain its
 announced schedule to achieve that goal. Nonpartisan
 local government authority elections were held in
 December 1976, and a constituent assembly was con-
 vened in October 1977, to adopt a new constitution.
 In some states, members of local government au-
 thorities were elected directly under universal
 adult (18 and over) sufferage. In other states, all
 adults were permitted to vote for electors who in
 turn chose members of local.government authorities.
 Elected members of the constituent assembly were
 chosen by members of the local government authorities.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-Governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The FMG in the past has not offered a public reaction
 to allegations of human rights violations or re-
 ceived any requests for outside investigation. The
 response to such a request would depend on the
 nature of the allegations and the reputation of the
 organization requesting the investigation.
