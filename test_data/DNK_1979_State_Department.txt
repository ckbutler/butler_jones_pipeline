 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a long democratic
 tradition. It has a unicameral legislature of 179 members,
 elected proportionally by a complicated system that allows
 representation for virtually every minority. A spirit of
 compromise has largely overcome the problems created by a
 multiplicity of parties and has fostered the creation of a
 society marked by humanitarianism and a highly developed
 social welfare system. There is broad public support and
 consensus for strong human rights policies in Denmark.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by law and respected in prac-
 tice.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Fulfilling the basic needs of the population for food, shelter,
 health care and education are major objectives of Danish
 government policies. These policies include full consideration
 for less privileged elements of the society. A comprehensive
 social welfare policy includes provisions of health and
 medical services, welfare services, various family benefits,
 pensions, and disability and unemployment insurance. Ombuds-
 men have the power to investigate charges that these or any
 other government programs are not carried out fairly or that
 they violate the rights of private persons.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed bv law and respected in practice.

 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political life is carried out in a highly democratic fashion.
 Danish trade unions are by law guaranteed the'right to organ-
 ize, strike, bargain collectively and lobby. The labor move-
 ment, a dominant social and political force, fully guarantees
 the rights of both sexes, a policy backed up by advanced and
 comprehensive public welfare legislation. Danish women hold
 high and influential positions in virtually every area of
 society. They are cabinet ministers, parliamentarians, judges,
 journalists, and are integrated into governmental bureaucracy
 at all levels; however, unemployment among young women is
 roughly twice that of young men. There is respect for civil
 and political liberties both in theory and in practice.
 4.   Governmental Attitudes and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Denmark has conceptually and in practice been a leader in the
 field of human rights. It has supported human rights in inter-
 national fora and been in the vanguard of those furthering the
 rights of women, the disadvantaged and the poor. Denmark holds
 its human rights record open for international appraisal, re-
 cently defending itself before the European Commission on Human
 Rights when charges of insensitivity were brought by one of its
 citizens. Denmdark is party to the International Covenant on
 Civil and Political Rights (including the optional protocol),
 the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the
 European Convention on Human Rights.
