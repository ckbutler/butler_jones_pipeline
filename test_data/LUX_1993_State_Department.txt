 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy with a democratic parliamentary form
 of government. Executive authority is exercised by the Prime Minister. The role of
 the Grand Duke, the titular Head of State, is largely ceremonial. The Chamber of
 Deputies, a unicameral legislature, encompasses the full political spectrum. The
 Council of State, an appointed body, reviews legislation before it is given final ap-
 proval by the Chamber.
 The police and gendarmerie who maintain order are subordinate to governmental
 and judicial authority. Judicial and penal systems are open, efficient, and fair.
 Luxembourg has a prosperous free market economy with active industrial and
 services sectors. Its standard of living and level of social benefits are high.
 Human rights are valued and safeguarded. Individual rights are protected by law
 and respected in practice by both the Government and the populace. Luxembourg's
 large foreign population (just over 30 percent) is well integrated into the society and
 the economy.National practices in apparent conflict with human rights are quickly
 and publicly addressed.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Killing for political reasons did not
 occur.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known instances of politically motivated dis-
 appearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture or other unusual punishment is prohibited by law and is not known to
 occur. An allegation by a resident Spanish foreign national charing police use of
 excessive force is being investigated to determine whether the police acted outside
 the law.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Due process is provided by law and ob-
 served in practice. Except in cases of hot pursuit, judicial warrants are required for
 arrests. Detainees must be charged and must appear before a judge within 24 hours
 of arrest. Prisoners are not held incommunicado, and immediate access to an attor-
 ney is granted. Those who are charged are held pending trial or released on bail
 at the judge's discretion. Exile is never imposed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Luxembourg has an independent and fair judicial
 system with the right of appeal. Civilians are not tried in military courts. All de-
 fendants have access to legal counsel, at public expense if necessary. All charges are
 formally and publicly stated. Defendants are presumed innocent unless proven
 guilty. They have the right to public trial, cross-examination of witnesses, and pres-
 entation of evidence. Either the defendant or the prosecutor may appeal a ruling.
 An appeal results in a completely new judicial procedure, with the possibility that
 a sentence may be increased or decreased. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary. Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy is protected by law and respected in practice. A judicial warrant
 is required to enter a private residence, to monitor private correspondence, or to
 conduct electronic surveillance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedoms of speech and press are legally pro-
 tected and respected in practice. Print media are privately owned and free of gov-
 ernmental interference. The privately owned national radio and television company
 has exclusive rights for television broadcasting within Luxembourg. The company
 is subject to governmental oversight but functions independently. A newly instituted
 permit system allows the establishment of other private radio stations. Radio and
 television broadcasts from neighboring countries are freely available.
 Censorship is not legally imposed, but societal consensus on propriety largely pre-
 cludes dissemination of extreme pornography or of sensitive information concerning
 national security or the royal family. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association is provided by law and exists in practice. No limitations are imposed
 on orderly public demonstrations. Permits for public demonstrations are routinely
 issued.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion, and full freedom of religious
 choice exists. There are no restrictions on maintaining places of worship, religious
 training or instruction, publication of religious material, or participation in chari-
 table activities. Foreign clergy practice freely. Luxembourg's population is about 95
 percent Roman Catholic. The state pays the salaries of Roman Catholic, Protestant,
 and Jewish clergy. Local governments often provide and maintain religious facili-
 ties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Counlry, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is full freedom of domestic and foreign travel, emigration, and re-
 patriation. Luxembourg asylum policy grants asylum seekers due process and full
 consideration of their cases.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Luxembourg is a fully functional multiparty democracy. There is universal suf-
 frage for all citizens aged 18 and above. Policy is freely debated within the Govern-
 ment and the society. There is no risk in dissent; opposition groups and political
 parties operate without fear of government repression. National elections are held
 every 5 years, and local elections every 6 years. Representatives are chosen by se-
 cret ballot in direct elections which are based on a proportional system. Multiple
 candidates run for most positions. The Maastricht Treaty entitles nationals of Euro-
 pean Union (EU) states to vote in their country of residence, starting in 1995, re-
 
 
 963
 ardless of how long they have lived there. Due to Luxembourg's large foreign popu-
 lation, it has received a derogation whereby EU non-citizen residents who have re-
 sided in Luxembourg for at least 5 years will be permitted to vote in local and Euro-
 pean Parliament elections. Such residents may run for election after residing in
 Luxembourg for at least 10 years.
 Foreigners who have fulfilled certain age and residency requirements (usually 18
 years of age and 10 years of residence, 5 of them continuously) may appl for Lux-
 embourg citizenship. Women participate freely in the political process. There are
 seven women in the Chamber of Deputies, including the President of the Chamber.
 Other women in senior leadership positions include the Minister of Agriculture, the
 Secretary of State for Public Health and Youth, three members of the European
 Parliament, and the mayors of several major municipalities, including Luxembourg
 City.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not restrict the activities of local or international human
 rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Racial, social, or sexual discrimination is prohibited by law. In practice, blatant
 discrimination rarely occurs, and relations among native Luxembourgers, immi-
 grants, and other foreigners are generally good.
 Women.-Women and men en4oy the same property rights. In the absence of a
 prenuptial agreement, property is equally divide upon  issolution of a marriage.
 Equal pay for equal work is mandated by law. No job discrimination suits have
 been brought to date. In addition to prominent women politicians and civil servants,
 there are noted women doctors, lawyers, and journalists. A recent European Union
 study on women's presence in the Luxembourg labor market noted that only 52 per-
 cent of Luxembourg women between the ages of 25 and 49 work, which may be at-
 tributed in part to Luxembourg's singular prosperity. The study also pointed out
 that, while progress is being made, women s salaries in Luxembourg are only 55
 percent of men  -earnings and that women are concentrated in lowerlevel clerical,
 janitorial, and sales jobs but that proga is bein  made in the banking sector.
 Violence against women is not widespread and is not tolerated by society or the
 Government. Several women's rights groups, including some that aid battered
 women, are active. Prosecution of battery charges does take place, but cases are
 rare.
 Children.-The Government is strongly committed to the protection of children's
 rights and welfare. Luxembourg pays family allocation allowances (calculated on a
 sliding scale according to family income and size), birth premiums, and educational
 allowances. School is compulsory, beginning at age 4. Among other activities, the
 Ministry of Youth coordinates youth centers, educational and cultural exchanges,
 and courses.
 Child abuse is not considered to be a widespread problem. The Luxembourg Asso-
 ciation for the Prevention of Child Abuse believes there may be about 200 cases a
 year. Victims of or witnesses to child abuse may call for help on a hotline.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Government estimates in 1993 indicate that
 Luxembourg's foreign population is over 30 percent of the total, primarily long-term
 permanent residents. Approximately 85 percent of the foreign population comes
 from European Community member states. Luxembourg recognizes a need for for-
 eign workers, and foreigners generally are assimilated into the overall society and
 economy without difficulty. "Skinheads" and neo-Nazis are few, and antiforeigner in-
 cidents are infrequent (estimated at less than 10 in 1993) and confined largely to
 harassment. Police respond whether or not the motivation is antiforeigner. The Gov-
 ernment has tried to promote increased tolerance through education and subsidizes
 French, German, and Luxembourg courses to help integrate foreigners into the soci-
 ety.
 Approximately 2,200 refugees from the former Yugoslavia resided in Luxembourg
 under temporary special protected status in 1993. Government and private entities
 continued to support their basic needs. Some 300-400 of these refugees were work-
 ing. Although precise figures are difficult to determine, the Government has esti-
 mated that 220-250 refugees from the conflict in the former Yugoslavia resided in
 Luxembourg without the benefit of legal protection.
 People with Disabilities.-Luxembourg's national programs for the disabled are co-
 ordinated by the Ministry of the Family. Job placement and professional education
 assistance is provided by the Government. Disabled workers apply for positions
 
 
 through the Employment Administration. Businesses and enterprises with at least
 25 employees must hire qualified disabled workers if they apply and must pay them
 prevailing wages. Employers who do not adhere to these quotas, which are deter-
 mined by the size of the employer's work force, are subject to monthly fines equiva-
 lent to half of a disabled worker's monthly salary. There is no record of complaints
 of noncompliance.
 National legislation does not directly mandate accessibility for the disabled, but
 builders receive subsidies to construct "disabled friendly" structures. The Ministry
 aims to expand access to public buildings, priority parking, housing, and schools.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers have the right to associate freely, choose
 their own representatives, publicize their views, and determine their agenda. Ap-
 proximately 65 percent of the labor force is unionized. Membership is not manda-
 tory. Unions operate free of governmental interference. The two largest labor federa-
 tions are linked to, but organized independently of, the Christian Social and the So-
 cialist Parties. There are also several independent unions. Laws prohibiting dis-
 crimination against strikes and strike leaders are enforced by a labor tribunal.
 Except for government workers providing essential services, all workers have the
 right to strike. Essential workers include police, army personnel, and medical work-
 ers in duty hospitals and clinics. Those government workers who may strike must
 observe certain conditions, such as preliminary cooling-off periods. Workers rarely
 strike in Luxembourg; no strikes occurred in 1993.
 Unions maintain unrestricted contact with international bodies, including the Eu-
 ropean Trade Union Confederation and the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected by law and freely practiced throughout Luxembourg. Wages, benefits, and
 working conditions are set in negotiations between unions and employers. Busi-
 nesses having 15 or more employees must have worker representatives. Businesses
 with over 150 employees must form joint works councils composed of equal numbers
 of management and employee representatives. In businesses with more than 1,000
 employees, one-third of the membership of the supervisory boards of directors must
 be employees' representatives.
 Both Luxembourg law and practice promote union activity and protect union lead-
 ers and members from discrimination. Effective procedures exist and are used to ad-
 judicate employment-related complaints. Labor tribunals are authorized to adju-
 dicate employment-related complaints. A request for a hearing before the court must
 be made in writing. Parties to the dispute are summoned before the tribunal to give
 testimony. The tribunal's decision may be appealed by either party. The tribunal
 does not have the authority to require that employers found guilty of antiunion dis-
 crimination reinstate workers fired for union activities, but it can impose fines on
 such employers.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under the
 age of 15 is prohibited. Children are required by law to remain in school until they
 are 16 years old. Apprentices between 15 and 16 years of age must also attend
 school. Adolescent workers receive additional legal protection, including limits on
 overtime and the number of hours that can be worked continuously. The Ministries
 of Labor and of Education oversee strict enforcement of national child labor and
 education laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage legislation effective as of
 May 1993 provides for a minimum wage for workers at least 18 years of age with
 no dependents. The minimum wage for a single adult worker throughout Luxem-
 bourg is approximately $6.50 per hour (232.99 Luxembourg francs). Lower, tiered
 minimum wage rates apply to younger workers and students between 15 and 18
 years of age and increase yearly by age. Minimum wage rates apply to all sectors
 of the economy without exception. All wages and salaries are indexed to the general
 cost-of-living index.
 Supplements to the minimum wage are added for workers with dependents. None-
 theless, supporting a family in Luxembourg is difficult on the minimum wage. In
 practice, most employees receive more than the minimum wage.
 National legislation mandates a workweek of 40 hours. Premium pay is required
 for overtime or unusual hours. Employment on Sunday is prohibited except in con-
 tinuous-process industries (steel, glass, and chemicals) and for certain maintenance
 
 
 965
 and security personnel. All workers receive a minimum of 5 weeks of paid vacation
 yearly, in addition to paid holidays.
 Luxembourg enjoys very high health and safety standards. A safe working envi-
 ronment is mandated by law and strictly enforced through an inspection system
 that provides severe penalties for infractions. Inspections are carried out by the
 Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labor and by the Accident Insurance Agency
 of the Social Security Ministry.
 No laws or regulations specifically guarantee workers the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
 If workers believe that the workplace is unsafe, they have the right to ask the Labor
 Inspectorate to make a determination. Determinations of workplace safety are usu-
 ally made expeditiously.
