 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland, a country with long and respected democratic
 traditions and institutions, has over the years built an
 admirable record with regard to human rights.
 The Swiss Constitution fully guarantees all basic freedoms and
 provides for a federal structure of government which gives
 individual cantons a considerable degree of autonomy. Popular
 initiatives and referendums afford an effective instrument to
 the citizen, as well as the group, to pursue significant
 changes in policies through direct action. In spite of
 linguistic and religious diversity, Switzerland has built up a
 political system based on consensus in which all citizens have
 the right and the opportunity to express their opinions and
 yet work together toward comon objectives.
 Although under the Swiss federal system cantons are directly
 involved in many human rights matters, this involvement is
 controlled and limited by federal legislative and
 constitutional guarantees. All those who feel that their
 rights have been violated at the cantonal level can appeal for
 redress to the federal courts.
 Women are still subject to some legal disabilities, reflecting
 their traditionally subordinate role in Swiss society;
 however, recent years have seen steady progress toward
 political equality.
 Switzerland has traditionally provided facilities to many
 international organizations concerned with humanitarian
 affairs as well as extended support to refugees from around
 the world. Nine International Trade Secretariats are
 headquartered in Switzerland, as is the International Labor
 Organization.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No such occurrences have taken place in Switzerland.
 b. Disappearance.
 There have been no reports of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 The Constitution provides freedom from all of the above, and
 there have been no allegations of any violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile.
 Swiss criminal law does not provide for habeas corpus.
 However, freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile is
 guaranteed by law. A detained person may not be held longer
 than 24 hours without a warrant of arrest issued by the judge
 conducting the preliminary investigation. Once the warrant is
 issued, the individual may be detained as long as necessary
 until the investigation is completed. However, the length of

 SWITZERLAND
 investigative detention is always reviewed by higher judicial
 authority and, traditionally, investigations are completed
 within a very brief period. A suspect must immediately be
 shown the warrant under which he or she is being held, and he
 or she has a right to contact legal counsel as soon as an
 arrest warrant is issued. Bail, or release on personal
 recognizance, is traditionally granted, unless the examining
 magistrate believes the individual is a danger to society or
 will not appear for trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Swiss Constitution guarantees public trials. Minor cases
 are tried by a single judge; difficult cases by a panel of
 judges; and murder or other serious crimes by a public jury.
 According to longstanding tradition, even the most serious
 cases are usually brought to trial within several weeks or, at
 the most, a few months.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 There have been no allegations of violations in this area by
 Swiss authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are no restrictions on freedom of speech and press in
 Switzerland except in cases involving groups or associations
 considered a potential threat to the state. However, no
 groups or associations are so designated at the present time.
 A peripheral issue involves the linguistic minorities,
 specitically the Italian and Romansch linguistic groups.
 Occasionally, these groups have expressed fear that the
 limited resources made available to them by the Government
 endanger the continued intellectual vitality of these
 languages and amount to a deprivation of freedom of speech.
 The Government is fully aware of these concerns and has taken
 steps to meet them.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 The only restriction Switzerland places on peaceful assembly
 and association is the requirement to obtain permits from
 police authorities before holding public meetings. These
 permits are rarely refused except in cases where the
 authorities have reason to believe that the meeting will lead
 to violence. Occasionally, demonstrations, mostly involving
 youth, have become violent, and there have been complaints of
 police overreaction. In the rare instances when this has
 happened, public opinion and the media have strongly reacted
 to abuses of authority and asked that steps be taken to avoid
 repetition of similar incidents.
 Labor unions enjoy full freedom to organize, strike, and
 influence political decisions. Swiss labor relations have
 been characterized by industrial peace, and strikes and other
 labor unrest are practically unknown.

 C. Freedom of Religion
 Switzerland enjoys religious freedom. One area which over the
 years has caused difficulties, however, is the issue of
 universal military service by Swiss men. Swiss law provides
 no exemption for conscientious objectors, who are nearly
 always convicted for their refusal to serve. Efforts have
 been made to modify the Swiss Constitution in order to provide
 alternative service for those who wish to claim exemption for
 reasons of conscience. These efforts, so far unsuccessful,
 continue.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Swiss citizens have freedom to travel in or outside the
 country and can emigrate without difficulty. Switzerland has
 traditionally been a haven for refugees from many countries.
 Currently there are about 32,000 refugees in Switzerland, the
 vast majority from Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia. In
 recent years the traditional welcome to refugees has been
 somewhat tempered by concern over growing unemployment, which
 in some circles was blamed on the influx of these refugees.
 In 1984 the swelling numbers of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka
 led the Government to reiterate that applicants failing to
 meet the criteria for political asylum must subsequently
 depart Switzerland. Overall, however, the Swiss people remain
 prepared to provide shelter and assistance to refugees as
 reflected in federal and cantonal governments' actions.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Switzerland is a highly developed, constitutional democracy.
 Federal legislative power is vested in a bicameral legislature
 elected by universal suffrage every 4 years. Since 1971 Swiss
 women have been enfranchised in all federal elections and have
 held seats in the Federal Parliament. One of the 26 Swiss
 cantons still excludes female suffrage at the cantonal and
 local levels.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests during 1984 for outside
 investigations of the human rights situation. Switzerland
 cooperates with international and non-governmental groups in
 all areas of human rights, and Swiss nationals play a
 prominent role in the International Committee of the Red Cross
 and other humanitarian non-governmental organizations. In its
 1984 report, Amnesty International continued to express
 concern over the imprisonment of conscientious objectors.
 Freedom House rates Switzerland "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Swiss per capita gross national product of $17,000 (1982)
 is the highest in the industrialized world. Unemployment,
 which until 1982 was practically non-existent, hovers around
 1 percent and remains a cause of concern. Health services are
 available and good. The infant mortality rate stands at 7.2
 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy at birth is 77.8
 years (1984). Education is of high quality and free through
 
 
 1102
 SWITZERLAND
 university level. Access to universities, however, is closely
 controlled through tough entrance examinations. A recurrent
 complaint of the Italian-speaking minority is the lack of an
 Italian-language university in Switzerland. The adult
 literacy rate is 99 percent.
 within a total population of nearly 6.5 million, about 18
 percent is made up of foreign workers and their families. The
 Government has taken steps in recent years to limit the number
 of foreign workers coming into Switzerland or obtaining
 residence permits. Real estate acquisition by foreigners is
 strictly controlled, and its expansion has at times been the
 object of concern. The Swiss Government and cantonal
 authorities have also started to look into the need to
 integrate foreign workers and their families into Swiss social
 services programs. In times of economic difficulties and
 unemployment, Swiss nationals in some areas of the country
 resent any additional facilities provided to foreign workers.
 Women's limited involvement in the Swiss political and
 business worlds is expanding slowly. The 25 women elected to
 the Federal Parliament in 1983 represent 10 percent of that
 body, while women constitute 51 percent of the population. On
 October 2, 1984, a woman was for the first time elected to the
 7-member Federal Council, the nation's governing executive
 body. The vast majority of Swiss of both sexes welcomed this
 "breakthrough.' On the other hand, Swiss women are still paid
 less than men for equal work and remain underrepresented in
 senior positions in industry, banking, and government.
 The Federal Government has been careful in the apportionment
 of funds in order to ensure that all linguistic groups have
 commensurate facilities and means to carry out cultural
 activities in their own language.
