 GABON
 President Omar Bongo has ruled Gabon since 1967. He has been
 reelected three times in uncontested elections, most recently
 in November 1986 as head of the Democratic Party of Gabon
 (PDG), which was then the sole legal political party.
 Responding to internal pressures, he took a number of
 significant steps in 1990 to implement a multiparty system.
 Following a sequence of demonstrations and strikes in the
 first 3 months of 1990, he permitted a process of political
 liberalization to begin in March/April with the convocation of
 a national convention in Libreville. Seventy-four political
 associations participated, along with the ruling PDG, in a
 debate on Gabon's political future. In response to the
 recommendations prepared by convention delegates, the
 President appointed in April an interim cabinet of 29
 members--including 6 from opposition groups--to oversee the
 transition from a single-party to a multiparty system. In
 October elections were held for a new multiparty legislature
 which resulted in the PDG winning 59 seats out of 120. The
 National Assembly has not had real power in the past, but the
 newly elected Assembly has exhibited a degree of independence
 by confronting and criticizing the Government. In response ta
 a recommendation from the national convention, President Bongo
 announced that presidential elections will not be held until
 1993, when his current 7-year term expires.
 The armed forces are comprised of approximately 4,000 army,
 navy, and air force personnel. Internal security is shared by
 the Gendarmerie, a paramilitary force of 2,700, and the
 National Police, consisting of 2,000 troops, which works with
 the Gendarmerie to maintain law and order in Libreville, Port
 Gentil, and other provincial capitals. The security forces
 use beatings as part of the interrogation process.
 Gabon's relatively high per capita income ($3,200 in 1990) is
 based largely on oil revenues, but it belies the
 underdeveloped nature of the country and its economy.
 Although endowed with petroleum, manganese, uranium, and vast
 timber resources, Gabon has experienced limited agricultural
 and industrial development and must import most of its food
 and manufactured goods. Rain forest covers 85 percent of the
 country, and approximately two-thirds of the populace live in
 rural areas. Due to the precipitous fall in revenue from oil
 exports in the late 1980's, the Government has imposed
 austerity measures to meet World Bank and International
 Monetary Fund program criteria. A massive onshore oil field
 discovered in southern Gabon should boost petroleum output by
 50 percent by 1991.
 Despite important steps toward a more open political system,
 human-rights abuses continued in 1990. Principal problems
 included mistreatment of prisoners and detainees and lack of
 procedural safeguards in State Security Court trials. With
 the move toward a multiparty political system, restrictions on
 freedoms of speech, press, and assembly were considerably
 relaxed. Gabon now enjoys a lively and critical print media
 with some half dozen weekly newspapers in addition to the
 government-sponsored newspaper, L'Union. During legislative
 electoral campaigns in September/October, L'Union and the
 government-controlled television and radio provided in-depth
 coverage, including activities of opposition groups. However,
 the firing of the L'Union managing editor in late September,
 allegedly for grad. ng too much access to the opposition, had
 a chilling effect.'%i the paper's staff for a short time.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political killings or summary executions
 in 1990. The death of Joseph Rendjambe in a Libreville Hotel
 in May was alleged by his political followers to have been
 engineered by the Government, but pathological and
 toxicological analyses conducted by a respected French medical
 institution reportedly did not identify any unnatural cause
 for Rendjambe's death. Two persons arrested in conjunction
 with a foiled assassination/coup plot in late 1989
 subsequently died while in custody. According to the
 Government, one died from malaria and the other from a
 combination of diabetes and hypertension. No independent
 medical confirmation of the causes of death was made available.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of abductions or disappearances
 ascribed to government security forces or any other group.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Gabonese law and security enforcement officials use beatings
 as part of the interrogation process of detainees, including
 illegal aliens from neighboring countries. Security personnel
 are rarely punished for human rights abuses.  No specific
 incidents were reported in 1990.
 Prison conditions are harsh, and the main prison, Central
 Prison, has poor hygiene, inadequate medical facilities, and
 insufficient food.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although the law, based on French jurisprudence, provides
 procedural protections against arbitrary detention, it allows
 for pretrial detention, which can be for a prolonged period.
 Security forces-have been known to disregard the procedures
 concerning arbitrary detention, particularly in security
 cases, by detaining persons indefinitely without charge. The
 only known political detainees or prisoners held during 1990
 were 14 persons arrested following revelations of two alleged
 coup plots in October 1989. Pending completion of the
 investigation, the 14 were held without access to their
 families, though they did have access to legal representation
 in the immediate pretrial phase.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control nor as a
 sentence for convicted criminals. A number of opposition
 figures such as Pere Mba Abessole, leader of the Morena
 Bucheron party, have returned in recent years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system, modeled on the French, has several
 levels. The trial court (Tribunal de Premier Instance) hears
 questions of fact and law in civil, commercial, ordinary
 criminal, and administrative cases. The appellate level is
 divided into two courts, with a separate appeals court for
 
 
 129
 GABON
 criminal cases. The highest level, the Supreme Court, has
 four chambers. Outside the normal court system, there is a
 military tribunal to handle all offenses under military law, a
 State Security Court, which is a civilian tribunal, and a
 special criminal court which deals with fraud and embezzlement
 of public funds by officials.
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for in the
 Constitution and generally has been respected iii criminal
 cases, but important procedural safeguards are lacking in
 State Security Court trials. State Security Court trials are
 open to the public, and defendants are represented by counsel,
 with the right to appeal to the Supreme Court or, if turned
 down by the Supreme Court, to the President. However, court
 officials are appointed by the President, who can also
 transfer and dismiss them by decree.
 Although the judiciary is susceptible to intervention by the
 executive, particularly in political or security cases, there
 was no indication that such intervention occurred in 1990.
 The Government gave no explanation regarding the delay in
 bringing to trial the 14 arrested for the 1989 coup attempt.
 The 14 were tried in two groups in November and December in
 the State Security Court. The trials were open to the press
 and public, and were covered extensively by the government
 controlled media, including partial trial transcripts in the
 newspaper and lengthy television reports. In both trials the
 two principal defendants were sentenced to 8,and 6 years
 respectively; the others were acquitted. Twenty-four others
 who had been arrested in connection-with the coup were
 released in 1990 after appearing before the State Security
 Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search warrants may be obtained after the fact but, as
 occasionally happens in cases of suspected illegal aliens,
 sometimes they are not obtained at all. There were credible
 reports that in many-cases the homes of those detained were
 ransacked by security forces who confiscated personal
 effects. The Government periodically monitors
 communications. Membership in Gabon's former single political
 party, the PDG, is not mandatory, but it has enhanced
 opportunities for political and career.advancement.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With the move toward a multiparty system, freedom of speech
 and press have been significantly enhanced. While direct
 public criticism of the President previously had not been
 permitted, during the national convention and the legislative-
 election campaign Gabonese opposition leaders criticized the
 President directly and indirectly, with no known retribution.
 Although public media-radio, television, and the daily
 newspaper L'Union--are controlled by the Ministry of -
 Information and disseminate government views and communiques,
 there was widespread coverage of opposition campaigns and
 candidates throughout the electoral period. This coverage
 included frequent and pointed criticism of the Government as
 well as the ruling PDG party.
 
 
 130
 GABON
 In addition, lively opposition print media now exist, with
 some half-dozen weekly newspapers available in the capital.
 The established media carry wire service material (mostly
 Agence France Presse) which gives the public some coverage of
 world events. The President has encouraged journalists to
 point out failures of individual government officials or
 ministries and td highlight inefficiency and corruption.
 There was one instance in 1990 when an issue of the
 Paris-based magazine Jeune Afrique was banned because of an
 article concerning Rendjambe's death.
 Academic freedom is relatively unrestricted. In 1990
 university students engaged in protests against the
 administretion's financial mismanagement that has resulted in
 a lack of funds for scholarships and the deteriorating
 physical plant at the university campus in Libreville.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government limits freedom of assembly and association to
 recognized organizations--including 74 recognized opposition
 political associations. Permits and notification of police
 are required for all outdoor meetings. The Government
 generally permits such meetings only if they are organized by
 recognized political groups (and their ancillary units such as
 the women's, youth, and labor movements), cultural and
 entertainment impresarios, or recognized church groups. By
 law, demonstrations are not permitted, but there were numerous
 demonstrations in the first half of 1990 for which organizers
 and participants went unpunished.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion, and the Constitution provides for
 religious freedom. Because their activities were considered
 by the Government as fostering disunity, Jehovah's Witnesses
 and several small syncretistic sects were banned by
 Presidential decree in 1970. The decree was.renewed in 1985.
 As recently as 1987, the courts sentenced 24 Jehovah's
 Witnesses to short or suspended terms for belonging to a
 banned organization. The primary faiths are Catholic and
 Protestant. There are a few Muslims (including President
 Bongo) and numerous adherents to traditional religions.
 Foreign missionaries, including Americans, engage actively in
 evangelical and social-service activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement of both Gabonese citizens and expatriates within the
 country is not formally restricted; travelers occasionally
 encounter Gendarmerie control points where identity cards and
 other documents are examined. Following May riots in Port
 Gentil and Libreville set off by the death of Joseph Rendjambe
 (see Section l.a.), a 2-month curfew was imposed, first
 nationwide and then for the Ogooue-Maritime province where
 Port Gentil is located. Gabonese citizens may return freely
 to Gabon from abroad. The previous requirement that Gabonese
 citizens must obtain exit permits from the police was
 rescinded in June, but government employees must obtain
 permission to travel abroad.
 There are approximately 200,000 non-Gabonese resident in
 Gabon, many of whom are from Equatorial Guinea or Cameroon.
 Immigration laws and Presidential decrees promulgated in 1986
 
 
 131"
 
 GABON
 imposed requirements for heavy financial-guarantee on
 non-French and non-American expatriates working in Gabon and
 levied exit visa fees for each departure from the country.
 The Gendarmerie periodically detains undocumented aliens who
 are then placed in a holding camp under harsh conditions.
 Most of the detainees are released after paying fines or
 bribes.
 The Government encourages, but does not force, "regroupment"--
 the voluntary consolidation of small rural communities into
 larger villages along a road-by enhancing the delivery of
 public services such as water, electricity, and schooling in
 the larger villages.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 At the end of 1990, the right of citizens to change their
 Government was still limited, but important reforms were
 undertaken which, if fully implemented, will enable citizens
 of Gabon to exercise this right. The revised constitution,
 parts of which were discussed in a Government communique, will
 be addressed by the National Assembly in its spring 1991
 session; it calls for a fully functioning democratic system.
 Although the Democratic Party of Gabon (PDG) remains the
 principal political party of Gabon, there are now 74
 recognized opposition political associations, 37 of which
 chose to participate in the September/October legislative
 elections for Gabon's 120 National Assembly seats. President
 Bongo granted to each of the 75 recognized political groups
 $75,000 to finance legislative electoral campaigns. Election
 results for 62 seats were annulled in September due to voting
 irregularities. In late December, the Supreme Court annulled
 another 5 seats, leaving in question the ultimate makeup of
 the Assembly which was then in session. Some opposition
 candidates alleged ballot box stuffing, and their supporters
 smashed boxes. Most observers agreed that irregularities were
 due to disorganization. After the second round of elections
 in October, the PDG won a total of 59 seats and received the
 support of 3 independent candidates which gave it a
 parliamentary majority. The remaining 58 seats were split
 among 7 opposition parties.
 President Bongo has been reelected three times in uncontested
 elections, most recently in November 1986. While a 1983
 constitutional amendment provided that only the
 President-Founder of the PDG party (President Bongo) could be
 a candidate for President, an amendment to the transitional
 Constitution promulgated in April 1990 provides for open
 candidacy. A new, "definitive" constitution, to be debated in
 the National Assembly in early 1991, provides for a limit of
 two 5-year presidential terms.
 Presidential elections are held during the 7th year of the
 President's term. President Bongo has stated that the next
 Presidential election will be held in 1993, when his current
 term expires in conformity with the Constitution. National
 Assembly members are elected for 5 years. The Council of
 Ministers, which meets under the chairmanship of the President
 or the Prime Minister, approves most government decisions
 proposed by the President. The 36-member Cabinet appointed in
 November includes four opposition ministers and
 representatives of major ethnic groups from all regions.
 
 
 GABON
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights groups, although
 representatives of international groups occasionally visit
 Gabon. In 1989 the Government invited representatives of
 Amnesty International and other human rights organizations to
 visit Gabon to ensure that the alleged assassination/coup
 plotters arrested in August of that year received proper
 treatment and a fair trial, but that trial had not been held
 by the end of 1990 (see Section l.e.). The Cabinet appointed
 in November includes a Minister for Human Rights and Relations
 with the.Legislature.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Gabon's relative prosperity has enabled the Government to
 extend health and social security benefits to all its people,
 regardless of tribal affiliation or region. There were no
 significant ethnic, racial, religious, or social groups that
 suffered discrimination in 1990. Urban women are moving
 increasingly into the professions due to improved educational
 opportunities, including in technical training institutions in
 urban areas. Government and party policies are supportive.
 In rural Gabon women still fill largely traditional roles
 built around family and village, e.g., hauling water, tending
 fields. The gradual introduction of piped-in water and of
 electricity has had the effect of improving living standards
 for rural women.
 According to medical practitioners, violence against women,
 including wife beating, occurs but the extent of the problem
 is not known. Incidents of violence against women are
 reported in the media from time to time and invariably are the
 outgrowth of domestic disputes or are related to violence
 against prostitutes. Cases of violence against women rarely
 come before the courts. Neither the Government nor women's
 groups have directly addressed this issue.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the existing Constitution, workers are not free to form
 and join unions of their own choosing. Workers may only
 organize unions under affiliation with the government-
 sponsored Labor Confederation of Gabon (COSYGA). Under the
 reforms adopted in the first half of 1990, all ties between
 COSYGA and the former single party have been formally
 severed. The future of COSYGA remains uncertain. The future
 constitution reportedly provides for freedom of association
 but its position on the role of an umbrella labor federation
 is unknown at this time. It is estimated that over half of
 Gabon's 90,000 salaried private sector workers are unionized.
 Government employees are not permitted to belong to unions.
 Under Gabonese law, the right to strike continues to be
 severely restricted; strikes are illegal if they occur before
 remedies prescribed under the Labor Code (1978) have been
 exhausted. In February and April, demonstrators from several
 public sector organizations, e.g., Air Gabon, the electric
 utility, the national railway, gathered outside the
 Presidential palace at various times to protest working
 
 
 133
 GABON
 conditions, taxes, and low public sector salaries. President
 Bongo met with labor delegations to discuss their grievances,
 and ultimately resolved outstanding issues through a
 combination of tax recisions and pay increases. Utilities
 workers and public sector employees in Gabon's economic
 capital of Port Gentil staged work stoppages in 1990 to
 protest government-ordered cuts in salaries and personnel at
 the state-owned utilities company.
 COSYGA is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and maintains ties with the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) and the American Federation of Labor and
 Congress of Industrial Organizations and other national trade
 union centers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions in each sector negotiate with management over specific
 pay scales, working conditions, and benefits applicable to
 their industry. Representatives of labor, management, and
 government meet annually to agree on the minimum wage, which
 is determined within guidelines provided by the Government.
 Agreements reached between labor and management in each sector
 also apply to nonunion and expatriate labor. According to the
 Labor Code, workers may individually or collectively take
 complaints of code violations to arbitration and may appeal to
 labor and national courts. These provisions are respected in
 practice. However, the 1989 report of the ILO Committee of
 Experts (COE) recommends that existing legislation be revised
 to expand protection against antiunion discrimination and to
 provide protection, including penal sanctions, for workers'
 organizations against employer interference. There are no
 export processing zones in Gabon.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law, and is not practiced,
 although technical violations of the conventions on forced
 labor have been criticized by the ILO.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 No minor below the age of 16 may work without the
 authorization of the Ministries of Labor, Public Health, and
 Education, which enforce this provision. It is granted
 rarely, and few employees in the modern wage sector are below
 the age of 18. Children at younger ages are involved in
 traditional family farm labor in rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The (1978) Labor Code and the (1982) General Convention of
 Labor govern working conditions and benefits for all sectors.
 Labor legislation provides broad protection to workers. The
 minimum wage for unskilled labor since April 1985 has been
 about $250 per month for Gabonese and about $192 for
 foreigners. Owing to labor shortages, most salaries are much
 higher. These wages provide a decent living for workers and
 their families. Work over 40 hours per week must be
 compensated with overtime, and the workweek must include a
 minimum rest period of 48 consecutive hours. Women have a
 right to 14 weeks of leave during pregnancy, including 6 weeks
 before delivery.
 
 
 134
 GABON
 The Labor Code provides for occupational health and safety
 standards to be established by decree of the Minister of
 Health. Adherence to these standards, which are generally
 adopted from the French model, varies greatly and usually
 reflects company policy rather than governmental enforcement
 efforts. There are a range of employment opportunities for
 Gabonese wishing to enter the wage economy, although it has
 been declining as the economy reacts to the fall in world oil
 prices in the late 1980's.
