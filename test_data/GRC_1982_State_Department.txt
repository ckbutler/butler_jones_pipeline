 GREECE
 Greece is a republic with a democratically elected parliament.
 A full member of the European Economic Community, Greece is
 classified according to United Nations standards as a developed
 country. Its economic system is a traditional free market
 economy.
 The full range of universally acknowledged human rights is
 protected by the 1975 Constitution, which reflects the spirit
 and includes many of the provisions of the United Nations'
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Parliamentary elections
 were held most recently in October 1981 and were vigorously and
 freely contested. The judiciary is independent of both the
 .executive branch of government and parliament, and operates
 within a civil law framework with precedents from Roman law and
 French and German sources. An active and unfettered press
 functions throughout the country. Economic and social rights
 -in Greece are guaranteed by the Constitution and are fully
 observed by the Government. Thus, through a combination of
 constitutional guarantees and administrative practices, the
 Greek Government has demonstrated its commitment to the
 observance of human rights.
 Legislation was passed in 1982 which extended existing human
 rights in the areas of labor law, family and marriage law, and
 political participation (voting age and local self government).
 Both short-term and long-term trends for human rights in Greece
 are favorable.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no cases of politically-motivated killings in
 Greece in 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested or held in
 clandestine detention either by legal authorities or others.
 c. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by the Constitution.
 Torture and bodily maltreatment, impairment of health, or the
 use of psychological violence, as well as any other offense
 against human dignity, are prohibited and punished as provided
 by law. These provisions are respected in practice.
 d. Cruel,. Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or
 -punishment is also guaranteed by the Constitution, and has been
 reepected in practice during 1982. Summary executions do not
 take place, and physical punishments are not administered as
 saentences for-crimes. Conditions in prison and detention
 .faciliti-es-ere satisfactory. Adequate health care and diet are
 -provided.- There is no distinction in treatment among prisoners
 of different social class, race, sex, religion, or type of
 conviction. Cases requiring medical treatment receive special
 attention. -Once sentenced, prisoners may be visited by family
 members three times per week.

 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the Constitution, which states "no person shall be arrested or
 imprisoned without a reasoned judicial warrant which must be
 served at the moment of arrest or detention pending trial,
 except when caught committing a criminal act." This provision
 is respected in practice. Preventive detention does not exist
 in Greece. A person arrested on warrant or while committing a
 crime must be brought before an examining magistrate within 24
 hours, at which time he is charged. This magistrate must issue
 a warrant of imprisonment or order the release of the detainee
 within three days of the examination, unless special
 circumstances warrant a two-day extension of this time limit.
 The Constitution further states that the maximum duration of
 detention pending trial "may not exceed a period of one year in
 the case of felonies or six months in the case of
 misdemeanors." A decision of a judicial council is required to
 effect extensions of these maximum durations (by six or three
 months, respectively) in exceptional cases. In practice,
 despite crowded court calendars, trials generally take place
 within four months of the submission of charges.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and the
 military. Fair and public trials are guaranteed by the
 Constitution and respected in practice, and defense lawyers are
 always available. Mandatory public court sessions are provided
 for, except for a few special exceptions involving juveniles or
 those charged with morals offenses, when the privacy of the
 victim requires protection. There is also a legal provision
 for the possible closed hearing treatment of a sensitive
 portion of cases dealing with public order. In such instances,
 none of which are known to have occurred during the past year,
 the court by law must publicly pronounce its "reasoned
 decision" on the matters heard privately. A defendant may
 appeal a court verdict to an appeals court. The Constitution
 stipulates that military courts shall have no jurisdiction over
 civilians.               .
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home as well as of an individual's
 personal and family life are guaranteed by the Constitution,
 which states "every person's home is a sanctuary." The
 personal and family life of the individual is inviolable. No
 house search may be made except when and as specified by law
 and always in the presence of representatives of the judicial
 power. These constitutional guarantees are respected in
 practice. Warrants, issued by a district attorney, who is
 considered a judicial officer in Greece, are required for an
 official to enter a private home. No cases are known in which
 forced entry has been alleged or in which the Government has
 practiced other violations of the home.  A constitutional
 provision requires punishment and "liability to full damages to
 the sufferer" for violations of the sanctuary of the home and
 for the abuse of power.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 
 
 918
 Freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution, which
 states that every person may express and propagate his thoughts
 orally, in writing, and through the press, with due regard to
 the laws of the state.
 Freedom of the press is guaranteed by the Constitution which
 states "The press is free. Censorship and all other preventive
 measures are prohibited." Opposition viewpoints are constantly
 ventilated in the active Greek press, and criticism of the
 government is tolerated. Radio and television are government
 owned, but opposition viewpoints are aired. The Constitution
 allows for the seizure, by order of the public prosecutor, of
 publications which insult the president, offend religious
 beliefs, contain obscene articles, advocate a violent overthrow
 of the political system, or disclose military and defense
 information. No periodicals or newspapers were seized in
 1982. Greece has strict libel laws. Violations of these laws
 are prosecuted under established legal procedures with the
 safeguards of due process.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the Constitution, which
 states "Greeks shall have the right to assemble peaceably and
 unarmed." Limits on outdoor public meetings do exist, however,
 if it is determined by police authorities that a serious
 disturbance of social and economic life is threatened. In 1982
 no public assemblies were prohibited. Police on occasion
 restrict areas where demonstrators can gather, if such
 gatherings in their view pose a clear and present danger to
 public safety and order.
 Labor rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and are
 respected in practice. The right to bargain collectively and
 the right to strike are exercised freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The prevailing religion is Eastern Orthodox. There are several
 small minorities including Muslims, Jews, and non-Orthodox
 Christians. The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion
 and prohibits discriminatory practices against religious
 minorities. This provision is respected in practice. Minority
 groups have participated in the increasing prosperity of Greece
 and enjoy full political rights. The Greek Government is
 committed to observing the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne
 relating to the education and political rights of the Muslim
 minority. Currently there are two Muslim members of
 Parliament. There are occasional complaints by members of
 minority groups about alleged bureaucratic delays on such
 matters as driving licenses and land transfers, although these
 difficulties appear to reflect low-level discrimination rather
 than aisystematic Government effort to harass the Muslim
 minority. In 1982 members of the Muslim minority in Western
 Thrace protested against a lower court decision upholding
 government notices of expulsion from their land in the village
 of Evlalos. The Government claimed that the farmers involved
 had no legal title to the land, and that it belonged to the
 Government. The Muslims claimed that there was no legal basis
 for the Government action, and that the intended use of the
 land is the resettlement of Greeks in an historically Muslim
 area. In April 1982 an Appeals Court judge stayed the lower
 court decision. Pending further decision of the Appeals Court,
 the Muslim families have continued to occupy and use the
 disputed land.
 
 
 919
 During the emotional reaction to the Israeli military
 intervention in Lebanon, members of Greece's small Jewish
 minority complained of growing anti-Semitism, including in
 particular the interchangeable use of the words "Jewish" and
 "Israeli" by the press and government-owned mass media. The
 Government responded by recalling Greece's historic record of
 protecting its Jewish community and by disclaiming that its
 policy of opposition to Israel's actions was in any way
 directed against Greek Jews.
 Greece's small community of Jehovah's Witnesses was affected by
 the provision in the Constitution which states that "No person
 shall be exempt from discharging his obligations to the State
 or may refuse to comply with laws by reason of his religious
 convictions." In deference to the Jehovah's Witnesses, in 1977
 the Government modified the compulsory military service law to
 provide for alternative, noncombat service. While courts of
 first instance have, on occasion, hended down lengthy sentences
 to conscientious objectors who refuse military or alternative
 service altogether, prison terms are sharply reduced in the
 appellate process. Under the law, prison sentences can be
 worked off so that, in practice, a conscientious objector does
 not serve a sentence longer than his period of military
 obligation and could serve a shorter period.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel and emigration. This right is
 respected in practice. Intending emigrants and those returning
 experience no discrimination. Refugees are not forced to
 return to homelands from which they fled.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Greece is a multi-party democracy in which all citizens enjoy
 full political rights, without regard to race, sex, religion,.
 or political persuasion. All opposition parties function
 freely, have access to the media, and hold public meetings.
 Women have the same political rights as men and participate
 fully in the Greek society. At present there are 13 women in
 the 300 member Parliament, and one Minister and two Deputy
 Ministers in the Cabinet.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 - Human Rights
 The Greek Government has not objected to visits and
 investigations by human rights organizations. Amnesty
 International has a chapter in Greece.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Greece's per capita gross national product has grown rapidly
 during the 1970's and reached $4,522 in 1980 according to World
 Bank data and $4,348 according to OECD data. Although still
 high, Greece's per capita GNP is probably well below that
 figure today, because the 1980 data was based on a different
 exchange rate. Moreover, in 1981 and 1982 there was no real
 growth in GNP. The rate of inflation was about 25 percent in
 1980 and 1981, and the Government has increasingly resorted to
 price controls in 1982 to deal with this problem. The
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 59
 
 
 920
 Government also regulates heavily the credit markets. Real
 interest rates for savers are negative and often 10 percent
 below the rate of inflation. Import and exchange controls are
 becoming an increasingly more common feature of economic life.
 Despite these problems, living standards are relatively high,
 as reflected in social data on Greece. Greeks are well-fed;
 the ratio of calorie supply relative to nutritional
 requirements is 136 percent. Life expectancy at birth is about
 74 years, and the adult literacy rate is 90 percent for the
 total population, but almost 100 percent for adults below 55
 years. Moreover, 100 percent of the population has access to
 safe water, and primary school enrollment exceeds 100 percent
 (i.e., some children older or younger than the normal ages are
 in primary school). However, the infant mortality rate is 18.7
 per 1,000, which is relatively high, and the quality of medical
 care, particularly outside the three major cities, is not
 adequate.
