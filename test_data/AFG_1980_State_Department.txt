 AFGHANISTAN
 Afghanistan, a poor and underdeveloped nation, has been torn
 by dissension and civil unrest since the April 1978 coup
 which overthrew President Daoud. In 1980, however, it
 suffered massive violations of it! sovereignty and of the
 human rights of its citizens. In late December, 1979, the
 Soviet army entered Afghanistan in force and overthrew
 President Hafizullah Amin. In his place, the Soviets
 installed a regime headed by Babrak Karmal, who had followed
 the Soviet army into Afghanistan from his previous exile in
 Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
 Today Afghanistan is a country torn by warfare. Some 85,000
 Soviet troops and remnants of the Afghan army fight against
 spontaneous and nationwide resistance. The Afghan national-
 ists arrayed against them represent many different ethnic
 groups and beliefs. Afghan society as a whole remains highly
 conservative, Islamic, and traditional. The Babrak regime's
 base of support is limited to the Parchamist faction of the
 small People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. It survives
 only under the protection of the,Soviet occupiers.
 In an effort to gain some popular support for his regime,
 Babrak has shelved many economic and social programs which
 previous leaders Amin and Taraki had tried to institute and
 which had caused, at least partially, resistance and civil
 unrest beginning soon after the Marxist coup in April 1978.
 Bahrak also cultivates Muslim religious leaders and portrays
 himself and his government as moderate and pro-Islamic. The
 continuing resistance of nationalist fighters all over
 Afghanistan, the continuing disintegration of the Afghan
 military and civil service, and the flight into Pakistan
 of tens of thousands of Afghan refugees every month demonstrate
 the relationship between rulers and rule in Afghanistan.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture in prisons continues to be widely employed by Afghan
 authorities; evidence is furnished by surviving victims and
 other eyewitnesses. There are credible reports that Soviet
 advisors have been present during interrogation of prisoners
 where torture is alleged to have occurred. Other maltreat-
 ment is widespread, including beatings and sexual violations
 as well as incarcerations in jam-packed cells without heat,
 sanitary facilities or adequate fo6d.
 In the military conflict, torture appears to be used by all
 parties. Prisoners rarely are left alive on either side but
 frequently are subjected to torture and mutilation before
 being killed. Although confirmation is lacking, there are
 credible reports of villagers being tortured and killed by
 Soviet or joint Soviet/Afghan military units, either as
 examples to other villagers not to harbor or help the
 nationalists, or to extract information.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Summary execution of political prisoners continues under the
 Babrak regime, although much less frequently than under the
 Taraki and Amin governments. During these previous regimes,
 as many as 15,000 political prisoners were reported incar-
 cerated in Kabul's Pol-i-Charki prison at one time, and
 executions numbered in the thousands.
 Current estimates from reliable sources, including released
 foreign prisoners, puts the number of political prisoners
 somewhere between 3,000 and 9,000. Because of the regime's
 difficulty in controlling provincial centers, most of these
 political prisoners have been transferred to Pol-i-Charki
 prison. There, the guards include Soviet troops. In addi-
 tion to Afghan common criminals and political prisoners,
 some foreign prisoners and Soviet military also are incar-
 cerated in Pol-i-Charki.
 The frequency and level of atrocities connected with the
 fighting which continues throughout the country appear to
 have increased through 1980. Just after its invasion, the
 Soviet army, which bears the brunt of the fighting on behalf
 of the Babrak regime, appeared to be trying to avoid harm to
 non-combatant civilian targets. By late spring, however, a
 deliberate change in tactics seems to have occurred. Villages
 suspected of harboring insurgents, or those located close to
 the scene of a guerrilla action, regularly are attacked;
 civilians are killed summarily; village crops are destroyed.
 Acts of brutality, including looting and rape, are widespread.
 Refugees report that the Soviets regularly have used non-
 lethal chemical agents, including riot control agents and
 incapacitants, as well as incendiary devices against nation-
 alists and civilian populations. These reports are wide-
 spread and, in some cases, documented. In addition there
 have been reports, so far unsubstantiated, of the use of
 lethal chemical agents. The United Nations passed a resolu-
 tion in December 1980 calling for an impartial international
 investigation into the use of chemical weapons.
 The Soviets now employ small colored plastic landmines design-
 ed to maim. Beginning in late spring 1980, these were air-
 dropped by Soviet and Afghan pilots on the mountain passes
 bordering Pakistan. The mines, designed to inhibit movement,
 especially at night, have been found in areas some distance
 from the borders, in fields and cultivated areas as well as
 around wells and other village centers. The shapes and
 colors of the mines seem to appeal to children, and the
 number of young refugee victims in Pakistani hospitals for
 amputations rose dramatically in the last half of 1980.
 c. Disappearances
 Disappearance of citizens from their homes or from the streets
 continues under the current regime as it has in the past.
 When a citizen is arrested, he is frequently not heard from
 for months or longer, if ever. In addition to the disappearance
 of nationalists engaged in armed resistance to the current
 regime, people are presumed to disappear for political,
 economic, and religious reasons. Several cabinet ministers
 from the Amin government, businessmen and religious leaders
 are missing and widely believed either dead or in Pol-i-Charki
 prison.
 
 
 931
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment have long been common and
 continue today. In mid-January 1980, the new Babrak regime
 claimed to have released 10,000 political prisoners from
 Pol-i-Charki. The number actually released was far smaller
 and included common criminals. Arbitrary imprisonment or
 its threat continues to be employed by the current regime.
 The Afghan army continues to deteriorate and the army today
 numbers considerably less than half its original 1978
 .strength of about 100,000. As soldiers defect to the
 nationalist side or simply desert, the Kabul regime is using
 impressment to obtain replacements. The practice of dragoon-
 ing men and boys to serve in the Afghan army is now common;
 there are eyewitness reports that boys as young as 14 have
 been picked up in this manner. While house-to-house searches
 are perhaps the most common manner of getting new soldiers,
 men and boys also are taken to the army from roadblocks.
 Student demonstrations in Kabul in late April and early May,
 in many cases led by school girls, resulted in an estimated
 1000 arrests.  (The regime admitted that it had arrested over
 600 students, of whom about 100 were held for trial.) Over
 60 high school and college-age youths, including a number of
 girls, were killed as they demonstrated. According to one
 credible report, at least 20 grammar-school age children
 were among those arrested. Some of those released reported
 that they were beaten and tortured with electrical devices.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Political prisoners are held for long periods of time
 without trial. Some may have been executed; others
 ultimately are released with no reason given for the arrest.
 Most of those accused of non-political civil or criminal
 offenses have been tried according to provisions in the
 penal code which has been in force since before the 1978
 coup. Under the law, citizens are guaranteed public trial
 in civilian courts, with the usual rights to legal counsel,
 appeal and confrontation of witnesses, although trial in
 absentia is possible.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Forced entry into private homes by military or armed civilian
 representatives of the regime is common, especially after the
 evening curfew. Night-time arrests are frequent, many of
 which appear to be a form of intimidation.
 Many functions previously performed by military or police,
 including post-curfew checks and searches of homes, are now
 Lbeing. performed instead by politically loyal, armed
 Parchamist cadres-who have no authority under the law.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Afghanistan ranks among the world's poorest countries. It
 is almost completely rural and agricultural, and its economy
 and social patterns are organized along feudal lines.
 Illiteracy is about 90 percent, the mortality rate is very
 high, disease is widespread, and life expectancy is about
 40 years.
 
 
 932
 The Babrak regime claims that it is pursuing the two previous
 governments' programs of social and economic change (includ-
 ing land reform, abolition of usury, strengthened health care,
 equal rights for women, abolishment of the dowry, elimination
 of illiteracy and unemployment, revision of the tax structure,
 and building up of the public sector). The current regime in
 fact has shelved certain such programs which were partially
 responsible for the beginnings of nationalist resistance.
 For one example, the Babrak regime has allowed expropriated
 property to be returned to previous owners.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 All media are controlled by the regime and its Soviet
 patrons, who exert tight control over content. The press,
 radio and television are used solely to convey and reflect
 official policy. No criticism is allowed. On the other
 hand, in Kabul and other cities shabnamas, or "night letters",
 circulate surreptitiously. In them the Kabul regime and
 the Soviets are criticized and nationalist information is
 circulated. The regime considers circulation of such night
 letters to be criminal acts subject to severe sanctions.
 The government only permits political assembly in support
 of the regime, and all such meetings are orchestrated.
 Although the regime has made outward demonstrations of
 respect for Islam, a great majority of religious leaders
 remains alienated from the regime, and the regime treats
 them as subversive elements.
 Regime-controlled labor organizations have been established
 in several ministries and larger industries. These organi-
 zations have a reported total membership over 170,000.
 Unions have no right to negotiate or strike.
 For centuries, Afghan society has been dominated by the
 Pushtun ethnic group, which forms about one-half of the
 population. Others, such as Hazaras, Tajiks, and Uzbeks,
 historically have suffered direct and indirect discrimina-
 tion. The top political and military leadership of the
 current regime remains dominated by Pushtuns, although
 some members of ethnic minority groups hold prominent
 positions.
 Women continue to occupy an inferior place in this tra-
 ditional and feudal society. The government dropped efforts
 to educate rural women and girls, even though elimination
 of illiteracy is a stated goal of the regime. This edu-
 cational program was viewed ,ith suspicion and distrust by
 most Afghan men. Literacy among women is negligible, and
 the latest available statistic (1975) indicates that 98.5
 percent of women received no education at all.
 
 
 933
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration, and
 Repatriation
 Travel within Afghanistan is almost impossible because of
 the insurgency. Civilian traffic on roads can sometimes
 get through in convoy, but land travel is hazardous. The
 safest way to travel within Afghanistan is by airplane.
 This method is too expensive for the vast majority of
 Afghan citizens.
 There are many restrictions on foreign travel. Legal
 permission for travel outside Afghanistan has been cur-
 tailed; if one is not a trusted party member such travel
 is impossible (unless bribes are paid for passports). In
 addition to an expected passport bribe of up to about
 $1140, the regime now demands a deposit of about $230 for
 anyone leaving the country temporarily.
 Legal emigration is more strictly controlled than under
 previous governments; for all intents and purposes, it is
 rendered impossible. Through December 1, 1980, however,
 a total of more than 1,300,000 Afghans escaped overland
 into Pakistan where they are now registered in refugee
 camps. Many thousands more (no reliable statistics exist)
 are in Iran and elsewhere. Most escaped over the mountains,
 usually guided by local people. Helping Afghans leave
 their country surreptitiously has become an organized
 business; some Afghans have regular schedules of fees
 to guide escapees to Pakistan.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Since the Soviet invasion in December 1979, an authori-
 tarian one-party state ruled by the People's Democratic
 Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) has given way to an authori-
 tarian apparatus controlled totally by the Soviet Union.
 Soviet military and civilian advisors sit in almost all
 ministries and either make or approve every decision made
 by the regime.
 -The.PDPA itself is ruled by a small group who form the
 party's politburo. The party is torn by feuding between
 the two factions, Khalq and Parcham. The less numerous
 Parchamists (including Babrak) retain control of the PDPA
 apparatus. Actual party membership is estimated at from
 10,000 to 20,000 out of a population of approximately
 16 million. Membership in the PDPA (the only legal party) -
 and effectively membership in the Parcham faction -- is a
 prerequisite for political participation and professional
 advancement.
 There are no legally sanctioned opposition parties. Any
 perceived opposition is harshly treated. There has been
 .no constitution.since Taraki deposed President Daoud in
 1978. The Babrak regime has stated that the 64 principles
 enunciated in early 1980 will serve as an interim
 constitution.
 
 
 934
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 From late January until mid-June 1980 a delegation from the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was in Kabul
 with the agreement of the Kabul regime. Only twice during
 that time, however, was it allowed to visit Pol-i-Charki to
 check on the condition of prisoners. In mid-June, as a
 result of difficulties encountered in dealing with the Afghan
 authorities, it was called back to Geneva for consultations.
 Since then, the ICRC has tried several times without success
 to get approval from the Kabul regime for the return of an
 ICRC delegation. Private approaches to the Soviets also were
 unsuccessful. On September 16 the ICRC made a public appeal
 to all parties engaged in the conflict in Afghanistan to
 respect international humanitarian law and to permit the
 ICRC to discharge its traditional role. There has been no
 response to this public appeal.
 An Amnesty International mission visited Afghanistan in
 February 1980 and was received by Babrak. The same group,
 which previously had visited Afghanistan in October 1978,
 came in response to an offer made by the Babrak regime to
 discuss its assurances that it would protect Afghan citizens'
 human rights. The group visited Pol-i-Charki prison, talked
 to released political prisoners, and interviewed several
 still in prison.
 Apparently there has been no response from the Babrak regime
 to the Amnesty International memorandum reporting the
 findings of its mission, which was forwarded in late
 March 1980. The memorandum itself dealt basically with
 events which had taken place in 1979. It expressed concern
 about discrepancies in figures given for the numbers of
 prisoners executed or released, and it called for better
 conditions for the political prisoners with whom members
 of the mission had spoken in Pol-i-Charki. The memorandum
 confined itself to the organization's statutory concerns
 and did not deal with human rights concerns of a more
 general nature, such as those relating to armed conflict.
 The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)
 in 1980 undertook to provide humanitarian assistance to
 the Afghan refugees in refugee camps in Pakistan. UNHCR's
 participation in the care of the refugees has been
 criticized by the Afghan government.
