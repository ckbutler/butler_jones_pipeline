 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is nominally a multi party constitutional republic, but in reality
 power has been exercised by President Teodoro Obiang through a small subclan of
 the majority Fang tribe which has ruled since the country's independence in 1968.
 Despite the formalities of a multiparty form of government, President Obiang, in
 power since 1979, together with his associates, dominates the Government. The
 President's Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE) controls the judiciary
 and the legislature, the latter through fraudulent elections.
 President Obiang exercises control over the police and security forces through the
 Minister of Interior. The security forces committed serious human rights abuses.
 The majority of the population of 400,000 lives by subsistence agriculture, supple-
 mented by hunting and fishing. Barter is a major aspect of an economy in which
 the small monetary sector is based on exports of petroleum, increasing quantities
 of timber, and declining quantities of cocoa. Most international assistance has been
 suspended due to the lack of economic reform and the Government's continued viola-
 tion of human rights. Substantial new oil deposits were discovered in 1995 and will
 provide important additional revenue in the future.
 Serious human rights abuses continue. After some progress in 1994, the humans
 rights situation deteriorated in 1995. Citizens do not have the right to change their
 government. Principal abuses by the security forces included: arrests and physical
 abuse of prisoners in their custody; several extrajudicial killings; torture; beatings
 of detainees; arbitrary arrest and detention; and searches without warrants. With
 few exceptions, the authorities took no action against any security force members
 suspected of human rights violations. Prison conditions are life threatening. The ju-
 dicial system does not ensure due process and is subject to executive influence. The
 Government severely restricts freedom of speech and the press and effectively limits
 the right of assembly. In September municipal elections, the Government used arbi-
 trary arrest, illegal detention, and beatings with impunity in an unsuccessful at-
 tempt to restrain active political opposition. Discrimination and violence against
 women are problems.
 The only mass media in the country are the government-owned television and
 radio stations. There are no print media, and no newspapers or magazines from
 abroad are available.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were several political and
 extrajudicial killings. On September 17, the day of the municipal election, a police-
 man shot and killed a member of the political opposition in the town of Mbibiyiin.
 The policeman was in turn severely beaten by a mob.
 In January a police commissioner killed a farmer near Malabo, then cut open his
 abdomen and chest to remove several organs used in witchcraft-related rituals. Al-
 though the commissioner was tried by a court and found guilty, he was sentenced
 
 
 only to house arrest for 20 years. His movement, however, is apparently unre-
 stricted.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 These abuses are serious, frequent, and widespread. The police routinely beat de-
 tainees severely, and victims often require hospitalization after release. Access to
 prisoners is not generally permitted. The security forces arrested prominent mem-
 bers of the opposition and beat and tortured them. The Government uses the psy-
 chological effect of arrest, along with the fear of future beating, to intimidate opposi-
 tion party members. The Government has not prosecuted or punished any security
 officials for these abuses. In the year's most celebrated arrest case, Severo Moto, a
 leading opposition figure, and three other members of his Progressive Party were
 arrested in February for treason, along with six retired and active duty military offi-
 cials. At the trial in April, Moto was the only defendant who did not show evidence
 of torture. The others could barely walk or sit because of beatings to their feet and
 buttocks. One defendant, Pedro Massa Mba, had two broken arms; another,
 Norberto Nculo, had one broken arm. According to the United Nations Special
 Rapporteur for Human Rights, all of the military personnel showed evidence of hav-
 ing been hung by their wrists for extended periods of time. During the September
 election campaign, a guard at the former U.S. Embassy was arrested by police and
 beaten. Police released him after high level diplomatic intervention. His late uncle,
 a political opponent of the regime, had been beaten to death in Malabo's Blackbeach
 Prison 2 years before.
 Prison conditions are extremely primitive and life-threatening. Rations are inad-
 equate, and sanitary facilities are practically nonexistent. Prison authorities do not
 normally target women for harassment, but femaleprisoners are not housed sepa-
 rately from men. Prison conditions are not monitoredby independent organizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Police routinely hold persons in incom-
 municado detention. The Government arrested political figures and detained them
 for indeterminate periods. Ther  e ealso credib le reports that around five mem-
 bers of the Movement for the Autodetermination of the Island of Bioko (MAIB), an
 ethnically based political opposition group, were detained in prison for several
 weeks. At least 15 members of the opposition were arrested for political activity dur-
 ing the year.
 n lFebruary, opposition leader Severo Moto and nine additional opposition and
 military figures were arrested and charged with treason. At their trial in April
 (which lasted only 7 hours), one defendant was acquitted. The others were convicted
 and sentenced to long prison terms. Moto received a 28-year sentence. The trial was
 held in a military court which did not have jurisdiction over Moto, a civilian. After
 extensive international criticism and an internatinal campaign for his release, he
 and his fellow defendants were pardoned and released in August. Although the Gov-
 ernment did not force Moto to leave the country, he left to reside abroad soon after
 his release.
 There are nominal but unenforced legal procedural safeguards regarding deten-
 tion, the need for search warrants, and other protections of prisoners' rights. Judi-
 cial warrants are required. Generally, however, the police arrest suspects without
 having obtained warrants.
 Authorities also continued to hold citizens of Nigeria, Ghana, Gabon, and other
 countries to secure bribes.
 The Government does not force citizens into exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent; judges serve at
 the pleasure of the President and are appointed, transferred, and dismissed for po-
 litical reasons. Corruption is ram pant.
 The court system, composed of lower provincial courts, appeals courts, and a Su-
 preme Court, is rarely used. The President appoints members of the Supreme Court,
 and they are responsive to him. There are traditional courts in the countryside, in
 which tribal elders adjudicate civil claims and minor criminal matters.
 The Constitution and laws passed by the Chamber of Deputies provide for legal
 representation and the right of appeal. In practice, authorities do not uniformly re-
 spect these provisions. Civil cases rarely come to public trial.
 The trial of Moto and his codefendants was an example of the way the courts op-
 erate. Apart from statements that were extracted by torture, the only evidence pre-
 sented by the prosecution was a letter that Moto had written in 1992 which dis-
 cussed the military's possible reaction to a democratic change of government. This
 type of evidence is an example of how the courts respond to political imperatives.
 The quick guilt verdict, handed down by a judge appointed by the President, was
 a foregone conclusion.

 There were no reports of long-term political prisoners, but during the year the
 Government arrested political figures and detained them for indeterminate periods
 (see Section 1.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not enforce the law requiring judicial warrants for searches, and
 security forces arbitrarily search homes.
 The Government does not overtly force officials to join the PDGE, but for lawyers,
 government employees, and others, party membership is necessary for employment
 and promotion. The party banner is prominently displayed with the national flag
 in government offices, and many officials wear PDGE lapel pins. Foreign firms are
 often pressured to hire party members.
 There is reportedly some surveillance of members of the opposition parties, but
 there does not appear to be systematic interference with correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but the Government severely restricts these rights in practice. No
 publications of any kind are openly available. The country has no press, and foreign
 publications are not sold. Shortwave broadcasts and government-controlled tele-
 vision and radio stations are the only media available to citizens. Opposition pam-
 phlets and statements circulate.
 Television is Government-controlled and broadcasts only a few hours per day. The
 Government withholds even minimal access to broadcasting from opposition parties.
 It also refused to grant permits to foreign news media, incuding Spanish television.
 However, Spanish reporters were working in Malabo during the September munici-
 pal elections. It is not known if they had Government permission.
 There are no universities or other institutions of higher learning; the question of
 academic freedom is largely irrelevant.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of assembly and as-
 sociation is provided for in the Constitution. However, even for meetings in private
 homes, government authorization must be obtained for any gathering of more than
 10 persons for discussions that the regime considers political.
 The Government generally permits opposition parties to hold conferences and pri-
 vate meetings. It requires permits for public events, which it routinely grants but
 usually quickly cancels, effectively undermining the right of assembly. In the Sep-
 tember municipal elections, opposition parties were largely free to campaign, al-
 though there was some intimi ation. The MA.I.B. movement formally chose not to
 be a political party and it did not take part in the election.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government generally respects freedom of religion.
 There is no state religion, and the Government does not discriminate against any
 faith. However, a religious organization must first be formally recognized by the
 Ministry of Justice and Reli_',on before its practice is allowed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict internal travel. Local police may de-
 mand bribes from occupants of cars, taxis, and other vehicles traveling outside the
 capital. Members of opposition parties often travel abroad with no restrictions on
 their right to return. There are no refugees or asylum seekers.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have not had the right to change their government by democratic means.
 The Constitution nominally provides citizens with the right to change their govern-
 ment peacefully, but in fact there have been no free presidential elections since
 independence in 1968. The President exercises complete power as Head of State,
 commander of the armed forces, and leader of the government party, the PDGE.
 Leadership positions within the government are in general restricted to the presi-
 dent's subclan and closest supporters. While there is an elected Chamber of Depu-
 ties, it is not representative and is dominated by the Government.
 Municipal elections in September drew considerable attention. The Government
 used arbitrary arrest, illegal detention, and beatings in an unsuccessful effort to
 control a su den upsurge in opposition political activity. Despite these impediments
 the opposition parties were able to campaign effectively.
 According to U.N.-coordinated international observers, the local diplomatic com-
 munity and other well-informed individuals, the PDGE was soundly defeated at the
 polls in the municipal election, with the opposition winning from two-thirds to
 three-fourths of all votes cast. The Government announced the vote totals 11 days
 later, claiming that it had won control of 18 of 27 municipal councils with a 52 per-
 cent overall majority of the vote. Most observers believe the national government,
 
 
 81
 using its authority as the sole arbiter of the election process, altered the vote count
 after the election.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics,
 women are seriously underrepresented in politics. There are 2 women in the 42-
 member Cabinet, and 5 in the 80-member legislature.
 The Government does not overtly limit participation by ethnic minorities, but the
 monopolization of political power by the President's Mongomo subclan of the Fang
 ethnic group persists.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The US. Embassy prior to its October closing was not aware of the existence of
 local human rights nongovernmental organizations.
 The United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights visited once this year,
 receiving grudging government cooperation. The Government refused to permit the
 International Committee of the Red Cross to establish an office or visit prisons or
 detainees.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Both governmental and societal discrimination continue. These are reflected in
 traditional restraints on women's education and in the circumscribed opportunities
 for professional and occupational achievement of ethnic minorities. The Government
 deliberately limits potential opportunities for ethnic minorities.
 Women.-Societal violence against women, particularly wife-beating, is common.
 Medical professionals estimate that 30 to 35 percent of women experience violence
 in the home. The Government does not maintain records of such incidents, nor does
 it prosecute perpetrators.
 Athough the Constitution and laws provide for equal rights for women, they are
 largely confined by custom to traditional roles, especially in agriculture. Polygyny,
 which is widespread among the Fang, contributes to women's secondary status, as
 does limited educational opportunity; women receive only one-fifth as much school-
 ing as men.
 There is no discrimination against women with regard to inheritance and family
 laws, but there is discrimination in traditional practice. For an estimated 90 percent
 of women, including virtually all ethnic groups except the Bubi, tradition dictates
 that if a marriage is dissolved, the wife must return the dowry given her family by
 the bridegoom at the time of marriage, and the husband automatically receives cus-
 tody of all children from the union.
 Similarly, in the Fang, Ndowe, and Bisio cultures, primogeniture is practiced, and
 as women become memers oftheir husband's families upon marriage, they usually
 are not accorded inheritance rights. According to the law women have the right to
 buy and sell property and goods, but in practice the male-dominated society permits
 few women access to sufficient funds to engage in more than petty trading or to pur-
 chase real property beyond a garden plot or modest home.
 Children.-There are no legislated provisions for the welfare of children. The Gov-
 ernment devotes little attention to children's rights or welfare and has no set policy
 in this area.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no constitutional or legal provision for the
 physically disabled with respect to discrimination in employment or education.
 There is no legislation mandating accessibility for the disabled to buildings or gov-
 ernment services.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There is no legal discrimination against eth-
 nic or racial minorities, but in practice some members of minorities face discrimina-
 tion because they do not come from the Fang ethnic group, or belong to a subclan
 other than the President's, which controls the countrys political life. Minorities do
 not face discrimination in inheritance, marriage, or family laws.
 The MAIB, (see Section 1.d.) composed of ethnic Bubi, has become a target of gov-
 ernment security forces. In early October, at least five MAIB members were de-
 tained for their membership in the organization.
 Several thousand citizens of Nigeria and Ghana reside in the country. Most are
 small traders and business people and are harassed and persecuted by the police.
 A high percentage of the market traders are foreigners. Their merchandise is com-
 monly seized, and they are often jailed until they or their families pay bribes to the
 authorities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Constitution provides for the right to
 organize unions, the Government has not passed enabling legislation. In the small
 
 
 wage economy, no labor organizations exist, although there are a few cooperatives
 wit h limited power. The law prohibits strikes. The Labor Code contains provisions
 to uphold workers' rights, but the Government generally does not enforce them.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation regard-
 ing these rights or prohibiting antiunion discrimination and no evidence of collective
 bargaining by any group. Wages are set by the Government and the employers, with
 little or no input by workers. Employers must meet the minimum wages set by the
 Government, and most companies pay more than the government-established mini-
 mum.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced labor and
 slavery, and there is no evidence that such activity takes place. Convicted felons do,
 within the law, perform extensive labor outside prison without compensation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for child
 employment is 16 years, but the Ministry of Labor does not enforce this law. The
 Government also does not enforce the law which stipulates mandatory education up
 to the age of 18. Underage youth perform both family farm work and street vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law prescribes a standard 40-hour work-
 week and a 48-hour rest period which are observed in practice in the formal econ-
 omy. The minimum monthly wage is approximately $46 (cfa 27,500). The Labor
 Code provides comprehensive protections or workers from occupational hazard, but
 the Government does not enforce these in practice. Employees who protest
 unhealthy or dangerous working conditions risk loss of their jobs.
