 SPAIN
 Spain is a democracy with a constitutional monarch. The Parliament consists of
 two chambers, the Congress of Deputies and the Senate. President Jose Maria
 Aznar of the Popular Party (PP) was elected in 1996. The Government respects the
 constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary in practice.
 Spain has three levels of security forces. The National Police are responsible for
 nationwide investigations, security in urban areas, traffic control, and hostage res-
 cue. The Civil Guard polices rural areas and controls borders and highways. Autono-
 mous police forces have taken over many of the duties of the-Civil Guard in Galicia,
 Catalonia, and the Basque country. The security forces are under the effective con-
 trol of the Government. The security forces also maintain anticorruption units. An
 adviser for human rights in the Ministry of Justice is charged with promoting hu-
 manitarian law and training senior law enforcement groups in human rights prac-
 tices. Some members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is market based, with primary reliance on private initiative, al-
 though a number of public sector enterprises remain in key areas. The economy
 grew by 3.4 percent in 1997. The nominal unemployment rate dropped from the
 1996 high of 21.9 percent to 21 percent in 1997.
 The Government generally respected the human. rights of its citizens. However,
 there were problems in some areas, including police brutality, lenty pretrial de-
 tention, and an inefficient judicial system. An Ombudsman, called the "People's De-
 fender" in the Constitution, serves as an independent advocate for citizen's rights.
 Societal violence against women, discrimination against Roma, and incidents of rac-
 ism and rightwing youth violence are also problems. The Government investigates
 allegations of human rights abuses by the security forces and punishes those found
 guilty, although investigations are often lengthy. and punishments can be light.
 - Continued allegations surfaced of involvement by the previous Gonzalez adminis-
 tration in "Antiterrorist Liberation Groups" (GAL), which murdered 27 people be-
 tween 1983 and 1987. This secret organization was reportedly composed of security
 officers and contract gunmen with links to organized crime. It is believed to have
 had links to the highest ministerial levels, including a former Minister of the Inte-
 rior, the commanding officer of the security forces, and the most senior government
 representative in the Basque region. Judicial investigations into these allegations
 proceeded throughout the year but did not turn up any significant new evidence.
 These investigations could lead to trials of former senior officials on GAL-related
 charges.
 The principal source of abuses continued to be the protracted campaign of terror-
 ism waged by the Basque Fatherland and Freedom (ETA) terrorist group, which
 committed killings, kidnapings, and other abuses.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government forces. However, several deaths under
 suspicious circumstances occurred.
 Ifi March an officer from the Civil Guard was detained after fatally shooting a
 young Moroccan boy in the back. The boy's girlfriend claimed that they were asked
 what was wrong by the officer while they paused for him to tie his shoe. He re-
 sponded "nothing," and three shots were fired as they turned to walk away, accord-
 ing to the girl. The boy's parents and the Association of Moroccan Immigrants in
 Spain allege that his death was racially motivated. The Civil Guard denies these
 accusations.
 ETA member Jose Maria Aranzamenll died in Madrid's Acala-Mco prison, where
 he was being held in preventive custody, on February 7. Aranzamendi was found
 hanged in his cell. Prison officials failed to report that Aanzamendi had both his
 feet and hands bound. This generated skepticism as to the cause of his death and
 led some observers to blame prison officials. The official autopsy listed the cause of
 death as suicide, and no charges were filed.
 Eugenio Aranburu, a member of the national committee of Herri Batasuna (HB),
 the political wing of ETA, committed suicide on February 10, the same day that he
 was to have appeared in court for questioning in connection with an ETA video that
 HB used for propaganda purposes during the 1996 general election campaign.
 Aranburu, like the other HBnational committee members, announced that he would
 not answer the summons to appear in court for questioning over the video. He was
 found hanged in the country home of his brother (in Mallabia, Vizcaya). Aranburu's
 brother and friends said after his death that he was not suffering from depression
 or nervousness, including in regard to his forthcoming imprisonment (for refusing
 to appear for questioning over the video). In an interview in a Basque news maga-
 zine published shortly before his death, Aranburu said that he expected to be im-
 prisoned (by the Supreme Court) and that he believed that only punishment and
 beatings awaited him in prison. Nevertheless, he said that he was not worried about
 his forthcoming imprisonment. The HB national committee members were impris-
 oned for failing to answer summonses to appear before the Supreme Court to dis-
 cuss the election video. Initially, they had refused to pay bail but did so after it was
 reduced, and all were released early in the year.
 On March 27 the body of Josu Zabala Salegi, a member of ETA, was found in the
 countryside in Guipuzcoa province. The body had a bullet wound in the chest, and
 a 9mm pistol was found next to the body. Police pursued Zabala for more than 2
 years in connection with a series of ETA attacks. Zabala was wanted by the Na-
 tional High Court, which had ordered his arrest. An anonymous call to a pro-ETA
 newspaper said that Zabala was missing since March 23.
 In 1997 plaintiffs appealed the 1996 acquittal of two Civil Guard members in the
 case of the torture and murder of a detainee in 1994 (see Section 1.c.).
 Courts continue to investigate the "dirty war" against terrorism, during which
 GAL allegedly was responsible for bombings, extrajudicial killings, and kidnapings
 during the mid-1980's. No former senior officials have been tried yet, but investiga-
 tions into specific instances of murder and kidnaping could lead to eventual trials
 of such individuals.
 Former Interior Minister Jose Barrionuevo and former Secretary of State for Se-
 curity Rafael Vera, indicted in 1996 for kidnaping and other charges in the 1983
 case of Segundo Marey and the "dirty war" against ETA, were ordered to stand trial
 although their trials had not yet begun by year's end.
 Virtually no progress was registered in resolving the mid-1980's cases of killings
 by the security forces of Roman Onaederra, MikelZabaltza, Robert Caplanne, and
 a tramp and two drug addicts.
 ETA continued to commit human right abuses, including deliberate and arbitrary
 killings and hostage taking. As of December, ETA was held responsible for 13
 deaths during the year, a significant increase from 1996 during which 5 people were
 killed. According to the Minister of the Interior, ETA forces have killed 763 persons
 since 1968. The Attorney General reported that groups supporting ETA carried out
 830 acts of sabotage, numerous disturbances, and attacks on persons, property, po-
 litical parties, and security forces in 1995, a 300 percent increase since 1994 (latest
 available statistics).
 On January 8, two ETA gunmen shot and killed army Lieutenant Colonel Jesus
 Cuesta Abril in front of his house in Madrid. On January 30, ETA gunmen shot and
 killed Eugenio Olaziregi Borda, a bicycle salesman in San Sebastian. Olaziregi
 worked in a shop in Oiartzun where ETA terrorist Valentin Lasarte bought two bi-
 
 
 1297
 cycles before he was arrested in March 1996 (Lasarte was sentenced to a lengthy
 prison term). Olaziregi's killing was apparently based on the supposition that he
 had turned Lasarte in and served as a warning against public cooperation in the
 fight against ETA. On February 10, ETA gunmen shot and killed Supreme Court
 judge Rafael Martinez Emperador in Madrid. The same day ETA set off a car bomb
 in Granada targeted at a passing air force van; the bomb killed Domingo Puente,
 a civilian employee of Armilla air base, and its explosion wounded eight others. On
 February 11, ETA gunmen shot and killed Francisco Arratibel, a Basque business-
 man, in Tolosa, Guipuzca. ETA had accused Arratibel of having kept $450,000 (60
 million pesetas) of the ransom obtained for the release of ETA victim Emiliano Re-
 villa, who was kidnaped in 1988. Arratibl who was sentenced to 2 years in prison
 in 1994 for his intermediary role, escaped a previous ETA attempt on his life in
 1978 (a result of his father's refusal to pay ETA's revolutionary tax). On February
 17, an ETA car bomb killed Modesto Rico, a national policeman, in Bilbao. On
 March 11, ETA forces shot and killed Javier     an employee of the Martutene
 prisn in San Sebastian. On April 24, ETA shot adile  ational Police Inspector
 Luis Andres Samperio Sariudo in Bilbao. On May 5, ETA members shot and killed
 Civil Guard member Jose Manuel Garcia Fernandez in a bar in Zierbana in Vizcaya
 province.
 On July 10, ETA forces kidnaped Miguel Angel Blanco Garrido, a councilman of
 the Popular Party in the town of Ermua in Vizcaya, and issued an ultimatum to
 the Government that it would kill Blanco if the Government did not bring all ETA
 prisoners back to the Basque country within 48 hours. On July 12, ETA carried out
 its threat and killed Blanco. He was found with two shots to the head and his hands
 and feet bound in aooe   area near Lasarte in Guipuzcoa. His death in a hospital
 on July 130triggered an unprecedented level of national and international criticism
 of ETA. Mass -emonstrations took place throughout Spain, with a march of an esti-
 mated 1.5 million people in Madrid, 1 million in Barcelona, and several hundred
 thousand people in other provinces.
 On September 6, ETA set off a car bomb in the Basque city of Basauri, killing
 National Police officer Daniel Villar Enciso. .The 39-year-old of icer was on his way
 to work when the explosion went off. The death of Villar nlse-resulted in demonstra-
 tions throughout- many major cities and a funeral attendance of over 2,000 people,
 including the Minister of Interior. On October 15, Ertzaintza (Basque elice) agent
 Xtema Agu    died after being shot on October 14 by one of three ETA terrorists
 preparing an attack cn the new Guggenheim museum in Bilbao. Aguirre was shot
 when he demanded identification from the men after he erif tat the license
 plate numbers on the truck they were driving were false. The men had planted 12
 grenades in launcher tubes in a garden of the museum with the intention of setting
 them off during its- inauguration in the presence of top government and private sec-
 tor figures, inc uding King Juan Carlos.
 Following the announcement of the sentence of 23 HB National Committee mem-
 bers on December 2, Floren Aoiz, one of the convicted committee members, warned
 that the sentence pawauld bring consequences and they would be serious con-
 sequences.d Four days later, there was an attempt on the life of a PP town council-
 woman in the Basue region, Elena Azpiroz; ETA subsequently took credit for the
 attack. One of her bodyguards was injured in the altercation. On December 11, 64-
 year-old PP councilor Jose Luis Cas was fatally shot in the head in a bar in Irun
 in the Ba e region
 Poice o~mials and the press continue t& report an inrease in ETA youth criminal
 activity, including the continued use of Molotov cocktails to set fire to homes, busi-
 nesses, cars, andpoelitical party ofaies in a continuing campaign of intimidation.
 During -the year, damage by Jarrai, the very active youth wing of ETA, was ex-
 pected to surpass millions of dollars. On December 22, an ETA youth commando ex-
 ploded a homemade-bomb in the residence of Carmen Gurruchaga, a journalist for
 El Mundo, one of the most popular daily newspapers- The -incident happened the
 same day that Gurruchaga published an article in El Mundo revealing the possible
 presence in Cuba of Mikel Otegi, an accused murderer in hiding, from Spanish jus-
 tice. Although no one was injured in the explosion, the bomb contained enough ex-
 plosives to have killed Gurruchaga and her two children, who were also inside the
 home at the time of the explosion.
 The Government utilized special antiterrorist legislation in its efforts to combat
 ETA. It continued its counterterrorism efforts and sought tougher extradition rules
 from countries.outside Europe where ETA terrorists reside.
 In June the French judicial system sentenced 3 members of ETA's "comando
 itinerante" to life imprisonment and 3 others to 16 years' imprisonment for their
 participation in 21 terrorist actions between 1978 and 1989, which resulted in 38
 deaths and dozens of injuries. This marked the first time that ETA members were
 
 
 1298
 tried in France for crimes committed in Spain, although many ETA members have
 been tried in France for violating French law. France and Spain continue to cooper-
 ate to extradite ETA criminals, primarily from France to Spain.
 There are several organizations dedicated to the needs and concerns of victims of
 terrorism, among them the Association of Terrorism Victims (AVT). This organiza-
 tion was founded in 1981 and currently serves 1,400 families by providing legal and
 psychologcal counseling, publishing a monthly magazine, and carrying out other ac-
 tivities. Government funding is limited to $41,000 annually provided by the Min-
 istry of Defense. In 1996 the Association donated $880,000 to aid victims.
 Some victims of ETA crimes complain that the Government has ignored them or
 moved too slowly in compensating them for their losses. In June the AVT held a
 press conference to commemorate the 10th anniversary of ETA's bloodiest terrorist
 action, an attack in a Barcelona shopping center that resulted in 21 deaths. In 1996
 the Supreme Court found the police negligent for not evacuating shoppers despite
 a warning from ETA 1 hour before the explosion. The Court orderedthe Govern-
 ment to pay a total of $300,000 to the victims. Alvaro Cabrerizo, who lost his wife
 and both children in the attack, is the only person to date who has been com-
 pensated. Thirty-one families have cases pendi~ng. The AVT press conference pro-
 vided an opportunity for victims to criticize the Government for not carrying out its
 promise of compensation.
 On December 2, the Supreme Court sentenced 23 members of the National Com-
 mittee of Hf to 7 years in prison each for violation of a law prohibiting collaboration
 with an armed band. All 23 were fined $3,500 (500,000 pesetas).  e   e was
 based on the Committee's decision to distribute a video made by ETA during HB's
 1996 election campaign. In the video, masked ETA members with guns on the table
 in front of them proposed negotiating Basque self-determination with the Govern-
 ment. Mainstream Basque (not Spanish) political leaders charge that the sentences
 were politically motivated and the result of pressure by the Government on the
 Court to convict.
 Argentine naval officer Adolfo Sdilingo has been in prison since October 10, when
 he presented himself to National High Court judge Baltazar Garzon and offered his
 cooperation in the investigation of the disappearance of 600 Spaniards in Argentina
 during the Dirty War conducted by the dictatorship there between 1976 and 1983.
 On December 30 Garzon issued charges against another 36 Argentine military and
 police officials, whose names were provided by Scilingo. They join hundreds already
 charged. The Chief Prosecutor of the National High Court, Eduardo Fungairino, and
 the Attorney General, Jesus Cardenal, both expressed the opinion late in the year
 that the Court did not have jurisdiction in the cases brought by judges Garzon and
 Manual Garcia Castellon, who heads a similar case involving the disappearance of
 Spaniards in Chile. The Socialist Party called for the Government to fire both
 Fungairino and Cardenal for their stance in the cases.
 b. Disappearance.--Since 1970 ETA has kidnaped 76 people. It is estimated that
 ETA has obtained more than $33 million from the kidnapings. Since 1982 only five
 hostages were set free due to successful police intervention; nine were kilied during
 the process of negotiation.
 On July 1, the Civil Guard located and rescued Jose Antonio Ortega Lara, a pris-
 on official from Burges kidnaped by ETA on January 17, 1996. Ortega Lad spent
 a total of 532 days in captivity, making him the longest serving ETA hostage. ETA
 had conditioned Ortega Lara's release on a reversal of the Government's policy of
 dispersal of the approximately 500 ETA prisoners throughout Spain. In return for
 Ortega Lara's release, ETA called on the authorities to abandon what it defined as
 their strategy of repression of Basque prisoners, saying that in return it would be
 pered to make an "equivalent gesture." ETA stated that if the Government com-
 pied with its demand, prison officers would cease to be the object of its actions. Fol-
 lowing Ortega Lara's release, the authorities learned that the terrorists who were
 holding Ortega Lara had instructions to either kill him or let him die of starvation
 if the Government did not change its policy on ETA prisoners. Ortega Lara was kept
 in a cramped and humid underground cell in a warehouse on a river bank. Upon
 release, he was found to have lost 50 pounds and was suffering from malnutrition,
 muscle waste, and impaired vision.
 Hours before Ortega Lara was rescued, Cosine Delclaux Zubriria, a lawyer and
 son of a wealthy Basque businessman, was found tied to a tree near Elorrio follow-
 ing an anonyous call to a regional Basque newspaper. Taken hostage by ETA for
 ransom on November 11, 1996, from his place of work in Zamudio, Vizeaya, his kid-
 naping coincided with a renewed campaign by ETA to raise funds through the so-
 called "revolutionary tax." He was set free on July 1 by ETA after 232 days in cap-
 tivity. His family paid a ransom of $6.7 million and premised to pay an additional
 $3.35 million after his release.
 
 
 1299
 On July 10 ETA kidnaped Migel Angel Blanco Garrido, a local town councilor
 for the ruling Popular Party in Ermua TA issued a statement threatening to exe-
 cute the 29-year-old man unless the Government -met its demands to relocate some
 500 ETA prisoners near their homes: Blanco was shot on July 12 and died in a hos-
 pital the next day (see Section l.a).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such acts. Nonetheless, suspects charged with terrorism assert
 that they have been abused during detention, and similar charges are sometimes
 made by other detainees.
 On November 20, the United Nations Committee Against Torture released a se-
 ries of recommendations regarding the problem of torture in Spain. The report
 pointed to documented cases of torture that reached the courts and that in some
 instances took up to 15 years to be resolved. Among other criticisms were the inabil-
 ity of prisoners held incommunicado to choose their own attorney and concern over
 complaints lodged throughout the year of xenophobia and. racism against immi-
 grants.
 Nongovernmental- organizations and the media also continue to-accuse the secu-
 rity forces of occasional human rights abuses ancLbrutality. Amnesty International
 (Al) expressed concern in 1996 over "numerous reports . . . of ill-treatment and
 even torture inflicted on persons suspected of acts of terrorism by members of the
 security forces." AI said that investigations into -such allegations Were "not always
 systematically carried out by the public authorities" and that members of the secu-
 rity forces found guilty of torture or mistreatment and sentenced to imprisonment
 were "often pardoned or released early; or simply do not serve the sentence." Al rec-
 ommended that the Government "establish transparent and equitable procedures for
 conducting independent investigations into complaints of ill-treatment and torture"
 and urged the prosecution and appropriate punishment of officials found to have
 committed such acts. It also suggested that comprehensive -human rights training
 be provided to law enforcement and prison officers.
 According to a 1996 study completed by the Spanish Association Against Torture
 (AAT), there were 271 accusations of torture in 1995 (latest available statistics). The
 reportr published yearly, reflects statistics from the previous year.
 On March 11, captured terrorist Fernando Elejalde Tapia was taken into custody
 by three officers of the National Police immediately after the fatal shooting of a pris-
 on psychologist in the Basque region. He was held under the provisions of
 antiterrorist legislation. Two days later he received medical attention for a per-
 forated eardrum, four broken vertebrae, bruises all over his body, blackened eyes,
 a kidney malfunction, and semiconsciousness. An inquiry by the Interior Ministry
 concluded that, contrary to Elejalde's claim, no torture or mistreatment took place
 while he was under police supervision and that his injuries were a result of the cir-
 cumstances of the- arrest. While fleeingpursuing officers, Elejalde was struck by a
 car, and he offered fierce resistance when they caught up with him. The Minister
 of Interior accepted the resignation of the provincial governor and dismissed the San
 Sebastian police chief over their failure to inform the Government of Elejalde's se-
 vere injuries and to ensure-that he received medical attention sooner.-The Minister
 of Interior maintained afterwards that there was "no torture nor abuse here. ..-."
 TheBasque-Nationalist Party (PNV) and the United Left Party (ILU) complained
 -tliat Elejalde was forced to make declarations under extreme pain. In January 1998
 a judge ruled that Elejalde had not been tortured by the police.
 On November 8, 1996, a protected witness in the investigation of GAL crimes
 claimed- that he was abducted from a gas station and taken to a beach where he
 was handcuffed and beaten severely. Ie claims to have suffered repeated cigarette
 burns, sodomization, and death threats to his family. A copy of the judge's order re-
 questing that he be given extra protection was forced into his mouth. A medical ex-
 amination confirmed that his injuries were consistent with the allegations of tor-
 ture, including 22 cigarette burns and lacerations in the rectal area. The victim
 identified one of his abusers as wearing special black latex gloves that are issued
 to the special forces. This information generated an inquiry, and-the Minister of the
 Interior later admitted that there had been insufficient measures of security rec-
 ognizing a "collective failure of the state of law" but denied that the assault was
 a result of negligence. This incident coincided with other reports of verbal threats
 and assaults against other witnesses, jurists, and lawyers involved in the different
 inquiries into the operations of GAL. Amnesty International, in a March report, ex-
 pressed concern at the failure to protect witnesses in the GAL investigation and
 urged the Government to guard important witnesses.
 In September AI expressed concern over allegations of police brutality against 17-
 year-old Ivan Gonzalez Polanco. According to testimony, van was riding his motor-
 cycle around the center of Badajoz on January 15 when a police officer signaled him
 
 
 1300
 
 to stop. When he gradually slowed to a stop in the officer's direction, he was re-
 buked- for not stop ping immediately and shoved to the ground. After an argument,
 he was allegedly beaten and his nose broken. Requests by the family of the victim
 that the officers involved take a breathalyzer test and to lodge a formal complaint
 were denied. The family was obliged to wait and make the complaint in court on
 January 17. By this time the police'officer had filed his own complaint against the
 victim.
 In November a court in Vizcaya sentenced three members of the Civil Guard to
 4 years in prison and 6 years of inhabilitacion especial" (a ban on any public sector
 employment) for their participation in the torture of Kepa Urra Guridi. The court
 absolved three other members of the Civil Guard. The torture was committed in the
 victim's home on January 29, 1992, while Urra was detained on charges of collabo-
 rating with ETA. Urra was found guilty on March 25, 1996, along with several other
 ETA members, for his role in the 1992 death of National Police officer Jose Ansean.
 In December 1996 a Barcelona court acquitted members of the Civil Guard of the
 torture and murder of a detainee, Jorge Xurigue, in 1994. The officers claim that
 the detainee attempted to escape and had to be subdued. The victim died of a cere-
 bral hemorrhage following a blow to the temple. The provincial court found that the
 two officers kicked and beat the victim while he was on the ground. However, the
 court was unable to identify with certainty which of the two officers delivered the
 fatal blow. The court acquitted beth defendants of the charges of murder, homicide,
 falsifying an official document, and torture. In 1997 the plaintiffs appealed the case
 to the Supreme Court.
 In March a Madrid court sentenced four officers of the National Police to 3
 months' imprisonment and 1 year's suspension from duty for torturing Enrique
 Erreguerena in 1982. Erreguerena is to receive $7,000 compensation. The officers
 were acquitted of ille all detaining him and denyg him his rights. Erreguerena,
 who was suspected .f ETA-related crimes, was held incommunicado for 10 days
 under the antiterrorist legislation in force since 1982. Upon appearing in court, the
 judge ordered immediate medical attention for him. He later complained that he
 had been beaten, plunged in a bath until near the point of drowning, and given elec-
 tric shocks to his penis. In 1986 the then director of state security refused to provide
 information requested by the magistrate investigating the case. In 1993, some 11
 years after the events, six officers were charged with torturing Erreguerena. How-
 ever the trial was postponed several times or a variety of reasons, including the
 holiday leave of one of the accused.
 In April the provincial court in Vizcaya acquitted eight National Police officers on
 1987   ares of torturing two men suspected of ETA crimes. Both men suffered le-
 sions on their bodies. The officers claimed that the injuries resulted when the men
 attempted to flee and that they had acted appropriately and used reasonable force.
 In April the Federal Union of Police (UFP) an the Unified Union of Police (SUP)
 submitted a complaint to the Audencia provincial court prtesting its decision in a
 March 1993 case. The court had sentenced two agents and one inspector for the
 beating of two Peruvian immigrants to 5 weekends of house arrest and 12 years
 in jail respectively. The UFP that claims the verdict only reflected the immigrant's
 version and excluded the testimony of the agents and other witnesses.
 There was no apparent progress in the case of four policemen charged with the
 rape of a Brazilian tourist in March 1996. Nor was there progress in the trial of
 14 Civil Guards of the Colmenar Viejo barracks accused of torturing 3 youths in
 1994 following their arrest after a violent confrontation in a bar. The judicial inves-
 tigation of allegations of torture in the case of several persons arrested in 1992 and
 accused of collaboration with ETA dragged on at year's end.
 Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards. The Council
 of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) made formal visits to
 inspect prisons in 1991 and 1994, and an ad hoc visit in June 1994. In March 1996,
 after a long delay, the Government finally agreed to the 1997 publication of the
 S orts on its visits along with the Government's response. The CPT reorts
 exprssed concern over the continued use in the last 5 years of less severe met ods
 of mistreatment, such as 'punches, kicks, blows, and verbal insults."
 The public defender in his 1997 report found only four cases in 1996 of mistreat-
 ment in p~risons. He noted the rise of drug addiction and AIDS in the prison popu-
 lation and the need for implementingbetter rehabilitation programs.
 Allegations of mistreatment of ETA prisoners arose aftr the suicide deaths of
 three individuals associated with ETA (see Section l.a.).
 On December 8, the Minister of Interior agreed to move 15 convicted ETA crimi-
 nals dispersed throughout various prisons to prisons located in or near the Basque
 region. is move was consistent with the new prison policy agreed to by the Min-
 ister of Interior and delegates from the Basque parliament human rights committee
 
 
 1301
 on November 20. The new policy is to be carried out-on a case-by-case basis and
 only upon the denunciation of ETA terrorism by each potential prisoner to be trans-
 ferred.
 The same Basque committee sent a delegation of four of its members in February
 to visit ETA prisoner Juan Lorenzo Lasa Mitxelena. He had been detained in
 France in 1985, was later extradited -to Spain, where he was accused of six murders,
 tried; and sentenced to more than 200years' imprisonment. The committee's delega-
 tion called on Mitxelena in his-capacity-as.. spokesperson for ETA prisoners to
 present-a plan approved by the committee calling, on the Government to transfer
 826 Basque prisoners, including about-550 ETA prisoners, to 14 prisons situated
 -within a 300 kilometerradius of the Basque country. The committee's p lan was re-
 jected by Mitxelena as insufficient. Mitxelena insisted that ETA wants all of its pris-
 oners brought to the four prisons in the- Basque country and Navarre.
 In September the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) rejected all the pro-
 ceedings initiated by those close to ETA against the -Government's dispersion of ETA
 prisoners to jails outside the Basque country. The Commission specifically rejected
 two complaints against the order to imprison Jon Idigoras (a member of HB) and
 one action presented by. a nongovernmental-organization, the Association for the
 -Prevention of Torture, against the policy of ,dispersion of ETA prisoners. Carlos
 Iturgaiz, the President of the Popular Party in the Basque country, reacted to the
 U.N. Commission's, decision by encouraging the political parties that had lodged
 complaints about the Government's prison policy to "withdraw any action against
 the Spanish government."
 The Government- permits visits by human rights monitors, including the Euro-
 pean Committee for the Prevention of Torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and the authorities respect these provisions in practice.
 A suspect may not be held more than 72 hours without a hearing except in cases
 involving terrorism. The Penal Code permits holding a suspected terrorist an addi-
 tional 2 days without a hearing, as well as the possibility of incommunicado deten-
 tion for such persons, provided that a judge authorizes such action. Many requests
 for extensions and incommunicado detention contain only the minimal necessary de-
 tails. The U.N. Committee Against Torture and AI, in its 1997 report, expressed
 concern over incommunicado detention and the suspension of procedural rights,
 such as the initial denial of selection of free legal counsel that antiterrorist legisla-
 tion permits.
 The law on aliens permits detention of a person for up to 40 days prior to deporta-
 tion but specifies that it must not take place in a prisonlike setting.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and the Government respects this provision in
 practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the judiciary is independent in practice.
 A group of opposition political parties plans to accuse the Government of unwar-
 ranted interference in the judiciary before a European Union tribunal. The charge
 stems from perceived government avoidance of proper procedures in the appoint-
 ment of prosecutors.
 The judicial structure consists of territorial, provincial, regional, and municipal
 courts with the Supreme Court at its apex. The Constitutional Court protects con-
 stitutional rights, but there is no clear distinction between its jurisdiction and that
 of the Supreme Court on some issues, nor is it clear which has ultimate authority.
 A National High Court handles cases involving crimes such as terrorism and drug
 trafficking. The European Court of Human Rights is the final arbiter in cases con-
 cerning human rights.
 A nine-person jury system was established in 1995, and the first cases were tried
 in 1996. In June the verdict in a jury trial was annulled for the first time. The
 Catalonian superior court of justice ordered a retrial after discovering that a mag-
 istrate had committed irregularities that ultimately affected the final outcome.
 The entire Penal Code was revised in 1996. Changes included the restructuring
 of the criminal justice system, the introduction of modern offenses and white-collar
 crimes, an increase in the penalties for fraud offenses, a rise in the legal age at
 which an individual may be tried for a criminal offense from 16 to 18 years, the
 establishment of other new offenses (including domestic violence and sexual harass-
 ment), and the authorization of judges to fine individuals with reference to their
 wealth. The new code also allows judges more flexibility in sentencing. It eliminates
 the longstanding tradition of granting credits toward early release for good behavior.
 The maximum penalty for any one offense under the new code is 25 years, and the
 maximum time a person can continuously serve is 30 years, regardless of the cumu-
 
 
 1302
 lative total of sentences. Judges can now deport foreigners sentenced to 6 years or
 less.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair public trial, and the authorities
 respect this right in practice. Defendants have the right to be represented by an at-
 torney (at state expense for the indigent). They are released on bail unless the court
 has some reason to believe that they may flee or be a threat to public safety. The
 law calls for an expeditious judicial hearing following arrest. However, the Associa-
 tion of Victims of Terrorism and others have protested delays in the judicial process.
 By law suspects may not be confined for more than 2 years before being brought
 to trial, unless a further delay is authorized by a judge, who may extend pretrial
 custody to 4 years.
 In practice pretrial custody is usually less than 1 year; however, criticism is heard
 in legal circles that some judges use preventive custody' as a form of anticipatory
 sentencing. In cases of petty crime, suspects released on bail sometimes wait up to
 5 years for trial. It is estimated that 25.8 percent of the prison population is await-
 ing trial.
 Followng conviction, defendants may appeal to the next higher court. Human
 rights groups such as the Association Against Torture and members of the press
 complain that many persons convicted of human rights offenses of have avoided ju-
 dicial sentencing by prolonging the appeals process and that their sentences are un-
 duly light. According to Amnesty International, custodial sentences of less than 1
 year and 1 day are customarily not served in such cases.
 In January the European Court of Human Rights issued its judgment in the De-
 cember 1996 case of Scott v. Spain. The plaintiff, a British citizen, was arrested on
 March 5, 1990, on suspicion of raping a Finnish woman in Puerto de la Cruz,
 Tenerife. He was kept in detention for over 4 years in connection with the rape
 charges and with a request for extradition. The court awarded the plaintiff legal
 costs and expenses.
 In June two Moroccans were acquitted on charges of rape. The judge ruled that
 DNA samples taken from the victims did not match either of the accused. Both
 maintained their innocence from the beginning and participated in several hunger
 strikes during their 5-year stay in prison.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the privacy of the home and correspondence. Under the
 Criminal Code, government authorities must obtain court approval before searching
 private property, wiretapping, or interfering with private correspondence. The
 present antiterrorist law gives discretionary authority to the Minister of Interior to
 act prior to obtaining court approval in "cases of emergency."
 Investigation continues into allegations of wiretapping by the National Intel-
 ligence Agency (CESID) of private telephone conversations made by the King, var-
 ious ministers, and other prominent figures between 1980 and 1991. The Minister
 of Defense, the Vice President, and CESID's chief resigned in 1995, after related
 government documents were leaked to the press. A judge closed the case in Feb-
 ruary 1996. However, in May 1996, a provincial court revoked that decision and or-
 derd the judge to reopen the case. Investigations continued throughout the year.
 CESID has also been linked to the investigations of GAL crimes. A judge in one
 GAL investigation found lists of CESH) documents relating to GAL in the prison
 cell of the former director of operations of CESID, which were subsequently leaked
 to the ress. Based on the lists, the judge requested 16 official secret documents
 from CESID, which allegedly contain information abeut GAL crimes. The Govern-
 ment declassffied and released 13 of the documents; the investigation continues.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. Opposi-
 tion viewpoints, both from political parties and nonpartisan organizations, are freely
 aired and widely reflected in the media.
 In September a bullfighting fan was fined $1,400 for calling the commissioner of
 the bullfight "tonto" (dumb) during a bullfight and for doing it in the presence of
 a large crowd that included King Juan Carlos. The year before the same fan was
 fined $270 for a similar outburst.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The Government treats various religions
 in different ways. Catholicism is the predominant religion and enjoys the closest of-
 
 
 1303
 ficial relationship as well as the most benefits. Jews, Muslims, and Protestants (the
 latter a confederation of many faiths) also have official status but enjoy fewer privi-
 leges. These religions have bilateral agreements with the Government. Other recog-
 nized religions, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, are covered by constitu-
 tional protections but have no special agreements with the Government. Religions
 not officially recognized, such as the Church of Scientology, are treated as cultural
 associations. There are over 15,000 Jews and 300,000 Muslims in Spain, although
 most of the latter are transient and dispersed. Religion courses are offered in pubic
 schools but are not mandatory.
 In September the Government approved $570,000 for the Catholic Church and an-
 other $100,700 for the Protestant Evangelical Council. The President announced
 that efforts were made during the year to open talks with the Jewish and Muslim
 communities so that they might be eligible for funding in the next fiscal year. The
 Jewish and Protestant groups refuse funding; the Muslims are not eligible at
 present.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel within and outside the country, to emigrate,
 and to repatriate. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. A recent asy-
 lum law (passed in 1994 and modified in 1995) brought refugee and asylum cases
 together and gave full power to adjudicate them to the Office of Asylum and Refu-
 gees (OAR), a branch of the Ministry of the Interior, but also mandates that cases
 can be referred to the UNHCR for appeal. Asylum requests can be made only at
 the point of entry, and applicants are detained until the case is resolved. Negative
 rulings must be made within 72 hours, but the asylum seeker has an additional 24
 hours in which to make an appeal. No provisions are made for detainees to have
 access to translators or lawyers. Since 1994 the revised law has caused a major drop
 in the numbers of both requests for, and grants of, asylum. During the first 6
 months of 1996, only 110 of 1,638 applications for asylum were approved and an
 additional 98 humanitarian asylum applications were approved (latest available sta-
 tistics). The were no instances of forcible repatriation of refugees during the year.
 Spain continues to face a wave of illegal immigrants coming across the strait of
 Gibraltar. In September the Ombudsman called for the urgent creation of a commit-
 tee to address immigration issues. It is estimated that more than 10,000 illegal im-
 migrants were caught in 1996, the majority in Andalucia in southern Spain. Au-
 thorities say that under "normal" circumstances they intercept no more than 30 per-
 cent of those who enter through that zone. In response, the Government is resorting
 to a mix of tighter border controls, liberalized treatment for those who have already
 established themselves in society, and increased international coordination.
 In March the police dismantled an illegal smuggling ring run by nine Polish citi-
 zens. In a single year of operation, the group was responsible for bringing in over
 2,500 Polish women to work as domestic servants. Detained in connection with the
 ring were 9 men and 16 women.
 In August and September there were several reports of accidental deaths involv-
 ing Moroccan men attempting to enter Sp ain illegally. Criminal gangs have been
 implicated in the deaths; they run smuggling rings in which would-be immigrants
 are charged enormous fares and then packed into poorly ventilated and unsafe boats
 or containers to be brought into Spanish territory.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which all citizens 18 years
 of age and over have the right to vote by secret ballot for Parliament. Elections are
 held at least ever 4 years. In the 1996 national elections, the Popular Party ended
 14 years of Socialist government, and Jose Maria Aznar became Prime Minister.
 Governmental power is shared between the central government and 17 regional
 "autonomous communities." Local nationalist parties give political expression to re-
 gional linguistic and cultural identities.
 Women are increasing their participation in the political process. The number of
 female candidates increased in the 1996 national elections, but under the electoral
 system the percentage of votes won determines the number of candidates elected
 from the party list. Many women were placed in the lower half of the list. As a con-
 sequence of this electoral system, the number of women elected has never reached
 25 percent. Women hold 19 percent of parliamentary seats. The 350-member Cham-
 ber of Deputies has 72 female representatives (22 percent of the total), and the 256-
 member Senate has 27 (10.4 percent of the total). The Ministers of Justice, Agri-
 culture, Education and Culture, and Environment are women.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding. International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation, of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of nongovernmental human rights groups, including the Human Rights
 Association of Spain in Madrid and the Human Rights Institute of Catalonia in Bar-
 celona, operate freely without government interference. The Government cooperates
 -readily with. international organizations investigating allegations of human rights
 abuses (such as the European Commission of Human Rights) and international non-
 governmental human righta groups, as well as with independent national groups.
 The Constitution -provides for an Ombudsman, called the "People's Defender", who
 actively investigates complaints of human Tights abuses by the authorities. The Or-
 budsman operates independently from any party or government ministry, must be
 elected, every 5 years byoa- three-fifths majority of congress, and is immune from
 - prosecution.- He has complete access to government institutions -and to documents
 not classified-secret for national security- reasons.
 Section 5.-Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitutionprovides for �equal rights for all citizens. The Office, of the Peo-
 ple's Defender received approximately 22,000 complaints in 1996 (latest information
 - available). While the majority of the complaints pertained to. education and social
 -services, increases were registered in complaints- of racism, domestic violence, and
 mistreatment-by law enforcement agencies.
 Women.-Sexual abuse, violence, and-harassment of women in the workplace con-
 tinued to be problems. On- December 19, the government spokesman urged victims
 - . of sexual and domestic abuse to report their cases and  promised legislative reforms.
 His announcement and subsequent- protests in Granada-and Madrid were reactions
 to the death due to domestic violence of the 60th. woman during the year. The
 deaths in 1997 total 5 less than in 1996,-15 more than in 1995, and 18 more than
 in 1994.In 1997 the mistreatment or threat of-mistreatment of women was the sub-
 ject of-18,860 complaints; in 1996 the comparable number was 16,738. Experts be-
 ieve that only 10 percent of violent acts against women are reported to authorities.
 Some nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) estimate that about 600,000 to
 800,000 cases of abuse occur each year. Almost 2,000 women were sheltered incog-
 nito during the- year. In a 1996 study in which 1,800 women were interviewed, 15
 .-percent admitted to having suffered some type of physical or sexual abuse.
 During December there were several attempts on the lives of women by their hus-
 bands. In one particularly gruesome incident, on December-17 in Granada 60-year-
 old -Ana Orantes was badly beaten, then doused with gasoline and set on fire by
 her 61-year-old ex-husband, Jose Parejo. On December 4 she had appeared on a tel-
 evision talk show and testified to 20 years of domestic abuse by her husband. On
 December 19, a 30-year-old man attempted to run over his 21-year-old wife, who
 was carrying their small child into a day care center when he drove toward them
 in the ambulance that he drove for a private ambulance company. The wife and
 child found refuge inside the day care center, at which point the husband unsuccess-
 fully attempted to break into the building. On December 19, Madrid police officials
 discovered the body of Olga Santos inside the store she owned. Santos died from
 multiple stab wounds inflicted by her ex-boyfriend, who then committed suicide.
 That same day in Isla Cristina (Huelva), 42-year-old Rafael Faneca attempted to set
 fire to his home with his wife and two young children inside.
 Various women's organizations urge reform of the Penal Code to include tougher
 .punishment for the perpetrators of domestic abuse and crime. The Federation of
 Separated and Divorced Women is pushing for modifications in the Penal Code to
 make the issuance of a restraining order automatic upon the filing of a complaint.
 The Commission for the Investigation of Mistreatment Against Women urges chang-
 ing the classification of these crimes from a petty offense to a misdemeanor ("falta"
 to "delito ") and wants complaints of abuse to be followed up by a quick and thor-
 ough judicial and police investigation. According to the Commission, the failure to
 promptly investigate a complaint, which they believe occurs frequently, results in
 the loss of important evidence. The Commission reported 724 domestic violence-re-
 lated deaths and 500 attempted murders in the last 13 years. However, between
 1989 and 1994, only 33 cases have resulted in convictions. The President of the As-
 sociation for Women, which also advocates reforming the Penal Code, believes that
 prisons "do not have sufficient capacity to hold such individuals in custody."
 Several levels of government provide assistance to battered women. A toll-free hot
 line advises women where to go for government shelter or other aid if mistreated.
 There are 54 official centers for mistreated women. The Government also runs edu-
 cational programs seeking to change public attitudes that contribute to violence
 against women. The Women's Institute has charged that some judges are reluctant
 
 
 1305
 
 to get involved'in cases of violence against women by members of their family. Simi-
 larly, in smaller towns some police officers have been reluctant to accept complaints
 from battered women. Recognizing the latter problem, the Ministry of the Interior
 initiated a program in 1986 that created special sections in most police departments
 to deal with violence against women, staffed by trained female officers.
 A 1989 law prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace, but very few cases have
 been brought to trial under this law.
 In recent years, women have moved towards equality under the law, and larger
 numbers of women are in the educational system and work force. According to the
 organization Active Population, women received 57 percent of university degrees in
 1996 (latest information available). The Minister of Social Affairs reports that
 women constitute 43 percent of the work force. However, according to the Taxation
 Agency (Agencia Tributaria) in its 1997 report "Employment, Salaries and Pensions"
 completed by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, women only occupy 18 percent of better
 paying positions. Women outnumber men in the legal, journalistic, and health care
 professions but still play minor roles in many fields.
 The law mandates equal pay for equal work. However, according to a 1997 report
 by the Economic and Social Affairs Council, women's salaries remain 27 percent
 lower than those of their male counterparts. The Council asserts that women are
 more likely to have temporary contracts or part-time employment than men. The
 National Association of Rural Women and Families (ANFAR) reported in 1995 that
 80 percent of rural women are not formally employed but instead aid their husbands
 in farming or fishing. ANFAR said that these women lack titles to family enter-
 prises and do not receive the same social security benefits as the male head of
 household. In 1997 the community of Madrid increased funding for women's organi-
 zations after cutting funding by 9 percent in 1996, which resulted in paralyzing
 more than 1,000 women's programs.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its commitment to children's welfare
 through well-funded and easily accessed programs of education and health care.
 Education is compulsory until age 16 and free until age 18. The Constitution obli-
 gates both the state and parents to protect children, whether or not born in wedlock.
 The Ministries of Health and Social Affairs are responsible for the welfare of chil-
 dren and have created numerous programs to aid needy children. Numerous NGO's
 exist to further children's rights. For example, the school help program for the pro-
 tection of children has a team of experts who work with educators to help them
 identify abused or abandoned children in the classroom.
 The 1995 Law of the Child gives legal rights of testimony to minors in child abuse
 cases; it also obliges all citizens to act on cases of suspected child abuse and, for
 the first time, sets up rules regarding foreign adoptions.
 Under the new Penal Code, children under the age of 18 are not considered re-
 sponsible for their actions and cannot be sent to prison. The seriousness of the vio-
 lent acts in the Basque country by separatist youths, however, has led to accelerated
 negotiations between the centralGovernment and the Basque government for the
 punishment of youthful offenders under the age of 18. The Attorney General's 1996
 report highlighted a 300 percent increase in youth vandalism in the Basque country
 since 1994 (latest statistic available). Public debate centered on whether the age of
 responsibility should be set as low as 12 years. However, following negotiations with
 opposition parties, the Government announced agreement in October on draft legis-
 lation that does not lower the age of responsibility.
 A 1996 penitentiary law lowers the age that a child can remain with an incarcer-
 ated mother from 6 to 3 years of age. It also provides a special unit for mothers
 with children, a kindergarten, psychological support, and ways for children to get
 out of prison regularly. At present it is estimated that 200 children live in jail with
 their mothers under this law.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution obliges the State to provide for the
 adequate treatment and care of people with disabilities, ensuring that they are not
 deprived of basic rights that apply to all citizens. Since 1982 a law on the integra-
 tion of disabled citizens has been in effect, which aims to ensure fair access to public
 employment, prevent disability, and facilitate physical accessibility topublic facili-
 ties and transportation. The national law serves as a guide for regional laws; how-
 ever, levels of assistance and accessibility differ from region to region and have not
 improved in many areas.
 The 1996 Penal Code continues to allow parents or legal representatives of a men-
 tally disabled person to petition a judge to obtain permission for the sterilization
 oft at prson. In 1994 the Constitutional Court held that sterilization of the men-
 tally infirm does not constitute a violation of the Constitution. In practice many
 courts have authorized such surgery. Religious groups continue to protest this ru-
 ing.
 
 
 1306
 In October the National Confederation for the Deaf filed a discrimination com-
 plaint against the Government for not officially recognizing sign language.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Roma, who make up 2.5 percent of the popu-
 lation, continue to suffer discrimination in housing, schools, and jobs. Since 1991 the
 Madrid city government, in cooperation with the autonomous regional government,
 has been carrying out a program to relocate squatters (the great majority of whom
 are Roma) to housing projects in the region. A University of Navarra study esti-
 mated that 12,000 squatters live in camps on the margins of Madrid, although the
 Madrid public works councilor states that there has never been a reliable census
 of squatters. The daily El Pais reported in 1996 that 16 prefabricated houses exist
 around Madrid for the squatters ("chabolistas "), with 140 more houses planned.
 The city government plans to relocate 449 of the 769 families of squatters in and
 around Madrid by 1998. Spain's largest Romani organization, Gypsy Presence, com-
 plains that the city has put up police checkpoints and fences that make Romani
 communities resemble prison camps. The     up's complaint that such relocation
 areas lack basic services is supported by NG-O's and the press. The city government
 denies any anti-Romani bias in its actions. Thirty-one illegal families destroyed
 their "houses" in 1996 so that they would not be counted in the census and forced
 to relocate.
 A language or dialect other than Castillian Spanish is used in 6 of the 17 autono-
 mous communities. The Constitution stipulates that citizens have "the duty to
 know" Castillian, which is the "official 'language of the state," but it adds that other
 languages can also. be official under regional statutes and that the "different lan-
 guage variations of Spain are a cultural heritage which shall . . . be protected."
 Catalonia has passed a law whereby Catalan is taught in- regional schools and used
 at official regional functions. Suits regarding specific applications of this law are
 -ending in various courts. Both Galicia and Valencia have laws stating the duty to
 -promote" their regional languages in schools and at official functions.
 In Bilbao 21 parents filed complaints against several summer camp counselors in
 August for punishing students because they spoke Castillian and not Euskera (the
 Basque language) in the classroom.. The punishments included carrying a backpack
 filled with. rocks and wearing a sign stating, "I am in favor of Castllian." The chil-
 dren were participants in an educational program designed to expand knowledge of
 Basque language and Basque culture.
 In 1995 Congress modified the Penal Code to make it a crime to "incite, publicize,
 or otherwise promote the abuse or discrimination of people or groups because of
 race, ethnicity, nationality, ideology, or religious beliefs." No cases have been tried
 under the modified Penal Code.
 Human rights groups and the media continued to give increasing attention to dis-
 crimination against the growing numbers of illegal immigrants from northern and
 sub-Saharan Africa. Foreign nationals of African and -Latin American origin com-
 plain of discrimination and abuse by- authorities and, more .frequently, by ordinary
 citizens. According to a 1996 study by the-Youth Institute in the Ministry of Labor
 and Social Affairs, 91 percent of. persons under the age of 29 would like to see inmi-
 gration further restricted. Although only 1.3.percent- of the population is foreign
 born, and the Government reduced-the- number of work permits issued to foreigners
 by 10 percent in 1995, 60 percent of the-respondents under.29 years old in the same
 survey, said that they believed that immigrants caused -employment problems for
 them. The Association of Moroccan Immigrant-Laborers has offices in Madrid, Bar-
 celona, and Seville to combat anti-Moroccan racism.
 In February the National High Court ruled that no constitutional violations had
 taken place when a 53-year-old black Spanish citizen was stopped for questioning
 based on the color of her skin. The woman had been stopped by two police officers
 - at a train station in December 1992. She was traveling with her son and husband,
 - both Caucasian. They were not interrogated. The police officer. justified her deten-
 tioxr on-the grounds that many people of color are illegal immigrants.
 Quasi-organized rightwing youth groups (called "skinheads" by the press) contin-
 .ued to commit violent acts throughout the year, terrorizing minorities, and in some
 instances, committing murder. National police .estimate the total number of
 skinheads to be several thousand; however, they say-that the skinheads are not or-
 Sanized to plan specific actions. The organization SOS Racismo stated that race-re-
 ated violence increased in 1996 as a result of reductions in police arrests and incar-
 cerations of skinheads.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assoiation.-Al workers, except those in the military services,
 judges, magistrates, and prosecutors, are entitled to form or join unions of their own
 choosing. All that is required to organize a trade union is that more than two work-
 
 
 1307
 ers register with the Minister of Labor and Social Security. Over 200 trade unions
 are registered and 1 is not legally registered (because the Constitutional Court ruled
 that it was ineligible, since it represents military personnel).
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to choose their representatives, de-
 termine their policies represent their members' interests, and strike. They are not
 restricted or harassed by the Government and are independent of political parties.
 A strike in nonessential services is legal if its sponsors give 5 days' notice. Any
 striking union must respect minimum service requirements negotiated with the re-
 spective employer. The right to strike has been interpreted by the Constitutional
 Court to include general strikes called to protest government policy. In 1996 the
 Labor Ministry reported 830 strikes, in which 1,078,000 workers participated, com-
 pared with 883 strikes by 569,000 workers for the same period the previous year
 (latest available statistics).
 Unions are free to form or join federations and affiliate with international bodies
 and do so without hindrance.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-A 1980 statute undergirds the
 right to organize and bargain collectively. Trade union and collective bargaining
 rights were extended in 1986 to all workers in the public sector, except military per.
 sonnel. Public sector collective bargaining in 1990 was broadened to include salaries
 and employment levels, but the Government retained the right to set these if nego-
 tiations failed. Collective bargaining agreements are widespread in both the public
 and private sectors; in the latter they cover 60 percent of workers, notwithstanding
 that only about 15 percent of workers are actually union members.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against trade union members and
 organizers. Discrimination cases have priority in the labor courts. Legislation in
 1990 gave unions a role in controlling temporary work contracts to prevent their
 abuse and in termination actions. Nonetheless, unions contend that employers dis-
 criminate in many cases by refusing to renew temporary contracts of workers engag-
 ing in union organizing. More than one-third of all employees are under temporary
 contracts, and the number is growing.
 Labor regulations and practices in free trade zones and export processing zones
 are the same as in the rest of the country. Union membership in these zones is re-
 portedly higher than the average throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding that performed by children, is outlawed and is not practiced. The legislation
 is effectively enforced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohibition effec-
 tively (see Section 6.c.). The statutory minimum age for the employment of children
 is 16 years. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security is primarily responsible for
 enforcement. The minimum age is effectively enforced in major industries and in the
 service sector. It is more difficult to control on small farms and in family-owned
 businesses. Legislation prohibiting child labor is effectively enforced in the special
 economic zones. The law also prohibits the employment of persons under the age
 of 18 at night, for overtime work, or in sectors considered hazardous.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for workers over 18
 years of age is considered sufficient for a decent standard of living. The daily na-
 tional minimum wage rate in 1997 was $14.06 (2,221 pesetas); for those 16 and 17
 years of age it was $13.88 (1,971 pesetas). These rates are revised every year in line
 with the consumer price index and are effectively enforced by the Ministry of Labor
 and Social Security. The law sets a 40-hour workweek with an unbroken rest period
 of 36 hours after each 40 hours worked. Workers enjoy 12 paid holidays a year and
 a month's paid vacation.
 Government mechanisms exist for enforcing working conditions and occupational
 health and safety rules, but bureaucratic procedures are cumbersome and ineffi-
 cient. Safety and health legislation is being revised to conform to European union
 (EU) directives. The Law to Prevent Labor Risks was passed in 1995 by Parliament
 as the foundation for the completion of the rest of the EU directives.
 The National Institute of Safety and Health in the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Security has technical responsibility for developing labor standards, but the
 Inspectorate of Labor has responsibility for enforcing the legislation through judicial
 action when infractions are found. Workers have legal protection for filing com-
 plaints about hazardous conditions.
 In November thousands of union members held protests in most major cities to
 demand the enforcement and strict application of laws mandating safe work condi-
 tions. The process of applying the laws has been slow and difficult. During the first
 6 months of the year there were 514 work-related deaths.
