 EGYPT
 Egypt is a republic in which the President and his party, the
 National Democratic Party (NDP), are the dominant political
 forces. The NDP, in power since 1978, commands large
 majorities in the two parliamentary bodies, the People's
 Assembly and the Shura (Consultative) Council; three of the
 eight legal opposition parties have some representation in the
 Parliament. The Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister, is
 appointed by and responsible to Che President. Mohammed Hosni
 Mubarakvas elected President by the People's Assembly in 1981
 and reelected to a second 6-year term in July 1987. In
 accordance with the Constitution, his reelection was affirmed
 by a popular referendum.
 The Ministry of Interior's General Directorate for State
 Security Investigations (GDSSI) is the main domestic security
 agency, although there are several other police forces. It
 enforces the state of emergency and conducts most
 investigations of domestic opponents of the Government. It has
 been implicated in many reports of torture and abuse of
 prisoners and detainees.
 Egypt has a mixed economy dominated by an inefficient public
 sector. The Government signed agreements with the
 International Monetary Fund and World Bank in May to support
 domestic economic reform calling for the reorganization or
 privatization of state-owned companies, reduction of the budget
 deficit, and letting the market determine currency and interest
 rates. Rising prices and unemployment buffeted the economy in
 1991, as incomes from tourism and worker remittances declined
 during and following the Persian Gulf War.
 Many basic human rights continued to be abused or significantly
 restricted. The main problem areas included torture of some
 detainees and the authorities' failure to punish the
 perpetrators, the widespread practice of arbitrary detention
 without due process under the state of emergency which has been
 in effect since 1981. Given the dominance of the ruling
 National Democratic Party over the People's Assembly, the Shura
 Council, local governments, the mass-media, labor, the large
 public sector, and the licensing of new political parties,
 newspapers, and private organizations, as a practical matter
 the people do not have a meaningful ability to change the
 government. Christians experienced discrimination by the
 Government and Islamic militants, women continue to face
 discrimination based on cultural traditions and some aspects of
 the law, and there are important restrictions on worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of government-instigated killings for
 political reasons in 1991; nor were there confirmed reports of
 deaths of persons in official custody.
 There continued to be instances in which the security forces
 used lethal force against Islamic extremists, who were
 sometimes armed. An estimated 8 extremists were killed in
 clashes with police in 1991, down from an estimated 52 in
 1990. Human rights observers maintain that security forces
 have become accustomed to using lethal force quickly in these
 
 
 1375
 EGYPT
 confrontations and usually do not give the warning prescribed
 by law. In February police fired plastic bullets at anti-Gulf
 War demonstrators at Cairo University, killing one student and
 injuring others. There are unconfirmed press reports that
 police may also have used lethal force to quell an anti-Coptic
 riot in a Cairo-suburb in September.
 People's Assembly Speaker Rifaat al-Mahgoub was killed while he
 was riding in a motorcade in downtown Cairo in October 1990.
 Twenty-four members of the Islamic Jihad, a violent, extremist
 group, are on trial, some in absentia, for the killing. In
 August a witness testified that the defendants killed
 al-Mahgoub by mistake, believing he was the Interior Minister.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of new disappearances in 1991, but a
 report from the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR)
 was published in July documenting the cases of three persons
 who disappeared in recent years allegedly while in police
 custody.
 The disappearance of Zakariya Al-Sayed Bakr in January 1988 was
 still unresolved. Unconfirmed reports indicate that Bakr
 reportedly ignored government warnings to curb his activities
 with the legally registered Progressive Unionist Party.
 Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Hamid Othman, 23, a medical student at
 Zagazig University, was arrested December 17, 1989, along with
 an unknown number of suspected Islamic extremists, the day
 after an attempted assassination of former Interior Minister
 Zaki Badr. In July the EOHR reported that Othman was taken to
 State Security
 headquarters in Cairo where he was tortured. The Government
 has said Othman was released from custody on December 28, 1989.
 The EOHR also reported during the year on Nasra Fathi Ibrahim,
 18, who disappeared on March 13, 1990, as she left her Cairo
 home. In September 1990, a State Security official reportedly
 informed a family lawyer that Nasra "voluntarily disappeared
 due to disagreements with her family," an allegation the family
 has denied.
 Except in the case of Othman, the Government has failed to
 answer inquiries on their fate.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture is illegal under Egyptian law, there is
 convincing evidence that it is practiced by police and security
 officers. Those guilty of torture are seldom punished. In
 August the EOHR issued a report on conditions at the Tora
 Prison complex south of Cairo. Among the abuses cited at Tora
 were: whipping and solitary confinement; the unauthorized
 removal of prisoners to another location for torture; and
 inadequate food, water, and medical treatment. The report
 alleges that contrary to prison regulations, State Security
 officials routinely transfer prisoners from Tora to State
 Security headquarters in Cairo where they are interrogated,
 tortured, and returned to Tora. In another report issued.in
 January 1992, the EOHR documented five cases in which rape and
 sexual abuse were used in 1991 as torture methods against both
 men and women by Egyptian police and security officers.
 
 
 1376
 EGYPT
 Dr. Mohamed Mandour, a doctor at Cairo's Palestine Red Crescent
 Hospital and a member of the board of directors of the EOHR,
 was arrested without charge on February 6; he was released on
 March 2 and subsequently reported that he was beaten and
 subjected to electrical shocks by security officers while in
 custody. In late 1990, three Muslim converts to Christianity
 were tortured by police (see Section 2.c.). The EOHR reported
 that al-Shadly Ebeid al-Saghir, a lawyer, was tortured while in
 detention twice in 1991; he reportedly was hung by his arms for
 long periods, subjected to electric shock, and beaten. The
 EOHR also reported that Mohamed Higazy, an Arabic language
 teacher, was arrested on August 18 by State Security officers
 who accused him of membership in an organization called Islamic
 Groups and of aiding other members of the group to travel to
 Afghdnistan; Higazy reportedly was tortured for 3 weeks at
 State Security headquarters in Dokki and 3 more weeks at State
 Security headquarters in Lazoughly.
 In July a judge ordered an investigation into allegations that
 at least seven defendants in the al-Mahgoub assassination case
 had been tortured. According to a credible source, the
 prosecuting attorneys observed "marks and injuries" on the
 bodies of the defendants when they were questioned in late 1990
 but made no attempt to discover the cause of the injuries.
 According to the same source, in the al-Mahgoub case, security
 officers mistreated the spouses of some defendants in the
 defendants' presence to obtain confessions.
 Officers convicted of torture may receive up to 10 years in
 prison, and murder charges may be brought against those
 responsible for a victim's death. Such penalties are rarely,
 if ever, imposed. In March a Cairo criminal court sentenced a
 policeman to I year at hard labor, and a State Security officer
 to 6 months at hard labor, for torturing a detainee to death in
 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary detention of government critics has been widely
 practiced under the state of emergency which has been in effect
 continuously since the October 1981 assassination of President
 Anwar Sadat. In May the People's Assembly voted to extend the
 state of emergency and the President's emergency powers until
 June 30, 1994.
 Under the Emergency Law, the Interior Minister may detain a
 person without indictment for 90 days. With a court order,
 detention may be extended for 6 months. In some cases, the
 Government has used this power to rearrest a person who has
 served time or been released by court order. In most cases,
 however, detainees are released after interrogation. An
 estimated 2,000 persons were detained for various periods under
 the Emergency Law in 1991. In July the Interior Minister said
 publicly that 700 "criminals" and 612 "political prisoners"
 were being held under the Emergency Law. It cannot be
 determined how many of these were detained for committing
 violence or other crimes and how many were held simply for
 trying to exercise freedom of speech, association, or other
 human rights.
 Under ordinary criminal procedure, arrested persons are charged
 with violations of specific laws, have the right to a judicial
 determination of the legality of arrest, and should be formally
 charged within 48 hours of arrest or be released. Arrests
 under this procedure occur openly and with warrants issued by a
 
 
 1377
 EGYPT
 district prosecutor or a judge. There is a system of bail.
 However, the regular penal code also gives the State wide
 detention powers. State prosecutors may obtain court orders to
 detain a person for 6 months, with 45-day extensions to
 complete an investigation. Prosecutors are not required to
 file an indictment, and the detainee is often released without
 explanation and without acknowledgment that "charges" have been
 dropped.
 Exile is prohibited and not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are three levels of ordinary criminal courts: Primary
 Courts, Appeals Courts, and the Court of Cassation (the final
 stage of criminal appeal). There is also a Supreme
 Constitutional Court, but its jurisdiction is limited to legal
 interpretations. It does not hear criminal appeals. There is
 no jury system. Criminal cases are heard by panels of judges.
 These trials are public.
 In addition, there are two special courts for criminal cases:
 the Court of Ethics and State Security Courts. Both have upper
 and lower division tribunals. The Court of Ethics hears cases
 falling under Law 95 of 1980, which may be brought on such
 charges as "endangering the public safety," illegally
 establishing a political party, inciting youth "to depart from
 religious values and loyalty to the fatherland," and denying
 the three "heavenly religions." In recent years, the Ethics
 Court has been relatively inactive.
 The State Security Courts have jurisdiction over more serious
 offenses, such as armed insurrection. Three judges preside
 over upper and lower division tribunals, but two military
 officers may be added by presidential decree to the upper
 division tribunal. Defendants before a State Security Court
 may be indicted under the Penal Code or the Emergency Law.
 When the indictment is under the Penal Code, the appeal goes
 from the lower division to the upper division to the Court of
 Cassation. When an indictment is handed down under the
 Emergency Law, the court is designated an Emergency State
 Security Court. The only appeal from the upper division of an
 Emergency State Security Court is to the President, who may
 amend, commute, or cancel a sentence, or order a retrial. His
 powers imply that he may cancel an acquittal and order a
 defendant retried for the same offense.
 There are several recent precedents in which the Prime
 Minister, acting on powers delegated fiom the President,
 refused to ratify acquittals from Emergency State Security
 Courts and ordered the defendants retried. One case involved
 156 persons acquitted of charges related to Egypt's 1977 bread
 riots. In October 1990, the Prime Minister refused to sign the
 acquittal and ordered the defendants retried. When the case
 went back to court in January 1991, the prosecution was .granted
 its request to delay the case indefinitely.
 However, a person may be tried in both the Ethics Court and a
 State Security Court on similar indictments: the latter court
 metes out imprisonment as a penalty, whereas guilt before the
 Ethics Court denies the person the right to engage in certain
 occupations or activities. If the courts reach different
 verdicts, the defendant may appeal to the President fot a
 pardon.
 
 
 1378
 EGYPT
 The President appoints all judges based on nominations from the
 Higher Judicial Council, a constitutional body designed to
 ensure the independence of the judiciary. The Council is
 composed of senior judges, lawyers, and law professors, and is
 chaired, by the President of the Court of Cassation. It
 regulates judicial promotions, salaries, transfers, and
 disciplinary actions. Judges may be appointed as prosecutors
 and vice versa.
 The judiciary maintains considerable independence from the
 executive branch. State Security Court judges have ordered
 inquests into torture allegations and have acquitted defendants
 in cases in which torture was used to extract confessions. In
 1990 the Supreme Constitutional Court overturned the electoral,
 law (for discriminating against independent candidates) and
 ordered the People's Assembly, elected under the old law,
 dissolved.
 There are also limitations on judicial independence and due
 process: the Ethics Court allows nonjurists to try cases; the
 President may appoint military judges to the State Security
 Courts; there is no judicial appeal from an Emergency State
 Security Court; there is the possibility of double jeopardy if
 the President orders a defendant retried; and the Emergency Law
 authorizes a detainee's rearrest, without formal charge, even
 if he has been freed by court order.
 There are no reliable statistics on the nmiber of political
 prisoners, but, as noted in Section 1.d., the Interior Minister
 acknowledged in July that 612 were being held under the
 Emergency Law on charges involving political activities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Despite constitutional provisions, there is substantial
 abridgement, under the Emergency Law, of the right to privacy.
 Under the Constitution, homes, correspondence, telephone calls,
 and "other means of communication shall have their own sanctity
 and their secrecy shall be guaranteed." Under the penal code,
 police must obtain a warrant, either from a judge or the public
 prosecutor, before undertaking searches and wiretaps. Courts
 have dismissed cases in which warrants were issued without
 sufficient cause. Police officials who conduct searches
 without proper warrants are subject to criminal penalties,
 although this is seldom enforced.
 However, the Emergency Law empowers the State to search persons
 or places without regard to constitutional and legal
 restrictions. Intelligence agencies frequently place political
 activists and suspected subversives under surveillance, and
 there are credible reports that they routinely screen
 correspondence, especially international mail. Opposition
 newspapers occasionally report that police illegally search and
 confiscate materials from their reporters.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Egyptians openly express their views without fear of
 retribution on a wide variety of political and social issues,
 sometimes airing vigorous criticism of the Government. The
 Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press,
 
 
 1379
 EGYPT
 and the Government has to a large extent refrained from
 curtailing political expression. However, there are
 restrictions.
 The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are often targets for
 criticism, but the Press Law stipulates fines or imprisonment
 for criticism of the President or a foreign head of state. In
 recent years, however, opposition journalists have criticized
 the President without harassment, although he may not be
 satirized in cartoons.
 The major national dailies are government owned. Their editors
 in chief are appointed by the presidency and can be dismissed
 by the NDP-dominated Shura Council. They follow closely the
 Government's line and downplay or avoid Egyptian human rights
 issues, sectarian strife, or other controversial themes.
 Privately owned newspapers are free to publish material
 supporting the political inclinations of their sponsoring
 organizations.
 Opposition newspapers are all associated with political
 parties. With the exception of "Al-Wafd," most are weeklies
 with small circulations. However, they frequently publish
 tough criticisms of government policies, which in turn inspire
 rejoinders in the "establishment" press. They also give
 greater prominence to human rights abuses in Egypt than
 state-run newspapers, although Islamic newspapers tend to be
 interested in such abuses only when suffered by
 fundamentalists.
 The Government influences the press in several ways. The
 Prosecutor General from time to time imposes bans on certain
 topics; in the past, such topics have included cases involving
 charges of corruption, the Egypt Revolution case, and political
 assassinations. These bans, however, are infrequent and used
 only during criminal investigations.
 Press content is also affected by the Shura Council, which
 supervises the press to some extent through the Higher Press
 Council, a 45-member body chaired by the Speaker of the Shura
 Council and cbmposed of senior press figures. One of the
 Higher Press Council's functions is to approve applications for
 new publications. The Government firmly controls the right to
 publish and in 1991 approved the applications for 48
 newspapers, magazines, and periodicals. The Council's
 approval, however, is only required for publications appearing
 regularly.
 In December 1990, the Government banned NOON, an in-house
 newsletter of the feminist Arab Women's Solidarity Association
 (AWSA), for allegedly printing articles on political issues, a
 prohibited activity. The Government earlier had banned NOON as
 a magazine, forcing AWSA to change its format to a newsletter.
 Radio and television are state owned, as is the Arabic-language
 news service, and hence follow government directives closely.
 The Cable News Network (CNN) began local broadcasting in
 November, and the state monopoly on broadcasting is gradually
 being weakened, particularly in urban areas, by the
 availability of satellite dishes, which bring international
 news and entertainment to a growing number of Egyptians.
 Books and works of art may be confiscated or banned by decree
 of various ministries without a court order. The Ministry of
 Interior regularly confiscates works by fundamentalist authors;
 
 
 1380
 EGYPT
 the Ministry of Defense may ban works about sensitive security
 issues and prosecute their authors; and plays and films must
 pass Ministry of Culture censorship tests both as scripts and
 as prepared for final production. The Ministry of Culture also
 censors foreign films but is more lenient when these are in
 video form. Television productions are censored by the
 Ministry of Information.
 Al-Azhar University censors the publication of the Koran and
 Islamic scriptural texts in Egypt. In recent years, the
 University also has begun to pass judgment on the suitability
 of nonreligious books and artistic productions. Although these
 pronouncements do not have the force of law, authorities move
 quickly to confiscate works Al-Azhar finds offensive.
 In December, acting on a recommendation of Al-Azhar University,
 the Cairo Supreme State Security (Emergency) Court sentenced
 author Alaa Hamed and publisher Mohammed Madbouli to 8 years
 imprisonment for the publication of Hamed's novel "A Distance
 in a Man's Mind" in March 1988. The two were tried and
 convicted of violating Article 98 of the Penal Code by
 "degrading or disdaining one of the holy religions.. .with the
 intention of harming national unity and social peace..."  The
 defendants were released on bail pending the verdict's review
 by Prime Minister Atef Sedky, as provided under the Emergency
 Law.
 On two occasions in 1991, after the outbreak of the Gulf War
 and at the opening of the Arab-Israel peace talks in Madrid,
 the Government arrested journalists, political figures,
 students, and others who attempted to publicize their
 opposition in an organized manner to government policy
 concerning these events. Most were released. At year's end,
 however, scores of mostly fundamentalist students were still
 reported in detention for their public opposition to the
 Arab/Israeli peace talks.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are substantial restrictions on this freedom. Under the
 Emergency Law, the Minister of the Interior's approval is
 required for public meetings, rallies, and protest marches.
 Permits are generally granted for indoor rallies, but street
 demonstrations are banned, except on university campuses. The
 Ministry of Social Affairs has legal authority to license and
 dissolve nongovernmental organizations (NGO's). Licenses may
 be revoked if an NGO engages in political or religious
 activities that are prohibited. The law also authorizes the
 Ministry to "merge two or more associations to achieve a
 similar function," a provision the State can use to merge an
 undesirable organization out of existence.
 In June, for example, the Ministry dissolved the 500-member
 AWSA, founded in 1985 by noted feminist author, Nawal Saadawi,
 on the grounds that it allegedly misused funds and engaged in
 unauthorized political activities. Among the alleged illegal
 activities were AWSA's expression of solidarity with the women
 -of Iraq during the Persian Gulf crisis and a seminar on
 Egyptian divorce law. After ordering AWSA dissolved, the
 Ministry of Social Affairs ordered its assets liquidated and
 the proceeds transferred to the state-approved women's group,
 Women in Islam. AWSA is seeking a court reversal of the
 dissolution decree.
 
 
 1381
 EGYPT
 Since 1985, the Government has refused to license the EOHR and
 the Arab Organization for Human Rights (AOHR) on the grounds
 that they are political organizations. Both organizations
 continue to operate openly from the same Cairo office. EOHR
 lawyers visit prisons and collect information from government
 offices, but only as individuals, not as EOHR representatives.
 Both organizations are challenging their legal status in the
 courts, claiming that the 1964 law governing associations is
 unconstitutional.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution guarantees "the freedom of belief"
 and the practice of religious rites, there are some important
 restrictions. Most Egyptians are Muslim and the Constitution
 establishes Islam as the state religion. Approximately 10 per
 cent of the population, 5 million people, belong to the Coptic
 Orthodox Church. There are also smaller Protestant and
 Christian evangelical denominations. The small Jewish
 community practices its religion without harassment. Members
 of recognized religions maintain links with coreligionists
 abroad, and the foreign clergy.generally pursue their
 ministries without harassment. All recognized faiths may, in
 principle, establish places of worship, run schools, and train
 enough clergy to serve believers.
 Islam accepts Christian and other converts, but Muslims face
 legal problems and social pressure if they convert to another
 religious faith. There is no clear legal prohibition against
 conversion or proselytizing, but Article 98f of the Penal*Code
 prohibits any person from "degrading or disdaining one of the
 holy religions or any of its religious sects" with "the
 intention of harming national unity and social peace." This
 has been interpreted specifically to discourage Muslim
 conversions. Conviction is punishable by imprisonment.
 Egyptian courts have upheld the principle that Muslims may not
 change their identity papers to reflect conversion to a new
 religion.
 In September and October 1990, security forces arrested three
 Muslim converts to Christianity for allegedly "insulting a
 heavenly religion" and "forging" identification papers to
 reflect their new faith. The three were tortured by state
 security officers, purportedly to obtain information on other
 converts and to force them to recant their own conversions.
 The case attracted international attention. 'The three were
 released on July 13 without explanation. Arrests of Muslim
 converts to Christianity have occurred episodically in recent
 years.
 According to a still current 1856 Ottoman decree, non-Muslims
 must obtain a presidential decree to build or repair a place of
 worship. Copts maintain they are frequently unable to obtain
 such authorization and, as a result, some communities use
 private-buildings and apartments for religious services. In
 1991 the police closed several such unlicensed "churches." In
 June the press began to focus on this issue as the Copts and
 Muslim moderates advanced arguments for legislative reform.
 Islamic fundamentalists have defended the building restrictions.
 In the IG years from January 1981 to December 1990, Copts
 obtained only 36 church permits--10 to build new churches and
 26 for other purposes, such as to repair an existing church.
 Forty-four permits were granted to other Christian sects. In
 the first 6 months of 1991, the presidency issued six permits,
 
 
 1382
 EGYPT
 of which the Copts received two, one for repairs, and one to
 build an office.
 Even with a permit, Copts often .encounter difficulties starting
 construction. A church may not be built near a mosque, but a
 mosque may be built near a church; reportedly when
 fundamentalists hear a new church will be built, they convert
 property near the site into a mosque, which means the Christian
 parishioners must find a new location. Unauthorized mosques,
 built without government permission, are common in Egypt.
 The penal code prohibits a place of worship to be used for
 antigovernment speeches. The Ministry of Religious Affairs
 appoints Muslim preachers and monitors sermons at mosques, but-
 in practice the Ministry cannot control all sermons, especially
 at "unauthorized" mosques.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Egyptians are free to travel within Egypt except in certain
 military districts, and there are other restricted areas to
 which foreigners may not travel. There are exceptions to
 freedom of foreign travel and emigration. These affect men who
 have not completed compulsory military service (although the
 stipulation is often circumvented) and women who must have
 permission from either their fathers, if unmarried and under 21
 years of age, or their husbands, if married, to obtain a
 passport.
 There is also an unconfirmed report of a Christian convert from
 Islam who was denied permission to travel abroad by the
 Interior Ministry under article no. 7153 of the Emergency
 Supreme State Security law of March 17, 1989, because, as a
 convert, he is "without civil rights." Citizens who leave the
 country have the right to return, and millions of Egyptians
 work abroad and move in and out of the country freely.
 The deportation of Egyptian citizens and aliens granted
 political asylum is prohibited and not practiced. Egypt is
 host to thousands of African and Arab refugees, but only a few,
 screened on an individual basis, are granted the right to
 resettle permanently. Many Ethiopians and other Africans, who
 seek documentation as refugees by the U.N. High Commissioner
 for Refugees, are instead detained by the police, and then
 transported to areas near the Libyan or Sudanese borders where
 they are released. Some return to their own countries; others
 find their way back to Egyptian cities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) dominates the
 People's Assembly, the Shura Council, local governments, the
 mass media, labor, the large public sector, and the licensing
 of new political parties, newspapers, and private organizations
 to such an extent that, as a practical matter, the people do
 not have a meaningful ability to change the government.
 In the 1990 People's Assembly election, NDP candidates won 383
 seats of 444 elected, independents (most of whom had been NDP
 Assembly members but were denied party support) 55, and a
 leftist party 6. Seven opposition parties boycotted the
 election. The Constitution reserves 10 Assembly seats for
 
 
 1383
 EGYPT
 presidential appointees, which generally assures some
 representation for Copts and women.
 Women were granted suffrage in 1956. Ten women hold Assembly
 seats: seven elected and three appointed. This is a decrease
 from the 39 women in the 1984 Assembly when the now repealed
 electoral law reserved 30 seats for women. Six Copts sit in
 the Assembly: five appointed and one elected. This is a
 decrease from the 11 Copts in the previous Assembly.
 The Assembly vigorously debates government proposals,
 especially on economic issues, and members exercise their
 authority to call on Cabinet ministers to explain policy and
 government-proposed legislation. However, much governance in
 Egypt is by ministerial decree without significant legislative
 oversight. Presidential appointments do not require
 legislative approval; the executive initiates most legislation;
 the Assembly may not modify the budget "except with the
 approval of the government"; there is no recent record of
 Assembly defeat of a major executive proposal; there is little
 oversight of the Interior Ministry's use of Emergency Law
 powers; and the military budget is prepared by the executive
 and not debated publicly.
 Moreover, Assembly votes and committee membership (except for
 the chairman and vice-chairman) are not matters of public
 record. Consequently, constituents have no independent method
 of checking a member's voting record.
 The Government's licensing power over newspapers, private
 organizations, political parties, and even the recognition of a
 single trade union federation discourages political pluralism.
 New parties-must be approved by a government committee. The
 eight opposition parties, the newest approved in April 1990, do
 not threaten NDP dominance. The NDP's ability to dispense
 material and career rewards has in part prevented opposition
 parties from playing a larger political role.
 To form a party without a license is a felony which may be
 tried before the Court of Ethics or a State Security Court.
 The Constitution also prohibits parties based on religion.
 Nevertheless, Muslim Brotherhood partisans are publicly known
 and openly speak their views. Some serve in the Assembly,
 elected as members of other recognized parties or as
 independents not affiliated with any party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human-Rights
 As noted in Section 2.c., the Government refuses to grant
 licenses to local human rights organizations on the grounds
 that they are political organizations. The EOHR and the AOHR
 nevertheless operate openly without benefit of licenses. In
 its 1990 annual report, EOHR said it "has not received any kind
 of cooperation from the authorities, but rather (its) lawyers
 were occasionally exposed to provocations and threats, with
 some of them being called in for questioning by the State
 Security Intelligence Service."
 In the past, the Government has received several visits from
 international human rights groups, while refusing to receive
 others. There were no known requests for visits in 1991.
 
 
 1384
 EGYPT
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Egyptian law provides for equality of the sexes, but aspects of
 the law and many traditional practices are discriminatory
 against women. Under Egyptian law, a married woman must have
 her husband's permission to obtain a passport, and he may stop
 her from traveling. A child must have the father's permission
 to obtain a passport, and even if the parents are divorced and
 the mother has custody, the child's mother need not be informed
 if the child travels outside of Egypt. Only males can transmit
 Egyptian citizcnship. In rare cases, this means children of
 Egyptian mothers and stateless fathers are themselves stateless.
 Religious laws affecting marriage and personal status generally
 correspond to the religion of the person involved, which for
 most Egyptians is Islam. However, the revised Family Status
 Law of 1985 amplified the legal basis for equality of the sexes
 beyond rights contained in Islamic law. It largely ensures a
 woman's right to divorce and preserves the wife's child custody
 and property rights. A second marriage by the husband
 (multiple marriage for men is acceptable practice in Islam) is
 grounds for the first wife to seek a divorce. A wife has the
 option of retaining the family residence or receiving financial
 compensation. These aspects of the family status law only
 apply to Muslims. Under Islamic law, female heirs are entitled
 to half the amount of a male heir's inheritance. However, only
 male heirs have a duty to provide for all members of the family
 who need assistance.
 Egyptian women have employment opportunities in government,
 medicine, law, academia, the arts, and, to a lesser degree, in
 business. Eleven percent of the diplomatic service, about 100
 officers, are women, and 3 are ambassadors. Women have entered
 politics and serve in the People's Assembly. The single female
 cabinet member has served since 1978.
 However, social pressure against careerism is still strong, and
 some Egyptian feminists say that fundamentalism has introduced
 a new conservative trend which limits further career gains.
 Women's rights advocates also believe that traditional
 attitudes and practices regarding female circumcision, Islamic
 practices on divorce and plural marriages, and the male
 responsibility to punish a female relative's presumed violation
 of sexual conduct, are highly discriminatory against women.
 Although violence against women is known to occur, little is
 known about its extent. There are no reliable statistics on
 the subject. Abuse within the family is seldom discussed
 publicly owing to the value attached to personal privacy in
 this traditional society.
 Reliable statistics.are not available on female circumcision.
 Surveys indicate that, while its use is lower in urban areas,
 the less extreme form of excision/circumcision is widely used
 in rural-Egypt. In some parts of upper Egypt the more drastic
 infibulation is still practiced. While it is not against
 Egyptian law, the law prohibits doctors from performing it in
 government hospitals.
 Egypt's approximately 5 million Coptic Christians are the
 object of a disturbing pattern of discrimination on the part of
 the Government and Islamic, extremists. Security forces arrest
 extremists who perpetrate violence against Copts, but the
 
 
 1385
 EGYPT
 Government does little to correct nonviolent acts of
 discrimination, including its own.
 Copts work in all career fields, occupying many leadership
 positions in the business and professional communities. Copts
 also continue to enjoy access to public employment, although
 there appears to be discrimination against their advancement in.-
 the governmental and public sectors. There are no Coptic
 governors or active duty generals, and few Copts in the senior
 diplomatic service. There are six in the Assembly. The sole
 Copt member of the Cabinet resigned in December to become
 Secretary General of the United Nations.
 Some Copts allege that they are discriminated against in
 admission to some fields of medical study; Islamic activists
 have objected to the prevalence of Copts in the medical
 profession, arguing that Muslim women should not be treated by
 Coptic doctors or go to Coptic pharmacists. Anti-Coptic acts,
 such as the burning of Coptic churches and Coptic-owned stores,
 are reported regularly in the press.
 Other governmental discriminatory practices are: suspected
 statistical underrepresentation of the size of the Coptic
 minority; governmental red tape on issuing permits to build or
 repair churches; the detention and mistreatment of some Muslim
 converts to Christianity; the prohibition against Muslims
 changing their identity papers to reflect their conversion to
 Christianity (upheld in a 1980 court decision); the use of the
 Koran as an Arabic teaching aid; and underrepresentation in
 government.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Egyptian workers are free to join trade unions, but are not
 required to do so. A union local, or worker's committee, may
 be formed if 50 employees express their desire to organize.
 Most union members, about 25 percent of the labor force, work
 in state-owned enterprises. Law 35 of 1976 states that a union
 may not be formed by "persons employed in high administrative
 positions in government, local administration, public
 companies, and public authorities." Private companies
 generally have nonunion workers.
 There are 23 trade unions, all required to belong to the
 Egyptian Trade Union Federatign (ETUF), the sole legal labor
 federation. The International Labor Organization's Committee
 of Experts (COE) has long noted that the law requiring all
 national trade unions to join a single federation infringes
 upon workers' freedom of association. The Government has shown
 no sign that it intends to accept the establishment of more
 than one federation. The leadership of the Federation asserts
 that it actively promotes workers' interests and that there is
 no need for another federation. The ETUF is dominated by the
 NDP and works in close concert with the Government.
 Strikes are illegal, and strikers may receive up to 2 years in
 jail. Those who incite others to strike may receive more
 severe penalties. A 1977 law stipulates hard labor for
 strikers in key industries who pose a "threat to the national
 economy." In the past, police have used lethal force to break
 up strikes at state-run companies, after which the Government
 has forcibly relocated strikers to new jobs in different parts
 
 
 1386
 EGYPT
 of the country. Strikes occurring in 1991 were brief,
 isolated, and quickly broken up by the police.
 The COE also criticized provisions of the-law which provide for
 imposition of compulsory arbitration at the request of one
 party only and the power granted the Public Prosecutor to
 remove from office the executive committee of a trade union
 that provokes a strike, even in nonessential services.
 The ETUF is a member of some international trade union
 organizations and maintains relations with others.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is permitted in the private sector,
 including in the export processing zones, but is rarely
 exercised, in part because the larger private businesses offer
 high wages and are not unionized.
 Collective bargaining does not exist in the public sector.
 Unions may negotiate work contracts with state-run businesses,
 but they must be approved by the Ministry of Labor. The
 Government sets wages, benefits, and many prices by
 administrative decree. Labor and management are obliged to
 conform to national development priorities.
 The law prohibits employer discrimination against union
 members, and a mechanism exists to resolve labor-management
 complaints.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor, and it is not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 12. Education is compulsory
 until age 15. The minimum age to join a labor union is also
 15. The labor-law of 1981 says children 12 to 15 may work 6
 hours a day, but not after 7 p.m. and not in dangerous work or
 heavy labor. Child workers must obtain medical certificates
 and work permits before they are employed. A 1989 study
 estimated that two-thirds of child labor, perhaps 720,000
 children, work on farms. However, children also work as
 apprentices in repair and craft shops and as workers in heavier
 industries such as brickmaking and textiles. How closely the
 Ministry'of Labor tries to enforce child labor laws, especially
 in small, mainly family-owned shops, is impossible to verify,
 but it appears that no effective attempt is made to enforce
 them.
 e. Acceptable-Conditions of Work
 For government and public sector employees, the minimum wage
 for the legal 6-day, 48-hour week is determined by a
 combination of law and presidential decree. The minimum wage
 is also legally binding on the private sector, and larger
 private companies generally observe the requirement and pay the
 bonus as well. It is doubtful that smaller private businesses
 comply with the minimum wage or maintain regular social bonus
 payments.
 The base pay is supplemented by a complex system of fringe
 benefits and bonuses that may double or triple a worker's
 
 
 1387
 EGYPT
 take-home pay. It is doubtful the average family could survive
 on a worker's base pay at the minimum wage rate.
 Low pay scales in the public sector are partially offset by
 relatively generous fringe benefits. These include guaranteed
 life-time employment, subsidized housing, free medical care,
 sick leave, and paid annual leave. Low pay, however, drives
 many Egyptians to hold two jobs, while others seek employment
 abroad, knowing they have reemployment rights when they return
 to their jobs in state enterprises.
 The Ministry of L-bor sets worker health and safety standards
 which also apply to private companies in the export zones, but
 enforcement and inspection are uneven.
