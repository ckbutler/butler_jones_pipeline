 COMOROS*
 The Federal and Islamic Republic of Comoros is a federation of
 three small islands of the Comoran archipelago. The republic
 lays claim as well to the fourth island in the archipelago,
 Mayotte, which at the time of independence voted to remain a
 French territory. A Constitution adopted by referendum in 1978
 provided for a federal system with elected Governors for each
 island and an elected Presidency. However, recent constitutional
 amendments significantly strengthen the position of President
 Ahmed Abdallah, who took power in a mercenary-led overthrow of
 the repressive, xenophobic regime of Ali Soilih. Constitutional
 revisions during the past year gave the President power to
 appoint Governors at the end of their current terms in December
 1983. The legislature also lifted the ban on political parties,
 but established only a single legal party, the United progress
 Party. According to new legislation, any citizen will be
 entitled to run for the Presidential elections in the fall of
 1984. In elections held since the Constitution was established,
 only the President, who ran unopposed, won by an overwhelming
 majority (99 percent). For other offices, a majority vote of
 60 percent is considered a strong mandate.
 A small mercenary force leads and trains the Presidential Guard,
 the best-equipped security force on the island. French technical
 assistance is establishing a small defense force and a gendar-
 merie. Each island administration has as well a local police
 force which is generally untrained and seldom paid.
 Newly independent, always poor, the Comoros has only a rudimen-
 tary institutional framework. Outside the major towns, tradi-
 tional village life guides all social conduct. There are no
 industries, no deepwater ports, and a limited highway and
 communications infrastructure.
 Agriculture remains the basis of economic activity, but with a
 population of 450,000 that will double by the year 2000, the
 Comoros is approaching full utilization of arable land. Exports
 of copra, vanilla, essence of ylang ylang, and cloves do not
 nearly cover necessary imports. The Comoros is part of the
 Francophone Africa Monetary Zone and depends heavily on France for
 budget support and technical assistance. Products of a conserva-
 tive Islamic society, Comoran leaders do not accept the full
 range of civil and political liberties. However, they do not
 exercise authority in a repressive fashion. Traditional mecha-
 nisms of communication between the people and government
 remove many of the negative elements of the lack of a more formal
 political process. Village notables and religious leaders domi-
 nate local politics while three major families, of which the
 President's is one, hold a lion's share of import/export busi-
 ness. Farming on small landholdings and small-scale commerce
 make up the daily activity for most of the population.
 The Government of Comoros has had five years of political stabil-
 ity. The security apparatus is increasingly manned by Comorans
 who are replacing foreign elements. Legislative elections in the
 spring of 1982 involved a large degree of local participation,

 vigorous contests for elective office, and elections that were
 open and well managed. Economic prospects are bleak, but the
 Government's policies have obtained French aid and technical
 assistance and South African investment that provide some eco-
 nomic reprieve. Gradual codification of the laws and training of
 jurists point toward a more modern legal system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 No instances of unlawful or arbitrary deprivation of life were
 reported in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances or abductions in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Federal Constitution guarantees the liberty and security of
 each individual. Penal discipline is very lax. Prisoners are
 released daily for prayers and work. Families provide them with
 their regular meals. No instances of torture, cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading punishment were reported in 1983.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although about 20 officials associated with the Ali Soilih regime
 Oere held without trial from 1978-80, 14 of these were tried in
 1980 receiving sentences from life imprisonment to six months
 incarceration. Others have been gradually released. According to
 the Government, the last political prisoners were released in the
 spring of 1983. This has not been confirmed by independent
 sources.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for the equality of all citizens before
 the law and the right of all accused to defense. The judiciary
 is independent, and trials are public. The present penal code is
 inherited from French colonial days. A new code is being drafted.
 Other than the special court to try members of the Ali Soilih
 regime, the criminal court has not held session in several years.
 Most disputes are settled under traditional law by village
 notables. Other civil cases are brought to the courts of first
 instance on the respective islands.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution protects the inviolability of home and property.
 There were no known cases of arbitary interference with privacy
 on the part of the Government. In the context of Comoran
 society, many aspects of private and family life are subject to
 societal influences.
 
 
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The islands have no newspaper even though there are small print-
 ing establishments. Foreign journals and newspapers are readily
 available. The only local news media is the government radio
 station which sometimes skips over news broadcasts because there
 is no news worth covering.
 Comorans do discuss and criticize their Government in public and
 private. But in these small islands, traditional pressures to
 conformity are great and opposition is not highly vocal or
 strident.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are limits to the right of assembly and association. The
 only legal political activity allowed is within the United
 Progress Party. However, social occasions like the great Comoran
 wedding ceremonies can involve political discussions, as the
 faithful gather around clan leaders. There were no reports of
 public gatherings being forbidden in 1983. Government officials
 addressed issues of public policy at public gatherings. Although
 the right to strike is guaranteed, wage labor is scarce in the
 Comoros and unions hardly organized. The desire for scarce jobs
 is a restraint on labor complaints. In the public sector a year
 ago, the Government broke a teachers strike by hiring new
 teachers. Hospital workers reportedly struck in late 1983 to
 claim unpaid wages.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 According to the Constitution, Islam is the "wellspring of the
 principles and rules which guide the state and its institutions.'
 However, freedom to practice one's religious faith is respected.
 Believers and nonbelievers have equal rights. There are estab-
 lished Protestant and Catholic Churches. Islam is present in
 both Orthodox Sunni and Ismaili forms. There are Christian
 missionaries working in local hospitals and schools, but they
 are not allowed to actively propagate their faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement in and out of Comoros for both
 citizens and foreigners. There is an exile community which
 opposes the Government. The Government has accepted the return
 of some without apparent retaliation, while others have been held
 for a time.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 President Ahmed Abdallah dominates the present Government. He
 was overwhelmingly elected to his current term in office, ih an
 election in which he was the only candidate. He apparently
 enjoys widespread support. He holds in the Presidential Guard
 the only reliable security force in the Comoros, and has both
 wealth and tradition buttressing his regime. He appoints
 ministers and soon will appoint Governors. The ministers of
 Abdallah's administration tend to remain the same but shift
 amongst themselves the few existing portfolios.

 Behind this facade of stability, leading notables vie for recog-
 nition and influence. Competing factions vied for election
 within the framework of the one-party system. Most contests went
 into second-round voting and the legislature now has several new
 members. Governorships were similarly contested but will no
 longer be. While by law the Presidential campaign is open to
 anyone who wishes to present his candidacy, it is not yet clear
 if the creation of a single legal party will restrict candidates
 for the legislature to a single slate.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Comoros accepted a visit from Amnesty International in 1981,
 but there is no indication of more recent human rights visits by
 international organizations. In 1983, Amnesty International was
 concerned about the political trials which took place in January
 and May 1982 which did not conform to internationally recognized
 standards. Freedom House rates Comoros "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Comoros is a small, poor, traditional island society. The
 constitutional deference to Islam is but formalization of the
 commitment of most Comorans to an Islamic world view.
 This commitment, reinforced by two years of unfortunate experience
 with a lay Socialist regime under Ali Soilih, have set Comorans
 in opposition to Socialist options. This is particularly true of
 the older generation, which once again controls wealth and wields
 influence. The Comorans are committed essentially to traditional
 Islamic views, which include tolerance for other religions,
 equality of Muslims before Allah, and an uncontrolled marketplace.
 At the same time the society is hierarchical with authority based
 on inheritance, age, and wealth or religious leadership.
 Within this society men have the dominant role. At traditional
 ceremonies and social gatherings, sexes are separated. Yet women
 are neither veiled nor prohibited from holding jobs. The Comoran
 institution of "grand marriage," in which a groom who has the
 means will spend from $10,000 to $20,000 for a wedding ceremony
 and gifts to his bride, gives women, particularly of the upper
 class, a special position in Comoran society. Women participate
 actively in political discussions, manage stores and companies,
 and travel independently abroad on private or government business.
 They send their daughters for higher education abroad, thus
 perpetuating the elevated status of higher class women in the next
 generation. Women on Grand Comore have on their own initiative
 started a highly profitable truck garden cooperative which sup-
 plies a large part of the produce in the local markets. Women
 have the right to participate in the political process, but
 tradition discourages the exercise of that right.
 Economic prospects for the Comoros are dim. The population is
 growing at a rate of 2.8 percent per year, and most arable land is
 already being cultivated. There are no prospects for industrial-
 ization. Significant efforts in education since the mid-1970's
 made primary education nearly universal for males and up to 83
 percent for girls. Secondary school graduates have doubled in
 three years. There are no jobs for these graduates, and the
 specter of an unemployed population of restless semieducated

 youths overshadows the seemingly stable traditional government of
 elders who now rule the Comoros.
 Markets for Comoros' tropical cash crops are fragile and dwin-
 dling. The current per capita gross national product of $330 is
 almost certain to decrease as export levels stagnate and popula-
 tion grows. An abundance of tropical fruits and fish keep the
 population from serious malnutrition. Calorie supply is 81
 percent of requirements. Maj6r food commodities like rice must be
 imported. Long-term international help in the form of food aid
 and technical assistance seems necessary in the foreseeable future
 for the Comoros. The leadership is hoping that new technical
 training programs will prepare youth for off-island jobs.
