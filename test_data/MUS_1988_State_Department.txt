 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius is a small, densely populated island nation with a
 functioning parliamentary democracy modeled after that of
 Great Britain. It is governed by a prime minister, council of
 ministers, and legislative assembly. The Governor General,
 with largely ceremonial powers, represents Queen Elizabeth II,
 the titular Head of State. Elections at national'and local
 levels take place at regular intervals. There are four major
 political parties, reflecting a wide range of ideological
 views, and several smaller parties. Executive power has
 changed hands twice in the last 7 years through fair and
 orderly elections supervised by an independent commission.
 Municipal elections in October 1988 renewed the main
 opposition party's control of the five largest cities. Prime
 Minister Jugnauth's coalition had its mandate renewed in
 general elections in August 1987.
 Mauritius has no military forces and depends on the
 paramilitary 700-man Special Mobile Force and the 240-man
 Special Support Unit for internal security. These forces,
 under the command of the Commissioner of Police, are
 apolitical, well-trained, and backed by a general duty police
 force of approximately 4,000 men.
 Mauritius has a mixed economy, based on sugar production,
 tourism, and textiles, with a strong private sector. In 1988
 the economy continued its growth, registering an estimated 5-7
 percent growth rate and creating some 12,000 jobs. The World
 Bank estimates Mauritian gross national product per capita at
 $1,470. Mauritius has followed a successful path of
 structural adjustment with private sector stimulation,
 especially in furthering exports through its free trade zone.
 Gross domestic product has grown from $991 million in 1985 to
 $1.5 billion in 1988. Unemployment has dropped from 22
 percent in 1982 to 4 percent currently.
 Mauritius has a good human rights record. Political and civil
 rights, including the freedoms of speech and press, are
 protected under the Constitutign and respected in practice.
 Mauritius' judiciary is independent, the legislature plays an
 increasingly active role in shaping national policy, religious
 freedom is respected, and there is an active labor movement.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS        -

 MAURITIUS
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been no reports of arbitrary arrests or detentions
 since the early 1970's. Detained persons have the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of their detention. In
 practice, this determination is usually made within 24 hours.
 Bail is commonly granted. In 1986 the Supreme Court ruled
 invalid a section of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1986 which had
 provided for detention without bail for persons arrested under
 Clause 46(2) of the Act.
 Exile is legally prohibited. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system, modeled on that of Great Britain,
 consists of the Supreme Court, which has appellate powers, and
 a series of lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the
 Queen's Privy Council in the United Kingdom and is routinely
 made in the cases of death sentences. There are no political
 or military courts. The judiciary is independent. The
 Governor General nominates the Chief Justice, in consultation
 with the Prime Minister, and nominates the senior puisne
 (associate) judges in consultation with the Chief Justice.
 The Governor General nominates other judges on the advice of
 the Judicial and Legal Service Commissions. The legal system
 has consistently provided fair, public trials to those charged
 with crimes. Defendants have the right to private or
 court-appointed counsel. The judiciary is also charged under
 the Constitution with ensuring that new laws are consistent
 with democratic practice. There are no political prisoners in
 Mauritius.
 f. Arbitrary InterfeLence with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law and generally
 respected in practice. The search of personal property or
 premises is allowed only under clearly specified conditions by
 court order or by police decision if an illegal act has been
 committed in the presence of a police officer. There have
 been reports from reliable sources that the Government's
 intelligence apparatus occasionally opens mail and carries out
 surveillance of local opposition leaders and other major
 figures.
 In October 1986, the Legislative Assembly amended the
 Constitution with regard to drug traffickers and drug
 trafficking in Mauritius. The legislation increased the
 powers of any commission of inquiry to look into personal
 finances, including bank accounts; provided for fines of
 persons who refuse to testify; provided for fining a bank and
 revoking its license if it refuses to cooperate in a financial
 investigation; and provided for the seizure of all assets of
 convicted drug traffickers who cannot prove that the assets in
 question were obtained legally.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is protected by the Constitution
 and by local tradition. Sixteen privately owned daily,
 weekly, and monthly newspapers present varying political
 
 
 223
 MAURITIUS
 viewpoints and freely express partisan views. Newspapers are
 subject only to the legal constraints of libel laws. The
 Government owns the one television and two radio stations (one
 strictly educational), broadcasting in five languages. The
 television and radio are reasonably objective in news and
 entertainment presentation, although opposition politicians
 occasionally accuse the broadcasting corporation of political
 bias in its news coverage. Television and radio broadcasts
 are also easily received without interference from the nearby
 island of Reunion (a French Department). The Government can
 review foreign broadcast program material and may delete
 segments considered offensive to local mores or politically
 sensitive. The Government sometimes delays the broadcast of
 local religious ceremonies. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Mauritians enjoy the right to form associations, including
 political parties, trade unions, and reiigious -rganizations.
 Mauritius has a multitude of such private organizations.
 Political, cultural, and religious assemblies are common-
 place. Although police permission is required for holding
 demonstrations and mass meetings, such permission is rarely
 refused. The registered political parties freely held large
 public rallies during the campaign for the August 1987 general
 elections and the October 1988 municipal elections.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no official state religion in Mauritius. Hindus,
 Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and others openly practice,
 teach, and proselytize their religions without prejudice. All
 religious institutions receive state subsidies in proportion
 to their memberships. There is no state-sanctioned
 discrimination against any ethnic or religious community.
 Foreign clergy require work permits, which are processed on a,
 case-by-case basis.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on full freedom of movement within
 the country. Foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation are
 also unrestricted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Theit Government
 Mauritius is governed by a freely elected, unicameral
 Legislative Assembly, with executive direction coming from a
 Council of Ministers, currently headed by Prime Minister Sir
 Anerood Jugnauth whose Alliance coalition won elections in
 1983 and 1987. The Governor General has the right to
 designate the person charged with forming a new government
 following parliamentary elections or a parliamentary crisis.
 Parliamentary, municipal, and village council elections are
 held at regular intervals. Voting and running for office are
 rights of all citizens 18 years of age and over. In the
 Legislative Assembly, 8 of the 70 members are appointed
 through a complex "best loser" system designed in part to
 ensure that all ethnic groups are adequately represented. The
 governing Alliance coalition consists of 3 parties and
 controls 41 of the 70 seats. Political parties often match
 the ethnicity or religion of their candidates to the
 composition of particular electoral constituencies. The
 
 
 224
 MAURITIUS
 majority Hindus, by virtue of their number, tend to dominate
 the national political scene and the civil service. Five of
 70 members of the Legislative Assembly and 2 of 18 Ministers
 are women.
 In the August 1987 parliamentary elections, 89 percent of the
 553,364 eligible voters cast ballots. Only 9,512 votes
 separated the winning and losing coalitions. The opposition
 controls the five major municipalities, and government parties
 did not contest the October 25, 1988 municipal elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no known requests by international
 organizations to investigate human rights violations in
 Mauritius. Amnesty International maintains two branches in
 Mauritius. There are several local human rights groups which
 address the internal situation in Mauritius without
 governmental intrusion.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women in Mauritius participate in all types of political,
 business, and social activities, and a few hold important
 positions. Nonetheless, traditional ethnic and religious
 attitudes hamper women in achieving true parity. The
 Government seeks to improve the status of women, and recent
 amendments to laws ranging from emigration to inheritance have
 removed sex discriminatory sections. An interministerial
 committee, headed by one of the female ministers, has been
 active since 1985 in addressing remaining discriminatory
 elements in local laws and practices. Nevertheless,
 discriminatory laws and regulations remain, including
 prohibition against women serving on juries.
 Moreover, the illiteracy rate for women (20 percent in 1983)
 is about twice that of men. While women are highly sought for
 employment in manufacturing plants, they tend to occupy the
 less skilled and lower paid positions and are particularly
 susceptible to layoffs during economic downturns. Twice as
 many women as men were employed in the Export Processing Zone
 as of March 1987, according to the Central Statistical
 Office. The average industrial salary for women is about 50
 percent that of men. The Minister for Labor and Industrial
 Relations, Women's Rights, and Family Welfare has indicated,
 however, that middle management training for women is one of
 her ministry's priorities.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Mauritius has an active trade union movement. Almost 300
 unions, for the most part grouped in 9 umbrella organizations,
 represent about 100,000 workers, more than one-fourth of the
 work force. Unions are free to organize workers in all
 sectors, including the Export Processing Zone (EPZ), which
 employs about 90,000 workers. The EPZ is a remarkably
 successful free trade zone in which goods and materials are
 imported free of duty, processed with Mauritian labor, and
 reexported. Unions can press wage demands, establish ties to
 domestic political parties and international organizations,
 
 
 225
 MAURITIUS
 and address political issues. Three of the five trade union
 activists who ran in the 1987 general elections were elected
 to the Legislative Assembly on the government slate. One
 leading federation actively supports the opposition party.
 The largest confederation, the Mauritian Labor Congress, is a
 member of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. It and three other national labor centers belong to
 the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 In theory, unions have the right to strike. However, in labor
 disputes, the Industrial Relations Act (IRA), patterned after
 a British model, requires a prestrike, 21-day cooling-off
 period followed by binding arbitration, which has the effect
 of making most strikes illegal. Refusal to follow IRA
 procedures in a mid-1988 textile plant strike led to the
 imprisonment of three union leaders for several days. The
 Government supported labor/management negotiations which
 resulted in the reemployment of most of the striking workers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions possess the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. Mauritian labor legislation, including the
 Industrial Relations Act, applies equally to the Export
 Processing Zone as it does to the rest of the labor sector and
 has been enforced with equal vigor.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits any form of forced or compulsory
 labor, and this prohibition is observed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children below the age of 14 cannot be legally employed,
 although scattered cases of child labor are reported.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Conditions of employment in Miuritius, including wage and
 leave conditions, are generally sufficient to afford an
 acceptable standard of living for workers in the agricultural,
 service, and manufacturing sectors. Government, private
 welfare groups, and labor unions serve as watchdogs on
 potential employer abuses. A maximum workweek of 45 hours is
 allowed. The Government mandates minimum wage increases each
 year, based on inflation. The current minimum wage for
 unskilled labor in the Export Processing Zone is $8 per week
 .during the first year and $10 per week thereafter.
 In 1987 the Government awarded a wage increase (12.6 percent)
 in the public service. Pay increases (10.15 percent) were
 also approved for the private sector, including the sugar
 industry and the EPZ. At the same time, the Government
 addressed the issue of overtime work in the EPZ due to
 complaints that EPZ employers imposed long hours of overtime
 on employees--about 10 to 20 hours per week, making for a 55-
 to 65-hour workweek. In the revised remuneration orders of
 July 1, 1987, the Government stipulated that no employee would
 be required to perform extra hours of work in excess of 10
 hours per week, except with his or her consent. In addition,
 new remuneration rates for overtime (above the regular 45-hour
 week) were introduced. In addition to wages, the Government
 also increased the social benefits to old age pensioners,
 
 
 226
 MAURITIUS
 unemployed persons, widows and orphans, and handicapped
 persons. A commission on salaries headed by British expert
 Donald Chesworth recommended salary increases, especially at
 middle and lower levels, that would cost approximately $42
 million. The Government decided to implement the report and
 to pay the arrears for the July-October 1988 period in
 November 1988. The unions have been generally satisfied with
 the Government's action, but some economists are concerned
 about the inflationary impact of the increases.
