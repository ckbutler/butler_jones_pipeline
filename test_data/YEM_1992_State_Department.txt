 YEMEN
 The Republic of Yemen was proclaimed in 1990 with the unification of the Yemen
 Arab Republic (YAR) and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). The
 
 
 1108
 
 Constitution provides for a Parliament elected by universal suffrage, a five-member
 Presidential Council elected by the Parliament whose chairman serves as Head of
 State, a Council of Ministers, and an independent judiciary. According to the unifi-
 cation agreement, the term of the present Parliament, consisting of the former YAR
 and PDRY legislatures and 31 members appointed by the President, was to have
 ended no later than November 21, 1992, by which time multiparty elections for a
 new Parliament were to have been held. In November, however, the Government,
 citing technical complications in preparing for the elections, announced that they
 would be held April 27, 1993. The Government in Sanaa exercises its authority over
 much of Yemen, but tribal leaders in the north and east continue to hold consider-
 able power based on their traditional prerogatives.
 An extensive state-security apparatus, the National Security Organization (NSO),
 exists as part of the Ministry of Interior and Security. Its officers have broad discre-
 tion over perceived national security issues and, despite constitutional prohibitions,
 routinely detain citizens for questioning, frequently mistreat detainees, monitor per-
 sonal activities, and search homes. The Government is believed to have intensified
 such searches in 1992. According to the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agen-
 cy, total military expenditures for 1989 were $618 million. There is no indication
 that efforts willbe made to reduce these expenditures in the near future.
 Yemen is a poor country of 14 million people with a rudimentary infrastructure.
 Agriculture and oil dominate the Yemeni economy, and modest oil exports provide
 a large percentage of government revenues and virtually all of its hard currency
 earnings. Remittances from Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states,
 formerly an important source of hard currency, declined significantly in the after-
 math of the Gulf war and the effective expulsion of many Yemeni workers from the
 Gulf. Foreign aid from the Gulf states, also an important source of revenue before
 the Gulf war, has almost completely ended. After unification, the Marxist economy
 in the south was liberalized, but significant former PDRY state institutions remain.
 Significant human rights abuses continued in 1992. Major problems included po-
 litical violence, which in 1992 claimed at least 10 lives, and the Government's fail-
 ure to investigate these attacks effectively and punish those responsible; the lack
 of an effective administrative system, resulting in uneven implementation and en-
 forcement of laws; torture and abuse of prisoners; and arbitrary detention. There
 were also continuing limitations on civil liberties, including freedom of speech, as
 well as widespread discrimination based on sex, racial origin, and religion.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were a number of reports of
 possible political and extrajudicial killings in 1992. A wave of apparently politically
 motivated bombing and assassinations claimed at least 10 lives. Attacks were di-
 rected against prominent government officials, particularly those from the former
 PDRY. The Justice Minister was wounded, and the brother of the Prime Minister
 was assassinated. A military adviser to the Minister of Defense was killed in a con-
 frontation with security forces at a road checkpoint. Official sources stated that the
 officer was killed after attempting to run the checkpoint. However, it was widely
 reported that he survived a firefight with security forces and was subsequently
 killed after being taken to a hospital for treatment. Although a few individuals were
 arrested, there has been no conclusive determination as to who was behind the var-
 ious attacks. There were also reports of the deaths of two former National Demo-
 cratic Front (NDF) members in prison after being tortured and, in one case, being
 allowed to starve to death (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were occasional reports of Yemenis disappearing follow-
 ing detention by the security forces. Most such detainees were eventually released.
 Most reports about disappeared persons are related to former members of the NDF,
 which waged a guerrilla war against the YAR from the mid-1970's through the early
 1980's. Families of an estimated 200 to 300 persons who disappeared in the former
 PDRY have been unable to obtain any documentation from the Government about
 the fate of their relatives. It is widely believed that the vast majority of these per-
 sons were killed while in the custody of PDRY state security officials.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution proscribes "physical punishment and degrading treatment." How-
 ever, security officials are commonly believed to resort with impunity to force or the
 threat of force to extract information from detainees. There were widely published
 reports in the Yemeni press alleging torture and mistreatment by prison officials.
 ne report alleged that a former NDF member, Sufyan Hamoud Affan, was tortured
 severely in Taiz prison and then allowed to starve to death. Prison officials claimed
 
 
 1109
 that he died "of illness" on March 1. A second NDF member, Mahdi Abdo Haydara
 al-Salimi, is also believed to have been tortured by prison officials prior to his death
 on April 23. Credible reports indicate that Mansur Muhammad Abroad Rajih, a
 writer and NDF activist, who remains imprisoned, has been subjected to torture
 throughout his incarceration.
 In contrast to 1991, there were no reported instances of amputation. In at least
 seven cases, the Yemeni Supreme Court refused to confirm amputation sentences
 and in several cases ordered the prisoners released upon a finding that their periods
 of incarceration (which ranged up to10 years) were adequate punishment.
 Substandard conditions in Yemeni prisons represent a threat to the health of in-
 mates. Visitors from human rights organizations and local press reports have de-
 scribed inadecuate food, medical, and sanitary facilities, and severe overcrowding.
 In the women s section of Sanaa central prison, prisone. were in some instances
 unable to obtain milk for their children who were incarcerated with them. The Gov-
 ernment said in June it would take measures to improve these conditions. Official
 press reports in late June claimed that some improvements had been made, but this
 could not be verified. Despite official decrees banning them, shackles are still used
 in a number of Yemeni prisons. Mentally ill persons are also occasionally shackled.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite constitutional and other legal
 guarantees, there continued to be reports of arbitrary arrest and prolonged deten-
 tion without charge. Moreover relatives of the accused are sometimes held while,
 in accordance with customary law, compensation for the victim or victim's relatives
 is negotiated.
 Under the law, persons arrested may not be detained for more than 24 hours
 without being brought before a court and formally charged. Upon arrest, a detainee
 has the right to notify a person of his or her choice, but this right is seldom honored
 or is observed only upon payment of a bribe, especially in cases of arrests by secu-
 rity officials. While there are prvisions for release on bail, arrested Yemens more
 commonly have a close family member pledge surety for them. In court, the accused
 has the right to he ththe charges being brought and has an opportunity to respond
 to those charges. A judge then decides whether the accused is to be held for trial
 or released. A detainee may not be required to answer questions without an attor-
 ney present.
 Credible sources report that as many as 4,000 prisoners are held in Yemeni jails
 without documentation concerning their imprisonment. Most of these prisoners were
 moved to state prisons from outlying jails following unification and are held cur-
 rently without a record of their sentences or why they were arrested. Although press
 reports in March indicated that the Government was continuing its investigation of
 these cases, the Government announced no releases in 1992 similar to the 1991 re-
 lease of 700 prisoners.
 In May the Government announced the pardon of M Nasser Mohammed, former
 President of the PDRY, and five associates. Al Nasser, currently living in Damascus
 in self-imposed exile, was sentenced to death in absentia in 1986 by PDRY courts.
 The Government also announced the pardon of 16 former members of the NDF. Par-
 dons of persons associated with guerrilla movements that the YAR and PDRY spon-
 sored in each other's territory prior to unification were issued, according to govern.
 ment officials, to strengthen Yemeni unity.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-In accordance with an August 1991 decree, judi-
 cial systems have been unified at the Supreme Court level. The lower courts have
 not yet been merged and continue to function in their respective halves of the coun-
 try. In the former YAR, there are two court systems: Shari'a (criminal and family)
 and commercial. The Shari'a courts are based on Islamic law and, viewed within
 their traditional Islamic context (e.g. no jury trials), are considered generally to be
 impartial. The judge actively questions witnesses. Attorneys are allowed to counsel
 their clients and may also address the court and examine witnesses. Foreign liti-
 gants in the commercial courts have frequently complained of biased rulings, and
 both Yemeni and non-Yemeni litigants have maintained that tribal ties as well as
 outright bribery are often decisive n obtaining a favorable verdict. Defendants enjoy
 the right of appeal and court sessions are generally open, although the Constitution
 permits thourtstoholdclosedsessions"orreasonsofsecurity orgeneral morals."
 The Shari'a and commercial courts are largely independent of the executive, but
 judicial authorities have complained of executive branch interference in sensitive
 cases and of the continued existence of extrajudicial prisons maintained by some
 ministries. Former YAR state security courts were formally abolished after unifica-
 tion.
 In the former PDRY there are three court systems: magistrate or divisional
 courts, provincial courts, and military courts. Magistrate's courts have jurisdiction
 over most criminal and traffic offenses, juvenile cases, family cases, housing and
 
 
 1110
 agrarian disputes, and minor civil matters. Provincial courts have jurisdiction over
 serious criminal cases involving the death sentence or long prison terms, inheritance
 cases, major civil claims, and appeals from magistrates' courts. Military courts have
 jurisdiction over crimes by members of the armed forces.
 The Government denies that it holds any political prisoners, although nongovern-
 mental Yemeni sources dispute this. Concerns expressed by Amnesty International
 and other human rights organizations have tended to focus on NDF members still
 held in northern prisons. There are no figures available on the number of NDF
 members still in prison. Most NDF prisoners appear to qualify as political prisoners
 on the basis that they have not received fair public trials. In addition, some NDF
 members are apparently still held despite a 1985 general amnesty declared for all
 former NDF members.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution contains guarantees of the freedom and confidentiality of mail, tele-
 phones, telegrams, and other means of communication, except in cases determined
 by law and court order. The Constitution also specifies that residences, places of
 worship, and educational institutions are not to be searched except in cases specified
 by law. Nevertheless, security forces routinely search homes, monitor telephones,
 read personal mail, and otherwise intrude into personal matters, alleging security
 concerns. Yemeni visitors to foreign embassies and consulates are sometimes ques-
 tioned by security agents.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The new Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and press "within the limits of the law." Yemenis typically engage in unin-
 hibited discussions of both domestic and foreign policies in qat (a mildly narcotic
 leaf many Yemenis chew) sessions, an institution deeply ingrained in Yemeni life.
 However, some Yemenis remain cautious in exercising their freedom of speech, be-
 lieving that they may experience difficulty if security agents overhear them criticiz-
 ing particular government leaders. Since unification Yemen has enjoyed greater
 press freedom. In addition to several major newspapers owned by the Government,
 some 90 papers have appeared and are widely distributed. These papers represent
 a wide spectrum of political opiion and frequently criticize government policies and
 leaders by name. Despite this openness, sensitive areas remain and the press is
 widely seen as practicing self-censorship, particularly regarding Yemen's policies to-
 ward the Gulf crisis and on Yemeni-Saudi relations. In September a Ministry of In-
 formation spokesperson specifically criticized three Yemeni papers for failing to ad-
 here to "apprpriate standards," and the Yemem press clearly takes its line from
 the Government on issues of interest to the Government. In addition, Ministry of
 Information subsidies to most papers give the Government added control over the
 print media. The Government has on occasion prevented the distribution of foreign
 press articles deemed critical.
 The Ministry of Information also owns and operates Yemen's radio and television
 stations. News broadcasts appear to be closely controlled by the Government and
 virtually never contain reports critical of the Government. However, Yemen's two
 television channels regularly broadcast uncensored parliamentary sessions even
 though some speakers vociferously denounced various government policies.
 Materials carried by both foreigners and Yemenis are subject to inspection at cus-
 toms points, and those of a religious, political, or pornopnic nature are often con-
 fiscated. Self-censorship is sometimes practiced at Sanaa University, where profes-
 sors and senior administrators require a security clearance before being hired. How-
 ever, recent faculty elections at the university were conducted without government
 interference, and there were no reports of government interference in teaching pro-
 grams or curriculum development.
 b. Freedom of Peacul Assembly and Association.-Article 39 of the new Constitu-
 tion contains guarantees of freedom of association. Organizations must register with
 the Ministry of Social Security and Social Affairs but licensing does not routinely
 offer any problems.
 Yemeni citizens have a right to demonstrate peacefully. Citizens continued to
 demonstrate regularly in front of the President's office, Parliament, and provincial
 government offices to voice their views on domestic issues. In August a confronta-
 tion between the police and religious activists protesting the planned use of a ceme-
 tery for a commercial project in Aden became violent. Two pmersons were reported
 killed and nine wounded. In December government security forces put down violent
 demonstrations apparently stemming from Yemen's worsenin  economic situation.
 Official reports indicated that 15 people were killed and 61 injured, although the
 actual toll is probably higher.
 
 
 1111
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion, and there are some restric-
 tions on the practice of other religions. Most Yemens are Muslims, either members
 of the Zaydi sect, which is a form of Shi'ism, or followers of the Shafi'i Sunni school
 of Islamic law. Islamic associations with ties to Pan-Islamic organizations enjoy a
 degree of freedom; however, the right of these organizations to run schools inde-
 pendent of the government school system was restricted by the passage of a new
 education bill in August.
 Most of the once sizable Yemeni Jewish population has emigrated; somewhat
 fewer than 1,000 Jews remain, mostly scattered in northern rural areas. There are
 no formal synagogues, but services are routinely held in private homes. Despite oc-
 casional hindrances, the Government has allowed contact with foreign Jewish
 groups and has permitted these groups to build and operate schools and ritual baths
 in the two main centers of Jewish population. In 1992, however, security authorities
 in Saadah refused to allow foreign groups to meet with local Jews on three occa-
 sions claiming that such meetings required a permit. Nevertheless, foreign groups
 traveled and met with local Jews in many villages.
 There are no indigenous Christian Yemenis. Foreign Christians throughout
 Yemen and the Indian-origin Christian community of Aden regularly conduct serv-
 ices. While there are no churches in the former YAR, there are Christian churches
 and a Hindu temple in Aden. Foreign clergy may not proselytize but are present
 in Yemen, often teaching or working in social services or health care. By religious
 convention, Muslims may not convert to other religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Yemeni citizens enjoy freedom of travel within Yemen, although there
 are some checkpoints on major roads. Foreigners are required to obtain permits for
 travel outside the capital, but regulations are not strictly enforced. Permission for
 most tourists to travel is easily obtainable through travel agencies.
 Most Yemenis are able to travel abroad freely and to emigrate, but Yemeni Jews
 encounter discrimination which effectively limits their freedom in both respects. For
 most Yemenis, obtaining passports is a relatively simple matter. Exit permit proce-
 dures have been simplified and permits are generally available at the airport. How-
 ever, young males who have not yet completed their military service sometimes are
 prevented from traveling abroad. Moreover, women seeking exit visas are often
 asked to prove that male relatives do not object to their travel. Despite frequent
 statements by high-ranking government officials affirming that Yemeni Jews enjoy
 the same right to travel that other Yemenis enjoy, Jews continue to face discrimina-
 tion in obtaining passports, and the number of Jews able to travel is believed to
 be far below the number of those desiring to travel. Passports issued to Jews rou-
 tinely carry handwritten designations of the holders' religion.
 There have been no reports of Yemenis being denied the right to return. The num-
 ber of refugees (primarily from Horn of Africa countries) increased dramatically in
 1992 from about 10,000 to over 60,000. The overwhelming majority were given asy-
 lum, and there were no reports of forced repatriation. Many of these refugees have
 family or tribal ties to Yemen and have found work in Yemen. The Government
 closely monitors all political activity by refugees. Many of the Palestinians who ar-
 rived in Yemen from Lebanon in 1982-1983 have departed; the remainder live in
 camps near Sanaa and Aden and are closely watched by security services. Other
 Palestinians are employed, often as teachers or business people, and do not face sig-
 nificant restrictions on their freedom of movement.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of the citizens of Yemen to change their government remains to be test-
 ed. Although the unification agreement called for the holding of Parliamentary elec-
 tions before the end of the transitional period on November 21, 1992, the Govern-
 ment announced in November that the elections would be delayed until April 27,
 1993. The Government said that technical problems mainly involving difficulties in
 obtaining reliable census figures and the drawing up of district boundaries had
 forced the delay. While the legal implications of the delay are unclear, most observ-
 ers believe that the current Parliament may legally be extended past November 21
 under Article 43 of the Constitution.
 All the top leaders of the YAR and PDRY remained in power after unification.
 Even before unification, while technically illegal in both the YAR and the PDRY,
 new political parties began to organize. Article 39 of the Constitution, which allows
 freedom of association for political, professional, and labor organizations, permits
 political parties, although by law their programs may not oppose the Islamic religion
 or the goals of the Yemeni revolution or violate Yemeni international commitments.
 Under the law, government financial support must be given to recognized political
 
 
 1112
 arties and parties may establish their own newspapers. More than 40 parties
 formed, but as of year's end none had registered in accordance with the 1991 Politi-
 cal Parties law.
 In accordance with the Unification Agreement, the current Parliament is charged
 with enacting laws providing for the unification of ministries and other government
 bodies and establishing joint legal codes until the first unified Parliament is elected.
 The 301-member transitional Parliament consists of 159 members from the former
 YAR Consultative Assembly, 111 members from the former PDRY Supreme People's
 Council (including 10 women), and 31 members appointed by President Saleh at
 unification. The Constitution gives broad powers to the Parliament: these include
 electing the Presidential Council, withdrawing confidence from the Government
 questioning the Prime Minister and government ministers, ratifying international
 agreements, and approving the budget. The transitional Parliament has vetoed
 some government-sponsored bills and demanded modifications in others. However,
 implementation of laws passed by the Parliament, as well as the accountability of
 individual ministers to it, has been uneven and local ministry and other officials re-
 tain considerable power to exercise their discretion in interpreting and enforcing the
 law.
 A five-member Presidential Council with broad executive powers has functioned
 since unification. Its chairman is the former YAR president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and
 its Vice Chairman, the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) Secretary General, Ali Salem
 al-Bidh. The Council has executive powers, including the right to pass legislation
 by decree when the Parliament is not in session. Laws passed by decree must be
 submitted for review by the Parliament within 30 days.
 The Council appointed Haydar Abu Bakr al-Attas Prime Minister in May 1990
 and he formed a Government, comprising 39 ministries, with approximately equal
 representation between northerners and southerners. In addition, a 45-member Con-
 sultative Council was appointed by the Presidential Council to advise the Govern-
 ment on broad policy issues. There is no constitutional provision for the Consult-
 ative Council, and it has met irregularly since its creation. Women may vote and
 hold office by law, although this right is imited in practice by cultural and religious
 traditions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A government-sanctioned human rights organization exists as a committee of the
 Parliament. Initial attempts to form a nongovernmental human rights organization
 were frustrated both by government opposition and infighting between leftists and
 Islamists.
 The Government again permitted Amnesty International representatives to inves-
 tigate prison conditions and allegations regarding political prisoners in 1992.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, origin, lan-
 guage, occupation, social status, or religious belief, in practice various forms of dis-
 crimination exist. For example, Yemeni Jews face discrimination in exercising their
 rights to travel and to meet with foreign groups. Also, by tradition, non-Muslims
 are not permitted to carry weapons, traditionally carried by Muslim Yemenis.
 Yemenis with a non-Yemeni parent (so-called muwalladin) face both institutional-
 ized and informal discrimination. For example, the Constitution requires that mem-
 bers of the Presidential Council be "born of Yemeni parents." Sanaa University ad-
 ministered by the Government applies the same restriction when hiring teaching
 and senior administrative staf, as does Yemen's military academy in selecting ca-
 dets. However, discrimination against muwalladin is not universal; many senior
 government officials, including ministers, are muwalladin. Some muwalladin com-
 plain that they are required to pay substantial bribes to receive residency permits,
 passports, and other official documentation. Another smaller group known as
 Akhdam, the descendants of ancient Ethiopian occupiers who later became slaves,
 also faces persistent social discrimination.
 Although the Constitution provides for equality, significant restrictions on women
 are imposed by tradition and law. In March the Presidential Council issued by de-
 cree a new family law based largely on the former YAR law. Under the law, polyg-
 amy is allowed, husbands may divorce their wives without justifying their actions
 before the court, and, in cases of divorce, both the family home and the children
 are automatically awarded to the husband. Courts in the north are applying the
 new law, but a group of jurists in Aden, where women enjoyed substantially greater
 rights in the past, said they would refuse to implement it and questioned the con-
 stitutionality of the decree. There are frequent cases of child marriage in rural
 
 
 1113
 areas. The institution of dowry payments is widespread. The amount of payments
 has increased in spite of government attempts to limit their size.
 Societal pressures often force women to defer to the guidance of male colleagues
 and the general supervision of male relatives as, for example, in seeking to travel
 abroad. Education for women in significant numbers began in the YAR only at the
 end of the civil war in 1970; education for women in the-PDRY was more advanced.
 An estimated 85 percent of all Yemeni women are illiterate, compared to 46 percent
 of all men.
 In Aden women work in midlevel jobs in several ministries and also in banks and
 other businesses. Yemen's largest factory group employs women on the same pay
 scale as men, and women have risen through the ranks to lower management posi-
 tions. There are female judges and lawyers in Aden and lesser numbers in the
 north, but the Ministry of Justice has only one female employee.
 A form of female genital mutilation, clitorectomy, is practiced in the Tihama Red
 Sea coastal region and in the region of the Hadhramaut along the Gulf of Aden, es-
 pecially among Yemenis of African oriin. The extent of the practice is unknown.
 While some individual government health workers in the Tihama actively discour-
 age clitorectomy, there is no government directive or guidance against the practice.
 Gonservative social mores effectively prevent public discussion or government ac-
 knowledgment of the practice.
 Wife beating and other physical abuse of women occurs frequently in Yemeni fam-
 ilies. Although there is little public discussion of this matter, it has received increas-
 ing attention in the press. The female victim usually turns to a male relative to
 pressure the perpetrator to stop the abuse; she may seek a legal remedy but social
 traditions usually compel women and their male relatives to seek mediation and
 keep the matter within the extended family.
 There is a government-sponsored women's association which promotes female edu-
 cation and civic responsibilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-As the united Yemen has not yet enacted a new
 labor code, the labor codes for the former YAR and PDRY remain in effect for their
 respective parts of the country. In both the YAR and PDRY, labor unions were close-
 ly controlled, if not organized, by the respective ruling parties. Under the YAR
 Labor Code, a union may be set up by 100 or more workers upon application to and
 approval by the Government. The Code prescribes a single union system with one
 union committee per enterprise, one union branch per locality, one general union
 per economic sector, and one national umbrella organization, which was the Yemeni
 Trade Union Confederation. Public servants, employees and manual workers em-
 ployed in the state administration, as well as some categories of farm workers, are
 excluded from union membership.
 Under the YAR Labor Code the Council of Ministers may dissolve trade unions
 without judicial action. The dode also prohibits unions from en a *ng in political
 activity. Financial records are subject to government oversight. YAR trade unions
 were reported to be under heavy security forces' influence and were not known to
 challenge the Government. In the PDRY, the General Federation of Trade Unions
 (GFTU), the only labor association, was under close Yemeni Socialist Party control.
 The YAR and PDRY labor confederations merged in 1990, forming the Yemeni
 Confederation of Labor Unions (YCLU). The YCLU is affiliated with the Inter-
 national Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the Communist dominated World
 Federation of Trade Unions.
 In the YAR, labor-related legislation neither allowed nor outlawed strikes. At
 least 10 major strikes occurred in Yemen in 1992, including a 24-hour general strike
 that halted all transportation, and strikes by Aden dock workers and Aden munici-
 pality workers. During several weeks in November, Yemenis employed by the Gov-
 ernment, banks, and educational institutions staged peaceful strikes for higher pay.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although the YAR Labor
 Code calls for employers to treat workers collectively, it does not provide for a sys-
 tem of collective bargaining, nor does it contain provisions to ensure worker protec-
 tion against acts of discrimination by employers. There are consequently no formal
 collective bargaining agreements now in force. Unions do negotiate wage settle-
 ments for their members and have often resorted to strikes or other actions to
 achieve their demands. According to the YAR Labor Code, collective agreements
 must be registered and may be unilaterally revoked by the Government if they do
 not conform to the security and economic interests of the country. No such revoca-
 tions were reported in 1992.
 The YAR was criticized by the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Commit-
 tee of Experts (COE) in 1991 for discrepancies between its Labor Code and ILO con-
 
 
 1114
 ventions. The COE charged that YAR labor laws excluded large categories of work-
 ers, including public servants, from union protection and permitted "interference by
 the public authorities" in financial administration of unions and their right to self.
 regulation. Moreover, the COE reiterated its past criticism that the collective bar-
 gaining process had still not been implemented, and called upon the Government
 to Otake measures to encourage the collective negotiation of terms and conditions
 of employment, in view of of the fact that no collective agreement had yet been con-
 cluded."' Until a new labor code is passed, workers in the north enjoy limited protec-
 tions under the YAR Labor Code. In the PDRY, the State, through the YSP-con-
 trolled unions, purported to represent the rights of the workers. There was no collec-
 tive bargaining, and there were no nongovernmental bodies that addressed labor
 grievances.
 There are currently no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is for-
 bidden by the Constitution, and there are no reports of it in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There was no minimum age for
 employment of children in the YAR. Labor by minors aged 12 to 14 was regulated
 by the Labor Code. In the PDRY, the Labor Code prohibited the employment of chil-
 dren (defined as between 7 and 12years of age) and regulated that of young persons
 (between 12 and 16 years of age). Apprentice employment of young persons aged 14
 and older is permitted.
 Throughout Yemen, child labor is common, particularly in rural areas. For the
 most part, it is sanctioned by family tradition and it is not uncommon to see chil-
 dren working in workshops or stores. In the south, child labor often occurs on fam-
 ily, cooperative, and state farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There was no established minimum wage in
 the YAR. In the former PDRY, the labor laws set a minimum wage which provided
 a worker a minimal standard of living. The prevailing daily wage for unskilled labor
 in Yemen allows a very modest standard of living for a worker with a family.
 YAR legal codes prescribe a maximum 8-hour workday (6 hours during Ramadan),
 but some workshops operate 10- or 12-hour shifts without penalty. The YAR Labor
 Code does not prescribe the number of workdays, only that the maximum workweek
 consist of 48 hours. The PDRY Labor Code stipulates a 42-hour workweek. These
 provisions are not widely enforced in either part of Yemen. The Ministry of Labor
 in the YAR investigated complaints of alleged violations and, if found valid, sought
 restitution from the employer. Enforcement of the Labor Code is more prevalent
 against foreign employers of Yemeni workers.
 Little attention is paid to health and safety standards in either part of Yemen.
 The majority of Yemen's population practices traditional agriculture. Industrial pro-
 duction involves mainly light manufacturing and food processing. YAR and PDRY
 legal codes did not effectively regulate working conditions and health hazards in the
 workplace, and this remains the case. In the past, the YAR government set general
 safety requirements for larger organizations but only occasionally checked compli-
 ance. There was legislation regulating conditions of labor in the PDRY, but there
 was no agency for effective enforcement.
