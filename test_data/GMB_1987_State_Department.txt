 THE .GMBIA
 A former British colony on the West-African coast, The Gambia
 is a parliamentary democracy with an elected president. Until
 a bloody" coup attempt lin July 198r, The  Gambi'ha d a Iiistory
 of p]olitical'stability under the leadership of its only
 Presdfdeftr since independence in 1965, Sir Dawda Jawara. His
 ruling People's Progressive Party (PPP),has dominated the
 Parliaimen; but'several opposition parties actively partidipate
 in tbe'pxaiticar process. Two new political parties were
 formed in 1986 and joined the ruling paity and the existing
 opposition National Convention Party ih contesting the
 parliamentary and presidential elections held in March 1987.
 President Jawara was reelected by a large margin, and PPP
 candidates'wod an overwhelming majority in the Parliament. -
 While'there were some allegations of fraud, none were
 substantiated,' and =tlie elections were* judged by most observers
 to be'free-and fair.

 naval unit organized and trained by British officers. One
 company of' The' 6ambian army has bben- integrated With --
 Senegalbse-troops into a onfederdl battalion led by a
 Senegalese 'officer. The-Gambia also has a-gendarmerie of
 abohxtf35OO nembers,� he~ded bj ' Senegalese.
 The Gimbia's estimated population of 784,000 consists largely
 of subsistence farmers growing fice and ,groundnuts (peanuts),.
 the country's primary export crop. The Gambia continued in
 1987 s stringent prdgram of economic reform which'has'been
 praised by the Inteinationial Monetary Fund, the World Bank,
 and other donors, and has allowed The Gambia to reschedule its
 debt and receive critical new lr'-ns.  -

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no instances of political killings.
 ,b. Disappearance
 There were no known allegations of abduction or secret
 detention by the Government or by any other group.

 THE GAMBIA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution contains prohibitions against torture and
 other cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment. There were no
 allegations of torture in 1987. Prison conditions are severe,
 and there have been occasional reports of mistreatment of
 prisoners. The Government has expressly disapproved of such
 practices. There are segregated prison facilities for men and
 women of both maximum and minimum security types. The
 Government allows prison visits by representatives of the
 local Red Cross and by close family members.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Based on British legal practice, well-developed constitutional
 and legal procedures govern the arrest, detention, and trial
 of persons accused of crimes. Under these procedures, a
 detained person must be brought to trial within 1 week of
 arrest. This waiting period, however, can be extended twice,
 making 21 days the maximum period of detention before trial.
 The Government scrupulously observed legal procedures in
 handling the 1,008 persons detained after the coup attempt.
 Under the Emergency Act of 1981, which was abrogated in
 February 1985, the Government ordered the detention of persons
 who were considered to have been involved in acts prejudicial
 to public safety for up to 14 days without a detention order
 but with the right to legal counsel.
 The Labor Administration Act prohibits forced labor, and there
 have been no indications that it is practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There were no known political prisoners in The Gambia at the
 end of 1987. Sixty-six persons were sentenced to death--after
 lengthy public trials--for crimes committed in connection with
 the 1981 coup attempt. All the cases have now gone through
 appeal, and the President in each death penalty case brought
 to him has granted executive clemency in commuting the
 sentence to life in prison. No executions have taken place.
 One of the 1981 coup leaders was arrested in 1985, tried, and
 sentenced to death in 1986. His case was appealed before the
 Criminal Appeals Court, and the sentence was reduced to 20
 years. To help discourage future coup attempts, The Gambia
 Parliament enacted a law in May 1986 which imposes the death
 penalty for treason, but which also includes the safeguard
 that a person cannot be convicted of treason on the
 uncorroborated statement of only one witness.
 Three kinds of law operate in The Gambia: general, Sharila,
 and customary law. Shari'a, governing Muslims, is observed in
 marriage and divorce proceedings.  Customary law covers
 marriage, inheritance, divorce, land tenure and utilization,
 local tribal government, and all other civil and social
 relations originating in the traditional religious and tribal
 situation of the country. General law, based on English
 statutes and modified to suit The Gambia context, governs
 criminal cases and trials and most organized business
 practices. If there were a conflict between general law and
 Shari'.a, general law would prevail.
 The Constitution provides criminal defendants with the
 traditional rights of the English legal system, such as
 
 
 1.15
 THE GAMBIA
 presumption of innocence, the right of the accused to be
 informed promptly of the charges, and the right to a public
 trial. If released on bail, the accused person need not come
 to trial until the investigation-is completed, and there.
 apparently is no maximum time limit for investigations.
 Appeals normally proceed from the Supreme (trial) Court to the
 Court of Appeals, the country's highest tribunal.
 While the judiciary operates independently and is free of
 government interference, judges are appointed by the
 Government. Because of the shortage of legal professionals in
 The Gambia, the'legal system is staffed in part by judges and
 prosecuting and defense attorneys from neighboring
 English-speaking countries having the same basic legal system
 as The Gambia.
 f, Arbitrary Interference'with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides guarantees, which are'respected in
 practice, against arbitrary search of person and property.
 The Constitution permits the voluntary submission by a suspect
 to search, or a mandatory search if it is reasonably required
 in the interests of.national defense or public welfare. Under
 the. crjmina1.code, search warrants based on probable cause are
 issued by magistratqsupon application by-the police.- There
 are a. few police and.militarycheck points in and around
 Banjul. Periodically-, .ivers.are stopped'and yehicles are
 searched,   .        .,     .
 The rights of fhmily are of extreme importance in The Gambia's
 conservative Muslim society. Marriage, the raising of
 children, and religious instruction are regulated by a
 combinationof personal preference and ethnic and religious
 tradition, .The Government.does notporm4i y intrude in family
 matters,. There is.no.effort to censor or control personal
 corresp6ndence 6r conqmunications.
 Sectioh 2, Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for press freedom, and th -
 Government does not attempt to censor published materials,
 whether they. originate.within or outside the, country.
 .However, the Emergency Act, which was abrogated in 1985, did
 have an inhibiting effect on criticism of the Government by
 the few, independent newssheets. In practical terms, The
 Gambia, with lts small,.mainly rural, largely illiterate, and
 multilinu.alpopulation, does.not, support an active press..
 There areao dai1y newspapers. There is a government
 newsapir e nd..a People's Progressive Party newspaper which
 come out 94 a weekly or biweekly basis. There are several
 indepepdent, intermittently published, mimeographed-newssheets.
 Both the'opposition and the independent press are'sometimes'
 very criticall.of the Government. There is, however, some
 degre  of self-censorship in the government-owned media, which
 exerciseg, restraint in. reporting criticism of the Government.
 There is.no television in The Gambia,..although Senegalese
 broadcasts can be received. The.Government dominates the
 media through Radio Gambia, but there have bpen no xeported
 instances of government interference with the one commercial
 radio station which mainly broadcasts music. -Foreign
 magazines and newspapers are available in the capital.

 THE GAMBIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In general, there is no interference with the freedom of
 association and assembly, which is provided for in the
 Constitution. The Government almost always grants permits for
 meetings but requires that these meetings be open to the
 public. One organization, the Movement for Justice in Africa,
 which was implicated in the 1981 coup attempt, is banned.
 The Labor Administration Act specifies that workers are free
 to form associations and have the right to organize and
 bargain collectively. However, trade unions are small and
 fragmented and are a minor element in Gambian economic and
 political life. Less than 20 percent of the work force is
 engaged in the modern wage sector of the economy, where unions
 normally are active. The Labor Administration Act authorizes
 strikes, but because of a required 14-day cooling-off period
 (21 days in essential services), government conciliation
 efforts, and the poor bargaining strength of the unions, few
 strikes actually occur.
 The Gambia Workers Confederation, which is supported by the
 Government, is an umbrella organization covering about 16
 unions. Another umbrella union, The Gambian Workers Union
 (GWU), which was banned in 1982, has recently reorganized with
 government approval. The GWU was originally banned in the
 late 1970's for an illegal strike, but the ban was lifted in
 1982 and then reapplied. The Union is currently in the
 process of regaining its prior support. Union members have
 the freedom to attend meetings outside the country.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The constitutional provisions of freedom of conscience,
 thought, and religio, are observed in practice. The State is
 secular, although Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the
 population. The schools provide instruction in the Koran for
 Muslim students. Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,
 freely practice their religion. There is a small Baha'i
 community in Banjul. Missionaries are permitted to carry on
 their various mission-related activities. There is no
 evidence of discrimination in employment, education, or in
 other areas of Gambian life on religious grounds.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, subject to
 conditions protecting public safety, health, and morals.
 There is no restriction on freedom of emigration or freedom of
 return. Internally, police and military checkpoints exist in
 and around Banjul, but there is no evidence that police harass
 travelers. Because of historic and ethnic ties with the
 inhabitants of Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, and Mauritania,
 people tend to move unregulated across borders, which are
 poorly marked and difficult to police. Under the Confederation
 Treaty of 1981, neither Gambians nor Senegalese need passports
 or visas to travel to the other country. The Gambia also
 recognizes the Economic Community of West African States'
 (ECOWAS) protocol which allows entry of ECOWAS country
 citizens up to 90 days without visas.
 Refugees fleeing persecution or unrest in other countries are
 not numerous in The Gambia, but the Government and people have
 
 
 117
 THE GAMBIA
 a reputation for tolerance. There have been no reported cases
 of refugees being forcibly deported.
 Section 3 Respect for Political-Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The chief executive (the President) and the members of the
 legislature (Parliament) are popularly elected, as are the
 district councils and the chiefs, who exercise traditional
 authority in the villages and compopnds. Citizens must be at
 least 18 years of age to vote. Balloting is secret, and
 careful.measures-are employed to assure that filiterate voters
 understand the choices and voting procedure.
 A functioning multiparty system exists in.The Gambia even
 though the People's Progressive Party has been in power since
 independence. The principal opposition party, the National
 Convention Party (NCP), contests both national and district
 elections. Two newly-formed opposition parties, The Gambia
 People's Party (GPP) and the People's Democratic Organization
 for Independence and Socialism (PDOIS), contested the March
 1987 presidential and parliamentary elections. Campaigning
 was vigorous, active,, and open by all parties. The ruling PPP
 wojaby.an overwhelming majority and.now holds 31 of 36
 elective seats in the Parliament.
 Only one (the NCP) of the three opposition parties won seats.
 The oppositipn charged.that the election was manipulated by
 the Government but could not provide evidence to support its'
 allegations. The opposition also charged, with some
 justification, -hat.. thOePPP 6enefitqd from -its control of
 Radio Gambia.and access to. governmen, vehicles for campaigning.
 Overall, however, the election Kas considered by-observers to
 be free and fair.
 Section.4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental' nvestigation of Allege6d Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government permits- visits of international human rights
 organizations to observe the conditions of detainees and the
 trial process. There, were no reported requests by such
 organizations fol:-nvestigation of alleged human. rights abuses
 in The Gambia during 1987.
 The Government is responsive to charges of human rights
 violations. When Amnesty International criticized the
 Government for the use of chains and shackles on prisoners,
 they were removed. The Gambia is a member of the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission and of the newly created
 African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, which it has
 offered to host in Banjul. The Government has also proposed
 the creation of a quasi-governmental African Center for Human
 Rights Research.
 Section 5" Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The people are overwhelmingly Muslim, and 85 percent of the
 population live in villages. While personal initiative and
 choice are valued, rights end privileges are generally
 collective. Traditional conservative values, especially about
 women, are changing, but very slowly. Marriages are still
 often arranged, and Muslim tradition allows for polygamy. In
 villages the women continue to perform work in the field and
 
 
 118
 THE GAMBIA
 provide for the majority of local food production. Women also
 play an important role in the small, modern wage sector of the
 economy. Most are in lighter or semiskilled jobs (e.g.,
 assembly work, handicraft shops, bus conductors), vary few are
 in skilled trades (e.g., carpentry, auto repair), an  a small
 but growing number are in midlevel supervisory positions
 (e.g., tourist hotels and banks). There is no wage dr
 benefits discrimination for jobs that are performed both by
 men and women. Females comprise over one-third of the
 students in primary school, and, with growing educational
 opportunities, women participate increasingly in the
 professions and in political life. The Minister of Health and
 the Parliamentary Secretary in the President's Office are
 women. In addition, there are women in prominent positions in
 the civil service as department heads and undersecretaries.
 There is a women's bureau in the Office of the President which
 actively promotes debate on women's issues.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 In the small industrial sector of the economy, labor cards
 authorizing employment of youths are generally not issued
 until they reach the age of 16 and never below the age of 14.
 This control on child labor does not apply to customary chores
 on family farms. Minimum wages and hours of work are
 determined by the Joint Industrial Council, pursuant to the
 Labor Administration Act, which has representation from
 employees, employers, and government. These minimum wages,
 however, are well below the actual rates paid in the
 marketplace. For example, the minimum wage for an ordinary
 unskilled laborer is approximately 75 cents per day for an
 8-hour day, but in fact such workers now receive about $2.15
 per day. Occupational safety and health are covered by the
 Factory Act under which the Minister of Labor is given
 authority to regulate factory health and safety, accident
 prevention, and dangerous trades, and to appoint inspectors to
 ensure compliance. However, this system is less than fully
 satisfactory owing to the shortage of inspectors. The
 Government recently announced that it will submit to
 Parliament a new labor code to replace obsolete labor laws and
 improve labor conditions, and an Industrial Injuries
 Compensation Act to replace the existing Workmen's
 Compensation Act. With these changes, the Department of Labor
 will also be strengthened.
