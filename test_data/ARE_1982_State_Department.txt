 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (Emirates) is a federation of seven
 small traditional Arab shaikhdoms, formed in 1971 when Great
 Britain relinquished its 150-year-old special treaty
 relationship with their rulers. The Emirates are unequal in
 size, population, natural resources, and economic development.
 Abu Dhabi, the largest and wealthiest, plays a predominant role
 in the federation. Under Abu Dhabi's ruler, Shaykh Zayid, who
 also is President of the United Arab Emirates, considerable
 progress has been made toward formation of a centralized and
 effective federal government. Nevertheless, individual
 emirates continue to exercise extensive authority over their
 own economic resources and development planning, police and
 security forces, law courts, and social welfare policies.
 The Emirates' Islamic and tribal traditions have shaped its
 outlook on political organization and its national leadership's
 attitude toward human rights. Under the provisional
 Constitution adopted in 1971 and still in effect, political
 control in each emirate remains effectively in the hands of
 hereditary ruling families. The rulers of the seven emirates
 (or their deputies) form the Supreme Council, the Emirates'
 highest executive and legislative body. The Supreme Council
 elects two of its members to be the President and Vice
 President respectively of the Federation. The President in
 turn appoints a prime minister and his cabinet. Since 1971 the
 Ruler of Abu Dhabi has been President, and the Ruler of Dubai
 has been Vice President and -- since 1979 -- Prime Minister. A
 Federal National Assembly of forty members appointed by the
 individual emirate rulers gives advice to the Government on
 legislation and reviews its operations.
 The country has approximately 180,000 citizens playing host to
 900,000 guest workers. UAE foreigners recruited from other
 Arab countries, South Asia, Western Europe, and the United
 States make up most of the work force. Many occupy key
 managerial, professional, and technical posts in the public and
 oil sectors. In order to ensure that individual expatriates do
 not develop a vested interest in the society the Government
 encourages turnover and limits the number of foreign residents
 allowed to bring their dependents. Nationals enjoy important
 benefits and privileges denied to foreign workers, and few
 foreigners are offered citizenship. Nevertheless the large and
 diverse foreign population has stirred up little resentment
 among Emirate citizens because they regard foreign skills and
 labor as essential to their own prosperity. Aliens deemed
 security threats or troublemakers are deported swiftly. Most
 foreign workers find wages and employment opportunities better
 than in their homelands.
 There was little perceptible change in the Emirates' outlook on
 political organization and its attitude toward human rights
 during 1982. The society's basic Islamic and tribal traditions
 can only change gradually. In the long term, however,
 prospects for wider participation in the political process, and
 liberalization of social and governmental institutions remain
 good. At the time of the founding of the Federation in 1971,
 illiteracy and a lack of political consciousness outside of
 tribal affiliation was the norm. Today, education of children
 is compulsory and the literacy rate has risen to 60 percent.
 Thousands of young Emirates' citizens are presently studying at
 colleges in Europe and the U.S. Traditional methods of
 decision-making are very gradually giving way to more formal,
 structured, and modern practices in the context of newly
 established government ministries.

 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There were no reports during 1982 of persons having been killed
 for political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances, clandestine detentions, or secret abductions
 were reported in 1982.
 c. Torture
 The Provisional Constitution prohibits torture. No instances
 of torture have been reported.
 d. Cruel,.Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The provisional Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading
 treatment. Some emirates, notably Abu Dhabi, apply traditional
 Islamic procedures and penalties in criminal cases which are
 tried in religious courts. Other emirates have criminal court
 systems based on European models. Transgression by Muslims of
 Islamic laws (drinking alcohol and publicly violating the
 Ramadan fast) have been punished by public caning. (Caning is
 sometimes added to other sentences for criminal offenses.)
 There were a few instances of public caning administered in
 rape, theft, and murder cases during 1982. In the case of
 foreigners, deportation may occur after service of jail
 sentences. All sentences involving capital punishment must be
 approved by the ruler of the emirate in which the crime
 occurred. No such sentences for capital punishment were issued
 in 1982 and no executions occurred. Theoretically, the
 amputation of a hand for theft may be imposed by the Islamic
 courts, but in practice sentences to imprisonment or
 deportation are imposed instead. Prison conditions, while not
 comfortable due to crowding and lack of air conditioning, are
 tolerable. Prison diet and medical care are adequate.
 Prisoners are allowed visits from family members, lawyers, and,
 if foreigners, consular representatives. There are no reports
 that the authorities condone mistreatment of prisoners or that
 personal abuse is common either during detention or after
 transfer to prison.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The laws of individual emirates prohibit arrest without warrant
 in most cases, and prolonged detention without trial is rare.
 No instance of arrest without warrant or prolonged detention
 was reported in 1982.
 Although the provisional Constitution does not specifically
 guarantee habeas corpus, police generally are required to
 report any arrest to a designated court judge within 24 hours
 of the arrest. The judge determines whether there is enough
 evidence to try the individual who is then either promptly
 brought to trial or released. There is no preventive detention
 in the Emirates.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Emirates' courts provide fair and public trials before
 experienced civil or religious judges. These judges are drawn
 mainly from other Arab countries, since there are few jurists
 
 
 1296
 among Emirate citizens as yet. Since foreign judges are on
 limited employment contracts it is unlikely they are
 independent enough to restrain the Government in a politically-
 sensitive case. The provisional Constitution provides broad
 judicial review powers. Except for cases clearly involving
 considerations of national security, rulers and their
 administrators do respect the independence of the courts. A
 ruler occasionally pardons convicted persons or reduces
 sentences, but then only after the court has completed its
 proceedings.
 There are no jury trials. In civil courts the accused may be
 represented by counsel of his choice, but no public defender
 system exists. Crimes and punishments are defined by law, and
 the accused is presumed innocent until found guilty. In Sharia
 court, counsel is generally not allowed and the definition'of
 crime and punishment is drawn from the Koran and the works of
 religious scholars. Public access to trials involving
 sensitive security or political issues may be restricted. No
 trials of such sensitivity were conducted during 1982. Special
 labor courts have been established to handle disputes between
 workers and employers.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The provisional Constitution guarantees freedom from arbitrary
 search, and presentation of a search warrant is required before
 police officials may enter a home. There have been no reports
 during 1982 of police searches of homes without warrants. In
 prior years, police have been known to conduct searches of
 homes without warrants when the Government considered that
 national security was at stake.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Emirates' citizens are constitutionally guaranteed freedom of
 speech, communication, religion, and assembly "within the
 limits of the law.* Individual citizens can express their
 views on a wide range of public issues without fear of official
 harassment. Radio and television are owned by the Ministry of
 Information and Culture or by individual emirate governments.
 There are both private and semi-official newspapers and
 periodicals. A press law codifies the powers of censorship,
 media closure, and control of reporting. In practice, quiet
 guidance rather than forceful edict sets the media tone. Mild
 criticism of government actions appeared to be permitted,
 particularly if it targets poor execution of government policy
 rather than the policy itself or the motives behind it. For
 example, the Ministry of Health was recently criticized by the
 press for not doing enough to lower infant mortality rates.
 There are no clear guidelines, however, as to what type of
 criticism is "irresponsible" and therefore not permitted. One
 weekly magazine, the "Ai-Azmena Al Arabiyya," was closed in
 early 1982. The paper had been reporting on social
 dissatisfaction within the Emirates and frequently criticized
 other friendly Arab governments in the region. Visits by
 foreign journalists require Ministry of Information approval.
 Books, films, and periodicals are censored for materials
 considered pornographic, derogatory of the Arabs or of Islam,
 favorable to Israel, or critical of the ruling families.
 Enforcement is not rigorous. Because of the loose federal
 structure, material banned from publication or distribution in
 one emirate sometimes appears in another.
 
 
 1297
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Clubs and other organizations must be licensed by the federal
 or emirate governments. Organized public gatherings must have
 a permit. By refusing to issue a license or a permit,
 individual emirates in effect can legally ban political
 activities that worry them. In June and July 1982, police
 officials interrogated a number of Lebanese activists who were
 suspected of organizing clandestine meetings with fellow
 Lebanese expatriates to discuss possible reactions to the
 invasion of Lebanon by Israel. Some of the suspected activists
 were deported. There were also reports of two small, peaceful,
 though illegal, demonstrations by expatriate Iranians in the
 Emirate of Dubai in conjunction with the Iran-Iraq war. Both
 demonstrations were dispersed by police. Three demonstrations
 followed the September 1982 massacres of Palestinian refugees
 in Beirut. They were spontaneous, but peacefully controlled by
 security forces. The largest numbered several thousand persons.
 Labor is not-permitted to organize. There are no legal
 provisions for the right to strike or to engage in collective
 bargaining. Foreign workers dare not strike for fear they
 might be deported. Individual laborers can bring grievances to
 a conciliation committee at the Ministry of Labor where they
 can expect fair rulings. However, due to language barriers and
 lack of knowledge about arbitration procedures, many laborers
 do not utilize this facility.
 The Government is concerned about the labor conditions of
 foreign employees. Knowing that many have been misled by
 unscrupulous labor agents, the Government has tightened up
 considerably on visa procedures and work permits. The
 Government has also brought up to date a labor law covering
 conditions of employment, compensation, inspection, and
 enforcement procedures. Some economic abuse of foreign labor
 continues contrary to Government policy because of lack of
 enforcement.
 I c. Freedom of Religion
 The provisional Constitution establishes Islam as the religion
 of the state. Non-Muslims (virtually all of whom are aliens)
 may practice their faiths so long as this "does not conflict
 with public policy or violate public morals." Christian
 churches and schools are officially tolerated and have in the
 past occasionally received financial support from individual
 rulers. However, 1982 saw stricter controls placed on both.
 Property along the Corniche Road in Abu Dhabi has been re-zoned
 to exclude churches. The two Christian churches presently on
 the Corniche will be rebuilt on new suburban lots provided
 gratis by the Government. The de facto effect of the ordinance
 is to reduce the prominence of the Christian profile along the
 city's principal thoroughfare. Restrictions forbidding
 religious proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims were
 emphasized. The Ministry of Education applied greater pressure
 on private schools to enforce stricter separation of the sexes
 and a general enhancement of the schools' Arabic/Islamic
 studies programs for their Muslim students.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restraints on freedom of movement within the
 country, although visits to certain areas, such as oil
 installations, require prior:permission from security
 authorities. Foreign travel and emigration for all citizens
 are unrestricted. The right of return is extended to all
 citizens.
 
 
 1298
 Although the country does not have formalized procedures for
 handling refugees or applications for political asylum, it has
 traditionally provided a haven for many people of the area who
 left their own countries for economic or political reasons.
 During the past year, many Iranian refugees have sought to
 enter the country, often illegally. Some Iranians have been
 allowed to remain in the country, especially those able to show
 that they face retribution or persecution if repatriated to
 Iran. In such cases permission to remain in the country is not
 usually granted formally -- rather, the persons involved are
 quietly allowed to remain. There have been a few reports,
 however, that boats containing Iranians were turned back by
 Emirates' Coast Guard vessels. The Government rejected the
 asylum request of Iranians who hijacked an Iranian Air Force
 C-130 to Dubai in October 1982. The hijackers were not allowed
 to deplane, and the aircraft landed in a neighboring state.
 The country has extended assistance to specific groups of
 refugees on an ad hoc basis. The Government contributes to the
 UN Relief and Works Agency and the UN High Commissioner for
 Refugees.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The position of the rulers in each emirate is not defined in
 any constitutional document but has evolved from traditional
 authority exercised by patriarchs in nomadic society. While
 primogeniture has some influence, the ruling family generally
 selects its most capable and respected member to wield
 political power. The leading clan within the tribal society,
 in turn, owes its position among other clans to its reputation
 for responsiveness and fairness in settling disputes and
 providing leadership. Intermarriage between the ruling family
 and influential families in other clans creates a web of
 informal channels that form the traditional basis for political
 participation. Rulers try to find a consensus before acting, a
 decision-making style that, while indecisive at times, rarely
 leads to harsh measures toward anyone within the tribe.
 Additionally, the tradition that any member of the society may
 petition the ruler in person keeps him from becoming remote and
 absolute.
 The provisional Constitution, adopted in 1971 and still in
 force, left intact the traditional political system in the
 Emirates and in effect extended it to the Federal level.
 Executive and legislative powers remain firmly in the hands of
 the seven rulers meeting as the Supreme Council of the
 Federation who choose one of their number to act as Chief of
 State and appoint a cabinet. To supplement traditional
 channels of political consultation, the provisional
 Constitution has established an advisory National Consultative
 Council whose 40 members are appointed by the individual rulers
 in numbers proportionate to the size and importance of their
 emirates. The National Consultative Council is consulted on
 all laws passed by the Council of Ministers. Its views are not
 constitutionally binding upon the Government but in practice
 are given serious consideration.
 So far there appears to be little pressure from United Arab
 Emirates citizens for formal democratic institutions. An
 expanding economic pie and the large number of expatriate
 workers have left the citizenry a privileged class and few feel
 aggrieved. Suffrage does not exist for either men or women.
 Women play no public role. Foreigners, who form the bulk of
 the population, are expected to refrain from political
 activities and jeopardize their residence status if they become
 
 
 1299
 so involved. Since most are on bachelor status and intend to
 return home with their savings, few seem to miss having a
 political input. Freedom House, in its 1982 report, classifies
 the Emirates as "Partly Free."
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The UAE is responsive to foreign criticism of its human rights
 performance. Sensitivity to allegations of mistreatment of
 lower income foreign workers has resulted in efforts to give
 this group more legal protection. No human rights group
 visited the country in 1982. Amnesty International noted no
 outstanding cases of concern in its 1982 report.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Although income from oil exports declined slightly during 1982
 due to a slack world market, the Government still has ample
 funds for economic and social development. Oil revenue for
 1981 was $20 billion, making the per capita gross national
 product one of the highest in the world -- over $27,000. The
 per capita income of immigrant laborers from the Asian
 subcontinent is far below the average, but still is often three
 times more than most could earn in their native countries.
 Medical treatment is free to all citizens and foreigners
 alike. Within the last decade, life expectancy for Emirates
 citizens has been increased from 55.4 years to 62.4 years, due
 to better health care and improved sanitary conditions. The
 1981 UN population data shows infant mortality at 65 per 1,000
 live births. This figure has aroused public concern and has
 prompted the Ministry of Health to review child care practices
 regarding sanitation and nutrition.
 Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the most industrialized of the Emirates,
 have undertaken programs to expand the number of low-cost
 housing units. Water and electricity are provided residential
 users at subsidized prices. With only limited arable land and
 sparse water resources, the Emirates must import most of its
 food and desalinate its water. Almost the entire population
 has access to safe drinking water. Citizens, and in some cases
 foreigners, are allowed to buy basic commodities at subsidized
 prices.
 Education is free for all academically qualified children --
 both citizen and non-citizen. It is compulsory for nationals
 from the ages of six to twelve. Within the last two years,
 there has been an expansion of teacher training programs and a
 massive building program for new schools.
 There are now some 73,505 children of all nationalities
 attending 283 primary and secondary schools in the Emirates.
 The most reliable estimates put the literacy rate at over
 60 percent. Girls account for approximately 48 percent of the
 students enrolled in primary schools. Family conservatism and
 the tradition of girls marrying in their early teens have
 prevented many women from continuing their education beyond the
 primary level. This, in turn, has limited the role of female
 citizens in the economicand cultural life of the country. The
 Government is encouraging young women to pursue their
 education, and women are beginning to find jobs in the news
 media and government offices, as well as in health and
 education.
 
 
 1300
 The largest economic enterprises are state-owned or combine
 state ownership with private equity participation. Otherwise,
 commerce is relatively unrestricted except for laws designed to
 ensure that the Emirates' nationals share in and control the
 country's economic expansion. Citizen and non-citizen rights
 to private property are protected under both religious and
 secular law. In accordance with both Islamic law and local
 custom, the title to previously unclaimed real property is
 vested in the rulers who, in turn, sell or allocate land to
 Emirates citizens. Citizens are also given preference in the
 issuance of business licenses or the right to buy shares in
 semi-public enterprises.
