 IVORY COAST
 The Ivory Coast is a one party state. Power is concentrated
 within the party whose longtime leader is President Houphouet-
 Boigny. The party seeks to develop a broad consensus for
 its program of socio-economic development. This consensus
 was reinforced in 1980 by holding competitive elections
 for party, legislative and municipal posts, and by more
 open discussions in 1981 within the institutions to which
 candidates were elected. Economic growth has permitted
 appreciable improvement in the standard of living and has
 contributed to widespread support for the policies of the
 Ivorian government. The Ivory Coast remains a developing
 country in which it is difficult to supply the vital needs
 of some of its people. The Ivory Coast generally seeks to
 involve dissenters in the operations of the system, rather
 than to isolate or imprison them.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Ivorian penal code prohibits the use of violence by
 officials unless there is legitimate justification. It does
 not, however, specifically mention torture, nor does it
 define what constitutes "legitimate justification' or a
 legitimate level of violence officials may use. There have
 been no reports of torture in the Ivory Coast.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Although capital punishment is not legally prohibited, it
 has not been used since independence. In February 1981, 46
 or more Ghanaian residents of the Ivory Coast, who had been
 rounded up for identity checks, suffocated after being
 placed overnight in a small, poorly ventilated cell. The
 Ivorian Government condemned this tragedy and arrested the
 Gendarme Lieutenant responsible. Systematically cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment of individuals or prison
 inmates is not known to occur, but foreign Africans are
 likely to be treated more roughly by police than their
 Ivorian counterparts and lower-level officials sometimes
 beat prisoners despite official orders to the contrary.
 Prisoners are allowed visits from attorneys of their choice
 and family members, who frequently provide food to supple-
 ment the sparse prison diet. Prison conditions are poor.
 There is no evidence of discriminatory treatment of prisoners
 on the basis of sex, ethnicity or race.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no reports of any cases of abduction, secret
 arrestor clandestine detention. There have been no allega-
 tions of persons disappearing.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Ivorian constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit
 arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and they rarely occur. The
 government does occasionally detain individuals it believes
 may be security threats, sometimes for several months or
 more. It also takes firm measures against acts it considers
 threats to internal security.
 In May 1981 Amnesty International appealed to the Ivorian
 government to release a group of approximately 20 television
 and radio employees who had been drafted into the army
 following a strike. They were released in September and
 returned to their jobs. A letter from an anonymous Ivorian
 published in a French newspaper alleged that eight persons
 thought to be leftists had been incarcerated for some months
 without specific charges having been brought against them
 and without having recourse to defense counsel. An individual
 who attempted to file his candidacy for the presidential
 elections in 1980 allegedly was placed in a military prison.
 There are reports that an individual who threw a fire bomb
 in the direction of President Houphouet-Boigny has been
 held without charges since January 1981.
 Under the Ivorian penal code, a public prosecutor can detain
 a suspect for up to 48 hours without bringing charges. Any
 further detention must be ordered by a magistrate. Magistrates
 can authorize periods of detention of up to four months, but
 must provide to the minister of justice a monthly written
 explanation of why the detention should be continued.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial exists and appears to be
 respected. In most rural areas, however, justice is often
 administered at the village level through traditional tribal
 institutions. The judiciary is independent of the executive
 and military and that independence is broadly respected.
 Defendants have the right to legal counsel and the Ivorian
 judicial system provides court-appointed attorneys for
 indigent defendants, although in practice such attorneys are
 not readily available. Appeals of verdicts of civilian
 courts are made to the court of appeals. Civilians are not
 tried by military courts. There is no structure of appeals
 courts within the military justice system. Persons convicted
 by a military tribunal may request the Supreme Court to set
 aside the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Code of Penal Procedure specifies the conditions for
 entry into a private residence. A policeman or investigat-
 ing magistrate may conduct searches of homes without a
 warrant, if he has reason to believe there is evidence
 concerning a crime on the premises. He must have the
 prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized in the
 search. He is required to have witnesses to the search,
 which may not take place between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and
 4:00 a.m.
 
 
 121
 Legal safeguards against arbitrary searches are generally
 respected in the modern parts of cities. In less developed
 urban sectors and in rural areas legal safeguards are
 sometimes ignored.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Within the framework of the one party state, there is a
 large measure of freedom of speech and complete freedom of
 religion. There is freedom of assembly except when the
 government perceives a significant and immediate danger to
 public order. In such cases the government prohibits
 meetings, and arrests persons disregarding its orders.
 All Ivorian news media are owned or controlled by the
 ministry of information. Criticism is permitted. In
 practice this means there is regular criticism of the
 shortcomings of policy execution, but not of the policies
 themselves. Foreign publications are readily available and
 are not seized, even when they criticize the Ivorian govern-
 ment, the party and the president. The authorities attempt
 to suppress distribution of the occasional locally produced
 antigovernment tracts that appear.
 A government-sponsored umbrella union, whose leaders occupy
 important positions in the top organs of the country's
 single political party, organizes and directs unions. The
 right to strike exists in theory, but strikes are discouraged
 in practice. A threatened strike by Public Health Service
 employees in July 1981 was quashed when the party political
 bureau issued a statement threatening strikers with being
 drafted into the military and with other, unspecified
 sanctions. Wildcat strikes occur occasionally. If there
 appears to be a threat to public order, the strikers or their
 leaders might be detained temporarily. Generally, the
 government negotiates with the strikers and resolves at
 least some of their economic grievances. There have been no
 reports that professional groups have experienced persecution
 or harassment, but the government does make an effort to bring
 them under its wing or that of the party so as to ensure
 that their activities are consonant with the party lines.
 There is no favored religion. Those affiliated with minority
 religions do not suffer persecution or harassment.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Ivorians have the right of voluntary repatriation. Ivory
 Coast's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The
 country has resettled or granted safehaven to Angolans,
 Eritreans, Guineans, Liberians and Indochinese. The Ivorian
 government issues them refugee travel documents which permit
 them to return to Ivory Coast within two years. While in
 the' Ivory Coast, they receive one year renewable residents'
 visas for their first five years in the country, after which
 they may apply for permanent residents' cards. The Ivory
 Coast does not take any significant responsibility to
 provide for the economic and social welfare of refugees.
 
 
 122
 The government exercises minimal control over domestic
 and foreign travel. Checkpoints operate regularly outside
 major urban areas for verification of personal identification,
 motor vehicle licenses, insurance papers and other documents.
 Ivorians can freely travel abroad and emigrate.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation in the Ivory Coast is limited to the
 single Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI). President
 Houphouet-Boigny launched a wide-ranging program of democra-
 tization in 1980. There was intense competition in the
 party elections and about 50 percent of the top local party
 leaders were voted out of office. In November 1980, contested
 municipal and national legislative elections also resulted
 in a significant turnover of elected officials. The newly
 elected officials have since been seen to work in their
 constituents' interests vigorously, and debate within the
 institutions in which they serve has been more open than in
 the preceding sessions.
 Public criticism of basic governmental policies, or of the
 President, rarely occurs. Unions and professional and other
 associations serve as channels for citizen participation,
 articulating the interests of their constituents. The
 president meets with these associations to try to resolve
 significant or difficult issues.
 Some Ivorian traditional societies accord women considerable
 political and economic power. In other fields their role is
 more restricted. The October 1980 party congress devoted
 a separate section of its final resolutions to reiterating
 and strengthening the official policy of encouraging full
 participation by women in social, economic and political
 life. Women remain, however, very lightly represented
 at the higher levels of the government and the party.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government of the Ivory Coast is cooperative toward
 inquiries into its human rights situation. However, in June
 1981 the Ivorian minister of information, speaking for the
 government, denied an Amnesty International report that
 television and radio workers who had been drafted into the
 army after a strike were political prisoners. The Ivory
 Coast has a chapter of Amnesty International. The Ivory
 Coast delegation to the United Nations Commission on Human
 Rights has played an active and constructive role in the
 activities of that body.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Per capita GNP in the Ivory Coast rose from US $520 in 1970
 to US $1040 in 1979. Life expectancy increased from 42.5
 years to 47 years in the same period. The adult literacy
 rate was 20 percent in 1976, while annual population
 growth rates have gone from 3.7 percent in the 1960's to 5.5
 percent in the 1970's. On the average, 19 percent of all
 Ivorians have access to potable drinking water, but there is
 
 
 123
 a large discrepancy between urban access (50 percent)
 and rural access (5 percent).
 The Ivory Coast's population of over eight million includes
 at least two million foreign Africans, 100,000 Lebanese,
 perhaps 65,000 French, and small numbers of other Europeans,
 North Americans, and Asians. A great disparity exists
 between the standard of living of expatriates and the
 African elites on the one hand, and the urban poor on the
 other. Nonetheless, there is a sizable growing urban Ivorian
 middle class and living conditions in the villages have
 improved markedly and steadily during the Ivory Coast's 21
 years as an independent state. Most villages have wells,
 and at least three years of primary education are offered in
 all but the smallest communities. Efforts are being made to
 consolidate small villages to the minimum size necessary to
 provide education, health and other public services. The
 country has constructed an excellent nationwide network of
 paved highways and nearly, all Ivorians have access to
 motorized transportation.
 The Ivory Coast has an adequate measure of food self-
 sufficiency. While perhaps 50 percent of the rice, 75
 percent of red meat, and 100 percent of the wheat is
 imported, ample-supplies of traditional starches,
 vegetables, fish, and other proteins are available and
 affordable. Although malnutrition sometimes occurs, there
 is no evidence of starvation.
 Better-paying government and private sector jobs seem to be
 concentrated among the minority Muslim (25 percent) and
 Christian (15 percent) populations, a phenomenon more
 related to urbanization and access to education than to. a
 systematic pattern of discrimination. On the other hand,
 the government's policy of Ivorianization requires that all
 positions be offered to Ivorians before foreigners and
 essentially keeps foreign Africans from most wage and salary
 jobs in the modern-sector. Education absorbs some 30-40
 percent of the operating budget and is generally available
 to all children, Ivorian and foreign, boys and girls.
