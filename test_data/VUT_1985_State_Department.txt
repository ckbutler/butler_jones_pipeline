 VANUATU
 Vanuatu is a Southwest Pacific island nation which became
 independent in 1980 following more than 70 years of joint
 British-French rule. It has a parliamentary system of
 government. Independence was accompanied by temporary
 political turbulence, including an attempt at secession, which
 left a legacy of suspicion of outside interference. However,
 most of the internal strains from the 1980 secessionist
 rebellion have subsided.
 Political legitimacy in Vanuatu is based on majority rule,
 supported by both Melanesian and Western tradition. The first
 general election since independence, held in November 1983,
 was vigorously contested and democratically conducted. The
 courts are independent and solicitous of individual rights.
 The police and military are under civilian control.
 The Vanuatu economy resembles that of other Pacific island
 states in its dependence on international trade and its
 vulnerability to shifts in world market prices. Tourism earns
 more foreign exchange than all exports combined. Vanuatu has
 gained some revenue as a tax haven. Until recently, attempts
 to attract foreign investment have been hampered by
 uncertainty over land rights. A land law was enacted in 1983
 in an effort to resolve this problem.
 The favorable human rights situation in Vanuatu remained
 unchanged in 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Due process is strictly observed. Neither the Government nor
 any organized group resorts to political violence.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of politically motivated
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Constitutional guarantees against torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment are complied with in practice and
 enforced by the courts. Prisoners also have recourse to an
 Ombudsman.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no politically motivated arrests in Vanuatu. Arrest
 is by warrant. There is no exile. Suspects have free access
 to a lawyer of their choice. The constitutional guarantee
 that suspects will be informed of charges and given a speedy
 hearing before a judge is observed. The use of forced or
 compulsory labor is not permitted and there have been no
 reports of either practice.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a fair public
 trial, presumption of innocence until proof of guilt,
 prohibition against double jeopardy, the right of habeas
 corpus, and appeal to the Supreme Court.
 The courts are independent of military or executive
 interference. There were no reports in 1985 of arbitrary or
 unfair exercise of judicial authority.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Sanctity of the home and family and privacy of correspondence
 are observed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution. The
 Government, however, publishes and controls the country's only
 national newspaper and manages the national radio station.
 There is no independent television or commercial radio.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political
 parties or trade unions in Vanuatu. There are two main
 political parties and a relatively new smaller party. To an
 extent unusual among Pacific Island states, the ruling
 Vanua'atu party is the primary policy-making body, whose
 decisions are then implemented by the Government.
 Vanuatu has a small but active trade union movement with the
 right to organize, strike, and bargain collectively. As of
 1984, there were 21 registered trade unions and 6 employer
 associations. In February 1984, a labor council, called the
 Vanuatu Trade Union Congress, was formed and became a member
 of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is protected by law and respected in
 practice. Missionaries of various Christian denominations
 work without restriction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Vanuatu citizens are free to travel domestically and
 abroad. There are no bars to returning home from abroad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Vanuatu is a multiparty democracy. Numerous candidates
 competed in the parliamentary elections in 1983; both the
 campaign and voting were considered by outside observers to
 have been fair. Elections to provincial and local councils
 have also been contested and fair.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has publicly expressed willingness to permit
 investigation by qualified and objective outside observers.
 There were no charges of human rights violations in 1985. The
 1985 Amnesty International Report does not have an entry for
 Vanuatu. Freedom House rates it "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population was estimated to be 132,000 in 1985 and the
 growth rate 3.2 percent. Per capita gross national product
 (GNP) was $801 in 1982. Buoyed by tourism, which has expanded
 steadily since independence, the economy weathered the recent
 international recession with few problems. Communal land
 ownership by clans was thought to be a hindrance to economic
 development but a system of land leasing has been implemented
 in an attempt to ameliorate that problem.
 Government services are provided without discrimination.
 According to 1985 statistics, infant mortality was 78.2 per
 1,000 live births and life expectancy at birth was 55.61
 years. For the period 1980-1982, the calorie supply was
 estimated by the World Bank as being 98 percent of
 requirements. The Bank estimated that in 1980 around 55
 percent of the population had access to safe water (65 percent
 in urban areas). According to government statistics for 1979,
 37.3 percent of the population was literate. The primary
 school enrollment ratio for 1981 was 108 percent.
 In 1985 a minimum wage law was adopted. There is also
 legislation regulating conditions of work, including hours,
 and with provisions concerning child labor. No information is
 available on occupational safety and health legislation.
 Women have equal rights under the law, but traditional culture
 has hampered them from moving into leadership roles. The only
 female candidate for Parliament in the 1983 election was
 defeated by a small margin. However, several women hold
 senior positions in the Government.
