 NIGER
 Niger is ruled by an authoritarian military-civilian regime
 headed by General Ali Saibou, who took power following the
 death of the former President in 1987. A new Constitution was
 promulgated and approved in a September 24, 1989, referendum,
 establishing a secular one-party state, and replacing the
 Supreme Military Council with a joint civilian and military
 Superior Council of National Orientation, dominated by the
 military, as the nation's highest political body-.
 Presidential and legislative elections in December 1989
 offered voters only a yes or no choice on the nominees
 selected by the sole political party, the National Movement
 for the Development of Society (MNSD).
 Nigerian security organizations include the armed forces;
 paramilitary forces; the Directorate of State Security, which
 reports directly to the President; and the National Police,
 which is responsible for maintaining public order and
 countering antigovernment activity. Various elements of the
 security forces have been responsible for human rights abuses.
 Niger's economy is based largely on subsistence farming,
 livestock raising, and some of the world's largest uranium
 deposits. In the small, modern sector, the Government is
 attempting to reduce the number of state-owned firms and to
 encourage a greater role for private business. Cycles of
 drought, desertification, a 3.1 percent population growth
 rate, and the declining world demand for uranium since the
 early 1980's have undercut an already marginal economy.
 Assisted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World
 Bank, the Government continued to implement an austerity
 economic reform program in 1990, which met increased public
 opposition.
 In 1990 human rights remained restricted, despite extensive
 guarantees in the new Constitution of citizens' rights,
 including freedom of speech and press. The Government used
 extrajudicial actions, including killings, in responding to
 Tuareg attacks in the north, and excessive force in countering
 student demonstrations. Public unrest and demands for a
 multiparty system grew in 1990 and led the MNSD. and the
 Government to agree to amend the Constitution to permit
 multiple parties. On November 15, President Saibou announced
 his support for a multiparty system and outlined a calendar of
 political events through 1991, including legitimation of
 parties, revision of the Constitution, a national political
 conference, and new legislative elections.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The Government acknowledged that, in responding to Tuareg
 attacks on government facilities in May, government forces
 killed 54 Tuareg assailants. According to the Government, the
 Tuaregs killed nine persons, including some security
 officials. Some credible reports indicate that the military
 and paramilitary units used excessive and brutal force in
 responding to the attacks and engaged in extrajudicial killing
 (see also Section 1. c.).
 
 
 274
 NIGER
 Amnesty International (AI) reported that 20 Tuaregs were
 killed while building a house and 3 others were executed after
 they had been arrested in the Tuareg town of Tchin-Tabaradene,
 the site of a successful Tuareg raid in which several
 gendarmes were killed.
 While no confirmed data are available, some observers fixed
 the number of deaths caused by government forces in Tuareg
 towns and villages during this period at between 200 and 300.
 AI's estimate is that extrajudicial executions may have
 exceeded 100. The Government reportedly prepared, but had not
 published at year's end, investigatory reports of these
 incidents, including on the military's actions in the area.
 Violent student protests in early 1990 resulted in the deaths
 of several students on February 9 when security forces fired
 on student marchers in Niamey. Reports of the number of
 deaths vary between the official count of 3 and allegations of
 up to 20. Although the Government issued a statement
 expressing the President's regret over the security forces'
 actions, it also warned that the instigators of the
 demonstrations would be punished. The Government announced it
 had detained some security officials involved in the incident
 and intended to bring responsible security officials to trial,
 but there were no formal announcements of proceedings against
 specific officials by the end of 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated abductions or
 disappearances in 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Government's policy banning physical abuse of prisoners
 and detainees appears to be applied in most cases, with the
 notable exception of insurgent Tuaregs. Tracts produced by
 Tuareg groups and others have accused the security forces of
 using torture and other degrading punishments during
 interrogations, including public beatings while naked and
 electric shock treatments. AI reported that at least 30
 Tuaregs arrested in Agadez were subjected to torture and that
 another 380 Tuareg were reportedly detained in the Tahoua army
 barracks where torture is believed to be used. Government
 officials denied these allegations. Reportedly, some Tuaregs
 also died as a result of this torture, but firm information is
 lacking, in part due to the Government's failure to make
 public the results of its investigation after the May attacks.
 There were no other reliable reports of systematic torture of
 prisoners or detainees during the year, but occasional abuses
 by individual law enforcement or prison officers probably
 occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although the 1989 Constitution specifically prohibits
 arbitrary detention, this prohibition is not always respected
 in practice.  Once an arrest is made, the law requires that
 the suspect be either charged or released within 48 hours.
 This period may be extended for another 48 hours by the public
 prosecutor, who is also the head of the judicial police. In
 practice, delays beyond the established 48-hour periods
 
 
 275
 NIGER
 frequently occur, and prisoners often spend months in jail
 awaiting trial. Failure of the police or public prosecutor to
 respect the 48-hour rule does not invalidate the case against
 a suspect. Preventive detention is permitted under the law
 but must be ordered by an examining magistrate. Suspects are
 held in preventive detention or more often released on
 provisional liberty for the duration of the magistrate's
 investigation of the case, which may take as long as 1 year.
 Defendants are allowed access to a lawyer of their own
 choice. Bail is available for crimes carrying a penalty of
 less than 10 years of imprisonment.
 Despite these legal safeguards, in 1990 the police conducted
 sweeps of the market areas in Niamey to check
 identifications. At least 40 persons were sent to prison
 farms, without due process, for 3 to 6 months.
 Many reports indicated that government forces arbitrarily
 arrested Tuaregs in 1990. The Government admitted that more
 than 70 Tuaregs were arrested for alleged involvement in the
 Tuareg raids; it directly implicated 7 of them in the armed
 attack at Tchin-Tabaradene, including former Minister Mohamed
 Abdoulaye. It released the seven in August, asserting that
 although they masterminded the Tchin-Tabaradene attack, they
 did not participate in it. AI reports that at least 400
 people, most of them Tuaregs, were arrested, although the
 majority were believed to have been released without charge or
 trial. At the end of 1990, the 70 remained in detention; the
 Government had not indicated whether they had been charged,
 despite the legal requirement that persons suspected of
 security offenses be charged within 5 days.
 Officials denied that the Government is holding political
 detainees or prisoners, and there are no other known political
 prisoners.
 The Government used short-term detentions to counter the
 expression of controversial views. In 1990 the editor of a
 new, twice-monthly newspaper, whose first edition was
 extremely critical of the Government, was briefly called into
 police offices for questioning. Many student leaders,
 professors, and trade unionists were also detained briefly
 during student strikes in Niamey and other cities. Professor
 Sanoussi Jackov was briefly detained without charge for his
 alleged role in instigating the February demonstration which
 ended in the shooting death of at least 3 students. A British
 Broadcasting Corporation correspondent was held for a short
 period for filming the February 9 student demonstration.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control in Niger,
 but persons have voluntarily exiled themselves.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Niger's legal system is an amalgam of French, Islamic, and
 customary law. Civil and criminal cases not involving
 security-related acts are tried publicly. Defendants have the
 right to be present at their trials, to confront witnesses,
 and to present evidence. The new Constitution reaffirms the
 judicial principle of presumption of innocence. The Supreme
 Court was formally established late in 1990. Defendants have
 the right to counsel at public expense if they are minors or
 if they are indigent and face the prospect of a sentence of 10
 years or more. Both the defendant and the prosecutor may
 appeal the verdict, first to the Court of Appeals and then to
 
 
 276
 NIGER
 the highest court, the Supreme Court. Both courts are obliged
 to hear appeals. The Court of Appeals reviews both questions
 of fact and law while the Supreme Court limits its review to
 questions of law. In 1990, under the new Constitution, the
 Supreme Court replaced the State Court as the highest court,
 and it reviews the decisions of the Court of Appeals.
 The Constitution calls for an independent judiciary but makes
 the President, as Chief Executive, the guarantor of this
 judicial independence. In practice, the Government intervenes
 in the judicial process in political cases. The President has
 the right to pardon persons convicted in criminal cases and
 invokes this right on frequent occasions. At the village
 level, matters such as property disputes are frequently
 resolved by traditional courts. The judiciary is handicapped
 by a shortage of trained personnel and legal facilities, such
 as an inadequate number of copies of the civil and criminal
 code.
 Security-related cases are tried in the State Security Court,
 which operates outside the normal criminal law framework. This
 Court has been in existence since independence in 1960. Its
 judges are nominated for specific sessions and limited periods
 of time. According to the Ministry of Justice, a military
 officer presides, but this Court also includes civilian
 magistrates. It affords the defendant the same legal rights as
 in a criminal case, with the exception of the right to a public
 trial; its deliberations are held in secret. The Tuareg
 detainees will be the first cases brought before this Court
 since 1988. Human rights groups, including Al, have criticized
 this Court's secret proceedings as not in accordance with
 international standards of fair trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The police are required to have a search warrant to enter homes
 except in cases involving major crimes, when they are permitted
 to enter at any time. Search warrants do not permit searches
 between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Violations of privacy,
 such as interference with correspondence, are illegal but are
 presumed to occur.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The new Constitution affirms the citizen's right to freedom of
 opinion, thought, expression, and press but does not
 specifically prohibit the Government from banning material it
 deems offensive. President Saibou has said repeatedly that
 free expression of all political opinions will be allowed
 within the sole political party, the MNSD. In practice,
 however, there are definite restrictions on freedom of speech
 and press. Major print and electronic media are government
 owned and controlled. Limited criticism of certain government
 officials and policies is allowed, but attacks on the Chief of
 State, his major policies, or the legitimacy of the regime are
 not tolerated. Journalists practice self-censorship to comply
 with these restrictions.
 In 1990 the trade unions of Niger officially requested access
 to the media to express their opinions. President Saibou
 publicly denied the request and stated that the media were
 government organs. Government-controlled media did not report
 
 
 277
 NIGER
 the killing of student demonstrators in February until 30 hours
 after the incident, even though the international media had
 earlier reported the event. Circulation of political tracts
 which generally criticized the Government for alleged
 corruption, abuse of power, subversion of democracy, brutal
 repression, and mismanagement increased greatly. The
 Government vociferously attacked these tracts and their authors
 in the media and arrested government officials who were
 suspected of releasing a World Bank letter which was included
 in a political tract.
 The country's first independent newspaper, Haske, which is
 highly critical of the Government, appeared in 1990. It is
 printed in Benin but freely distributed in Niger. Its candid
 first issue sparked a fire-storm of criticism from the official
 daily newspaper and electronic media which contended that
 freedom of the press did not imply the right to criticize the
 Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although Niger's new Constitution authorizes freedom of
 assembly and association, these rights are restricted in
 practice. In February security officials threatened to beat
 students if they carried out their plans for a demonstration.
 When the students ignored the warnings and marched into Niamey,
 at least three were shot and killed by security authorities.
 These killings and the Government's apparent lack of progress
 in bringing those responsible to justice caused frequent
 demonstrations and strikes by students, teachers, university
 professors, and trade unions. On February 16, approximately
 10,000 people marched in the largest demonstration since
 independence to protest the security forces' action. Police
 did not intervene, and there were no casualties. Large-scale
 demonstrations and brief general strikes and student strikes
 continued throughout the year, despite a government ban on
 student demonstrations issued in April. In some instances,
 police allowed protests to continue unhindered. In others, the
 police moved in with tear gas and force, for example,
 forcefully dispersing a National Union of Nigerien Workers
 rally in June. The Government entered into separate
 negotiations with trade unionists and students to discuss
 outstanding grievances. In November the Government agreed to
 move toward a multiparty system and to reconsider economic
 austerity measures (see Section 3).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Niger is a secular state. While the population is nominally
 over 90 percent Muslim, the Government permits the practice of
 other religious beliefs. Foreign missionaries may live, work,
 and travel in Niger but must obtain permission from the
 Ministry of Interior for their operations. Religious groups
 are allowed to maintain links with fellow believers in other
 countries. Religious groups may maintain places of worship,
 train clergy, publish religious material, provide religious
 education, and participate in charitable activities if properly
 registered.
 The Government, concerned by Islamic fundamentalist violence
 that erupts periodically in nearby northern Nigeria, monitors
 Muslim religious activity through the Islamic Association.
 This Association, funded by the Government, assists in
 
 
 278
 NIGER
 informally screening local religious leaders. Islamic services
 that go beyond strictly religious subjects are not permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Niger is monitored. Police checks, often.
 entailing thorough searches, take place upon entering or
 leaving major towns and cities. The requirement for an exit
 visa to leave Niger has been abolished. Neither emigration nor
 repatriation are restricted. By law, a married woman must have
 the permission of her husband to travel abroad.
 Niger is a party to the U.N. Convention and Protocol Relating
 to the Status of Refugees and has cooperated with the U.N. High
 Commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) in handling the few
 registered refugees currently in Niger.
 In December over 2,000 Chadians took refuge in Niger as a
 result of the fighting in Chad. UNHCR and other organizations
 investigated the situation. Many donors provided relief and
 assistance. By'year's end, nearly half of the refugees
 returned to Chad, and most of the rest were expected to return
 soon.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In 1990 citizens did not have the right to change their
 government through peaceful means. The armed forces, under
 President Saibou, continued to dominate the State. Niger's
 1989 Constitution calls for a one-party state and a strong
 presidency. In 1990 the Government agreed to introduce
 amendments to the Constitution; if approved as scheduled in
 1991 and fully implemented, the amendments would provide for a
 multiparty system.
 Recurrent student unrest and strikes by trade unions, which
 initially protested economic problems and the Government's
 proposed austerity programs, expanded into a broader political
 protest and demands for multiparty democracy. Initially the
 Government claimed that Niger's development problems were too
 severe to permit the "luxury of multiple political parties."
 However, as interest in political pluralism grew in 1990, the
 Government appointed a commission to study ways of promoting
 freedom of political expression and democracy. In November
 President Ali Saibou announced that the Government would accept
 the commission's recommendations and would submit draft
 amendments to the Constitution in 1991 to permit multiple
 parties. He called for the holding of a national conference
 after political parties are established. President Saibou also
 directed the Prime Minister to reconsider austerity measures
 and propose alternatives that would be more acceptable to the
 Nigerien people. By the end of 1990, however, no specific
 alternatives were announced.
 Under the 1989 Constitution legislative and presidential
 elections are to be held every 5 and 7 years respectively. The
 Constitution limits a president to two terms. President Saibou
 heads both the Superior Council for National Orientation and
 the National Executive Bureau (BEN), two new institutions, and
 appoints all eight prefects (regional governors), who until
 1989 were all military officers. In 1990 two prefects were
 civilians. While the announced purpose of these two new
 institutions was to increase consultation with, and
 
 
 279
 NIGER
 participation by, civilians in government, interest groups
 increasingly criticized them, charging that they eliminated
 competition from other political organizations and protected
 the military's political power. In November the BEN called on
 the Government to improve efficiency, eliminate corruption,
 recover unpaid taxes, and punish transgressors.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no domestic groups that monitor the human rights
 situation in Niger, and Niger is not active in regional and
 international human rights organizations. However, the
 Government cooperates with international human rights groups
 and answers inquiries on the status of prisoners. French State
 Secretary for Humanitarian Action Bernard Kouchner visited
 Niger in 1990 to discuss the human rights situation,
 particularly the Tuareg issue. The Nigerien Parliament also
 invited European parliamentarians to Niger for this purpose.
 After AI accused the Government of human rights abuses against
 the Tuaregs, the Government invited an AI delegation to visit
 Niger and investigate, but AI had not sent a delegation by the
 end of the year.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Members of the Djerma ethnic group, while only one-fifth of the
 population, nevertheless dominate the civil service and
 military officer corps. Over 50 percent of the population are
 members of the Hausa ethnic group. Student tracts criticized
 Djerma domination of government. The two primary nomadic
 groups, Tuaregs and Fulani (Peul), have less access to
 government services, partly because their lifestyles make it
 difficult for the Government to supply them with services.
 By tradition and practice, and through some aspects of Islamic
 law, women occupy a subordinate place in Nigerien society.
 Males have considerable advantages in terms of education,
 employment, and property rights. Eighty percent of the
 children finishing elementary school are male. Niger's
 traditions incline employers to favor men as employees.
 Employers claim that labor laws that are intended to protect
 pregnant women by regulating their work hours and ability to
 leave a position without notice raise the cost of employing a
 woman versus an equally qualified man. Islamic law influences
 inheritance laws; for example, males are given preference in
 inheritance cases.
 The Government has begun work on a new family code, has tried
 to provide better employment opportunities to women, and has
 supported a national women's association. women are paid
 comparable wages to that of men and they are active in
 government and the business community. The first professional
 associations of women traders, educators, and bankers were
 formed in 1988. The women's organization develops commercial
 cooperatives and social programs for women. About one-third of
 Nigerien doctors are women, and many of the nation's
 magistrates are women.
 The Government continues to encourage family planning and in
 1988 legalized the use of contraceptives. Abortion on demand
 remains illegal and is likely to remain so because of religious
 
 
 NIGER
 strictures. Female genital mutilation (circumcision) occurs
 but is limited to a few small ethnic groups. Niger has
 participated in international conferences on this subject but
 does not regard it as a major domestic problem. Neither the
 Government nor the women's association has addressed the issue
 publicly.
 Violence occurs against women and children and includes wife
 beating, but the extent of this problem is unknown. Such
 violence is considered antisocial behavior in Nigerien society,
 and women often turn to both traditional and modern judicial
 authorities in cases of abuse. The new family code
 specifically addresses domestic violence and strengthens
 existing legal provisions in this area. A Ministry of Social
 and Women's Affairs, created in 1989 and headed by Niger's
 first female cabinet minister, has a broad mandate to improve
 the position of women in society. The Associatiop of Nigerien
 Women focused on the topic of violence against women at several
 of its conferences, which received substantial publicity in the
 government-controlled media.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Approximately 90 percent of Niger's work force is employed in
 the largely subsistence rural sector. In the small modern
 economy, workers have the right to establish and join trade
 unions that are organized under an umbrella group, the National
 Union of Nigerien Workers (USTN). The USTN, whose head is
 freely elected by its members, represents about 30 percent of
 the approximately 60,000 salaied workers in Niger.
 The USTN is nominally independent but is partially funded by
 the Government. The USTN has an observer in the MNSD but is
 not part of the party structure. In fact, the USTN's vocal
 opposition to government pol-icies increased sharply in 1990.
 Strikes in Niger are legal if conciliation and mediation
 procedures have been exhausted. Labor unrest during 1990,
 guided by the USTN, grew significantly and frequently brought
 business and transportation to a halt. Strikes by bank
 employees, miners, airline employees, government workers, and
 truck drivers, as well as brief but frequent general strikes,
 were successfully held to protest the implementation of major
 retrenchment policies by the Government to meet IMF and World
 Bank programs. After the student shooting incident in
 February, trade unionists broadened their protests to include
 political issues, such as the student deaths and the
 Government's failure to investigate them and the treatment of
 Tuaregs. In his Labor Day speech, the Secretary General of the
 USTN broke new ground by publicly calling for the immediate
 adoption of a multiparty political system. In November the
 USTN organized a 5-day nationwide general strike which closed
 Government offices, the banking sector, uranium mines, and the
 airport. Schools and universities were also closed as students
 joined in. In addition to demands voiced in strikes earlier in
 the year, the strikers demanded that the Government bring to
 justice perpetrators of violence against students and Tuaregs.
 They also demanded that a national conference be convened to
 introduce a multiparty system. In practical terms, however,
 the workers' willingness and ability to strike are severely
 limited by the lack of union-provided compensation during work
 stoppages.
 
 
 281
 NIGER
 The USTN is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and abides by its policy of having no formal affiliations
 outside the African continent. Niger's specialized unions have
 been able to bring their concerns into the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) forum through affiliations with their
 international counterparts. The Teachers' Union of Niger in
 1990 had its case against Niger's wage and promotion restraints
 examined by the ILO through an affiliation with the World
 Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is legally authorized, but the Government
 is deeply involved in the process. Individual unions are
 permitted to bargain for more favorable agreements at their
 work sites. The Government publicly promotes voluntary
 worker-employer negotiations and does not sit at the bargaining
 table in private sector negotiations. If these negotiations
 fail, the Government becomes the arbitrator, and the
 arbitration is binding.
 A basic framework agreement among the USTN, the employers, and
 the Government has been in force since 1972. The agreement
 covers the basic determinations of wages and benefits and is
 extensively applied to all sectors of the urban wage economy.
 Labor legislation is applied uniformly throughout the country.
 There are no export processing zones in Niger.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Niger's labor code prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and it
 is not known to have been practiced in recent years.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children between the ages of 12 and 18 may be employed, subject
 to strict provisions limiting hours of employment and types of
 employment. Child labor laws'are enforced by an Inspector of
 Labor. All labor provisions, including those concerning child
 labor, are applied in practice only in urban areas. In Niger,
 child labor is allowed in other than industrial settings. Only
 extreme abuse of the child would be sufficient to terminate
 employment. In the subsistence agricultural sector, where most
 Nigeriens are employed, children work on family plots under
 conditions that are not in compliance with the provisions of
 the labor code. Education at the primary level is free but is
 not compulsory. However, only a quarter of Nigerien children
 of primary school age, primarily male, actually attend schools,
 with an even lower proportion attending middle school and high
 school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage for salaried workers is about $94 per
 month. According to union officials, this wage is not
 sufficient to provide a decent living for workers and their
 families. Because of the country's depressed economy, the
 Government has increased salaries by only 6 percent since 1980,
 despite the rising cost of living. The legal workweek is 40
 hours. However, certain occupations requiring irregular hours
 are authorized longer workweeks, with a maximum of 72 hours.
 The labor code also prescribes occupational safety and health
 regulations that are enforced by the labor inspectors in the
 Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and Professional Training.
 Because of staff shortages, this office focuses mainly on
 
 
 282
 NIGER
 safety violations in the mining, building, and industrial
 sectors. According to a ministry official, compliance is often
 difficult to enforce because workers may not be fully aware of
 the safety risks posed in their jobs and refuse to wear
 protective clothing due to Niger's hot climate. For the most
 part, employers provide adequate safety equipment.
