 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka is an island republic, about the size of West
 Virginia, situated off the southern tip of India. From
 independence in 1948 until the present Constitution came into
 force in 1978, the country had a Westminster-style
 parliamentary system of government. Since 1978, the system of
 government has more closely resembled that of France, with an
 executive president who is independent of the unicameral
 Parliament. Both are elected by universal adult suffrage. An
 independent judiciary and rule by law are characteristics of
 the government system which were adopted from the British
 model. The 1978 Constitution guarantees the fundamental rights
 of all citizens, and permits citizens who believe those rights
 have been violated to petition the Supreme Court for redress.
 The people of Sri Lanka are an ethnic and religious mixture:
 74 percent are Sinhalese, mostly Buddhists; 18 percent are
 Tamils, who predominantly are Hindus; 7 percent are Muslims of
 varying ethnic origin, and the remaining 1 percent are Malays,
 the descendants of European colonists, and others. The 18
 percent of the population who are Tamils includes 12.6 percent
 who are "Ceylon Tamils" whose presence on the island dates back
 many centuries, and 5.5 percent so-called "Indian Tamils" of
 families which came to Sri Lanka more recently. The caste
 system reportedly is breaking down among Buddhists, although it
 remains important when marriages are arranged, and continues to
 be widely observed among Hindus in the North.
 Sri Lanka has been a democracy since independence. In all but
 one general election held since 1948, the party in power has
 been defeated. In 1977, the United National Party headed by
 J. R. Jayewardene won an overwhelming victory, obtaining
 five-sixths of the seats in Parliament. Jayewardene became
 Prime Minister. Under the new Constitution adopted in 1978,
 Jayewardene became President and in October 1982 was elected to
 a six year term, receiving nearly 53 percent of the popular
 vote. In December 1982, a referendum was held on a
 constitutional amendment to extend until 1989 the term of the
 Parliament elected in 1977. The referendum was approved by
 nearly 55 percent of the voters. In May 1983, by-elections
 were held for 18 parliamentary seats and 38 urban and 12
 municipal councils, involving about one-eighth of the voters.
 These elections generally were regarded as free and fair,
 although some critics questioned government practices during
 the referendum campaign. For example, critics noted that the
 referendum campaign was conducted while a state of emergency
 was in force, and claimed that the Government used its special
 emergency powers to detain some prominent opposition figures
 and prevent them from campaigning against the referendum. The
 Government pointed out that any person who claims there have
 been irregularities or unfair practices in the referendum
 campaign is free to take his case to the courts, but that no
 person has done so.
 Sri Lanka is a multiparty democracy. The largest opposition
 party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, currently is in some
 disarray, in part because the civic rights of its leader,
 former Prime Minister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, were
 suspended in 1980 for seven years on the grounds that she had
 exceeded her powers during her tenure as Prime Minister,
 1970-77. The last few years have witnessed a decline in
 electoral support for parties of the left, although the radical
 Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP), which has limited appeal among
 most voters, retains a following among students and other

 youth. The minority Tamil communities are represented by two
 parties. The political wing of the Ceylon Workers Congress
 represents most "Indian Tamils," many of whom are stateless
 persons whose forebears were brought from India in the 19th
 century to work the country's tea plantations. The Tamil
 United Liberation Front (TULF) is strong in the North and
 East. Its constituency primarily is "Ceylon Tamils", who are
 Sri Lankan citizens and whose ancestors came to the island many
 centuries ago.
 One of the TULF's avowed objectives is partition of the island
 and the creation of a separate Tamil state ("Tamil Eelam") in
 the northern and eastern districts where Ceylon Tamils either
 form the majority or represent substantial minorities. This
 goal of some Tamils is one of the core issues in relations
 between Tamils and Sinhalese. A large majority of Sinhalese
 strongly oppose any consideration of a division of the country
 to allow an independent Tamil state. More than half of all
 Ceylon Tamils live outside the northern and eastern areas of
 the country, and many of them recognize that it would not be
 feasible for most of them to move to those relatively poor
 areas, for employment and other reasons, even if an independent
 state were to be created. Yet some of these Tamils support the
 separatist goal, apparently because this objective has become a
 rallying point among Tamils in the country's communal politics.
 Heightened tensions between Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese and
 minority Tamil ethnic communities focused international
 attention on the island republic in 1983 and tested the
 nation's long-standing democratic traditions. The human rights
 of Sri Lankans were affected greatly by increased terrorist
 activities, communal violence, and the Government's efforts to
 cope with both. Illegal acts by some police and military
 personnel have been a key issue in the human rights picture.
 Sri Lanka's security forces are small, intended primarily for
 internal security and coastal patrol. The great majority of
 security forces personnel are of the Sinhalese ethnic group.
 In the police force, about 5.5 percent of policemen and 10
 percent of police officers are Tamils; the representation of
 Tamils in the military services is even smaller. All military
 training is in the Sinhala or English languages. Generally,
 the police are responsible for maintaining civil order;
 however, during a state of emergency the military is called
 upon to assist.
 Since the mid 1970s, young Tamil militants have engaged in acts
 of terrorism directed against the Government and its
 representatives and supporters in the Tamil-majority North and
 in the East. Their principal objective nominally is the same
 as that of the political party which represents most Tamils,
 the Tamil United Liberation Front: to create a separate Tamil
 state, or Tamil Eelam. But these terrorists claim that
 peaceful political means have failed to achieve this objective
 or to satisfy other Tamil demands concerning language,
 education, employment, and fair treatment under the law and by
 security forces. They have resorted to violence as their means
 for partitioning the country. Composed of various rival
 groups, the terrorists generally are referred to as "Tamil
 Tigers." The Government alleges that certain organizations in
 Sri Lanka receive substantial financial assistance from
 expatriate Tamils and overseas groups to train terrorists, and
 claims to have evidence that some terrorists have received
 paramiltary training abroad. Since 1975, the "Tigers" are
 
 
 1418
 believed to be responsible for the deaths of 52 police officers
 and armed forces personnel, 12 politicians, 13 police
 informants, and 14 others.
 To combat the terrorist challenge, the Government passed the
 Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act in 1979,
 giving itself special powers, including the right to make
 arrests without warrants and to extend detention. The
 Government asserts it needs the special powers of the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act to expedite the investigation of
 terrorist incidents, and argues that it is comparable to acts
 with a similar purpose in India, the United Kingdom, and other
 Commonwealth countries. Critics regard the Prevention of
 Terrorism Act as a threat to human rights in Sri Lanka. In
 1982, the Act became a formal,, permanent part of the law of the
 land. In 1983, the Government proclaimed a prolonged state of
 emergency, press censorship, and the imposition of curfews.
 Immediately following the May 1983 parliamentary by-elections
 and local government elections, the Government declared a state
 of emergency in order to deal with anticipated violence such as
 that which had occurred after previous elections. Parliament
 overwhelmingly approved this action. The state of emergency
 was renewed on June 18 and has been renewed almost unanimously
 by Parliament every month since then. The Government's
 rationale for continuing the state of emergency has been the
 persistent activity of the terrorists and the perceived need of
 authorities to have the power to investigate offenses which
 they claim cannot be pursued effectively under ordinary civil
 law. Between September 22 and October 17, for example, there
 were 45 incidents of terrorism, according to government
 figures. These incidents include the burning of
 Government-owned buses and trains, robberies of banks,
 factories, and government offices, raids on police stations,
 jailbreaks, and attacks on security forces in the North and
 East. Tamils claiming to have committed some of these acts of
 violence said they were retaliating for illegal police and
 military attacks on innocent members of the Tamil community.
 On June 3, Tamil terrorists killed three Air Force
 noncommissioned officers in Vavuniya. Scattered instances of
 retaliation against Tamils in the South occurred with
 increasing frequency in the weeks that followed, with violence
 especially severe in Trincomalee. Matters peaked on July 23
 when Tamil terrorists ambushed and killed 13 Sri Lankan
 soldiers (all of them Sinhalese) in the Jaffna Peninsula in the
 North. In a backlash of anger by the Sinhalese majority, there
 followed the most serious and widespread violence directed
 against the Tamil community since independence. On July 24,
 according to government figures, soldiers in Jaffna killed 51
 unarmed Tamils. Violence against Tamils in the city of Colombo
 spread throughout the Sinhalese-majority areas in the central
 and southern parts of the country. At the end of a week of
 killing, burning, and looting by Sinhalese mobs, the Government
 reported that 387 people, mostly Tamils, were dead, among them
 53 convicted prisoners and detainees who were killed in prison
 by other prisoners. This figure also includes some 34 persons,
 mostly Sinhalese, killed by security forces for engaging in
 looting and arson during the height of the disturbances.
 According to government figures, 116 Tamil- or Indian-owned
 large businesses were damaged, 38 of them completely
 destroyed. As many as 3,100 Tamil shops were damaged or
 
 
 1419
 destroyed, and thousands of Tamil-owned or Occupied homes were
 burned or looted. Four thousand vehicles were burned. At the
 height of the violence, more than 100,000 Tamils sought refuge
 in camps set up by the Government and tens of thousands of
 them, many with transportation provided by the Government, fled
 to the comparative safety of the North and East.
 There is no evidence to support the claims of some Tamils and
 critics of the Government that it planned or promoted this
 violence, which newspapers described as a "holocaust" and
 President Jayewardene sadly termed "a crisis of civilization,"
 but Government supporters concede that authorities were
 hard-pressed to quell it. Government officials, including the
 President, admit that some members of the security forces
 either actively participated in the violence or stood by unable
 or unwilling to stop it. The Government claims that the
 organized violence (some mobs appeared to have electoral lists
 and knew exactly which Tamil homes or business they wished to
 attack) was the work of extreme leftists. It therefore
 proscribed on July 30 the Nava Sama Samaja Party, the Janatha
 Vimukthi Peramuna, and the Communist Party (Moscow Wing), and
 detained members of these parties. In addition, the Government
 introduced a sixth amendment to the Constitution which makes
 separatism illegal. This amendment in effect forced the
 members of Parliament from the Tamil United Liberation Front,
 the major party of the Ceylon Tamil community, to give up their
 seats; they had been elected in 1977 on a platform advocating
 "Tamil Eelam".
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 "Tamil Tiger" terrorists generally aim their attacks at symbols
 of government authority and have used assassination as a
 political weapon. In 1983, they are believed to have killed
 three policemen, two airmen, and 14 soldiers, all Sinhalese; 8
 politicians, all Tamils and organizers or candidates of the
 ruling United National Party; one Tamil police informant; and
 four Tamil civilians, one of whom was a terrorist reportedly
 killed by a rival gang.
 For the past several years security forces in the North and
 East, in the words of the Civil Rights Movement of Sri Lanka,
 have "demonstrated their propensity to retaliate
 indiscriminately against the civilian population" in reaction
 to terrorist attacks on the armed forces. The Government
 acknowledges that during the July violence army personnel in
 Jaffna killed 51 Tamil civilians, and that navy personnel in
 Trincomalee during the same period left their barracks, killed
 at least one person and injured ten, and burned more than 125
 shops and houses. Immediately following these incidents, the
 personnel responsible were confined to barracks. At least 34
 looters and arsonists were killed by security forces, but there
 were reports of incidents elsewhere during the week of communal
 violence when police and military personnel did not prevent
 criminal wrongdoing or themselves committed lawless acts. The
 Government said it would prosecute those for whom evidence was
 sufficient for indictments. By the close of 1983, the navy had
 taken summary action against sailors and navy officers involved
 
 
 1420
 in the Trincomalee incident (according to the Government: one
 petty officer, 77 regular sailors, and seven reservist sailors
 were dismissed from the navy, and the cases of eight other navy
 personnel still are being investigated), but no charges had
 been brought against police or army personnel. The Government
 said that adequate evidence had not been found yet and that
 witnesses had not come forward, but that it still intends to
 take action against all persons, military or civilian, where
 there is evidence of wrong-doing. Critics counter that there
 already is ample evidence to bring charges against some police
 and military personnel, and that the Government's failure to
 prosecute them shows that the security forces can attack Tamils
 with impunity.
 On July 25, 35 Tamil prisoners, either convicted terrorists or
 suspects being held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, were
 killed in Colombo's Welikade jail, reportedly by other
 prisoners.  Two days later, another 18 Tamil prisoners in the
 same jail were killed. A magistrate found that the 53 deaths
 were homicides, and ordered a police investigation. Prison
 officials claimed the deaths were the result of prison riots
 which prison guards had tried to stop. It is alleged that
 prison guards were partially responsible for these deaths due
 to malfeasance, but the Government firmly denies this
 allegation and insists that the prison warders, who do not
 carry firearms, were themselves overpowered by the rioting
 prisoners.
 In April, a Tamil detained under the Prevention of Terrorism
 Act was found dead in his cell in Gurunagar Army Camp, after
 being held without charges for several weeks. At the inquest,
 the Judicial Medical Officer reported that the deceased had 25
 internal and 10 external injuries, inflicted while in army
 custody. Police are investigating.
 In June, the Government promulgated emergency regulations that
 permit the armed forces to dispose of dead bodies without post
 mortems or inquests. The Civil Rights Movement of Sri Lanka
 protested these regulations, and Amnesty International is very
 critical of them. The Civil Rights Movement of Sri Lanka fears
 that these powers could be abused, and could facilitate the
 destruction of evidence in cases of deaths by torture,
 indiscriminate killings, and executions without trial by
 security forces. As far as is known, there were two instances
 in 1983 when ordinary criminals (as distinguished from those
 suspected or convicted under the Prevention of Terrorism Act)
 died while in police custody. In the past, a magisterial
 inquiry sometimes has resulted in prosecution of police
 officers found responsible for such deaths.
 b. Disappearance
 The wife of a Sri Lankan Freedom Party organizer has charged
 that her husband was assaulted and arrested by armed policemen
 on the night of July 27. She began habeas corpus proceedings.
 On September 1, the Court of Appeal ordered police to produce
 her husband. The police countered by denying that he ever was
 taken into custody or arrested. The Court then directed the
 Chief Magistrate of Colombo to inquire into the wife's
 allegations. This case, which the Government describes as
 "unique," still is being argued before the Magistrate.
 
 
 1421
 During the periods of communal disturbance and civil disorder.
 many family members became separated. According to press
 reports, the Sri Lankan Red Cross received 1001 inquiries about
 people missing following the July violence. 418 have been
 located alive, 100 have been confirmed dead, and the remaining
 483 still are not accounted for by the Sri Lankan Red Cross and
 are listed as missing. Emergency regulations permitting
 disposal of bodies without inquests complicate the effort to
 determine whether some of those still unaccounted for were
 killed.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution guarantees that "no person shall be subjected
 to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment." Nonetheless, there have been persistent reports
 of torture or ill-treatment by military and police of persons
 detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Both Amnesty
 International and Freedom House have reported allegations of
 torture in Sri Lankan prisons. Most of those allegedly
 subjected to such treatment are young Tamil males in the North
 and East who are suspected of ties with the "Tigers". In 1983,
 two such detainees complained that they were tortured while in
 the hands of the army at Panagoda Army Camp. One, a Roman
 Catholic priest, wrote to the President asking for an impartial
 commission of inquiry into his charges. A spokesman for the
 Government said in Parliament on February 10 that the inquiry
 was being held, but no reports of its findings have been
 published. The Government claims that an examination.by a
 Judicial Medical Officer revealed only slight bruises on one of
 the prisoners.
 Civil rights attorneys admit that the harsh conditions in Sri
 Lankan prisons and detention centers are not the result of
 government policy. Prison conditions in Sri Lanka are not
 good; many prisons are old and overcrowded. The Government has
 announced plans to build new ones.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution stipulates that no person "shall be arrested
 except according to procedure established by law" and that an
 arrested person must be informed of the reason for his arrest.
 Within 24 hours an arrested person is brought before a
 magistrate who may authorize bail or, for serious crimes,
 continued detention. An arrested person may be detained up to
 three months without bail, or longer if a court rules. Sri
 Lankans are not detained, arrested, or prosecuted for
 expressing views critical of or different from those of the
 Government.
 There are exceptions to these rules for persons detained during
 a state of emergency or under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
 Any person arrested under the Act must be produced before a
 magistrate within three days unless the Minister of Internal
 Security orders the suspect to be detained for a period of
 three months. Such a detention order may be renewed for an
 aggregate period of up to 18 months. The terms of detention
 are set out in this order; detainees do not have the same
 rights as other prisoners in Sri Lanka regarding visits by
 family, access to lawyers, food, and other conditions of
 incarceration.
 
 
 1422
 In 1983, the Prevention of Terrorism Act was used on a nuriber
 of occasions to detain and take into custody Tamil youths
 suspected of terrorist activities. For example, thirteen
 youths were taken into custody on October 13 as they returned
 from India where, the Government suspects, they received
 paramilitary training. Early in July 1983, Amnesty
 International estimated that there were 65 people in detention
 in Sri Lanka. The Government stated that as of early November,
 25 people were in detention under the Act.
 The Constitution empowers the Court of Appeal to issue writs of
 habeas corpus. On several occasions in 1983, relatives and
 lawyers of detained persons have taken advantage of this
 authority to gain access to detainees. While persons held
 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act may be permitted to see
 lawyers of their choice, the Government is sometimes slow in
 granting access and in some cases has imposed strict conditions
 on such visits. Bail is available for most persons arrested,
 but it cannot be granted to persons held under the Prevention
 of Terrorism Act. According to press reports, the Government
 is contemplating the creation of an advisory committee to
 consider objections to detention orders issued under the Act.
 A state of emergency has been in effect since May 18, and
 persons may be detained under emergency regulations. In
 February, the Supreme Court ruled that such detentions are not
 violations of the fundamental rights protected by the
 Constitution. In September, the Government issued new
 regulations empowering authorities to hold suspects detained
 for violating emergency regulations for 90 rather than the
 usual 30 days before being produced before a magistrate.
 Acoording to Government figures: 6,780 people were arrested for
 looting, arson, and mischief during the July disturbances,
 including 500 detained for curfew violations. To date, about
 3,000 have been released because of insufficient evidence
 against them to proceed with prosecution, 2,280 suspected or
 charged with less serious crimes have been released on bail,
 and 1,500 still are under detention while their cases are being
 investigated by police. Prosecution proceedings are underway
 in fifteen cases of murder, and about 300 other cases of
 various serious crimes have been forwarded to the Attorney
 General for the filing of indictments in the High Court.
 In addition, 42 members of the political parties proscribed on
 July 30 were detained under emergency regulations. Detained
 members of the Communist Party were released on September 22
 and the ban on the party was lifted on October 14. The
 proscription of the JVP and NSSP remains in force; 26 members
 of these parties remain in detention under emergency
 regulations.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Sri Lankan Law derives from the British common law tradition.
 The Constitution guarantees the independence of the judiciary,
 and lawyers and judges are held in high esteem. Under normal
 circumstances, an accused person is entitled by the
 Constitution and customarily receives a fair trial in open
 court, is represented by counsel of his choice, and is apprised
 of the charges and the evidence against him. Although trial by
 jury is the custom in Sri Lanka, juries are not provided in
 trials under the Prevention of Terrorism Act on the grounds
 that jury members could be intimidated.
 
 
 1423
 Trials for capital crimes usually take place within 12 to 15
 months after the arrest. Further delays sometimes occur. An
 English-language Colombo newspaper reported in April that there
 were 150 persons, most accused murderers, who had been in
 prison for between one and seven years, waiting for their cases
 to be heard. The Cabinet appointed a subcommittee to examine
 this problem and the Government set up a board of review to
 examine cases of persons detained for over three months on
 criminal charges. According to the Government, the object of
 the board is to expedite the processing of these cases.
 Another cause of delays is the large number of vacancies on the
 High Court.
 The Chief Justice and all judges of the Supreme Court, Court of
 Appeal, and High Court are appointed by the President. The
 Chief Justice and two Supreme Court judges comprise a Judicial
 Service Commission which appoints, transfers, and dismisses all
 lower court judges and magistrates.
 The traditional independence of the judiciary came under some
 pressure in 1983. In two much-publicized cases, policemen were
 promoted who had been found guilty by the Supreme Court of
 ill-treating citizens and preventing them from demonstrating
 publicly. The Government also paid the fines imposed on these
 policemen. The Civil Rights Movement of Sri Lanka condemned
 these promotions on the grounds that the Government appeared to
 endorse unconstitutional behavior, was encouraging similar
 breaches in the future, and was undermining the role of the
 judiciary in protecting fundamental rights.
 In April, a parliamentary select committee was appointed to
 investigate allegations by a former Appeal Court judge against
 two Supreme Court judges with respect to their conduct as
 judges. Critics see the appointment of this select committee
 as an unprecedented infringement on the independence of the
 judiciary because it is inconsistent with constitutionally
 mandated procedures for investigating allegations against
 judges. One complication is that legislation for the removal
 of judges envisaged in the Constitution never has been framed.
 The Government reportedly is drafting such legislation.
 On June 11, rowdy crowds demonstrated aggressively outside the
 residences of three Supreme Court judges who had decided that a
 policeman had violated the fundamental rights of a citizen.
 The judges claim that police failed to respond to telephone
 calls for assistance. The press, Bar Association, and a
 visiting representative of the International Commission of
 Jurists all condemned the incident as an attempt to intimidate
 the judges. It is widely alleged that the demonstrations were
 organized and carried out by government supporters and that the
 demonstrators used government vehicles. The Government denied
 these allegations, claiming that none of the participants in
 the demonstrations has been identified.
 Supreme Court judges were required to take an oath disavowing
 separatism within one month of the passage of the Sixth
 Amendment to the Constitution. All the judges took the oath
 before the September 8 deadline. The Attorney General on
 September 9 ruled that their oaths were invalid, and therefore
 they had ceased to hold office as of September 8, because they
 had given their oaths to one another rather than to the
 President. The Court and judges' offices were locked and armed
 police guards barred entry to everyone. Following a public
 
 
 1424
 outcry, all the judges were reappointed on September 15 and
 took their oaths before the President. Subsequently, the
 Supreme Court ruled that through their original oaths the
 judges had complied with the Constitution and thus they had
 never, in fact, ceased to hold office.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects individual privacy and the sanctity of
 the family and the home, and the judiciary has a good record of
 upholding rights to privacy in those cases which reach the High
 Court or Supreme Court. However, critics of the Prevention of
 Terrorism Act, and of the actions of Government forces in
 Tamil-dominated communities, claim that police and military
 personnel sometimes enter the homes of Tamils without cause or
 provocation. In ordinary circumstances, search and arrest
 warrants are required to enter private premises. Under the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act, however, police officers above a
 certain rank and less senior officers authorized by them in
 writing may, without a warrant, enter and search any premises
 and seize "any document or thing" when there is a presumption
 or evidence of support for, or involvement with, unlawful
 activity.
 There is no generalized monitoring of telephones, but some
 critics of the Government allege that their telephones are
 tapped.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees "freedom of speech and expression
 including publication," but it also permits these guarantees to
 be restricted "as may be prescribed by law in the interests of
 national security." In practice, the Government imposed press
 censorship several times in 1983.
 The Government controls two of the largest newspaper groups and
 owns the nation's radio and television services. Such control
 constrains but does not prevent criticism of the Government.
 There is a plethora of independent newspapers and magazines,
 many of which are the organs of opposition political parties.
 Although independent publications complain of attempts by the
 Government to control criticism, differing views appear
 regularly in the press. Statements by members of opposition
 parties, whether made in Parliament or elsewhere, are reported
 in newspapers, but such coverage drops off during periods of
 press censorship.
 Government attempts to infringe upon press freedom occurred
 during 1983. In February, the independent newspaper Weekend
 published an article relating to proceedings of a Cabinet
 meeting, without receiving permission to publish from the
 Secretary to the Cabinet. The Government sued Weekend but
 withdrew its charges when the paper agreed not to publish
 similar materials again without permission. In April, four
 persons were arrested in Vavuniya fdr distributing leaflets
 calling for a closure of business as a means of public
 protest. A week later three youths in Jaffna were arrested for
 selling a Tamil-language fortnightly magazine found
 objectionable by security forces.
 
 
 1425
 Under the Public Security Act. i.e. during a state of emergency
 such as prevailed through much of 1983, direct censorship may
 be invoked. On May 18, in the wake of a terrorist attack on a
 polling station in Jaffna during municipal elections (in which
 one solider was killed), the Government imposed censorship on
 all reports of violent incidents in the North and East. In
 June, the radical Tamil weekly magazine Saturday Review was
 closed following publication of the resolution of the
 Massachusetts House of Representatives which supported the
 creation of a separate Tamil state. And on July 2, the Tamil
 separatist newspaper Sutantiran and a magazine were closed. On
 July 18, censorship was imposed on all matters relating to
 post-secondary education, following disturbances on several
 university campuses. During the July communal disturbances,
 many Tamil newspapers suspended operations and all reports
 concerning terrorist activities, security operations, and
 communal matters were subject to censorship, in order to ease
 communal tensions and dampen the violence. Censorship was
 tightened on August I but was relaxed early in September.
 Censorship of articles relating to terrorist activities,
 security operations, and communal matters was resumed on
 November 1.
 On July 30, the Government closed the newspapers belonging to
 the three political parties it proscribed. With the lifting of
 the ban on the Communist Party in mid-October, the daily party
 organ Aththa resumed publication.
 On June 25 David Selbourne, an Oxford don and occasional
 contributor to the Manchester Guardian, was expelled summarily
 from Sri Lanka by immigration and police authorities. He had
 written a number of articles critical of the Government in
 1982. Wihout his knowledge, he was "blacklisted" by the
 Government. He entered Sri Lanka on a tourist visa in June.
 When the authorities discovered his presence they escorted him
 out of the country, and he was not allowed to inform the
 British High Commission of his expulsion. On August 2 Stewart
 Slavin, West Asia Manager for United Press International, was
 expelled for filing a story relating to the July violence that
 he had not cleared with the censor.
 The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution makes it illegal in Sri
 Lanka or abroad to espouse separatism. Those convicted of
 doing so may lose their civic rights and be removed from office
 or government service. The Supreme Court examined the
 amendment and found that it was not inconsisent with
 constitutional guarantees of fundamental rights.
 Academic freedom is respected in Sri Lanka, but communal and
 political violence led to disruptions of the education process
 in 1983. The Government closed universities temporarily after
 violence broke out on campuses, and academic publications were
 subject to the same censorship as other media.
 Those Tamils who have resorted to terrorism in their demand for
 a separate Tamil state have attempted to disrupt the democratic
 process in the northern and eastern Tamil-majority areas of the
 country. In 1983 the terrorists assassinated eight Tamil
 organizers or candidates of the ruling United National Party,
 and broke up a meeting in May at which the General Secretary of
 the Tamil United Liberation Front, who was also the Leader of
 the Opposition in Parliament at the time, was speaking.
 Terrorists threatened voters in the May elections with death or
 
 
 1426
 injury if they went to the polls. Many candidates from all
 parties attempted to withdraw their names from the ballot.
 Voter turnout in the Jaffna District on May 18 was below 10
 percent, in sharp contrast to the national average of 80
 percent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and
 association, and the right to form and join trade unions.
 Despite its relatively small size, Sri Lanka has an abundance
 of private associations devoted to the promotion of business,
 commercial, professional, educational, religious, charitable,
 and humanitarian causes.
 During a state of emergency no group is allowed to hold
 processions or street demonstrations. Police are empowered
 during states of emergency to move any stationary group of five
 or more persons from a public place.
 Under normal (i.e. non-state of emergency) circumstances,
 political and other rallies and processions may be held in
 public places without the permission of the authorities, but
 organizers must give advance notice to the police. Permits are
 required for the use of loudspeakers. Rallies and processions
 of which the police have not been notified may be dispersed
 only after issuance of a warrant by a magistrate.
 Late in June the Government reportedly was considering new
 ordinances that would require organizers to obtain permits for
 marches and processions even when a state of emergency is not
 in effect, and would empower the police without a magistrate's
 warrant to stop processions. Five opposition parties protested
 these proposals. As far as is known, there has been no further
 action on these proposals. On June 8, the Supreme Court upheld
 the right of Sri Lankan citizens to hold processions without
 permission.
 There are more than 1,500 trade unions in Sri Lanka. Under
 law, Sri Lankans are permitted to organize, bargain
 collectively, and lobby, and in the private sector to strike.
 Public sector employees who come under the Essential Public
 Services Act of 1979 are not permitted to strike. Workers in
 the free trade zone northeast of Colombo are not permitted to
 form unions, but do participate in company "associations".
 Sri Lanka's largest union, the Ceylon Workers Congress,
 primarily represents Indian Tamil tea estate workers (many of
 whom are stateless). Its President is a member of the Cabinet
 and a Tamil. The next largest union is the Jathika Sevaka
 Sangamaya, affiliated with the ruling United National Party.
 Many unions are associated with the Asian-American Free Labor
 Institute, the AFL-CIO's representative organization in Sri
 Lanka, or maintain ties with international trade secretariats,
 with the International Labor Organization (ILO), the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, or the World
 Federation of Trade Unions. Delegates from Sri Lankan unions
 regularly attend ILO and AFL-CIO conventions. Some unions,
 such as the Ceylon Workers Congress, play a significant role in
 the political process.
 
 
 1427
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official
 religion of Sri Lanka and requires the Government "to protect
 and foster" Buddhism, it also guarantees the freedom of all
 Hindus, Muslims, and Christians to practice their religions
 freely. Religious differences generally are not a basis for
 discrimination. Most members of the majority Sinhalese ethnic
 group are Buddhists, while most Tamils are Hindus. Christians
 come from both groups. Most Muslims speak the Tamil language
 but do not call themselves Tamils; they are sometimes called
 Moors. Sri Lankans of every faith are free to maintain links
 with coreligionists in other countries and to undertake
 religious travel.
 During the July anti-Tamil violence, mobs burned some Hindu
 temples, and at least one Christian church was burned.
 Buddhists, in turn, have expressed concern about the safety of
 their temples and shrines in areas where Hindus predominate.
 Two Cabinet ministers are assigned the additional portfolios of
 Minister of Muslim Affairs and Minister of Hindu Affairs to
 deal with issues involving those minority religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees every citizen "freedom of movement
 and of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka" and "freedom to
 return to Sri Lanka". These guarantees are honored in practice.
 The present Government removed exit visa requirements imposed
 by its predecessor and now permits virtually unimpeded
 emigration and travel. Sri Lankans of every ethnic group, both
 male and female, have taken advantage of this policy to seek
 better-paying jobs abroad. It is believed that there are over
 100,000 Sri Lankans working in the Middle East alone.
 Some Tamils, predominantly young men, have travelled abroad and
 sought refugee status or political asylum in the U.S. and other
 countries, on the grounds that they are members of a persecuted
 minority. The numbers of such applications increased after the
 the July communal violence. Under the Constitution, they are
 free to return to Sri Lanka at any time.
 The Government is very reluctant to permit refugees or
 displaced persons from other countries to stay in Sri Lanka
 while seeking permanent residence elsewhere, and generally
 denies such persons entry.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Sri Lanka is an open, working, multi-party democracy. Citizens
 elect their President, Members of Parliament, and local
 government officials by universal adult suffrage. All laws, as
 well as such acts as extending the state of emergency, must be
 approved by the Parliament. Voter turnout generally is over 80
 percent. The present Government won 51 percent of the popular
 vote in 1977, 53 percent in the presidential election of October
 1982, and 54.5 percent in the referendum of December 1982 which
 extended Parliament's term to 1989. The ruling party also won
 14 of the 18 by-elections held on May 18, 1983.
 
 
 1428
 The Civil Rights Movement of Sri Lanka is concerned about
 purported irregularities during the December 1982 referendum,
 which was particularly important in that it extended the term of
 the current Parliament until 1989. The Civil Rights Movement
 cites the following conditions which, in its view, militated
 against freedom of choice in the referendum: (1) a state of
 emergency existed throughout the campaign; (2) two important
 opposition newspapers were banned, several presses were sealed,
 and leaflets opposing the referendum were seized; (3) a number
 of opposition party organizers were detained, arrested for short
 periods, or repeatedly interrogated under emergency regulations;
 (4) the law permitting display of posters was disregarded. The
 Civil Rights Movement alleges also that there were serious and
 widespread irregularities in the conduct of the referendum. The
 Government maintains that it is unnecessary to respond to such
 charges, since legal remedies exist under the law to challenge
 electoral results in the courts. Despite the allegations, no
 lawsuits have been initiated, as far as is known, by critics of
 the Government.
 Sri Lanka has parties representing many different views in the
 political spectrum. All parties that meet certain requirements
 may appear on the ballot. Generally, opposition parties
 function freely, have their own newspapers, and their activities
 are covered by national news media. On July 30 the Government
 proscribed the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, Nava Sama Samaja
 Party, and Communist Party under the state of emergency. The
 ban on the Communist Party was lifted on October 14.
 The 1978 Constitution provides for the proportional
 representation system of elections. It was expected that the
 scheduled 1983 general election would be the first election
 under that system, but with the passage of the December 1982
 referendum approving the constitutional amendment to extend the
 life by six years of the 1977 Parliament, the proportional
 representation system will not come into use until the next
 general election, which is not required until 1989. Politicians
 of all parties, however, now are having doubts about the
 efficacy of this system. On July 6. Parliament approved a
 government motion to appoint a select committee to review the
 1978 Constitution and all voting laws. The committee is
 composed of eight members from the Government's ranks and four
 from opposition parties; it was appointed on July 8, and its
 deliberations are continuing.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is highly sensitive to investigations of its
 human rights practices. At the same time, it generally does not
 seek to prevent or interfere with such investigations. In the
 wake of the July communal violence, Sri Lanka has been the
 subject of a number of investigations. The Government says it
 regards recent reports issued by such organizations as Amnesty
 International and the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ)
 as biased.
 In June, a member of the ICJ visited Sri Lanka to examine the
 rule of law with special reference to the Prevention of
 Terrorism Act and the independence of the judiciary. While
 there, he spoke with Government officials and private citizens.
 Following that visit and the communal violence of late July, the
 
 
 1429
 ICJ issued an updated reprint of the report it first published
 after its visit in July and August 1981. The updated report,
 which has not been discussed fully in the Sri Lankan press,
 acknowledged that communal animosity in Sri Lanka "makes the
 role of the Government extremely difficult." The report called
 (among other recommendations) for a dialog with the Tamils,
 establishment of firmer control over the security forces, and
 repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
 In July 1983, Amnesty International issued the report of its
 1982 mission to Sri Lanka covering the period January 1981 to
 February 1982. The report said there was "a pattern of serious
 and consistent violations of human rights in Sri Lanka."
 Amnesty International is concerned particularly about the use of
 the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and allegations of arbitrary
 arrest and detention and of the torture and deaths of those so
 held. The Government declined to discuss the report with
 Amnesty International before it was published; following
 publication, the Government sought to refute all charges.
 Amnesty International also issued a report covering the period
 July to September 1983. In the report, it expressed concern
 about the killing of Tamil citizens in Jaffna by security forces
 on July 24, the murders of 53 Tamil prisoners in Colombo's
 Welikade Prison on July 25 and 27, and the arrest of members of
 the three proscribed political parties. In early November, the
 Government responded to these allegations, but its response has
 not been made public.
 The Civil Rights Movement of Sri Lanka also issued a report on
 the communal violence in July. Its concerns parallel those of
 Amnesty International.
 In August, a two-member fact-finding mission from the Law
 Association for Asia and the Western Pacific (LAWASIA) went to
 Sri Lanka with a mandate to investigate the constitutional
 justification for the state of emergency in the circumstances
 that arose in July 1983, the behavior of non-government groups
 and the Government at all levels before and after the state of
 emergency was imposed, and the circumstances of those persons
 displaced by the violence. As far as is known, the mission has
 not issued a report.
 The United Nations Human Rights Committee has required the
 Government of Sri Lanka to submit a comprehensive report on the
 general framework within which civil and political rights are
 recognized and protected, and to describe what it has done
 specifically to guarantee rights provided for in the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which
 Sri Lanka is a signatory. The requirement for this report is
 part of the normal requirements imposed on signatories and is
 unrelated to the July communal violence. Sri Lanka presented
 its report in early November, 1983.
 The United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of
 Discrimination and Protection of Minorities received a report
 from the ICJ on August 19 which 1) decried the Prevention of
 Terrorism Act because it removed basic protection of the human
 rights of detainees; 2) criticized the lack of discipline among
 security forces which led to torture and ill-treatment of
 detainees; 3) condemned frustration by authorities of habeas
 corpus proceedings; 4) criticized the regulations that permit
 security forces to bury bodies without inquests or post mortems;
 and 5) admonished the Government for promoting police officers
 
 
 1430
 convicted of acting illegally. The report also charged the
 Government with indifference to the fate of the Tamil
 population, which it claims exacerbated the communal
 disturbances. The Government replied on August 23, denying the
 charges and pledging to bring to court all persons responsible
 for the killings. By year's end, 15 cases of murder and 300
 cases of other serious crimes had been handed to the Attorney
 General to begin prosecution proceedings. No charges against
 police and military personnel were included in these cases.
 On September 5, the Sub-Commission passed a resolution
 requesting the U.N. Human Rights Committee to ask the Secretary
 General to seek information from the Government of Sri Lanka and
 other sources on communal violence and to submit a report to the
 U.N. Economic and Social Council. A final decision on the
 Sub-Commission's resolution will be taken by the Human Rights
 Committee at its meetings in February 1984.
 There are a number of local organizations that monitor human
 rights in Sri Lanka, both semi-official and non-governmental.
 They are concerned with all types of human rights violations.
 Their reports and public statements usually do not elicit
 responses from the Government. Leaders claim they are subject
 to occasional harassment by the Government but they have been
 permitted to continue to function. A member of Amnesty
 International's International Executive Committee resides in Sri
 Lanka and is active in local human rights matters.
 In its 1983 report, Amnesty International reiterated its
 concerns about use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and
 allegations of torture and ill-treatment of detainees. Freedom
 House rates Sri Lanka "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Sri Lanka is a developing and primarily agrarian nation. It
 depends heavily on plantation crops (tea, rubber, and coconuts)
 for export earnings and employment. Rice is the major food
 crop. When the United National Party came to power in 1977 it
 initiated a new program to accelerate economic growth based on
 the loosening of government controls and the shifting of
 government spending from consumer subsidies to capital
 investment. The Government had three main targets: to
 accelerate the Mahaweli hydroelectric, irrigation, and
 resettlement project; to create an investment promotion zone in
 order to attract foreign investment and expand exports; and to
 develop urban areas and provide sufficient housing. Large
 inflows of foreign aid have been crucial to Sri Lanka's
 ambitious capital development plans. The liberalization policy
 has had considerable success in stimulating growth, which has
 averaged about six percent annually. Per capita gross national
 product in 1982 was 283 dollars, up from 269 dollars in 1981.
 Many sectors of the economy remain in need of development.
 Entrepreneurs and farmers have benefitted from the United
 National Party Government's policies but others on fixed
 incomes, urban unskilled laborers, and tenant farmers have
 suffered from high rates of inflation. In 1983, inflation was
 expected to be over 20 percent.
 It is estimated that over 100,000 Sri Lankans are working
 abroad. While their departure has created shortages of trained
 personnel at home, the foreign exchange that they earn and remit
 
 
 1431
 has come to play a large role in improving Sri Lanka's balance
 of payments.
 Sri Lanka's population in 1983 was 15,647,000 and is increasing
 at the rate of 1.8 percent a year, about the average for the
 last decade. Life expectancy at birth is 69 years and the
 infant mortality rate is 32.2 per 1,000 live births.
 Sri Lanka's literacy rate of 85 percent, primary school
 enrollment of 98 percent, and the life expectancy of 69 years
 are among the highest in Asia, despite its low per capita income
 of around 283 dollars.
 Health care is free for all Sri Lankans and, while it is widely
 distributed, the number of facilities and doctors has not kept
 pace with population growth. In 1980 it was estimated that
 there was one hospital bed for every 340 persons and one
 physician for every 3,990 persons. The best medical facilities
 are found in and around Colombo. Hospitals suffer from
 shortages of medicine and trained staff and malfunctioning
 equipment; many facilities are old. Communicable diseases pose
 a major health problem. Cholera and diarrheal diseases are more
 frequent during periods of drought, such as occurred this year
 in Sri Lanka, because supplies of potable water and sanitation
 facilities are inadequate. A major outbreak of malaria occurred
 in 1983, the result of the opening of new settlement areas and
 some complacency on the part of officials who thought the
 malaria menace had been eradicated.
 Sri Lanka expected to be self-sufficient in rice for the first
 time in 1983. According to World Bank figures, when the push to
 self-sufficiency in rice first began in 1977, the population
 received nearly 97 percent of its required calorie supply.
 Steady inflation, however, has made it more difficult for the
 poor to maintain their previous levels of food intake.
 Sri Lanka has an excellent education system, free to citizens
 from primary school through university. As with health
 facilities, education facilities are not evenly distributed.
 The best schools are located in Colombo and other principal
 towns. In 1979 the primary school enrollment rate was 98
 percent. There is a shortage of university places; there are
 about 5,000 freshmen every year, drawn from a pool of roughly
 22,000 qualified candidates.
 In 1956, the first Sri Lanka Freedom Party Government began
 education reforms that de-emphasized the teaching of English and
 stressed vernacular education. As a result, many Sri Lankans of
 this generation lack the English language skills necessary to
 qualify for some government and private sector jobs, both at
 home and abroad. English has been important too as a "link
 language" between Sri Lanka's ethnic groups, and the decline of
 English was seen as one factor in the continuing tensions
 between Sinhalese and Tamils. In February 1983, President
 Jayewardene announced that the Government would place more
 emphasis on the teaching of English, and since then has taken
 steps toward that end. Peace Corps volunteers arrived in Sri
 Lanka in December 1983 to help in the training of Sri Lankan
 teachers of English.
 Sri Lankan citizens have the right to acquire, hold, and dispose
 of property, but each individual may own only one house and no
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 91
 
 
 1432
 more than 50 acres.  The Government permits non-citizen
 residents of Sri Lanka to own property, except that Indian
 Tamils who do not have citizenship, and thus are considered as
 stateless, temporary residents awaiting determination of status,
 are not allowed to own land or other real property.
 Sri Lankan women have suffrage and equal rights under the law,
 including equal property and inheritance rights. Sri Lanka's
 various ethnic and religious groups have their own "personal"
 laws, which place some limitations on women in these groups.
 For example, some Tamil families of very traditional thinking
 believe that their women members should work only in the home
 and not be seen working in public; this belief has a basis in
 the Hindu religion and in the caste system. And some Muslim
 women are discouraged by their families and communities from
 seeking higher education or employment.
 Women fill important posts in the civil service, the
 professions, and in business. Sri Lankan women are believed to
 vote in large numbers, but otherwise play a more limited role
 than men in the political process. There presently are eight
 women members of Parliament, and Sri Lankans are proud of the
 fact that they had the world's first woman prime minister, Mrs.
 Sirimavo Bandaranaike. In 1983, the President created a
 Ministry of Women's Affairs and Teaching Hospitals and gave the
 minister, a woman, cabinet rank.
 Only one group, those Indian Tamils who are stateless, are not
 integrated fully into the life of the country. In 1964, India
 and Sri Lanka signed an agreement that was intended to resolve
 the citizenship status of some one million stateless Indian
 Tamils over a period of 15 years, later extended to 17 years.
 By the terms of this agreement, India would grant citizenship
 and repatriate to South India 600,000 Indian Tamils and any
 children born to them after 1964. Sri Lanka would grant
 citizenship to 375,000 and their offspring born after 1964. By
 October 31, 1981, when the two countries were to have settled
 the citizenship of the Indian Tamils, India had taken more than
 300,000 persons as repatriates. Sri Lanka had granted
 citizenship to over 185,000 plus over 52,000 post-1964
 offspring. Over 100,000 Indian Tamils in Sri Lanka before 1964,
 plus nearly 45,000 offspring, were granted Indian citizenship
 but still awaited repatriation. In the wake of July's
 anti-Tamil violence, many in this latter group are being
 processed for repatriation. Some have migrated to India in
 recent months.
 With the lapse of the 1964 Agreement, India declined to consider
 any more applications for citizenship. The Government of Sri
 Lanka believes that the 1964 pact remains in force until the
 citizenship cases and permanent residence of all Indian Tamils
 covered by the pact have been settled.
