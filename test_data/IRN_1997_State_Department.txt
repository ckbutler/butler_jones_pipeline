 IRAN
 The Islamic Republic of Iranl was established in 1979 after a populist revolution
 toppled the monarchy. The Government is dominated by Shi'a Muslim clergy. Aya-
 tollah All Khamenei is the Leader of the Islamic Revolution and functions as the
 Chief of State. He is also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. President
 Seyed Mohammad Khatami was inaugurated in August, following a landslide vic-
 tory in elections held on May 23. The Constitution establishes a 270-seat unicameral
 Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majles. The Government seeks to conform public
 policy to its political and socio-religious values, but serious differences exist within
 the leadership and within the clergy. The Government maintains power through
 widespread repression and intimidation. The judiciary is subject to government and
 religious influence.
 Several agencies share responsibility for internal security, including the Ministry
 of Intelligence and Security, the Ministry of Interior, and the Revolutionary Guards,
 a military force established after the revolution. Paramilitary volunteer forces
 known as Basijis, and gangs of street thugs, known as the Ansar-e Hezbollah (Help-
 ers of the Party of God), who are often aligned with specific conservative members
 of the clergy, act as vigilantes. Both regular and paramilitary security forces com-
 mitted numerous, serious human rights abuses.
 Iran has a mixed economy. The Government owns the petroleum and utilities in-
 dustries and the banks. Large charitable foundations called bonyads, most with
 strong connections to the Government, control properties expropriated from the
 former Shah and figures associated with his regime. The bonyads exercise consider-
 able influence in the economy. Oil exports are the primary source of foreign ex-
 change. Mismanagement and corruption have created serious economic problems.
 Unemployment in 1997 was estimated to be at least 25 percent, and inflation was
 an estimated 20 percent.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor. The Government restricts
 the right of citizens to change their government. Systematic abuses include
 extrajudicial killings and summary executions; disappearances; widespread use of
 torture and other degrading treatment; harsh prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and
 detention; unfair trials; infringement on citizens' privacy; and restriction of the free-
 doms of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement. The Govern-
 ment manipulates the electoral system and represses political dissidents. However,
 during the presidential election campaign however, a lively debate on political, eco-
 nomic, and social issues occurred, although the Government closed several news-
 papers, disqualified candidates, and intimidated opposition campaigners by encour-
 aging vigilante attacks. Supreme Leader Khamenei, in a break with precedent,
 backed one candidate, Majles Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri. Nonetheless,
 Khatami's election victory, with nearly 70% of the vote, was not disputed and the
 regime apparently did not engage in election fraud. Khatami's election appeared to
 demonstrate a strong desire among his supporters, primarily women, youth, and the
 middle class, for greater social and cultural freedom and increased economic oppor-
 tunity. Women face legal and social discrimination. The Government discriminates
 against minorities and restricts important worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-U.N. representatives, including the
 U.N. Special Representative on Human Rights in Iran, Maurice Copithorne, and
 independent human rights organizations continue to comment on the absence of pro-
 cedural safeguards in criminal trials. Inhuman punishments are used in some cases,
 including atoning (see Section i.e.). In 1992 the domestic press stopped reporting
 most executions; however, executions appear to continue in substantial numbers.
 Amnesty International (Al) reported that at least 110 persons were executed in
 1996, a substantial increase over the previous year's total of 50 executions. Special
 Representative Copithorne reported 137 executions through November.
 Iranian journalist Ebrahim Zalzadeh, editor of Mayar literary magazine, had criti-
 cized government censorship and persecution of writers, and was arrested in Feb-
 mary. His body was found on March 29 with multiple stab wounds to the chest,
 accordin to Human Rights Watch (HRW). It is widely believed that the regime is
 responsible. Attorney Mohammed Assadi was executed on August 9 on charges that
 'The United States does not have an embassy in Iran. This report draws heavily on non-U.S.
 Government sources.
 
 
 1441
 included taking part in a 1980 coup attempt, visiting Israel before the 1979 Iranian
 revolution, and being a Freemason and a member of the International Lions organi-
 zation.
 Exiles and human rights monitors allege that many of those executed for criminal
 offenses, primarily narcotics charges, are actually political dissidents. A November
 1995 law criminalized dissent and applied the death penalty to offenses such as "at-
 tempts against the security of the State, outrage against high-ranking Iranian offi-
 cials, and insults against the memory of Imam Khomeimi and against the Leader
 of the Islamic Republic."
 Two Baha'i men reportedly died under circumstances that led some observers to
 believe that the men were killed because of their religious beliefs.
 Investigations of the killing of political dissidents abroad continued in 1997. A
 verdict issued on January 24 by the seventh Criminal Court of Istanbul sentenced
 an Iranian citizen to more than 32 years in prison with hard labor for his role-
 under the supervision of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security-in the
 murders of two members of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, according
 to the U.N. Special Representative.
 On April 10, in its official verdict, the Berlin Superior Court stated that the Su-
 preme Leader, President and Minister of Intelligence and Security had ordered the
 1992 killings of three Kurdish Iranian dissidents and their translator at the
 Mykonos restaurant in Berlin. The trial revealed persuasive evidence that govern-
 ment agents were responsible for the killings and that senior Iranian government
 officials had ordered them.
 In June a Swiss judge voiced suspicions that Iranian authorities ordered the 1990
 murder of Kazem Rajavi, a member of the National Council of Iranian Resistance.
 The announcement was made after 11/2 years of close collaboration with German ju-
 dicial authorities.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur noted that a total of 91 mostly Kurdish
 oppositionists based in Iraq were reported to have been killed by the Iranian regime
 in 1997, as a result both of targeted killings and armed clashes.
 The Government took no action to repudiate the fatwa, or religious ruling, calling
 for the murder of British author Salman Rushdie or anyone associated with his
 book, "The Satanic Verses."
 b. Disappearance.-No reliable information is available on the number of dis-
 appearances. In the period immediately following arrest, many detainees are held
 incommunicado.
 Faraj Sarkuhi, who disappeared for 2 months in 1996, was arrested in February
 and convicted of spreading antiovernment propaganda (see Section 2.a.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Credible reports indicate that security forces continue to torture detainees and pris-
 oners. Common methods include suspension for long periods in contorted positions,
 burning with cigarettes, and, most frequently, severe and repeated beatings with ca-
 bles or other instruments on the back and on the soles of the feet. A July 1996 law
 strengthens Islamic punishments such as flogging, stoning, amputations, and public
 executions. Four people were reported to have been stoned in 1997. According to
 Amnesty International, in August a 20-year-old woman, Zoleykhah Kadkhoda, was
 arrested on charges of adultery and stoned on the same day, but survived.
 Prison conditions are harsh. Some prisoners are held in solitary confinement or
 denied adequate food or medical care in order to force confessions. Female prisoners
 have reportedly been raped or otherwise tortured while in detention. In the past,
 prison guards have intimidated the family members of detainees and have some-
 times tortured detainees in their presence. Special Representative Copithorne met
 privately in 1996 with detainee Abbas Amir Entezam, a former deputy minister in
 the government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. Amir Entezam reported that
 the conditions in Evin prison improved after 1989, but that political prisoners still
 were housed with violent criminals and denied regular family visits. Amir Entezam
 claimed that he was beaten so severely that he lost the hearing in his left ear. There
 is no indication that conditions in the prisons have improved substantially since
 Copithorne's visit.
 The Government does not permit unrestricted visits to imprisoned dissidents by
 human rights monitors. During the 1996 visit the U.N. Special Representative was
 not able to see all the dissidents he asked to see.
 In September 1994, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) issued
 a report on "unresolved humanitarian issues" from the Iran-Iraq war. The ICRC
 noted that the Government failed to identify combatants killed in action and failed
 to exchange information on those killed or missing. The report criticized the Govern-
 ment for obstructing ICRC efforts to register and repatriate prisoners of war
 (POW's). The ICRC estimated in August that more than 13,000 Iraqi POWs had not
 
 
 1442
 been repatriated. Iran released 46 POW's in September in what it called a humani-
 tarian gesture. In late November, Iran released 500 Iraqi POW's, describing it as
 a "philanthropic" action. The governments of Iran and Iraq made little progress dur-
 ing the year on resolving the issue of those missing in action.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary arrest and detention, it remains a problem. There is reportedly no legal time
 limit on incommunicado detention, nor any judicial means to determine the legality
 of detention. Suspects may be held for questioning in jails or in local Revolutionary
 Guard offices.
 The security forces often do not inform family members of a prisoner's welfare and
 location. Even if these circumstances are known, the prisoner still may be denied
 visits by family and legal counsel. In addition, families of executed prisoners do not
 always receive notification of the prisoner's death. Those that do receive such infor-
 mation may be forced to pay the Government to retrieve the body of their relative.
 On December 14, Ebrahim Yazdi, Secretary-General of the Freedom Movement
 (IFM) since 1995, was arrested on unknown charges and detained in Evin prison
 in Tehran. Yazdi was Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Islamic Republic's first gov-
 ernment after the 1979 revolution. He tried to ron in recent p residential and par-
 liamentary elections but was denied permission by the regime. Yazdi had made pub-
 lic statements that may have been considered insulting to the Supreme Leader and
 joined some 50 others in signing an open letter to President Khatami urging the
 regime to respect the rights of dissident clerics. He was released on December 25,
 but faces charges of "desecrating religious sanctities," according to press reports.
 Although the Government claimed to have released Abbas Amir Entezam early
 in 1996, he is still detained. Initially arrested in 1979 on charges of espionage and
 condemned to life in prison, he is now held under house arrest.
 Adherents of the Baha'i faith continue to face arbitrary arrest and detention. The
 Government appears to adhere to a practice of keeping a small number of Baha'is
 in detention at any given time. According to the Special Representative and Baha'i
 groups, at least 21 Baha'is are currentl in Iranian prisons, including 2 men con-
 victed of apostasy and sentenced to death. Two otheraha'i men are in prison and
 sentenced to death for espionage and Zionist activities. Eleven Baha'is were arrested
 between May and December, two on unknown charges, one for proselytizing a Mus-
 lim, four for holding Baha'i meetings, and four for working without permits (see Sec-
 tion 2.c.).
 Although reliable statistics are not available, observers believe that scores or hun-
 dreds of Iranians are currently imprisoned for their political beliefs.
 The Government does not use forced exile, but many dissidents leave Iran because
 they feel threatened. Amnesty International reported in June that at least three dis-
 sident senior religious figures have been held under house arrest. The clerics in-
 clude Ayatollah Hassan Tabataei-Qomi, under house arrest for more than 13 years;
 Ayatollah Mohammad Sadeq Rowhani, under house arrest for more than 12 years;
 and Ayatollah Yasub al-Din Rastgari, under house arrest since late 1996. Addition-
 ally, the ayatollahs' followers reportedly have been detained and tortured.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system is not independent and is sub-
 ject to government and religious influence.
 Iranhas two court systems: The traditional courts, which adjudicate civil and
 criminal offenses; and the Islamic Revolutionary Courts, established in 1979 to try
 political offenses, narcotics crimes, and "crimes against God."
 Many aspects of the prerevolutionary judicial system survive in the civil and
 criminal courts. For example defendants have the right to a public trial, may choose
 their own lawyer, and have the right of appeal. Trials are adjudicated by panels of
 judges. There is no jury system. If a situation is not addressed by statutes enacted
 after the 1979 revolution, the Government advises judges to give precedence to Is-
 lamic law rather than rely on statues enacted during the Shah's regime. The courts
 are subject to political influence. The Revolutionary Courts may consider cases nor-
 mally in the jurisdiction of the civil and criminal courts, and also may overturn
 their decisions. Criteria for assigning cases to either system of courts appear to be
 arbitrary and unsystematic. The Supreme Court has limited authority to review
 cases.
 Trials in the Revolutionary Courts are not fair. A law authorizes judges to act as
 prosecutor and judge in the same case, and judges are appointed for their ideological
 beliefs. Often, pretrial detention is prolonged and defendants lack access to attor-
 neys. When legal help is available, attorneys are rarely given time to prepare an
 effective  defense. Indictments  are  often  for undefined  offenses  such  as
 "antirevolutionary behavior," "moral corruption," and "siding with global arrogance."
 Defendants do not have the right to confront their accusers or to appeal. Secret or
 summary trials of 5 minutes are not uncommon. Others are show trials intended
 
 
 1443
 to highlight a coerced public confession. A women's testimony is worth only half that
 of a man making it difficult for a woman to prove a case against a male defendant.
 In addition, the families of female victims of violent crime reportedly must pay the
 assailant's court costs.
 The Government often charges members of religious minorities with crimes such
 as drug offenses or apostasy. Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary,
 stated in 1996 that Baha'ism was an espionage organization. In January it was
 learned that the Supreme Court of Iran had confirmed the death sentences against
 Zabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talabi, two Baha'is convicted of apostasy (see Sec-
 tions 2.c. and 5). In January Hedayatollah Zendehdel, a Jewish businessman who
 converted to Islam, was hanged, having been charged in July 1996 with espionage
 and economic fraud during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
 No estimates are available on the number of political prisoners. However, the
 Government often arrests persons on questionable criminal charges, usually drug
 trafficking or espionage, when their actual "offenses" are political.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution states that "reputation, life, property, (and) dwelling(s)" are protected
 from trespass except as "provided by law." However, security forces enter homes and
 offices, monitor telephone conversations, and open mail without court authorization.
 The Basijis, other security forces, and the Ansar-e Hezbollah monitor the social
 activities of citizens. Such organizations may harass or arrest women whose clothing
 does not cover the hair and all of the body except the hands and face, or those who
 wear makeup. Vigilante violence may include attacks on young people believed to
 be too foreign in their dress or activities, invading private homes, and abusing un-
 married couples. Women also have been beaten if caught without proper clothing
 in public or in private houses when men are present. Enforcement appears to be
 very arbitrary, varying widely with the political climate and the individuals in-
 volved.
 In the past, prison guards have intimidated family members of detainees (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). Iranian opposition figures living abroad have reported harassment of their
 relatives in Iran.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the freedom of the
 press, except when published ideas are "contrary to Islamic principles, or are det-
 rimental to public rights." In practice the Government restricts freedom of speech
 and the press. However, since his August inauguration, President Khatami has pub-
 licly stated his intention to loosen constraints on freedom of expression, and some
 signs of this have been observed.
 The Government exerts strong control over most media, particularly publications.
 Some newspapers are associated with factions in the Government. They reflect dif-
 ferent views and criticize the Government, but are prohibited from criticizing the
 concept of velayat-e faqih, or rule by a supreme religious leader, or from promoting
 the rights of ethnic minorities.
 Complaints against journalists, editors, and publishers are frequently levied by
 public officials and even rival publications, and the offending writer is often subject
 to a trial, with fines, suspension from journalistic activities, lashings, and imprison-
 ment being common punishments if found guilty of offenses ranging from propa-
 ganda against the State to insulting the leadership of the Islamic Republic. Ansar-
 e Hezbollah have in the past attacked the offices of liberal publications and book-
 stores without interference from the police or prosecution by the courts.
 The record on freedom of expression has been mixed this year. President Khatami
 has publicly stated his intention to loosen constraints on freedom of expression, and
 in October, after his inauguration, it was reported that a year-long ban on the Ira-
 nian-Armenian monthly Araz had been lifted. The journal was to resume publication
 in Tehran with the support of the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance. Also
 in October, the 2 -year ban on Jahan-e Eslam newspaper was lifted, and the Min-
 istry of Culture and Islamic Guidance blocked the reissue of the blacklist Hoviyyat,
 citing it as hostile to Iranian intellectuals..
 Faraj Sarkuhi, a magazine editor who had been critical of the Government and
 who disappeared in November 1996 while traveling to Germany, reappeared in Iran
 in late December 1996. He was subsequently arrested and detained in February on
 charges of espionage and attempting to leave the country illegally. Sarkuhi was de-
 nied permission to meet with family members, lawyers, or foreign diplomats who
 requested to see him, according to Human Rights Watch. In September he was con-
 victed of "spreading antigovernment propaganda" and sentenced to a year in jail,
 including time already served. This sentence, lighter than some observers had ex-
 
 
 1444
 pected, was variously interpreted as being influenced by Khatami's emphasis on
 openness, or by strong international pressure on Sarkuhi's behalf.
 Despite Khatami's public commitment to increased openness, many constraints re-
 main. In particular, criticism of the Supreme Leader or of the principle of rule by
 a religious leader tend to generate a stern, immediate response from the Govern-
 ment. In November, Ayatollah Hossein All Montazeri called into question the Su-
 preme Leader's authority. In the past, Khamenei had been attacked by other clerics
 on the grounds that he does not possess sufficient religious credential to serve as
 the senior Iranian religious authority. Montazeri's remarks sparked attacks on his
 residence by Ansar-e Hezbollah mobs. These events prompted Ebrahim Yazdi and
 49 others to issue an open letter calling for the Government to respect Montazeri's
 rights (see Section 2.d.). Montazeri remains under house arrest.
 At least nine publications were banned during the year, most before Khatami's
 inauguration. In March the Esfahan-based cultural magazine, Zayendeh Rud, was
 closed down. No reason was cited for this action. In May Ya Sarat al-Hoseyn was
 banned for insulting then-candidate Khatami, who had initially lodged the com-
 plaint against the publication. In July Sobh magazine was suspendedfor a month
 after its publisher was accused of scandalous reporting. In a July letter published
 in a newspaper, publisher and writer Abdolkarim Soroush confirmed that he had
 been banned from leaving the country and that his passport had been confiscated.
 In November Ansar-e Hezbollah thugs attempted to break up at least one of
 Soroush's lectures.
 The Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance is also charged with vetting books
 prior to publication to ensure that they do not contain offensive material. However,
 some books and pamphlets critical of the Government are published without re-
 prisal. It was announced in July that regulations on book censorship would be made
 available to publishers to help them "overcome potential problems more easily." The
 Ministry inspects foreign printed materials prior to their release on the market.
 Human Rights Watch reports that in January Karamollah Tavahodi, a Kurdish
 writer living in Mashhad, was detained and sentenced to 1 year in prison because
 of the content of one of the volumes of his work, "The Historical Movement of Kurds
 in Khorassan." The book had been banned prior to his detention.
 Government restrictions on the film industry were tightened during the year. In
 August new regulations were announced requiring that film producers get official
 permission before they can sell international distribution rights to their films. Films
 produced in Iran already needed Ministry approval before they could be produced
 or screened. However, the Foreign Ministry intervened in May to overturn a ban
 imposed by the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance on Abbas Kiarostami's
 "The Taste of the Cherry," so that it could be shown at the Cannes Film Festival.
 In addition, since Khatami's inauguration, the Government has released at least
 two previously-banned films despite the protests of religious conservatives.
 The Government owns all broadcasting facilities, and their programming reflects
 its political and socio-religious ideology.
 The Government took no action to repudiate the fatwa, or religious ruling, calling
 for the murder of British author Salman Rushdie or anyone associated with his
 book, "The Satanic Verses." Also, the Government has failed to demand that the 15
 Khordad Foundation rescind the bounty offered for Rushdie's murder. Moreover, it
 was announced by the head of the 15 Khordad Foundation, Ayatollah Sane'i, a
 member of the council of senior clerics that oversees legislation, that anyone who
 carried out the execution of Rushdie during the 10-day Dawn of the Victory of the
 Islamic Revolution would receive an increased bounty; after the 10-day period, the
 bounty was decreased to its former amount.
 Academic censorship persists. In his 1996 interim report the U.N. Special Rep-
 resentative noted the existence of a campaign to bring about the "Islamization of
 the universities," which seemed to be a movement to purge persons "who fight
 against the sanctities of the Islamic system."
 Government informers are said to be common on university campuses and mon-
 itor classroom material. Admission to universities is politicized; all applicants must
 pass "character tests" in which officials screen out applicants critical of the Govern-
 ment's ideology. To achieve tenure, professors must cooperate with government au-
 thorities over a period of years.
 An academic, Habibollah Peyman, was not allowed to leave the country in Feb-
 ruary.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution permits as-
 semblies and marches "provided they do not violate the principles of Islam." In prac-
 tice, the Government restricts freedom of assembly. The Special Representative in
 1996 noted the tendency of government police and military forces not to intervene
 when Ansar-e Hezbollah attempted to break up opposition or cultural gatherings.
 
 
 1445
 The Constitution provides for the establishment of political parties, professional
 associations, and religious groups provided that they do not violate the principles
 of "freedom, sovereignty, and national unity," or question Islam or the Islamic Re-
 public. In practice, most independent organizations are banned, co-opted by the Gov-
 ernment, or moribund.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution declares that the "official religion of
 Iran is Islam and the sect followed is Ja'fari Shi'ism.f It also states that "other Is-
 lamic denominations shall enjoy complete respect," and specifically mentions "pro-
 tected religious minorities' including Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians. However,
 the Government restricts freedom of religion, particularly for those religious minori-
 ties not recognized by the Constitution. The Government is profoundly influenced
 by Shi'a Islam. The President and many top officials, including the Speaker of the
 Parliament and many parliamentary deputies, are Shi'a clergymen.
 Approximately 90 percent of the population are Shi'a Muslims. Aside from slightly
 over 1 percent who are not Muslims the rest of the population are Sunni Mus !ms,
 drawn largely from Kurdish, Arab, Turkoman, Baluchi, and other ethnic minorities.
 Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians are legally permitted to practice their religion
 and instruct their children, but may not proselytize Muslims. The Government
 interferes with the administration of their schools, and harassment by government
 officials is common (see Section 5).
 Oppression of evangelical Christians continued in 1997. In January two visiting
 Christian evangelists, Daniel Baumann and Stuart Timm, were arrested and de-
 tained under suspicion of espionage, a charge often levied against ersons who pros-
 elytize. Both eventually were released without having been charge .
 In January Hedayatollah Zendehdel, a Jewish businessman who converted to
 Islam, was hanged, having been charged in July 1996 with espionage and economic
 fraud during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Zendehdel is widely believed to have been
 targeted because he was a wealthy member of the Jewish community.
 The Government regards the Baha'i community, with 300,000 to 350,000 mem-
 bers, as a "misguided sect." Baha'is may not teac or practice their faith or main-
 tain links with coreligionists abroad. The Government appears to adhere to a prac-
 tice of keeping a small number of Baha'is in arbitrary detention at any given time.
 According to the Special Representative, at least 12 Baha'is are currently in Iranian
 prisons, including 2 men sentenced to death for apostasy and two others sentenced
 to death for espionage. Two Bahai men reportedly died in circumstances that led
 some observers to believe that the men were killed because of their religious beliefs
 (see Section L.a.).
 The Government continues to persecute Baha'is. Broad restrictions on the Baha'is
 appear to be geared to destroying them as a community (see Section 5). For exam-
 ple, Baha'i marriages are not recognized by the Government, leaving Baha'i women
 open to charges of prostitution. Children of Baha'i marriages are not recognized as
 legitimate and, therefore, are denied inheritance rights. Baha'i sacred and historical
 properties have been systematically confiscated and some have been destroyed.
 Group meetings and religious education are severely curtailed. Universities continue
 to deny admittance to Baha'i students. Baha'is regularly are denied compensation
 for injury or criminal victimization. Government authorities claim that only Muslim
 plaintiffs are eligible for compensation in these circumstances. Baha'is are prohib-
 ited from government employment. A 1993 law prohibits government workers from
 membership in gups that deny the "divine religions." The Government uses such
 terminology to describe members of the Baha'i faith. The law also stipulates pen-
 alties for government workers who do not observe "Islamic principles and rules."
 The Government often charges members of religious minorities with crimes such
 as drug offenses or apostasy (see Section 1.d.)
 d. Freedom of Movenent Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens may travel to any part of Iran, although there have been re-
 strictions on travel to Kurdish areas during times of heavy fighting. There were no
 reports of heavy fighting in these areas in 1997. Citizens may change their place
 of residence without obtaining official permission. The Government requires exit
 permits for draft-age males and citizens who are politically suspect. Some citizens,
 particularly those whose skills are in short supply and who were educated at gov-
 ernment expense, must post bonds to obtain exit permits.
 The Government permits Jews to travel abroad, but often denies them the mul-
 tiple-exit permits normally issued to other citizens. The Government does not nor-
 maly permit all members of a Jewish family to travel abroad at the same time. Ba-
 ha'is often experience difficulty getting passports. The Government prevented at
 least one academic from leaving the country (see Section 2.a.).
 The Government and the U . High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) esti-
 mate that there are approximately 1.3 million Afghan refugees in Iran. Of this total,
 
 
 1446
 only about 21,800 are accommodated in refugee camps administered by the Govern-
 ment. The rest live seminomadic lives or reside in settlements. In 1996 about 8,000
 refugees repatriated to Afghanistan; none were repatriated in 1997. This was far
 fewer than the UNHCR had predicted would return and resulted from continued in-
 stability in Afghanistan.
 The UNHCR estimates that there are about 580,000 Iraqi Kurdish and Shi'a Mus-
 lim refugees in Iran who were displaced by the Gulf War. There were no substantial
 changes in the population of Kurdish refugees in Iran in 1997. Most Kurdish refu-
 gees who fled fighting in northern Iraq in 1996 have returned there.
 The Government generally cooperates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian
 organizations in assisting refugees. Although the Government generally provides
 first asylum (and provided it to a large number of Afghan and Iraqi refugees), there
 have been instances, most recently in 1996, where pressure was applied to force ref-
 ugees to return to their home countries.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change their government is severely compromised by the
 leadership of the Government. The Supreme Leader, who exercises decisive power,
 is not elected and cannot be removed. The Government effectively manipulates the
 electoral system to its advantage. There is no separation of state and religion, and
 clerics dominate all branches of government. The Government represses any move-
 ment seeking to separate state and religion, or to alter the State's existing theo-
 cratic foundation. The selection of candidates for elections is effectively controlled
 by the ruling clerics.
 The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed of six Islamic cler-
 gymen and six lay members who review all laws for consistency with Islamic law
 and the Constitution. The Council also screens political candidates for ideological
 and religious suitability. It accepts only candidates who support a theocratic state,
 but clerics who disagree with government policies also have been disqualified.
 Regularly scheduled elections are held for the President, members of the Majles,
 and members of the Assembly of Experts, a body responsible for selecting the suc-
 cessor to the Supreme Leader. The decisions of the Majles are reviewed by the
 Council of Guardians, which must approve legislation before it enters into force.
 Vigorous parliamentary debates take place on various issues. Most deputies are as-
 sociated with powerful political and religious officials, but often vote independently
 and shift from one faction to another.
 A new president was elected in May. The Interior ministry estimated that over
 90 percent of the eligible population voted in the May presidential election. During
 the campaign, there was considerable government intervention and censorship. The
 Council of Guardians reviewed 238 candidates, including a women, but only allowed
 4 individuals to run. Three were clerics; all were men. Seyyed Mohammad Khatami
 garnered nearly 70% of the vote, his greatest support coming from the middle class,
 youth, minorities, and women.
 The election results were particularly notable because Khatami was not the re-
 gime's preferred candidate. In a break with precedent, Supreme Leader Khamenei
 let it be known that he preferred Majles Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri. Prayer
 leaders also supported Nateq-Nuri in their sermons. The regime attempted to censor
 public debate by restricting the campaign coverage of some technocratic and modern
 left publications, particularly the pro-Khatami daily, Salam. As the election neared,
 Khatami was evicted from his campaign headquarters. Despite the regime's clear
 preference for Nateq-Nuri, the election results were not disputed, and the regime
 does not appear to have engaged in election fraud-possibly due to Khatami's early
 and overwhelming lead. The results appear to indicate that citizens demanded
 change within the limits allowed by government control of the electoral process.
 The Government continued in early 1997 to nullify election results from the
 spring 1996 Majles elections in several districts, including Malayer, Astara, and
 fahan. Women are underrepresented in government. They hold only 13 of 270
 Majles seats, and there are no female cabinet members. President Khatami ap-
 pointed the first female vice president since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Masoumeh
 Ebtekar, following his in auguration. Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance
 Ata'ollah Mohajerani appointed a second woman to a senior post, Azam Nouri, when
 he chose her in August as his deputy. A woman was also appointed as a district
 mayor of Tehran.
 Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians elect deputies to reservedd Majles seats.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government continued to repress local human rights groups. In 1996 the
 Government established a human rights committee in the Majiles and a human
 rights commission in the judiciary, but observers believe that they lack independ-
 ence. The ICRC and the UTNHCR both operate in Iran.
 In 1997 the Government did not allow U.N. Special Representative for Human
 Rights in Iran, Mr. Copithorne, to visit the country, and complained that his annual
 report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission was biased. Iran denies the uni-
 versality of human rights and has stated that separate "Islamic' standards of
 human rights should apply to Islamic countries.
 In April a Foreign Ministry spokesman complained that Copithorne had exploited
 the goodwill of the Government and published lies and rumors in his reports. The
 spokesman also claimed that the issue of human rights was being used as a political
 tool and was manipulated by Zionist and foreign interests. Although the Special
 Representative reported that the Government was generally cooperative during his
 Febuary 1996 visit, following the release of his findings he was refused permission
 to go back to Iran in late 1996 and early 1997 to gather fresh material for an up-
 dated review. In his October report, Copithorne stated that he was disappointed by
 the difficulty in getting information from the Government on specific cases.
 A newspaper close to the regime advised that allowing members of the U-NHRC
 to visit Iran would "in fact enable them to abuse Iran's goodwill to publish their
 pre-planned reports," and further stated that the criteria for assessing human rights
 should undergo a drastic change."
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 In general the Government does not discriminate on the basis of race, disability,
 language, or social status. The Government does discriminate on the basis of reli-
 gion and sex.
 Women.-Although domestic violence is known to occur, little is known about its
 extent. Abuse in the family is considered a private matter and seldom discussed
 publicly. There are no official statistics on the subject.
 Discrimination against women has increased since the revolution. In general
 women suffer discrimination in the legal 'code, particularly in family and property
 matters. It is difficult for many women, particularly those residing outside large
 cities, to obtain any legal redress. Under the legal system, a woman s testimony as
 a witness is worth only half that of a man, (see Section i.e.)
 Although women may be educated and employed in the professions, social con-
 straints tend to inhibit their opportunities. Illiteracy and lack of university degrees
 also affect their standing. The enforcement of conservative Islamic dress codes has
 varied considerably since the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989. Such dress codes
 persist, although reports from human rights organizations and individual citizens
 indicate that enforcement varies with the political climate and the location. Women
 are often subject to harassment by the Ansar-e Hezbollah or the authorities if their
 dress or behavior is considered inappropriate.
 Under legislation passed in 1983, women have the right to divorce, and regula-
 tions promul ated in 1984 substantially broadened the grounds on which a woman
 may seek a divorce. However, a husband is not required to cite a reason for divorc-
 ing his wife. In 1986 the Majles passed a 12-article law on marriage and divorce
 that limited the privileges accorded to men by custom and traditional interpreta-
 tions of Islamic law. The 1986 law also recognized divorced women's rights to a
 share of the property that couples acquire during their marriage and increased ali-
 mony rights.
 Although the Government permitted women to attain the rank of-judge in 1995
 for the first time since the 1979 revolution, until May they were not allowed to issue
 judicial verdicts. They may now do so, but only in cases relevant to women.
 Children.-Most children have access to education through the 12th grade, and
 to some form of health care. There is no known pattern of child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no available information regarding whether
 the Government has legislated or otherwise mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 However, the Cable News Network reported in 1996 on the harsh conditions in an
 institution for retarded children who had been abandoned by their parents. The film
 showed children tied or chained to their beds, in filthy conditions, without appro-
 priate care. It is not known to what extent this represents the typical treatment of
 the disabled in Iran.
 Religious Minorities.-The Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Baha!i minorities
 suffer varying degrees of officially sanctioned discrimination, particularly in the
 
 
 1448
 
 areas of employment, education, and public accommodations (see Section 2.d.). Mus-
 lims who convert to Christianity also suffer discrimination.
 University applicants are required to pass an examination in Islamic theology. Al-
 though pub ic-school students receive instruction in Islam, this requirement limits
 the access of most religious minorities to higher education. Applicants for public-sec-
 tor employment are similarly screened for their adherence to Islam.
 Religious minorities suffer discrimination in the legal system, receiving lower
 awards in injury and death lawsuit anand incurring heavier punishments than Mus-
 lims. Sunni Muslims encounter religious discrimination at the local level.
 - - In 1993 the U.N. Special Representative reported the existence of a government
 policy directive on the Baha'is. According to the directive, the Supreme Revolution-
 ary     cU instructed government agencies to block the progress and development
 of the Baha'i community, expel Baha'i students from umversities, cut the Baha'is'
 links with groups outside Iran, restrict the employment of Baha'is, and deny Baha's
 "positions of influence," including those in education. The Government claims that
 the directive is a forgery. However, it appears to be an accurate reflection of current
 government practice.
 Property belonging to the Baha'i community as a whole, such as places of worship,
 remains confiscated. Other government restrictions have been eased, so that Baha i-s
 may currently obtain food ration booklets and send their children to public schools.
 However, the prohibition against the admissin of Baha'is to universities appears
 to be enforced. Thousands of Baha'is dismissed from government jobs in the early
 1980's receive no unemployment benefits and have been required to repay the Gov-
 ernment for salaries or pensions received from the first day of employment. Those
 unable to do so face prison sentences (see Sections 1.d. and 2.c.).
 National/IRacial IEthnic Minorities.-The Kurds seek greater autonomy and con-
 tinue to suffer from government discrimination.
 In February the Special Representative contacted the Government on two occa-
 sions regarding questionable detentions of persons reported to be sympathetic to
 Azeri nationalism.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Labor Code grants workers the right
 to establish unions, there are no independent unions. A national organization known
 as the Worker's House, founded in 1982, is the sole authorized national labor orga-
 nization. It serves primarily as a conduit for the Government to exert control over
 workers. The leadership of the Worker's House coordinates activities with Islamic
 labor councils, which are organized in many enterprises. These councils also func-
 tion as instruments of government control, although they have frequently been able
 to block layoffs and dismissals. Moreover, a network of government-backed guilds
 issues vocational licenses, funds financial cooperatives, and helps workers fine-jobs.
 The Government does not tolerate any strike deemed to he at odds with its eco-
 nomic and labor policies. In 1993 the Parliament passed a law that prohibits strikes
 bygovernment workers. It also prohibits government workers from     con tacts
 with foreigners and stipulates penalties for failure to observe Islamic dress codes
 and principles at work.
 In February oil refinery workers in Tehran went on strike to protest pay and
 working conditions. There were several reports of mass arrests.
 There are no known affiliations with international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers do not have the
 right to organize independently and negotiate collective bargaining agreements. No
 information is available on mechanisms used to set wages.
 It is not known whether labor legislation and practice in the exprt processing
 zones differ from the law andpractice in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Penal Code provides that the
 Government may require any person who does not have work to take suitable em-
 ployment. This prvision has been criticized frequently by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) as contravening ILO Convention 29 on forced labor. There is no
 information available on the Government's policy on forced and bonded labor by
 children.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employmrent.-The labor
 law prohibits employment of minors under 15 years of age and places special restric-
 tions on the employment of minors under age 18. Education is compulsory until age
 11. The law permits children to work in agriculture, domestic service, and some
 small businesses. By law women and minors may not be employed in hard labor or,
 in general, in night work. Information on the extent to which these regulations are
 entd is not available. There is no information available on the Government's pol-
 icy on forced and bonded labr by children.
 
 
 1449
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code empowers the Supreme Labor
 Council to establish annual minimum wage levels for each industrial sector and re-
 gion. It is not known if the minimum wages are adjusted annually or enforced. The
 Labor Code stipulates that the minimum wage should be sufficient to meet the liv-
 ing expenses of a family and should take inflation into account. Under current poor
 economic conditions, many middle-class citizens must work two or even three jobs
 to support their families. The daily minimum wage was raised in March to $2.80
 (8,500 rials). It is unlikely that minimum wage laws alone can ensure a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. Information on the share of the working
 population covered by minimum wage legislation is not available.
 According to press reports, the Ministry of Labor in December 1996 announced
 that employers had 1 month in which to fire foreign workers and replace them with
 Iranians. It is believed that approximately 1 million foreign workers, mostly Afghan
 refugees, would have been affected. The Government aparently hoped to alleviate
 high unemployment by pressuring foreigners to leave. owever, repatriation num-
 bers appear to be low due to continuing unrest in Afghanistan.
 The Labor Code establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum, with 1
 weekly rest day, normally Fridays, and at least 12 days of paid annual leave and
 several paid public holidays.
 According to the Labor Code, a Supreme Safety Council, chaired by the Labor
 Minister or his representative, is responsible for promoting workplace safety and
 health. The Council reportedly has issued 28 safety directives, and oversees the ac-
 tivities of 3,000 safety committees established in enterprises employing more than
 10 persons. It is not known how well the Ministrys inspectors enforce regulations.
 It is not known whether workers can remove themselves from hazardous situations
 without risking the loss of employment.
