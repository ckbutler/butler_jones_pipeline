 CAMBODIA
 Cambodia experienced extraordinary changes In 1992 and made notable progress
 in human rights, although serious problems remain. The 4 Cambodian factions and
 18 concerned nations in October 1991 had signed agreements on a comprehensive
 political settlement of the Cambodia conflict. These required the Cambodian parties
 to put down their arms, demobilize most of their forces, and commit themselves "to
 ho ding free and fair elections organized and conducted by the United Nations as
 the basis for forming a new and legitimate government." The elections are scheduled
 for May 1993.
 From April 1975 until January 1979 the Khmer Rouge, also called the Party of
 Democratic Kampuchea (PDK), ruled Cambodia and compiled one of the worst
 records of human rights abuse in this century. Between one-seventh and one-eighth
 of the population died of exhaustion, disease abuse, and by execution.
 In 1979 the Khmer Rouge were ejected from power by an invading Vietnamese
 army. The Vietnamese installed a regime made up largely of former PDK cadre and
 named it the People's Republic of Kampuchea. This was renamed the State of Cam-
 bodia (SOC) in 1989. Vietnamese arms maintained the SOC in power against rem-
 nants of the PDK and non-Communist resistance under Prince Sihanouk. In Sep-
 tember 1989, after 11 years of military occupation and stalemate, the Vietnamese
 withdrew the bulk of their armed forces.
 The October 1991 Peace Accords established a national reconciliation body called
 the Supreme National Council (SNC) whose president is Prince Sihanouk. The SNC
 includes representatives of the four Cambodian parties: the Khmer People's Na-
 tional Liberation Front (KPNLF); the National Front for an Independent, Neutral,
 Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC); the PDK; and the SOC (led by
 the Cambodian People's Party-CPP). Legally, the SNC embodies Cambodia's sov-
 ereignty during the transitional period until a new and representational government
 can be established.
 In the Accords, the SNC delegates to the United Nations all powers necessary to
 ensure their implementation. The United Nations has a broad mandate to achieve
 a neutral political environment for elections. Its instrument for this is the U.N.
 Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). UNTAC is to disarm the factions'
 armed forces, exercise direct control or supervision over administrative bodies in the
 fields of foreign affairs, national defense finance, public security, and information
 and to oversee human rights. It arrived officially on March 15 and has deployed
 nearly 16,000 armed peacekeepers and 5,000 civil administrators and civilian police.
 While the non-Communist KPNLF and FUNCINPEC, and the SOC generally co-
 operated with UNTAC, the PDK refused to allow UNTAC access to PDK areas and
 to participate in U.N. plans for demobilization. In December PDK forces detained
 by force U  AC military personnel who ventured into PDK-controlled enclaves to
 prepare for elections. It was thus impossible to document human rights abuses in
 PDK areas, except to note generally that the PDK continued to maintain a tight
 grinp on the people in its areas through violence and intimidation.
 In contrast, during the past several years, the SOC has been changing the small
 and predominantly agricultural economy from a centrally planned to a market-ori-
 ented economy. Legislation in 1989 restored the right to own and inherit property,
 and agricultural production is now mostly private and family based. While these re-
 forms, together with growing foreign investment, have improved the economy mod-
 estly, Cambodia remains one of the world's poorest countries, with an annual per
 capta income of only about $190.
 Where UNTAC was able to establish itself throughout much of the country, great
 strides were made in improving human rights. The SNC laid down rules for freedom
 of speech, press, and assembly, and ratified key international human rights instru-
 ments. For the first time in nearly 20 years, independent political parties were es-
 
 
 tablished in Phnom Penh and were able to function throughout most of Cambodia.
 Nearly 2,000 political prisoners and POW's held by the SOC were released, half of
 them under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC). Indigenous human rights grups were formed and began human rights
 training. International organizations such as Amnesty International and Asia Watch
 were able to visit Cambodia, and more than half of the 370,000 Cambodian refugees
 living mostly along the Thai-Cambodian border were voluntarily repatriated under
 the direction of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)by year's end.
 Nevertheless, human rights abuses continued. Political parties setting up offices
 in Phnom Penh were subjected to harassment by the SOC security authorities. Po-
 litical killings of independent political paty members occurred in Cambodia and, in
 some cases, appear to be clearly attributable to SOC security forces. UNTAC uncov-
 ered a number of secret detention facilities, in which some political opponents of the
 SOC had been interrogated and beaten. The SOC authorities failed to investigate
 these abuses adequately and did not take corrective action. While UNTAC was ac-
 tive in investigating human rights complaints throughout 1992 independent politi-
 cal activity occurred against a background of fear and intimidation. In the areas
 controlled by the PDK in 1992, there was no freedom of speech, no due process, and
 no freedom of association.
 Particularly egregious in 1992 was the racial violence directed against the Viet-
 namese minority in Cambodia. Vietnamese were murdered, and political discourse,
 particularly that of the PDK and the KPNLF, continued to feature strong anti-Viet-
 namese rhetoric.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-ln 1992 the KPNLF (which founded
 a new political party called the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party), FUNCINPEC,
 Action for Democracy and Development, and the PDK all alleged that members of
 their parties were assassinated by SOC agents. The SOC accused the PDK of killing
 SOC provincial officials. On January 22, two men abducted Tea Bun Long, former
 director of religious affairs for SOC party leader Chea Sim's United Front in Phnom
 Penh. His body was discovered the next day, hands tied, with a bullet tbrough his
 head. Some alleged Tea Bun Long was assassinated because he criticized the SOC
 for corruption. SOC officials immediately condemned the murder and implied other
 political parties were responsible. The SOC investigation, however, reached no con-
 clusions. Ambiguity in this case is compounded b the fact that there are indications
 there may have been personal motives for the killing as well.
 The January 28 assassination attempt against ormer SOC Minister of Commu-
 nications, Transport and Posts UngPhan was more clearly political. In 1990 the
 SOC jailed him and six colleagues for planning to establish an independent political
 party. Freed in October 1991, Ung Pan continued his political activity. In inter-
 views January 17 and 20, he openly criticized the SOC for corruption and an-
 nounced he would launch his political party shortly. Gunmen shot him January 28
 in Phnom Penh, but he survived the attack. Prince Sihanouk condemned the crime
 and called on the SOC to investigate. The investigation reached no conclusions.
 On March 16, a blow to the head caused Yang Horn, a former political prisoner
 and close associate of Ung Phan, to fall into a coma. He died 4 days later. SOC offi-
 cials claimed the death resulted from a traffic accident, an unlikely explanation
 given the nature of the injury. Although the incident occurred on a crowded street,
 no eyewitnesses came forward. UINTAC, conducting its first investigation of an al-
 leged political killing, was unable to reach a definiti~ve conclusion.
 FUNCINPEC member and offices were targets of violent attacks. FUNCINPEC
 member Huy Cheang was shot in Thnat Thmey village, Kratie Province on April
 30 in what FUNCINPEC described as a political assassination. UNTAC investiga-
 tors recommended the dismissal of an sOC military security officer who may have
 been involved in the killing and who obstructed the UNTAC investigation. In No-
 vember and December, there were several attacks in which grenades were thrown
 at FUNCINPEC offices, particularly in Eattambang province, resulting in 12 inju-
 ries. UNTAC concluded that in at least one such case SOC authorities were prob-
 ably involved. On November 23, FUNCINPEC member Khoem Khon was shot and
 seriously injured at his home in Mesang district Prey Veng province. SOC inves-
 tigations had produced no information on the incident even though two SOC officials
 were accused of carrying out the attack.
 The KPNLF also alleged that SOC security forces killed several of its members.
 For example Duong Ngeap, a KPNLF organizer in Sihanoukville, was shot and
 killed after four men entered his house on August 19, took some money and gold,
 
 
 533
 and, after asking questions about his involvement in the KPNLF, shot him in the
 head in front ofhis family. The SOC investigation failed to produce a result. How-
 ever, UNTAC and independent investigators uncovered evidence showing SOC po-
 lice elements were involved in the killing. At year's end it had not been established
 who gave the order for the assassination.
 In other cases, KPNIF member Ath Sadorn and his mother-in-law were shot No-
 vember 2 in Prey Veng province after having been repeatedly threatened by SOC
 officials. Guards at the KPNLF office in Koh Kong were injured when shots were
 fired into the building on November 8. The KMNLY claims that over 20 of its mem-
 bers were killed in 1992 for political reasons.
 PDK members were targets of political violence as well. On August 1, SOC secu-
 rity officers shot and killed PDK commander Sam Ron in Kratie. The SOC officials
 claimed the death occurred as a result of a gunfigt and that its security officers
 fired in self-defense. While initial UNTAC investigations were inconclusive, there
 was evidence that Sam Bon was shot after having been taken into custody by SOC
 officials. UNTAC reopened the investigation.
 Before UNTAC's arrival, the SOC frequently claimed that the killings of low-level
 provincial SOC officials were directed by the PDK. After UNTAC's arrival in March,
 no such cases were referred to it for investigation. There were reports of killings
 inside PDK areas carried out by PDK soldiers. However, no investigations were pos-
 sible. While banditry and lawlessness resulted in numerous deaths, there were no
 accusations of political killings in the non-Communist zones near the border with
 Thailand.
 It is clear that political opponents of the SOC were assassinated, that the SOC
 did not fully and impartially investigate the killings, and that SOC security officials
 appear to be involved in some of the assassinations. During 1992 perhaps as many
 as 50 such political killings occurred, although solid evidence is available on fewer
 than 10 cases. Given the secrecy of SOC security organs and impediments to effec-
 tive investigation, the responsibility of the SOC for these acts of political violence
 cannot be determined. The United States has pressed senior SOC officials to take
 steps to deal with such violence and has urged UNTAC to strengthen further its
 police monitoring activities.
 b. Disappearance.--Only about 10 to 15 percent of SOC prisoners received any
 sort of due process. Many prisoners were held incommunicado, their families discov-
 ering their whereabouts only after they were released. There were, however, major
 improvements during the year.
 The Paris Accords call for the release of all political prisoners and POW's under
 the direction of the ICRC. The SOC commenced release of such prisoners without
 the ICRC's participation in October 1991. In early 1992, the ICRC was able to im-
 plement its mandate as releases continued. On March 29, Prince Sihanouk presided
 over the "final" release. The total number of prisoners released, both with and with-
 out ICRC direction, was approximately 2,000.
 Opposition parties claimed that some of their members were abducted by SOC se-
 curty forces during 1992. While the SOC denied these accusations, in August
 UNTAC discovered the Tesang Detention Center in Battambang Province, a facility
 under the control of the SOC Ministry of Defense. The previously undisclosed facil-
 ity contained six detainees with direct links to FUNCINPEC. There were no chaes
 pending and UNTAC ordered their release. In one case, UNTAC raided a facility
 directly adjacent to the SOC Ministry of National Security in Phnom Penh in which
 independent political party members had been beaten and interrogated. The SOC
 claimed the facilities were used to hold detainees for no longer than 2 days at a
 time. UNTAC doubts this and is still investigating.
 The SOC has alleged that 400 of its soldiers have disappeared since 1980. Many
 are believed to have been taken prisoner in the civil war b, the PDK army. It is
 widely believed that such prisoners were either "reeducated and convinced to join
 the PDK or executed.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Beginning in late 1991, the SOC granted the ICRC access to SOC prisons. Since
 mid-1992, UNTAC officers also have had access. These visits revealed that condi-
 tions in many SOC prisons included shackling of detainees, solitary confinement in
 darkened cells, unsanitary conditions, inadequate food, and limited or no health
 care. Detainees were held incommunicado for periods of up to 12 years.
 International aid workers report that some detainees, weakened by prison condi-
 tions, died from diseases such as cholera. These poor conditions resulted in part
 from a lack of resources but also from official indifference and neglect.
 Former detainees report that interrogations of political opponents of the SOC re-
 gime included beatings and, occasionally, torture with lit cigarettes.
 
 
 534
 SOC authorities cooperated with international efforts to improve prison condi-
 tions. At the urging of the ICRC and UNTAC, shackling of detainees was halted in
 June-July 1992. Moreover, U.N. oflicials organized feeding and medical programs in
 the last quarter of 1992, resulting in a general improvement in the health of detain.
 ees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detenio, or Ezile.-Before the intervention of UNTAC, due
 process did not exist in practice in Cambodia. The SOC did not charge 85 to 90 per-
 cent of those detained. Uniformed or undercover agents arrested people without
 warrants, and the SOC denied access to legal counsel and bail to those arrested,
 frequently holding them incommunicado. The security apparatus of the SOC ap-
 pears to operate with a high degree of independence. While there are provincial se-
 curity forces and separate security forces operated by the SOC Ministry of Defense,
 the main political security organs of the SOC are controlled by the Ministry of Na-
 tional Security, which the SOC split off frem the Ministry of Interior in February.
 According to interviews with security officials, Dirctrate Two,3 sometimes re.
 ferrd to as the "Second Bureau" in the      of National Security, has authority
 to arrest, detain, and release those suspt fpolitical offenses. Although UNTAC
 sought to gain control over the SOC political security apparatus, in 1992 these or.
 gans retained their shadowy autonomy.
 In non-Communist controlled areas, KPNLF or FUNCINPEC security forces car-
 ried out arrests with no judicial oversight. While ther are reports that some detain-
 ees were summarily executed, these cannot be confirmed. There are no allegations
 that non-Communist groups carried out arrests for political purposes in 1992. Little
 is known of PDK systems for arrest and detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-On October 28, UNTAC commenced implementa-
 tion of thorough judicial and penal reform in all of Cambodia where it was present.
 The reforms are embodied in 'proviionas relating to the judiciary and criminal law
 and procedures applicable in Cambodia during the transitional period," a document
 approved by the SNC on September 10. The provisions include basic legal proce-
 dures such as search warrants, speedy trial, appellate courts, and standards for
 treatment of detainees. UNTAC civil administrative personnel are responsible for
 supervising the system. UNTAC initiated 1-month training sessions for all judges
 and prosecutors.
 The fundamental problems confronting UNTAC in implementing these procedures
 are the lack of trained personnel and the prevalence of corruption in the security
 syste. Additionally, the stem cannot be applied to PDK-ontrlled areas until the
 D     rmits UNTAC to doso. While the UAC reforms may result in future im-
 provement, during most of 1992 the legal system was arbitrary and essentially dys-
 functional. The 1989 SOC Constitution recognizes the presumption of innocence and
 provides for the presence of a lawyer at every trial. However, only a small number
 of cases have ever come before courts. In general, security forces under the Ministry
 of National Security act without judicial oversight or control.
 Each province has its own court, with judges directly dependent on provincial ex-
 ecutive authorities for their positions. Few judges or prosecutors have any formal
 legal training, and pay is inadequate. In the small percentage of cases brought be-
 fore judges, trials are condcted largely to intimidate, to fix penalties, and to exact
 bribes from defendants. In practice, defendants have no access to legal defense. One
 international human rights group estimated there were less than one dozen profes-
 sionally educated legal practitioners in Cambodia. No legal system is known to exist
 in PDK areas.
 Prior to UNTAC's intervention, there was no formal judicial or civilian legal sys-
 tem in the areas controlled by the non-Communists. Summary justice was the rule.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy Family, or Correspondence.--Search war-
 rants have not existed in Cambodia under the SOC regime nor in the areas con-
 trolled by non-Communist or PDK forces. Arbitrary forced entry into homes and sei-
 zure of p~sessions, including documents, by police and other security forces is com-
 mon throughout Cambodia..,
 The SOC Ministry of National Security tmintains a network of hundreds and per-
 ha  thousands of unduercover  ents, many of whom have received some training
 in  ietamtheformer Soviet Union, or the former German Democratic Republic.
 These agents carry out surveillance of suspected opponents of the SOC, including
 members of independent political parties and some foreigners. SOC police also con-
 ducted house--house surveys in Pnsm Penh to ensure the upcoming elections
 would be "fair. Such surveys were conducted late at night at the homes and offices
 of some political parties as a means of intimidation. There was no evidence of sys-
 tematic surveillance of communications, such as telephones and mail, but there was
 evidence of sporadic opening of mail.
 
 
 535
 Over 370,000 Cambodian refugees resided in camps in Thailand at the beginning
 of 1992. The Paris Accords provide for the right of all Cambodian refugees and dis-
 placed persons located outside Cambodia "to return to Cambodia and to live in safe-
 ty, security and dignity free from intimidation or coercion of any kind." At the end
 of 1992, more than hafr of these Cambodian refugees had been able to return to
 Cambodia voluntarily and under UNHCR supervision. The UNHCR hopes to com-
 plete the process by April 1993.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flict.-The ceasefire among the contending factions held during 1992 in most of
 Cambodia. All four factions partially demobilized, the non-Communist factions and
 the SOC deing so under UNTAC supervision. Demobilization was suspended, how-
 ever, as the PDK refused to participate. Sporadic shelling of villages and towns, es-
 pecilly by the PDK and SO C armies1 occurred in northern Kompong Thorn, Preah
 and eastern Siem Reap Prvnces. The shelling caused civilian casualties,
 and tens of thousands of civilians fled their villages.
 More important for Cambodians is the persisfnt problem of mines. Hundreds of
 thousands of mines have been laid thrugout Cambodia, especially in the western
 p art of the ountry, over the past 12 years of civil war. All four factions and the
 Vietnamese have participated in this practice. The PDK and the SOC armies con-
 tinue to plant mines to deny road access and to defend positions. Thousands of Cam-
 bodian civilians were maimed in 1992 by mines. Although demining has begun, the
 problem of mines will plague Cambodians for years to come.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Prior to 1992, freedom of speech and press were
 severely restricted. However, the Paris Accords provide that "all persons in Cam-
 bodia and all Cambodian refugees and displaced persons shall enjoy the rights and
 freedoms embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other rel-
 evant international human rights instruments." On January 15, the SNC agreed
 that freedom of speech and press should be permitted throughout Cambodia. SNC
 members ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on April
 20, marking the first time the SNC exercised its sovereign powers on behalf of Cam-
 bodia in acceding to an international instrument.
 While impressive strides were made in 1992, the new Cambodian commitment to
 freedom of speech occurred against a historical background of repression and fear.
 As a result, the exercise of freedom of speech was often restricted through self-cen-
 sorship by individuals fearful of consequences which in the recent past could have
 been dire. SOC authorities, accustomed to strict control over freedom of speech,
 have only slowly given up old repressive reflexes. In many instances when unfamil-
 iar individuals or new groups sought to express themselves freely, the SOC adminis-
 tration erected bureaucratic barriers, which then had to be corrected by UNTAC.
 In 1991 all print and broadcast media inside Cambodia were owned and operated
 by the SOC. In January 1992, the KPNLF began publication of its Weekly Bulletin,
 which directly criticized the SOC regime and resented KPNLF points of view. It
 immediately became a sensation although its dstribution was limited by its 2,000
 copy run. Until mid-1992, the S6C Ministry of National Security secretly reviewed
 all publications at the limited number of printers in Phnom Penh. By the end of
 the year, this practice seemed to have stopped. The KPNLF weekly bulletin was fol-
 lowed by publications of other independent political parties, including FUNCINPEC
 and General Sak Sutsakhan's Liberal Democratic Party. In mid-July, two independ-
 ent English-language newspalers began publication. At the same time, a human
 rights association began issuing its own bulletin, and SOC-controlled publications
 such as the Khmer Iangae newspaper Pracheachon began to carry articles ex-
 pressing independent political views.
 While the SOC controlled the only radio station with coverage of most of the coun-
 try, radio stations with more limited ranges were operated by the PDK and by the
 non-Communists. The SOC operated the only Khmer television station. However, in
 mid-1992, UNTAC began running programs on radio and television providing infor-
 mation on the peace process and voting. UNTAC initiated its own broadcasts on a
 Phnom Penh-based facility in November featuring interviews with members of var-
 ious political parties. The French Government also initiated French language radio
 and television broadcasts in the Phnom Penh area.
 UNTAC lodged complaints about abuse of freedom of speech, particularly against
 the PDK and KPNLF whose bulletin often contained inflammatory articles inciting
 readers to hatred of Vietnamese who remain in Cambodia.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Following the January 15 SNC
 decision calling for freedom of speech and assembly, procedures were agreed by
 which private political, human rights, and social associations could apply to the
 
 
 536
 SNC to organize and hold large public meetings. Nevertheless, 1992 witnessed dis-
 agreement among the SNC, UNAC, and the SOC over freedom of association, with
 independent groups often awaiting approval from the SOC before venturing to orga-
 nize themselves.
 An extraordinary success for freedom of association was achieved by the KPNLF
 at its second congress held in Phnom Penh May 21-22. Despite petty intimidation
 by SOC security forces, including photographing of participants, threats against par-
 ticipation in the congress for civil servants, and efforts to disrupt transport to
 Phnom Penh for the meeting, over 5,000 people from all over Cambodia attended
 the peaceful gathering, with security provided by UNTAC civilian police. Despite
 this breakthrough SOC provincial officials continued to obstruct establishment of
 political parties offices and activities at least until agreements were reached at the
 September 10 SNC meeting to allow for such establishment.
 c. Freedom of Reli&gion.-Buddhism, Cambodia's dominant religion, was nearly
 wiped out during the years of PDK rule. Buddhist temples were destroyed, monks
 forcibly defrocked, and Buddhist rites widely banned. The Moslem population of
 Cambodia, the Chans, were singled out for particularly harsh treatment. A large
 percentage of the Chain population was killed by the PDK. Christianity, viewed as
 a corrupt foreign influence, was thoroughly suppressed. The SOC's United Front or-
 ganization has supported the development of the Buddhist monkhood as a means
 of mass mobilization.
 Since the Vietnamese invasion in 1978, religion has slowly revived, particularly
 in the past 2 years. A Buddhist renaissance has occurred. The number of monks
 has risen from only a few hundred during the 1980's to about 40,000 at the end
 of 1992. (It is estimated there were 60,000 monks in Cambodia during the early
 1970's.) Pagoda schools carry out religious indoctrination. There are s  the Bud-
 dhist monkhood is emerging as a center of political independence.aFor example,
 monks are increasingly advocating human rights. Although the 1989 SOC Constitu-
 tion identifies Buddhism as the state religion, there is currently a high degree of
 religious tolerance in non-PDK controlled Cambodia. The Chamis have a powerful
 supporter in Deputy Chairman of the SOC National Assembly Mat Ly. Christianity
 was ruled "legal" in a statement by SOC party chief Chea Sim in April 1990, and
 there has been no systematic hindrance to Christian church services since mid-1991.
 Since late 1991, overseas Khmer Christian ministers have returned to Cambodia.
 Importation of Bibles was generally restricted until early 1992. However, since
 June, Bibles have been imported freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the County, Foreign Travel, and Repatriation.-
 In general Cambodians are free to travel through the areas controlled by the SOC.
 Nevertheless, in at least one notable case, K L  Secretary General leng Mouly
 was stopped by armed SOC officials while traveling outside Phnom Penh. There is
 no systematic control on movement within the zones ontrolled by the non-Com-
 munists. However, mines and bandits make travel in some areas perilous. Move-
 ment from the non-Communist zones to SOC-ontrlled zones is progressively open-
 ing up especially since reconstruction of Route 69 between Sisophon and Thmar
 Puok. Regarding the PDK-controlled areas, credible reports indicate that movement
 even to neighboring villages requires permission from village and military authori-
 ties as to the place and duration of travel, with checkpoints established between set-
 tlements.
 Until September 1992, the SOC authorities imposed strict controls on passports
 for foreign travel. Corruption made passports unaffordable for most Cambodians.
 The Mimstry of National Security would sometimes withhold exit visas for political
 reasons. Moreover, Cambodians who overstayed exit visas outside Cambodia could
 be subject to questioning.
 UNTAC is thoroughly leralizing the passport and visa systems of Cambodia. As
 of September, the SOC, under  UNTAC pressure, eliminated the requirement for exit
 visas. In addition, UNTAC is developing a UNTAC/SNC stamp which can be affixed
 to travel documents produced by any of the factions and which will make all such
 documents equally valid fortravel inside and outside Cambodia. Finally, UNTAC
 is working to eliminate corruption in passport issuance at the SOC Ministry of For-
 eign Affairs, a step which should help eliminate the financial barrier to obtaming
 travel documents.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Cambodians have not enjoyed this right in two decades and still did not in 1992.
 The Paris Accords represent an international effort to assist in restoring this right
 to the Cambodians. The Accords call for the United Nations to conduct free and fair
 elections in a neutral political environment for a constituent assembly which is to
 
 
 537
 approve a constitution, transform itself into a legislative assembly, and thereafter
 create a new government.
 In April or May 1993, Cambodians are to choose 120 members of a constituent
 assembly. The election is to be held throughout Cambodia on a provincial basis with
 proportional representation drawn from lists put forward by parties. According to
 the electoral law adopted by the SNC, UNTAC is to register all eligible voters. Polit-
 ical parties need to obtain at least 5,000 signatures of registered voters to be listed
 on the ballot. It remains to be seen if sufficient cooperation from all parties will be
 forthcoming to permit this plan to be implemented.
 Throughout 1992, Cambodian sovereignty was vested in the SNC, a 12-man body
 which includes representatives of all four factions, with Prince Norodom Sihanouk
 as its president. By the accords, the SNC delegates to UNTAC "all powers necessary
 to ensure implementation of the agreement. This means that aa       istrative
 agencies, bodies, and offices acting in the field of foreign affairs, national defense,
 mance, public security, and information will be placd under the direct control of
 UNTAC, which will exercise it as necessary to ensure strict neutrality." UNTAC has
 the authority to issue binding directives on the existing administrations, install
 U.N. personnel, and remove Cambodian officials when they are found to be obstruct-
 ing the implementation of the Accords.
 About one tenth of Cambodia's population lives in zones controlled by the admin-
 istration of the PDK. Nominally headed by President Khieu Samphan, the PDK is
 directed by a small group, including Pol Pot, Ieng Sary, Nuon Chea, Ta Mok, and
 Son Sen. While the rigidity of PDK control varies in different areas, Cambodians
 living under PDK control have no ability to take part in their own government.
 While the SOC and the non-Communists have cooperated with UNTAC in the im-
 plementation of the accords, the PDK did not cooperate fully and, in particular, re-
 fused to permit UNTAC access to its territory to carry out UNTAC's administrative
 functions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In 1992 indigenous human rights organizations were established, the first in dec-
 ades. On January 16, former SOC political prisoners Thun Saray and Khay Matoury
 announced formation of the Association for Human Rights in Cambodia (known by
 its French acronym "ADHOC"). Independent Cambodians launched three more
 human rights organizations over the course of 1992. All of the groups were highly
 successful in gaining membership and began conducting human rights training sem-
 inars and accepting and investigating human rights complaints from Cambodians.
 While the formation of these associations was a significant step forward, there
 were signs of opposition from the SOC administration. Thun Saray and Khay
 Matoury reported that they were subject to surveillance and were threatened be-
 cause of their activities. Efforts to establish provincial offices of human rights orga-
 nizations have been hampered by intimidation by SOC authorities. In one case, a
 human rights monitor was detained for 2 days by provincial authorities and freed
 only when UNTAC intervened. On December 10, about 100 SOC soldiers forcibly en-
 tered the ADHOC offices in Svay Rieng, where the group was celebrating Human
 Rights Day. ADHOC members were intimidated by the soldiers, and some ADHOC
 materials were confiscated. The effectiveness of indigenous human rights organiza-
 tions was limited by funding problems and their early stage of development.
 ADHOC, the Cambodian League for the Promotion of Human Rights, and other
 human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) find they must dedicate much
 of their time to training their own members in what human rights are and how
 human rights monitoring should be conducted.
 UNTAC's human rights, civil police, and civil administration branches were able
 to establish resident offices in all of Cambodia's 21 provinces and gain access to
 SOC administrative bodies.
 Until December 1991, no international human rights organization had been per-
 mitted to carry out investigations within SOC-controlled areas. However, an Am-
 nesty International team visited SOC-controlled areas from December 8 to Decem-
 ber 28, 1991, and an Asia watch team visited in April and May, 1992. The ICRC
 has worked freely in SOC and non-Communist Cambodian zones throughout 1992.
 Unfortunately, this new openness did not apply to PDKcontrolled zones. The PDK
 permitted only very limited visits to its areas by journalists and certain U.N. organi-
 zations, notably the UNHCR. Foreign diplomats had strictly controlled access to
 PDK zones in connection with visits by Prince Sihanouk.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4on, Language, or Social Status
 The SNC ratified key human rights instruments in 1992. Moreover, the 1989 SOC
 Constitution contains provisions to protect the rights of minority groups and women.
 However, with no effective means of implementing the previsions of these instru-
 ments, the most vulnerable elements of Cambdin society are often victims of dis-
 crimination.
 Vietnamese and Chinese have long been the largest ethnic minorities in Cam-
 bodia. Vietnamese were subject to bloody pogroms in the early 1970's and under the
 PDK. Ethnic Chinese have generally been more tolerated, although they, too, re-
 ceived particularly severe treatment under the PDK, in part because of their rel-
 ative prosperity. Popular sentiment against Vietnamese is strong throughout Cam.
 bodia. The Paris Accords call for the verified withdrawal of all foreign forces. The
 PDK has often interpreted this to mean that all Vietnamese inhabitants perhaps
 several hundred thousand people, must depart. The PDK and the KPNLF in par-
 ticular argued that if these provisions were not enforced, Cambodia would be ab-
 sorbed into an expanding Vietnam.
 On July 21, a brutal massacre of two Vietnamese families, including women and
 children, was carried out in the village of Tuk Meas in Kampot Province. Two subse-
 quent incidents-both linked to the PDK-resulted in a total of 19 more people
 killed, apparently just because of their Vietnamese origins. A UNTAC investigation
 produced circumstantial evidence that PDK units were responsible. Given strong
 public animosity toward Vietnamese and the political interests some groups may
 perceive in exploiting these hatreds, there is considerable threat of more extensive
 violence against Vietnamese. UNTAC efforts to curb the rhetoric of the PDK and
 the KPNLF have achieved little success. Anti-Vietnamese sentiment has not stopped
 Vietnamese from occupying many of the most lucrative manual and semi-skilled
 labor jobs in Phnom Pnh. However, in confrontations between Cambodians and Vi-
 etnamese, the former frequently have attacked the Vietnamese with little fear of
 prosecution or other official sanctions.
 The 1989 SOC Constitution and the 1989 SOC Law on the Family and Marriage
 contain provisions designed to protect women's rights, including a guarantee of
 equality before the law, provisions against forced marriage, and regulations on di-
 vorce. However, there are no effective means of implementing these regulations and,
 according to international aid workers who focus on the condition of women, vio-
 lence against women, including domestic violence and rape, is common. There are,
 however, no reliable studies available which could specify the extent of this abuse.
 There does not appear to be systematic discrimination against women in such high-
 prestige jobs as medicine and the civil service. The Cambodian Women's Association,
 formed as part of Chea Sim's United Front, has become increasingly independent,
 in particular at the provincial level. Khemara, an indigenous NGO, was active in
 1992 in promoting the interests of women and children.
 The handicapped constitute a substantial and vulnerable minority. Asia Watch re-
 ports that one in 236 Cambodians has lost at least one limb to mines, the highest
 percentage of amputees in the world. This group includes both adults and children.
 Programs administered by various NGO's have brought about dramatic improve-
 ments in treatment and rehabilitation of amputees. However, the SOC Ministry of
 Labor and Social Welfare which is responsible for assistance to the handicapped,
 is plagued by corruption. international NGOs report that high officials in the min-
 istry regularly extort from the handicapped assistance provided them by the inter-
 national community.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The SOC passed a Labor Law in early August. No
 such law existed previously. SOC labor officials stated that the law reflects consulta-
 tions with the International Labor Organization and international labor law experts
 and is similar to labor laws in market economy countries. There is a wide gap be-
 tween the provisions of the Labor Law, however, and the reality of labor conditions
 in Cambodia today, as the new law has yet to be implemented effectively. This is
 not surprising given the newness of the law and that Cambodia is passing through
 a political and economic transition period in which institutions to implement and
 enforce new laws are not being created and in which existing SOC administrative
 institutions are slowly breaking down due to a lack of leadership and an inadequate
 civil service.
 The new Labor Law states that workers have the right to form unions of their
 own choosing without previous authorization. However, the SOC Minister of Labor
 and Social Welfare has not yet promulgated detailed regulations regarding voting
 processes, candidate qualifications, and the types of enterprises where these proce-
 dures must be followed. No other unions currently exist apart from those in the
 
 
 539
 SOC-controlled union federation, and thee are no reports that workers have at-
 tempted to form other unions. The law does not require that unions join a single
 trade union structure and contains no provisions regarding whether a union may
 particiate in  litical activity.
 The Labor Law does not guarantee the right to strike. It requires that the SOC
 mediate disputes between employers and workers. Nevertheless, some workers take
 action when their interests are threatened. For example, in 1992 workers in some
 state-owned enterprises protested and prevented corrupt officials from selling state
 assets to private investors which would have caused them to lose their jobs.
 The law permits unions to join federations, but does not address whether they
 may be affiliated with international bodies. The Kampuchean Federation of Trade
 Unions is a member of the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade
 Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Coliectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected under the Labor Law, though any agreement reached between workers and
 employers must be approved by the SOC. However, collective bargaining does not
 currently exist in practice. Civil servant wages are set by the SOC authorities. Wage
 rates in other sectors are largely set by the market. Nevertheless, after complaints
 from workers in some previously state-owned factories that their salaries were being
 reduced, SOC officials intervened and required that private sector factory owners
 pay wages of $35 per month in the case of factories that are operating and $20 in
 the case of factories that have ceased operations. The Labor Law prohibits antiunion
 discrimination by employers against union members and organizers, and there are
 mechanisms for resolving discrimination complaints.
 No export processing zones exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The new Labor Law prohibits
 forced or compulsory labor. Adequate labor inspection to enforce the law does not
 exist. The Labor Law contains penal sanctions for offenders. There are no reports
 that domestic or foreign workers are being forced to remain in situations amounting
 to coerced labor. Prisons in SOC-controlled areas have been inspected by UNTAC
 and international human rights groups, and there are no reports of prison labor.
 There are widespread reports that the PDK compels people under its control to
 serve as porters for military and other supplies.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The new SOC Labor Law states
 that the minimum age for employment is 16, except for persons under age 16 work-
 ing in an enterprise in which all workers are members of a family and under the
 supervision of a father, mother, or guardian. Although penalties exist for violators
 of these provisions, the legislation is not effectively enforced by inspectors. Out of
 economic necessity, persons under the age of 16 years engage in a variety of jobs.
 These include street trading, construction, and small-scale manufacturing.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The new Labor Law does not provide for a na-
 tionwide minimum wage. However, it does require that every laborer must receive
 a minimum wage that assures a decent living standard. The wage can vary accord-
 ing to regions, and the Minister of Labor and Social Welfare is to set wages after
 discussions with a consultative committee on labor made up of labor, employer, and
 SOC representatives. The Minister of Labor and Social Welfare has not yet set any
 minimum wage rates, and this legislation is not effectively enforced. Currently, mar-
 ket-determined wage rates at lower levels are not sufficient to provide a decent liv-
 ing for a worker and family.
 The new Labor Law provides for a standard legal work week of 48 hours and a
 24-hour rest period. The law allows for hours in excess of the standard in the case
 of urgent, unusual work. In such cases, the law requires overtime payment at a rate
 set by the Minister of Labor and Social Welfare. These standards are not effectively
 enforced. Workers commonly work more than 48 hours per week and 8 hours per
 day. The new law states that the workplace should have health and safety stand-
 ards necessary to ensure the workers' well-being. The Minister of Labor and Social
 Welfare is to set specific standards, but has not yet done so. The law requires SOC
 labor inspectors to take action to ensure that standards are met, and if the employer
 does not comply, to shut down operations. However, these standards are not effec-
 tively enforced. Penalties are specified in the law, but there are no provisions to pro-
 tect workers who complain about unsafe or unhealthful conditions. Conditions in
 factories and small-scale industries are generally poor. Ventilation and lighting are
 inadequate, sanitation facilities are poor, and noise levels are significantly above
 international standards.
