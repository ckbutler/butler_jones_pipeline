 GABON
 Although President Omar Bongo has ruled Gabon since 1967,
 having been reelected three times in uncontested elections.
 Internal pre-ssures'beginning in late 1989-forced-him to
 acquiesce in extensive political reforms. In 1991 a new
 Constitution was promulgated which includes'provisions for such
 basic freedoms as movement, association, and religion and
 explicitly abolishes the old system of single party rule. The
 new multiparty legislature, which resulted from elections held
 during the last months of 1990, grappled with the many legal
 ramifications of the new order, including complex legislative
 initiatives on public sector employment and newly created
 constitutional'bodies. In the past, the National Assembly had
 no real pbwer, and it is still dominated by the former sole
 party, the Democratic Party of Gabon (PDG), which holds a
 narrow majority. However, the newly elected Assembly includes
 deputies from nine political parties and has been able to
 confront and criticize the Government oui some issues,.'e.g., in
 forcing extensive changes in spending priorities! The new
 Constitution limits President Bongo to one more 5-year term.
 The armed forces comprise approximately 4,000 army, navy, and
 air force personnel. Responsibility for internal security is
 shared by the gendarmerie, a paramilitary force of 2,700, and
 the national police, consisting of-.2,000 troops; the police
 work with the gendarmerie to maintain law and order in
 Libreville, Port Gentil, and other provincial capitals. The
 security forces use beatings as part of the interrogation
 process.
 Gabon's relatively high per capita income ($4,165 in 1991) is
 based largely on oil revenues, but it belies the underdeveloped
 nature of the country and its economy. Although endowed with
 petroleum, manganese; uranium, and vast timber resources, Gabon
 has experienced limited agricultural and industrial development
 and imports most of its food and manufactured goods. Rain
 forests cover 85 percent of the country, and approximately
 two-thirds of-the populace live in rural areas. Due to the
 precipitous fall in revenue from oil exports in the late
 1980's, the Government.has-imposed austerity measures to-meet
 World Bank and International Monetary Fund program criteria.
 Gabon took important steps toward a more open political system
 in 1991. With the'move toward a multiparty political system,
 restrictions on freedoms of speech,'press, and assembly were
 considerably relaxed.' Although the opposition has limited
 access to government media,.especially.radio and television,
 there is a lively opposition press, consisting of a half-dozen
 weekly newspapers which are often highly critical of the
 Government. The government-controlled newspaper, L'Union,
 generally avoids direct criticism of the Government and the
 President. Despite significant progress, some human rights
 problems remain with regard to the mistreatment of prisoners
 and detainees, including the handling of illegal aliens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political killings or summary executions in
 1991.
 
 
 134
 GABON
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of abductions or disappearances
 ascribed to government security forces or any other group.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Gabonese law and security enforcement officials use beatings
 and torture as part of the interrogation process of detainees
 to gain confessions. Prisoners are reportedly forced to march
 on their knees over stones; in addition, lawyers who have
 visited prisons report hearing cries of those who are being
 beaten. Prison conditions are harsh, and the main facility,
 Central Prison, has insufficient food, inadequate medical
 facilities, and poor sanitation. As a result, sickness is
 common, and prisoners have died because they had no one to
 bring them needed medicine. Violence among prisoners--in
 particular, homosexual rape-is also a problem.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although the law, based on French iurisprudence, provides
 procedural protections against arbitrary detention, it allows
 for pretrial detention for a prolonged period. Security forces
 disregard the procedures concerning arbitrary detention,
 particularly in security cases, by detaining persons
 indefinitely without charge. There is no way of accurately
 determining the number of arbitrary detentions during the year,
 but it is thought to be as many as several dozen. However, no
 political detainees were being held at the end of 1991.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control nor as a
 sentence for convicted criminals. A number of opposition
 figures such as Pere Mba Abessole, leader of the Bucheron
 Party, have returned in recent years. The only remainihg
 well-known "exile" is Pierre Mamboundou, who was convicted. in
 absentia for involvement in one of the coup plots uncovered in
 late 1989 by Gabonese security forces. He resides in Senegal.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system, modeled on that of the French, has several
 levels. The trial court (Tribunal de Premier Instance) hears
 questions of fact and law in civil, commercial, ordinary
 criminal, and administrative cases. The appellate level is
 divided into two courts, with a separate appeals court for
 criminal cases. The highest level, the Supreme Court, has
 three chambers, and the former fourth chamber, the
 Constitutional Chamber, was recast as an independent body by
 the 1991 Constitution. Outside the normal court system, there
 is a military tribunal to handle all offenses under military
 law; a State Security Court, which is a civilian tribunal; and
 a special criminal court which deals with fraud and
 embezzlement of public funds by officials.
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for in the
 Constitution and generally has been respected in criminal
 cases, but procedural safeguards are lacking in State Security
 Court trials. In this Court, trials are open to the public,
 and defendants are represented by counsel, but appeal
 procedures to the Supreme Court are restricted to raising
 points of law. The State Security Court is a nonpermanent
 body, called into existence as the Government determines to
 hear political and security cases. 'It was last convoked in
 
 
 135
 GABON
 1990 to hear the coup plot cases of 1989/1990. Subsequently,
 in response to clemency appeals, President Bongo twice reduced
 the sentences of those convicted in those trials, but none had
 'been released by year's end.
 Although the judiciary is susceptible to intervention by the
 executive, particularly in political or security cases, there
 was no indication that such intervention occurred in 1991.
 Reports persist that there were still some political prisoners
 held at the end of 1991, but these have not been confirmed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search-warrants may be obtained after the fact but, as
 occasionally happens in cases of suspected illegal aliens,
 sometimes they are not obtained at all. There were credible
 reports that in many cases the homes of those detained were
 ransacked by security forces who confiscated personal effects.
 The Government periodically monitors communications. -While the
 former ruling party does not compel party membership, there
 have been reports of government officials being fired or
 transferred for membership in oppositionparties.
 Section 2 Respect .for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With the move toward a multiparty system, most restrictions on
 freedom of speech and press have been eliminated. While direct
 public criticism of the President previously had not been
 permitted, during the legislative election campaign and in
 subsequent political debates, Gabonese opposition leaders
 criticized the President directly and indirectly, with no
 retribution. However, opposition leaders also complained that
 the state-controlled media did not provide adequate access to
 opposition parties.
 A half-dozen weekly newspapers, including the government-owned
 L'Union and a range of nongovernment papers, continue to
 circulate in the capital. The-President has encouraged
 journalists to point out failures of individual government
 officials or ministries and to highlight inefficiency and
 corruption. In 1991 such criticism continued and grew bolder,
 with leading opposition papers publishing extensive allegations
 of financial malfeasance by the President and his inner
 circle. As a result of a decision by Multipress, the publisher
 of L' Union and owner of the country's only high-speed rotary
 press, to demand advance payment, several papers have been
 obliged to print in Cameroon. More financially solvent
 opposition papers are printed at Multipress without any
 restrictions. All newspapers- circulate freely within Gabon.
 The established media carry wire service material (mostly
 Agence France Presse) which .gives the public some coverage of
 world events. There were no instances in 1991 when foreign
 publications were banned.
 Academic freedom is relatively unrestricted. A professors'
 strike over university mismanagement, lack of funds for
 research, and the deteriorating physical plant at the
 university campus in Libreville brought the 1990/91 academic
 year to a premature halt and contributed to the fall of the
 second Oye-Mba Government; security forces took no action
 against the strikers.

 GABON
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government grants the rights of freedom of assembly and
 association to recognized organizations, including 74
 recognized opposition political associations. Permits and'
 notification of police are required for all outdoor meetings.
 The Government generally permits such meetings if they are
 organized by recognized political groups or their ancillary
 units, such as the women's, youth, and labor movements;
 cultural and entertainment impresarios; or recognized church
 groups. By law, unauthorized demonstrations are not permitted,
 but there were numerous unauthorized demonstrations in 1991 for
 which organizers and participants went unpunished, including a
 major May Day rally staged by the Rassemblement National des
 Bucherons (generally referred to as the Bucherons party) in
 defiance of an explicit government ban.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion, and the Constitution provides for
 religious freedom. Because their activities were considered by
 the Government to foster disunity, Jehovah's Witnesses and
 several small syncretistic sects were banned by presidential
 decree in 1970. The decree was renewed in 1985. As recently
 as 1987, the courts sentenced 24 Jehovah's Witnesses to short
 or suspended terms for belonging to a banned organization. The
 primary faiths are Catholic and Protestant. Muslims (including
 President Bongo) constitute less than 5 percent of the
 population. There are significant numbers of adherents to
 traditional religions. Foreign missionaries engage actively in
 evangelical and social service activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement of both Gabonese citizens and expatriates within the
 country is not formally restricted; travelers occasionally
 encounter gendarmerie control points where identity cards and
 other documents are examined. Gabonese citizens may return
 freely from abroad. The previous requirement for Gabonese
 citizens to obtain exit permits from the police was rescinded
 in June, but government employees must still obtain permission
 to travel abroad.
 There are approximately 200,000 non-Gabonese residents in
 Gabon, many of whom are from Equatorial Guinea or Cameroon.
 Immigration laws and presidential decrees promulgated in 1986
 imposed requirements for heavy financial guarantees on
 non-French and non-American expatriates working in Gabon and
 levied exit visa fees for each departure from the country. The
 gendarmerie periodically detain undocumented aliens who are
 then placed in a holding camp under harsh conditions. Most of
 the detainees are released after paying fines or bribes. An
 increasing number of illegal immigrants are being deported to
 demonstrate the Government's commitment to preserving
 employment preferences for Gabonese.
 The Government encourages, but does not force, "regroupment"
 (voluntary consolidation of small rural communities into larger
 villages along a road) by improving the delivery of public
 services such as water, electricity, and schooling in the
 larger villages.
 
 
 GABON
 Section 3 Respect for Political.Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The 1991 Constitution, promulgated in March following extensive
 National Assembly debate, provides formal guarantees of this
 right, including the right to organize and campaign in the
 political arena. There are now a wide range of parties and a
 functioning multiparty National Assembly.
 Nonetheless; the former single party, the-Democratic Party of
 Gabon (PDG),-remains the principal political party in Gabon,
 and it still dominates the Government. Its leading role is due
 to its established strength in organization and infrastructure,
 to its.-close ties with the President, formerly the Secretary
 General .of the PDG, and to the splintering.and inexperience of
 the opposition. There have been continuing opposition charges
 of ballot rigging by the Government or PDG,-but the 1990
 irregularities appeared in part to have been tied to the
 disorganized election process. In the end, the PDG managed to
 retain a narrow majority in the final makeup of the National
 Assembly,. with 59 of the 120 seats going to PDG members and 3
 to PDG sympathizers. The remaining 58-seats are distributed
 among eight opposition parties.
 President-Bongo has been reelected three times to 7-year terms
 in uncontested elections, most recentlyin 1986. The new
 Constitution provides. for a limit of two 5-year presidential
 terms. The National.Conference of 1990 determined.that for the
 purpose of the new Constitution, the President.s-current term.
 would be considered his first; thus, he is eligible to stand in
 1993 fpr a final term and is widely expected to do so. In
 sharp contrast to the past, however, several candidates have
 indicated they plan to run against President Bongo.
 Under Gabon's nascent parliamentary system, the President's
 Prime Minister is head of government and must be confirmed by
 the National Assembly. Since the National Conference, there
 have been three governments,.each under the Prime Ministership
 of Casimir Oye-Mba, but with different ministerial rosters.
 The changes occurred when Mr. Oye-Mba submitted his
 Government's resignation in response to public pressure;--in the
 first instance, the completion of the legislative elections
 required that the -new Government reflect the power balance
 resulting from the controversial first round of elections. In
 - the second, a boycott of the legislature by much of the
 opposition and festering problems in the educational sector
 forced the.Government to seek a fresh start.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of- Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A number of local human rights groups, including an affiliate
 of Amnesty International, operate freely in the country. While
 their actions have been limited by inexperience-and poor
 organization, they have influenced government policy, most
 notably in the case of a Moroccan dissident writer expelled by
 France to Gabon. Local rights groups published communiques in
 the government-controlled press and held a series of meetings
 with President Bongo to urge him.to ensure the Moroccan's
 personal security and allow him full liberty of movement.
 Since June the Minister of Scientific Research has been charged
 with human rights and relations with the legislature. The
 Government has not impeded investigation by international human
 
 
 138
 GABON
 rights groups or blocked the activities of human rights
 observers.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The 1991 Constitution forbids discrimination based on national
 origin, race, gender, or opinion. Gabon's relative prosperity
 has enabled the Government to extend health and social security
 benefits to all its people, regardless of tribal affiliation or
 region. There were no significant ethnic, racial, religious,
 or social groups that suffered discrimination in 1991.
 In practice, women do face discrimination. However, government
 and party policies are supportive of expanding opportunities
 for women, and urban women in particular are moving
 increasingly into the professions, taking advantage of improved
 educational opportunities, including access to technical
 training institutions. At the primary school level, there is
 universal access for both girls and boys. However, at the
 secondary level, only 22 percent of females, as opposed to 31
 percent of males, are enrolled in school.
 In rural Gabon, women still fill largely traditional roles
 built around family and village, e.g., hauling water, tending
 fields. The gradual introduction of piped-in water and of
 electricity has had the effect of gradually improving living
 standards for rural women. Legal rights of rural women are
 largely governed by tribal tradition, while in the urban
 sector, women's rights are patterned on French law. While all
 women's rights are protected by the law, traditional practice,
 which prevails in rural areas, assigns most of the hard work-
 tending fields, preparing meals, child care--to women while
 depriving them of formal authority in the village context.
 According to medical practitioners, violence against women,
 including wife beating, occurs, but the extent of the problem
 is not known. Incidents of violence against women are reported
 in the media from time to time and invariably are the outgrowth
 of domestic disputes or 4re related to violence against
 prostitutes. Cases of violence against women rarely come
 before the courts. In the absence of statistics on the number
 of incidents versus the number of court cases, this observation
 is based on the relative weight given cases of violence against
 women in news accounts. Such reports uniformly treat these
 incidents as contemptible vestiges of a brutal past. Several
 women's rights groups and professional associations have been
 formed to address these concerns.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the new Constitution, the former monopoly of the
 government-sponsored Labor Confederation of Gabon (COSYGA) has
 been abolished. A new labor code, which would repeal the trade
 union solidarity tax and other legislative restrictions on
 trade union pluralism, is in the drafting stage but had not
 been presented to the National Assembly by year's end.
 In 1991 the trend continued toward freely formed, primarily
 company-based (as opposed to industrywide) unions, which have
 staged wildcat strikes aimed at forcing management to address
 concerns of pay, benefits, and working conditions.
 
 
 139
 GABON
 A strike at the government-run printing press crippled the
 print media for 2 weeks, during which none of Gabon's
 newspapers appeared on the stands. By the same token, strikes
 by public health workers'and primary and secondary school
 teachers forced the Government to make significant concessions
 on construction of new facilities. In the private sector,
 wildcat strikes by workers in state-run and other companies
 have resulted in pay raises, benefit improvements, and, in some
 cases, replacement of unpopular managers.
 Under Gabonese law, strikes are illegal if they occur before
 compulsory arbitration remedies prescribed under the .1978 Labor
 Code have been exhausted, but the Government informed the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Conference in June that
 a draft law on the right to strike has been examined by the
 Government and could be incorporated in the revised labor
 code. None of the strikers in the cited cases was the object
 of arrest or other disciplinary action. COSYGA, whose future
 role in Gabonese labor/management relations is unclear at
 present, has represented Gabonese workers at the ILO and has
 maintained limited contacts with a variety of national trade
 centers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Formally, unions in each sector negotiate with management over
 specific pay scales, working conditions, and benefits
 applicable to their industry. 'Agreements reached between labor
 and management in each sector also apply to nonunion and
 expatriate labor. According to the Labor Code, workers may
 individually or collectively take complaints of code violations
 to arbitration and may appeal to labor and national courts.
 Among the changes in the labor law urged by the ILO is a
 provision protecting workers against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones in Gabon.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law and is not practiced,
 although technical violations of the conventions on forced
 labor have been criticized by the ILO.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 No one below the age of 16 may work without the authorization
 of the Ministries of Labor, Public Health, and Education, which
 rigorously enforce this provision. Such permission is granted
 rarely, and few employees in the modern wage sector are below
 the age of 18. Children at younger ages are involved in
 traditional family farm labor in rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The 1978 Labor Code and the 1982 General Convention of Labor
 govern working conditions and benefits for all sectors. Labor
 legislation provides broad protection to workers.
 Representatives.of labor, management, and government meet
 annually to-agree on minimum wage rates, which are determined
 within guidelines provided by the Government. The Gabonese
 minimum wage is determined annually pursuant to Articles 94 and
 95 of the Labor Code of 1978. These articles designate an
 interagency group to study the status of the economy and
 recommend a minimum wage for the coming year to the President.
 The President then issues a decree, pursuant to Article 88 of
 the Code, setting the minimum wage. The current minimum wae
 
 
 140
 GABON
 for unskilled labor is sufficient to provide a decent living
 for workers and their families. Work over 40 hours per week
 must be compensated with overtime, and the workweek must
 include a minimum rest period of 48 consecutive hours.
 The Labor Code provides for occupational health and safety
 standards to be established by decree of the Minister of
 Health. Adherence to these standards, which are generally
 adapted from the French model, varies greatly and usually
 reflects company policy rather than governmental enforcement
 efforts. Article 134 of the Labor Code assigns enforcement of
 its health and safety provisions to the Office of the Inspector
 of Labor (Inspecteur du Travail) of the Ministry of Labor.
