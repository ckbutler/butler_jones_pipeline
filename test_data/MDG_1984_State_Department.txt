 MADAGASCAR
 Madagascar is governed by a President and National Popular
 Assembly elected by direct universal suffrage, and a Supreme
 Revolutionary Council chosen by both the President and
 National Assembly. Elections are actively contested within
 the controlled political framework sanctioned by the
 Government. This framework permits political activity by the
 seven parties making up the National Front for the Defense of
 the Revolution. Although all these parties theoretically
 share a commitment to a 'socialist' state, they have
 established positions ranging from a relatively moderate,
 pro-Western stance, to support for pro-Soviet interests. They
 also compete against each other in local, regional, and
 national elections.
 President Didier Ratsiraka was reelected in 1982 to a second
 seven-year term. He has broad constitutional powers, and his
 position is further strengthened by the influential role
 played by his political party, Arema, which holds an
 overwhelming majority in the National Assembly and which has a
 broad base of popular support. Also contributing to the
 President's power are his close ties to the state security
 apparatus. In his last election, the President won by a
 70-percent majority but lost the vote of some important
 regional and urban centers. The President's role has evolved
 in recent years toward one of a power broker among various
 competing interests. He must contend with opposition not only
 from other parties in the Front but also, behind the scenes,
 from elements within the Supreme Revolutionary Council and his
 own party.
 The Supreme Revolutionary Council is an advisory group broadly
 representative of Madagascar's regional and social structure.
 The leaders of all seven parties sit on the Council. The
 Council approves basic policy guidelines, convenes and
 adjourns the National Assembly, and passes laws when the
 Assembly is not sitting. Its members have broad patronage
 power through their control of scholarships and influence on
 government assignments.
 Madagascar's legislative branch, the National Popular
 Assembly, was last elected to a five-year term in 1983. Four
 parties won seats, with the President's party, Arema, claiming
 117 of 137 deputies. Arema did lose some major districts,
 including two by-elections in districts whose original vote
 results were invalidated by the High Constitutional Court. In
 1984 the new Assembly has carried on vigorous debate over
 government policy and critically questioned ministers on
 government programs.
 The Malagasy Constitution adopted in 1975 has made "socialism'
 the state's political philosophy. This led to nationalization
 of a major portion of the economy, although the private sector
 still plays an important role. Currently, the country's
 economy is in serious straits, with declining production in
 all sectors, burgeoning foreign debt, and rising
 unemployment. The problem has been further exacerbated by
 weak markets for export commodities, an inability to finance
 imports necessary for industrial production, and by the
 Government's over-involvement in the marketing mechanisms,
 especially in the agricultural sector. The Government has
 made efforts at economic liberalization and reform in return
 for assistance from the World Bank and the International
 Monetary Fund.

 MADAGAS CAR
 Fundamental liberties and individual rights are guaranteed by
 the Malagasy Constitution. However, several of these rights,
 including particularly civil rights such as freedom of the
 press and freedom of assembly, are restricted in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Since independence there has been only one political
 assassination. During 1984 there have not been any reports of
 unnecessary force or of other actions by the security forces
 which resulted in loss of life.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1984, there were no reported cases of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In 1983, there were allegations of brutality being used by the
 state security forces in their interrogation of persons
 arrested. These allegations were addressed by a court during
 the trial of alleged coup-plotters. In 1984, there have been
 no major state security trials nor any reports of state
 security forces using brutal methods of interrogation. Prison
 conditions are reported to be poor. Overcrowding and
 inadequate sanitation, health care, and diet are all problems
 in the prisons, and reflect the generally difficult economic
 situation which prevails in the country. There is no evidence
 of systematic or widespread mistreatment of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no concept of habeas corpus in the Malagasy legal
 system. In a normal criminal case the accused must be charged
 within three days or must be released. However, persons
 suspected of activity against the state may be legally
 detained incommunicado for 15 days, subject to indefinite
 extension if considered necessary by the Government.
 Defendants are generally charged formally and clearly within
 the specified time frame and upon being charged are entitled
 to the assistance of counsel. Counsel is readily available
 and, if a defendant does not already have a court-appointed
 attorney or cannot afford one, court-appointed counsel will be
 provided. Arbitrary arrest or detention occurs, however, in
 those cases which involve an alleged threat to the state. In
 such cases, the authorities may not bother with legal
 formalities in making an arrest. Some defendants in cases
 involving alleged coup-plotting were detained without being
 brought to trial for periods ranging from one year and eight
 months to over five years. Extended periods of pre-trial
 detention are the exception, not the rule, and are usually
 limited to cases considered genuine threats to the Government.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Under the Malagasy Constitution and in practice, the country's
 judiciary is independent of the Government. During the 1983
 election period, there were a number of judicial decisions
 
 
 194
 MADAGASCAR
 against the Government, some of which involved charges of
 election fraud. The courts also acquitted several individuals
 charged with plotting a coup. Although other defendants were
 eventually found guilty, the trial was fairly conducted, the
 defendants were represented by counsel, and the proceedings
 were followed by the public and the media. Judicial
 procedures are open and impartial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The state does not generally intervene in the non-political
 aspects of the lives of the people. The home is inviolable
 under Malagasy law, and intrusions into an individual's
 residence must be made under the authority of a warrant.
 Although government economic policies limit the choices open
 to an individual, the Malagasy may make their own decisions,
 without government coercion or interference, in such matters
 as changing jobs or residence, marriage, having children, or
 joining or declining to join political parties or social
 organizations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The media in Madagascar are subject to government censorship.
 The Government provides guidelines on prohibited topics, but
 these are not always explicit nor are they rigorously
 enforced. When enforced, the newspapers generally leave blank
 those columns where the deleted material would have appeared.
 In general, the censorship policies are designed to forestall
 media criticism of the President and top government officials
 and their actions. In one instance in 1984, a newspaper
 reporting on a downtown riot was withheld from distribution.
 Government control is further strengthened by state ownership
 of the radio, television stations, ahd news publications.
 There are, however, independent, privately owned newspapers as
 well, which can criticize within the above-mentioned
 guidelines what they perceive as the failings of the
 Government. Critical examination of a range of policy issues
 such as economic management, transportation, and education can
 be found in the media. Although direct attacks on the
 President are not permitted, criticisms of presidential
 policies and decisions are published. Individual citizens are
 free to voice their dissatisfaction with the Government
 without fear of arrest or harassment by the authorities.
 Although distribution of uncensored publications is officially
 prohibited, no instance is known in which action has been
 taken against them.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of assembly and association is restricted in
 Madagascar. Permits are required to hold public meetings and
 can be denied by the Government if officials believe that the
 meeting poses a threat to the state or endangers national
 unity. Persons and groups belonging to one of the parties in
 the National Front are permitted to organize and assemble.
 Two of these parties held national conferences in the capital
 city in 1984 and in speeches and resolutions roundly
 criticized the Government. Nevertheless, since political
 activity by groups outside the National Front is prohibited,
 dissenting political opinion is limited. Although the right
 
 
 195
 MADAGASCAR
 to organize labor unions is recognized, unions do not play a
 major role either politically or economically. The labor
 force of 4.5 million is mostly agrarian, and union labor
 accounts for less than 5 percent of the total. Unions are
 permitted to strike and conduct substantive wage negotiations,
 but because of the depressed economy strikes have been few,
 and the trade unions have been relatively quiescent. Most
 unions are affiliated with the National Front parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government of Madagascar is secular and there is no
 official religion. There is no discrimination on the basis of
 religious affiliation, and individuals are free to follow the
 faith of their choice. Missionaries and clergy are generally
 permitted to operate freely, and the Government has so far
 made no effort to restrain Christian churches which have
 become more outspoken in their criticism of government
 policies. Over half of the population is either Catholic or
 Protestant, with the remainder following traditional Malagasy
 religious beliefs or other faiths.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government has imposed no restrictions upon travel within
 the country. Official approval must be obtained for trips
 outside the country, but there has been only one known
 instance in the past in which approval was denied due to the
 individual's political views. Foreign travel is impeded by
 the difficulty in obtaining foreign currency, as the Malagasy
 franc is not convertible abroad, and the Government limits the
 amount of hard currency that can be obtained for foreign
 travel. There is no refugee population in Madagascar.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The electorate's choice is constrained by the nature of the
 political system, since the only political parties allowed to
 operate in Madagascar are those which are members of the
 National Front. However, there exists a range of ideological
 and policy views among the Front parties, and within this
 spectrum there are viewpoints represented that are at odds
 with the policies of the administration. Thus, the electoral
 process does give the voters a chance to choose among
 candidates expressing differing views in local and regional
 elections and in the National Assembly and presidential
 campaigns. The electoral process, although not completely
 free from irregularities, has been essentially straightforward
 in recent elections. The political system in Madagascar also
 reflects a considerable degree of regional balance. There are
 no special conditions of nationality or citizenship which
 exclude any elements in society from participating in the
 existing political process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not cooperated with groups wishing to
 investigate alleged human rights violations. There are no
 official representatives of human rights organizations in
 Madagascar.  In 1981, Amnesty International representatives
 
 
 196
 MADAGASCAR
 were denied visas. When the President's opponent in the
 election campaign called for supervision of the elections by
 Amnesty International in 1982, the President rejected this
 proposal as being in derogation of national sovereignty.
 In the absence of private human rights groups, the Christian
 churches in the country have taken the lead in advocating
 human rights. Although the Government is sensitive to
 criticism emanating from this quarter, it has not officially
 responded to questions or criticisms from the churches or any.
 other groups.
 Amnesty International reported that at least 20 prisoners of
 conscience or individuals whose cases were being investigated
 by Amnesty International were released during 1983, mostly as
 a result of court decisions. As of the end of 1983, Amnesty
 International knew of only one untried political detainee.
 Freedom House rates Madagascar 'partly free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Madagascar's economic situation, which had steadily
 deteriorated since 1978, seems to have stabilized; but the
 outlook for improvement in the immediate future is dim. The
 Government has actively undertaken many reforms in conjunction
 with World Bank and International Monetary Fund assistance and
 is working closely with Western nations who continue to
 provide development assistance.
 The gross national product (GNP), which had fallen each year
 from 1972 to 1982, increased slightly in 1983 with per capita
 GNP at $330. The population of 9.5 million continues to grow
 at a rate of 2.8 percent annually. Unemployment is becoming
 an increasingly serious problem, exacerbated by the migration
 of the rural poor into urban areas.
 The agricultural sector is the most important in the economy,
 accounting for almost 90 percent of employment and
 approximately 85 percent of export earnings. However,
 agricultural production has declined to the point where
 Madagascar has been forced to import rice, the staple of the
 Malagasy diet. Much of this decline is attributable to
 government marketing policies which subsidize consumer costs
 and control producer prices. Recent liberalizations in the
 marketing system have ameliorated this situation, and
 agricultural production has increased slightly in 1984.
 Despite problems with agricultural production, individual
 levels of caloric intake are at 110 percent of requirements
 (1977 statistic). Nevertheless, malnutrition and dietary
 deficiencies are ongoing problems due to erratic distribution
 of fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy products, and meat.
 Further, only one-fourth of the population has access to safe
 drinking water (1975 statistic).
 Health care delivery systems are plagued with shortages of
 medical personnel, inadequate facilities, and limited supplies
 of antibiotics and other medicines. Malaria remains a
 continuing problem, especially in coastal areas, and the
 population is quite vulnerable to outbreaks of disease
 following natural disasters such as flooding. Life expectancy
 at birth was 49 years in 1984, and the infant mortality rate
 was 101.1 per 1,000 in 1983.
 
 
 197
 MADAGASCAR
 World Bank 1980 figures for the primary school enrollment
 ratio show 90 percent for females and 98 percent for males.
 Recent dramatic increases in enrollment have resulted in
 overburdened facilities, shortages of qualified teachers, and
 extremely high student-teacher ratios in the public school
 system. The situation is unlikely to improve in the near
 future, and few families can afford the private or parochial
 schools.
 There is little overt discrimination against individuals on
 the basis of ethnic grouping or sex in Madagascar. Although
 there are numerous indigenous ethnic groups in Madagascar, the
 society is relatively homogenous due to a common language and
 a tendency for what were perhaps once disparate cultures to
 draw together in an island environment. There are still
 distinctions among these groups, but there is little
 discrimination by one group against another. Ethnic Indian,
 Chinese, and French communities have experienced some
 resentment from the Malagasy and occasionally have been the
 target of local government policies favoring Malagasy
 nationals.
 Madagascar has what is essentially a matriarchal society, and
 a highly visible role for women has been a long-recognized and
 integral part of the country's sociological framework. There
 are no restrictions concerning activities in which women may
 engage. Women have a lengthy tradition of involvement in
 high-level political activity, and currently there are women
 members of the Cabinet, Supreme Revolutionary Council, and the
 National Assembly. Women are also very active and play major
 roles in the various political parties. Women have a
 prominent role in the business and economic life of the
 country, with many of them managing or owning business
 concerns or filling management positions in state industries.
 Education at all levels is open to women. However, women in
 rural areas and among the poor face a greater degree of
 hardship. In addition to the responsibilities associated with
 child rearing and household management, economic necessity
 forces these women to engage in farm labor or other similar
 activities. These conditions stem more from socioeconomic
 factors than from a discriminatory bias toward women in
 Malagasy society.
