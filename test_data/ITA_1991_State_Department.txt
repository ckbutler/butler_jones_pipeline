 ITALY
 Italy is a democratic, multiparty republic with a parliamentary
 system of government. Legislative power is vested in the
 Parliament, which is directly and freely elected on the basis
 of universal adult suffrage. Executive authority is vested in
 the Council of Ministers, headed by President of the Council
 Giulio Andreotti from the Christian Democratic Party. Italy's
 judiciary is independent of the executive butsubject to
 political party pressure. The Chief of State, the President of
 the Republic, is elected by Parliament and representatives of
 Italy's 20 regions.
 Terrorist violence of both the left and right has remained at
 low levels in recent years. The most dramatic example of-
 terrorism may have been the killing in Bologna of three
 policemen in January. Although terrorism has yet to be
 completely overcome, its considerable reduction has freed
 increased-law enforcement resources for the struggle against
 organized crime, which remains a serious problem. Despite
 popular rejection of terrorism, however, the major terrorist
 crimes of the 1970's and 1980's remain unsolved and the
 perpetrators unpunished.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy which is among the
 world's largest. It is characterized by sizable government
 ownership of the primary industrial sectors and a private sector
 whose small and medium-sized companies are especially dynamic.
 Much media attention in 1991 was devoted to the problem of
 racism, directed primarily at third world immigrants. Violence
 against children continued to be troublesome, especially in
 light of a number of children killed in incidents attributed to
 organized crime. Nevertheless, the human rights situation in
 general continues to be good, and the trend toward openness in
 dealing with sensitive human rights issues has continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial"Killing
 Neither government forces nor legal opposition organizations
 engage in politically motivated killings.
 Levels of terrorist violence have continued to remain low in.
 recent years. The authorities have not yet determined whether
 the murder of three policemen in January in Bologna, violent
 attacks against Gypsies in late 1990 in Bologna, and the murder
 of two Senegalese in Rimini in August had political roots or
 were linked to organized-crime. Twenty-two children were killed
 in the first half of'1991, and authorities estimate that some
 40 percent of these murders were committed by organized crime.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of politically motivated disappearance or
 kidnapings.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture is provided for,by law and respected in
 practice. Cruel and degrading punishment is forbidden by law,
 
 
 1150
 ITALY
 and cases of violations have been rare. There were no
 allegations of ill-treatment of prisoners during 1991, but past
 allegations of ill-treatment, if investigated, rarely resulted
 in disciplinary proceedings against those responsible, even
 when the ill-treatment had been judicially proven.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police procedures are carefully controlled by law and judicial
 oversight. Arbitrary arrest is not practiced. Anyone detained
 by the authorities must be charged within 48 hours. Italian
 law imposes strict time limits on pretrial detention, which
 includes all detention prior to the conclusion of all appeals.
 In normal criminal cases, the maximum permissible duration of
 pretrial detention varies according to the gravity of the
 crime. Under reforms passed in 1989, the maximum time that any
 person may be held in pretrial detention, even for the most
 serious crimes, was set at 4 years. with no more than 2 years
 at each step-of the trial and during the long appeals process.
 The Government recently has moved to extend the total period to
 6 years for defendants accused of serious crimes.
 Provisional liberty may be granted to persons awaiting trial,
 depending on the discretion of the judge and the seriousness of
 the crime. Pretrial detention is not permitted for minor
 offenses.
 As a safeguard against abuse, "liberty tribunals" are empowered
 to review evidence in cases of persons awaiting trial and to
 decide whether continued detention is warranted. In the first
 6 months of 1991, 2,795 men and 134 women, out of a prison
 population of 31,053, were released because the length of time
 during which they could be held had expired.
 Exile abroad as a form of punishment is unknown. In July new
 legislation was passed requiring persons convicted of Mafia-
 type offenses to move their residence to their region of origin.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair, public trial is assured by law and observed in practice
 in almost all cases. Counsel is provided for the accused, free
 of charge, if necessary. Good-faith efforts are made to
 guarantee the due process rights set forth above. Trial
 procedures can often be cumbersome, however, with the result
 that trials frequently last an inordinately long time.
 Decisions in criminal cases by the court of original
 jurisdiction may be appealed to the next higher court by both
 the defendant and the prosecuting attorney. It is possible for
 a defendant who has been found innocent by a lower court to be
 found guilty and sentenced by the higher court after an appeal
 by the prosecuting attorney. Nevertheless, a defendant found
 guilty in a lower court may, on appeal, be found innocent or,
 if still found guilty, have his sentence reduced by the higher
 court. All cases may be appealed to the highest appellate
 court, the Court of Cassation.
 In 1989 an effort was made to streamline the process with the
 enactment of a revised Code of Criminal Procedure.
 Unfamiliarity with the new system on the part of judicial
 authorities, coupled with infrastructural and bureaucratic
 problems, led to disappointing results through 1991. The
 revisions to the Code provided for a more adversarial-type
 system designed to result in speedier trials. In 1991 the
 
 
 1151
 ITALY
 authorities tried to resolve the problem through the
 reassignment of judges.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive, but it is widely
 .accepted that the political views of individual judges and
 their links to-'political parties may affect proceedin4s. In
 1991 the President of the Republic said publicly that members
 of the judiciary were too closely linked to political parties.
 Judges are subject to intimidation by organized crime, and in
 1991 one judge investigating Mafia-type crime was- murdered.
 There are no political or security courts or political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Inrerfekence with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The concept of the privacy of the home is legally safeguarded
 .and respected by the authorities. Searches and electronic
 monitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant and
 in carefully defined-circumstances. One case of alleged
 electronic monitoring created a media uproar.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and a free press are assured under Italy's
 democratic political system, which allows expression of a wide
 spectrum of political views. Although there is no censorship,
 publications may be-seized for violation of obscenity laws or
 for defamation of state -institutions. These powers are seldom
 invoked.
 Government-run radio and television are politicized at the
 administrative level but air widely differing views on political
 and social issues. Politicians disagree, however, as to whether
 time is allocated impartially to parties and issues. In 1991
 the allocation of private television channels aroused keen
 interest because of the belief that some parties would gain
 political advantage from the distribution through their links
 with private owners. Many private television and radio stations
 broadcasting since the early 1980's have provided competition
 for the state-owned broadcasting system.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Italian citizens freely exercise their right of peaceful
 assembly, which is limited only in cases where national
 security or public safety is endangered. Permits are not
 required for meetings, but organizers of public demonstrations
 must notify the police in advance. Professional and employer
 associations organize and represent their constituencies freely.
 c. Freedom'of Religion
 Persons are free to profess and practice any religious faith.
 All religions are free to organize and proselytize within the
 limits imposed by the laws governing public order.
 Italy's relations with the Roman Catholic Church are governed
 by a 1984 agreement (Concordat) between the Italian Government
 and the Holy See, ratified in 1985. The agreement, which
 replaced the Concordat of 1929, recognizes the rights and place
 of Catholicism but no longer accords it the status of a state
 religion. The Roman Catholic Church continues informally to
 
 
 1152
 ITALY
 enjoy special standing in Italy because of the presence of the
 Vatican and because the overwhelming majority of Italians are,
 at least nominally, Roman Catholic. The State no longer
 provides subsidy payments to the Church, but taxpayers may
 elect to designate a small percentage, determined by law, of
 their tax payment to the Catholic Church or other denominations
 or humanitarian organizations. When the taxpayers do not
 specify another denomination or organization, their payments go
 to the Catholic Church with the result that the funds now
 received by the Church are greater than when it received a
 direct subsidy.
 Roman Catholic religious instruction is offered in the public
 schools as an optional subject. The Ministry of Education has
 yet to resolve a controversy over the "hour of religion" in
 schools. Proponents of religious instruction have advocated
 that students who choose not to enroll in a religion course
 spend the hour in school studying another subject instead. The
 Constitutional Court expressed the view that it would violate
 the students' rights to force them to do so. Not all schools,
 however, have as yet followed the court's view, which has the
 effect of an advisory opinion, and the issue remains open.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Italian citizens may travel freely both within the country and
 abroad. Emigration is unrestricted. Citizens who leave are
 guaranteed the right to return, and the Constitution forbids
 deprivation of citizenship for political reasons.
 Since the passage of the new immigration law in 1989, Italy has
 granted permanent resettlement to 1,600 persons seeking asylum
 in Italy. In addition, Italian authorities have provided
 temporary haven for many persons fleeing persecution who are
 eventually resettled in third countries. They have also
 indicated a willingness to receive Yugoslavs fleeing war zones
 in 1991.
 Early in 1991, some 28,000 Albanians seeking better economic
 conditions landed in southern Italian ports. More than half
 were persuaded to return to Albania after a brief stay in port
 areas. In August 19,000 more Albanians arrived by ship, most
 of whom were sent back after a few days. Soon after, Italy
 rounded up and forcibly repatriated approximately 2,500
 Albanians who were not given the opportunity to request refugee
 status. Due to the unprecedented and massive inflow of
 Albanians, Italian authorities appeared unable to provide
 adequate facilities to shelter and feed them. Approximately
 14,000 Albanians who arrived in Italy in 1990 and 1991 were
 permitted to remain temporarily. The Italian Government
 undertook measures to facilitate their assimilation, and some
 regional governments are providing assistance for employment,
 housing, health care, vocational training, and education.
 Between 7,000 and 10,000 have found work, another 2,000 no
 longer receive grants from the Government, and 2,000 are
 children.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Italy has a democratic, free parliamentary system. Although
 the Constitution outlaws the Fascist party, a wide range of
 organized and active political parties exists from the far left
 to the far right of the political spectrum. Election campaigns
 
 
 1153
 ITALY
 are free and open, and voting is by secret ballot. The
 Government investigates allegations of voting abuses. The two
 chambers of Parliament and regional, provincial, and municipal
 counciI are-elected either at regular intervals or when
 special. elections are called due to a loss of confidence.
 Opposition-groups are active and are able to alter or reject
 government policies. In 1991 one small party voluntarily
 dissolved and a new one, which split off from the former
 Italian Communist Party, was formed. In addition, the former
 Italian Communist:Party dissolved and reconstituted itself as
 the Democratic Party of the Left.
 There are norestrictions in law on-the participation of women
 in government and.politics. Political and social customs
 result, however, in a lower-percentage of participation by
 women than by men.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and -
 Nongovernmental Investigaticn of Alleged Violations
 of.Human Rights.
 Nongovernmental organizations are free to investigate conditions
 in Italy, attend trials, and publish their findings.
 The Italian Government and nongovernmental human rights
 organizations support human rights around the world. Italy
 participates fully in various international human rights
 organizations and is a staunch supporter of respect for human
 rights and fundamental freedoms.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no legal discrimination on the basis of race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 German speakers in the Alto Adige region bordering on Austria
 have claimed for many years that they were discriminated against
 on the basis of language, particularly in legal proceedings and
 in the schools,-and h recently enacted -package of reforms is
 aimed at providing further protection for them. Italian
 speakers have complained that the new concessions to the
 German-speaking minority have in fact resulted in reverse
 discrimination. Italian speakers, who are a minority in many
 parts of the region, have claimed that they are discriminated
 against in obtaining housing and employment. The gradual
 emigration of Italian speakers from the area will make the
 achievement of a balance between the two ethnic groups more
 difficult in the future.
 Italians in general show intolerance toward North Africans
 residing and working in Italy and toward the population of
 Gypsy origin. Employees of international organizations in Rome
 from third world countries report more difficulty in finding
 housing than their European colleagues. The Government
 maintains statistics on the number of cases of violence against
 third world immigrants by third world immigrants, but it does
 not keep statistics of violence directed against third world
 immigrants by Italians.
 The Lombard League and other recently formed, grass-roots
 political groupings which espouse separatist and nationalist'
 themes continue to attract followers. Some of the League's
 policies are widely perceived to have racist overtones. The
 
 
 1154
 ITALY
 Lombard League's policy supporting strict limits on third world
 immigration into Italy and on the rights and benefits which
 those immigrants enjoy once in Italy are two examples cited by
 critics. Another is the League's policy favoring greater self-
 government for the north because it regards the poorer regions
 of southern Italy as culturally and ethnically distinct areas
 that allegedly inhibit the economic growth and development of
 the more prosperous north.
 Despite the Italian authorities' efforts to integrate the Gypsy
 population into Italian society, Gypsy communities continue to
 stand out and to attract negative, sometimes violent, attention.
 Local. administrations and communities have shown greater
 sensitivity to the need to ensure equal treatment of those who
 belong to "nomad" groups and who are, for the most part, Italian
 citizens. While a number of initiatives are awaiting
 implementation, however, the increase in pickpocketing and other
 petty street crimes in which some members of these groups appear
 to be the predominant participants is a serious concern for most
 Italians and tourists. Approximately 4,000 Gypsies reside in
 the greater Rome area. Most of them live in precarious and
 unhygienic conditions. In August, partly due to the massive
 protests by Roman families opposed to the idea of Gypsies
 camping in or near their neighborhoods, the Roman authorities
 removed a Gypsy settlement from one area of Rome to another.
 Anti-Semitic graffiti and swastikas, probably by extremists of
 both the left and the right, continue to appear on walls in
 Rome and other Italian cities, but there were no acts of
 physical violence against the Jewish community in 1991.
 The condition of women has improved greatly over the past 20
 years. Subject to social customs, women participate freely in
 political and social life, but, despite legal guarantees,
 employers continue to favor men over women in filling jobs,
 particularly those with prospects for advancement to management.
 Women fill only 3.3 percent of managerial positions and are also
 poorly represented in the professions. Women tend to remain in
 traditional employment areas, although female police officers
 are beginning to appear in many Italian cities. Up to the early
 1960's, employers could legally dismiss a woman who married.
 Since 1963 it has been illegal to dismiss a female employee
 within one year of her marriage date except "for cause."
 Women enjoy equal rights with men in marriage, but a women's
 group linked to an opposition party estimated in September, on
 the basis of a telephone hot-line service, that 30 percent of
 Italian married'women were subject to physical abuse in the
 home. In the event of divorce, a woman is entitled to a share
 of the survivor's pension and any inheritance in the event of
 the death of her ex-husband. The property of a married couple
 is considered community property unless husband and wife agree
 to keep their property divided. All assets acquired prior to
 marriage are exempt from the community property provision.
 Demands by women's groups for more severe penalties against
 rapists have been unanswered. Violence against children
 continued to attract governmental and media attention during
 1991. In a series of incidents, 22 children were killed either
 accidentally in organized crime shootouts or because they were
 witnesses to crimes.
 Italy does not have any important national women's rights
 groups independent of political parties or trade unions.
 
 
 1155
 
 ITALY
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Workers' Statute of 1970 provides for the right to establish
 a trade union, to join a union, and to carry out union
 activities in the workplace. Trade unions are not government
 controlled, and the Constitution fully protects their right to
 strike, which is frequently'exercised. In practice, the three
 major labor confederations have strong ideological ties to the
 three major political parties and administer certain social
 welfare services for the Government, which compensates them
 accordingly. Moreover, the Workers' Statute favors the three
 confederations to the extent that it is difficult for small
 unions, including the so-called "base committees" (COBAS), to
 obtain recognition. In 1990, however, one of the COBAS, that
 of the locomotive-engineers, finally was recognized and seated
 at the bargaining table.
 Perhaps as the result of a 1990 law limiting the right to
 strike in essential public services, Italian workers went on
 strike much less in 1991 than in previous years. The number of
 hours lost to strikes declined by 53 percent in the first 9
 months of 1991. Italian unions associate freely and actively
 with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize and bargain collectively is
 protected by the Constitution and is freely practiced throughout
 the country. Labor-management relations are governed by
 legislation, custom, collective bargaining agreements, and labor
 contracts. A key element of labor-management-government
 cooperation affecting the industrial relations climate is the
 1986 agreement on indexing wages (scala mobile) to the cost of
 living every 6 months. National collective bargaining
 agreements in practice apply to all workers regardless of union
 membership. Collective bargaining at the national level
 (involving the three confederations, the public and private
 employers' organizations and, where appropriate, the Government)
 occurs irregularly and deals with issues of mutual concern,
 particularly the system of wage indexation. Sectoral
 negotiations, involving national-level industrial unions and
 employers' organizations, typically occur every 3 or 4 years
 and cover all aspects of labor relations; they also apply to
 all workers, whether unionized or not. Voluntary, nonbinding
 mediation is provided by the Ministry of Labor and is often
 effective in bringing labor and management together.
 There are no areas of the country, such as export processing
 zones, where union organizing and collective bargaining are
 impeded or discouraged. The law prohibits antiunion
 discrimination by employers against union members and
 organizers. A new law in 1990 encourages workers in small
 enterprises (i.e., fewer than 16 employees) to join unions and
 requires "just cause" for dismissals from employment.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor, which is prohibited by law, does
 not exist in practice.
 
 
 1156
 ITALY
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under current legislation, no child under 15 years of age may
 be employed (with some specified exceptions). The Ministry of
 Labor, having consulted with the labor organizations, may as an
 exception authorize the employment on specific jobs of children
 over 12 years of age. There are also specific restrictions on
 employment in various dangerous or unhealthful occupations up
 to the age of 18 for men and 21 for women, although no women,
 regardless of age, are permitted to be employed underground, in
 quarries, mines, or tunnels. Minimum age and compulsory
 education laws (through age 14) are effectively enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no minimum wage set under Italian law; basic wages and
 salaries are set forth in collective bargaining agreements.
 National collective bargaining agreements contain minimum
 standards to which individual employment agreements must
 conform. In the absence of agreement between the parties, the
 courts may step in to determine fair wages on the basis of
 practice in related activities or related collective bargaining
 agreements.
 Minimum work and safety standards are established by law and
 buttressed and extended in collective labor contracts. The
 Basic Law of 1923 provides for a maximum workweek of 48 hours
 --no more than 6 days per week and 8 hours per day. The 8-hour
 day may be exceeded for some special categories. Most
 collective bargaining agreements provide for a 36- to 38-hour
 week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours per day or an average of
 12 hours per week.
 Basic health and safety standards and guidelines for
 compensation for on-the-job injury are set forth in an
 extensive body of law and regulations. In most cases, these
 standards are exceeded in collective bargaining agreements.
 Enforcement of health and safety regulations is entrusted to
 labor inspectors; who are employees of local health units and
 have the same status as judicial police officers. Inspectors
 make periodic visits to companies to ensure observance of
 safety regulations. Violators may be fined or even imprisoned.
 It is common for Italian judges to find employees guilty of
 infractions. Trade unions also play an important role in
 reporting safety violations to inspectors. As of December 1990,
 work-related deaths in industry totaled 1,368 and in agriculture
 442, slight decreases from 1989 (when there were 1,550 in
 industry and 607 in agriculture). Part of the problem is an
 inadequate number of inspectors. Due to high unemployment,
 there is also pressure on workers to accept unsafe conditions
 as a necessary evil if they need jobs. There are many
 substandard workplaces in Italy, especially in the south.
