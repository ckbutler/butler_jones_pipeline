 GHANA
 Ghana is governed by the Provisional National Defense Council
 (PNDC) under the chairmanship of Flight Lieutenant Jerry John
 Rawlings who seized power from an elected government on
 December 31, 1981, and suspended the Constitution. Under the
 establishment proclamation of January 11, 1982, the PNDC
 exercises "all powers of government." In addition to Chairman
 Rawlings, the PNDC consists of eight members, of whom two are
 serving military officers and six are civilians. The executive
 consists of ministries headed by secretaries, who together
 constitute a. committee-of secretaries, chaired by a PNDC
 member, that drafts laws for referral to the PNDC for final.
 consideration and approval. All senior national, regional, 'and
 district officials are appointed by the PNDC.
 In 1991, facing mounting public pressures for reform, Chairman
 Rawlings announced various, carefully controlled steps in the
 process of returning the country to constitutional rule,
 including the lifting of the ban on politics following a
 referendum on a new constitution. These steps included the
 formation of a constitutional drafting committee, which
 prepared a draft document-by the end of July, and a.
 Consultative Assembly composed of 260 members to debate and
 redraft a new constitution, a task it was.unable to finish by
 December 31. At year's end,-the PNDC announced that the
 constitutional referendum would'still be held in April 1992 and
 that presidential and parliamentary elections, to which
 international observers would be invited, would take place
 before the end of 1992.
 The several security organizations report to various
 departments of government, but all come under the control of
 the PNDC. Most security cases of-a political nature are
 handled by the, Bureau of National Investigation (BNI). All
 security agencies report to the PNDC member for foreign affairs
 and national security.  There have been occasional instances of
 police brutality.
 Although Ghana is attempting to rebuild its industrial base
 after years of economic mismanagement, more than 60 percent of
 the population still draws its livelihood from agriculture.
 Cocoa and cocoa products provide more than half of export
 revenues. Gold, timber, and diamonds are also produced and
 exported. Annual economic growth has averaged 5 to 6 percent
 since the inception.of an econ6micrecovery program in 1983.
 Human rights remained circumscribed in Ghana, but the  situation
 improved in 1991, with Ghanaians speaking out on political
 issues as never before under the PNDC. Thefragility of this
 progress was demonstrated by the arrests late in 1991 of
 several 'pposition leaders for expressing their-opinions.
 Independent newspapers became outspokenly critical of the PNDC,
 and government opponents voiced their opinions in seminars,
 press conferences, speeches, and press releases. Various
 social and "public interest" organizati6ns fronting for the
 still banned political parties sprang up during the year. They
 expressed dissatisfaction with the PNDC's control over the
 reform process. In September they formed, with the Movement
 for Freedom and Justice (MFJ), the Coordinating Committee of
 Democratic Forces (CCDF) to issue statements on behalf of all
 opposition groups. However, there continued to be restrictions
 on such basic rights as freedom of speech, press, assembly, and
 religion; the right of citizens to change their government; and
 legal due process. Summary arrest and detention were
 
 
 GHANA
 continuing problems, with many instances of incarceration
 without formal charges.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Similarly, no politically motivated disappearances were
 reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were occasional credible reports of mistreatment of
 prisoners, such as keeping them in isolation for long periods
 and in dark, small cells without clothes or proper beds.
 Prisons in Ghana are antiquated and seriously overcrowded, and
 conditions are harsh. From time to time, the PNDC has commuted
 the sentences of ill or aged prisoners. The most recent
 example was in January 1992 when the PNDC granted amnesty to
 roughly 1,000 prisoners.
 There are occasional reports of excessive police force,
 especially during arrests. In May a demonstrator calling for
 the resignation of the PNDC was allegedly beaten by police. In
 December an opposition leader was arrested for allegedly coming
 to his feet tardily during the playing of the national anthem
 and entrance of the paramount chief. He was "drilled" twice a
 day in how to show respect for the flag and reportedly had his
 head shaved with a broken bottle, although upon his release he
 denied being tortured.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Criminal Code provides minimal legal protection against
 arbitrary arrest and detention. Although accused persons have
 the right to be charged formally within 48 hours of detention,
 the court can set excessive bail or refuse to release persons
 on bail and instead remand-them without charge for an
 indefinite period, subject to weekly review by judicial
 authorities. The only crimes for which, by statute, there is
 no bail are murder and subversion. PNDC Law 4 (preventive
 custody law of 1982) provides for indefinite detention without
 trial if the PNDC determines it is in the interest of national
 security. A 1984 law prevents any judicial inquiry into the
 grounds for detention under PNDC Law 4. Ghanaian security
 forces occasionally take persons into custody, with or without
 warrants, and hold them incommunicado for extended periods of
 time, with no legal recourse available to the detainee. The
 threat of such treatment serves as a deterrent to political or
 other opposition activities.
 Businessmen suspected of illegal activities have been, arrested
 and incarcerated while the Government undertook
 investigations. Lebanese and other resident foreign
 businessmen have been jailed and held for extended periods
 without formal charges and without'trial. In some cases,
 
 
 GHANA
 incarcerated businessmen have been released without any trial
 after paying a sum, informally deemed to be a suitable
 reparation, to the National Investigation Committee. In 1990 a
 naturalized American citizen of Ghanaian origin was held
 without charge and eventually released in August 1991 after
 repeated high-level U.S. representations.
 The exact number of long-term political prisoners and detainees
 at the end of 1991 was unknown; the best estimates indicate 50
 to 90. .The Movement for Freedom and Justice (MFJ), a movement
 organized to provide a forum for the banned political parties
 to present their views on the return to constitutional rule and
 human rights issues, and several international human rights
 groups published lists during 1991. The MFJ claims that there
 are others in detention whose names it does not know. The PNDC
 often detains for several months Ghanaians who have been
 repatriated to Ghana after having been denied political asylum
 in Western countries. In addition, persons are regularly
 detained for a few days to a few weeks for a variety of reasons
 and then released.
 It is difficult to determine how many of the 50 to 90 long-term
 detainees are political detainees. The Government claims that
 28 are held on criminal charges and 36 in connection with coup
 attempts. All of them have been, and are being, denied the
 right to ,a speedy, fair, and public trial. The Government
 gives no-indication that it is prepared to bring them to trial.
 The Government does not practice forced exile. In July it
 offered lxiited.amnesty to voluntary exiles, excluding those
 convicted 'of any criminal offense, wanted by the police for a
 criminal offense,, or under sentence of death by any court or
 tribunal in Ghana. In recent years, the PNDC has also quietly
 encouraged Ghanians, including dissidents, with valuable
 skills wh6"are living abroad to return; in some cases, the
 Government has offered amnesty. Some former government and
 PNDC officials have returned and resumed careers outside
 politics, apparently without difficulties.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Three court systems exist in Ghana. In the "prerevolutionary"
 court system, traditional legal safeguards are based on British
 legal practices. Trials are public, and defendants have a
 right to be present, to be represented by an attorney, and to
 present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. This system
 includes high.courts, appeals courts, and the Supreme Court
 headed by a Chief Justice. There are limitations, however, in
 the independence of thesebcburts. In'the past, the PNDC has
 summarily dismissed judges, thereby warning them that they
 serve at the PNDC's sufferance. In 1989 the Government
 reconstituted'the' judicial council but confined it to an
 advisory role for judicial appointments and disciplinary
 matters., The judiciary is still not independent.
 A separate public tribunal system'at the national and regional
 levels was set up by the PNDC in 1982 to bypass the regular
 court system and speed up the judicial process by restricting
 the procedural rights of defendants. The public tribunals
 depend.largely on judges with little or no legal experience,
 and they shortcut legal safeguards and due process to provide
 "rough and ready" decisions, particularly in criminal cases.
 This system includes the office of Revenue Commissioners, the
 National Investigations Committee (which, established by PNDC
 Law 2, has the power to investigate virtually any allegation
 
 
 152
 GHANA
 referred to it by the PNDC), the Special Military Tribunal, and
 the Public Tribunals Board.
 The PNDC normally avoids bringing political and security cases
 to trial, preferring to keep suspected opponents in indefinite
 detention. However, if cases come to trial, they are heard by
 public tribunals. PNDC Law 24 empowers public tribunals to
 impose the death penalty for any crime specified a capital
 offense by the PNDC or if the tribunal determines that it is
 merited in a particular case, even if the crime is not
 punishable by the death penalty under regular statutes. There
 are no known instances of this law being used. No appeals were
 permitted until 1985, when the National Appeals Tribunal was
 created. The Ghana Bar Association has elected not to practice
 before the public tribunals and currently has a court case
 pending which hinges on its opposition to the tribunals.
 The Chieftaincy Act of 1971 gives the village and other
 traditional chiefs powers in local matters, including authority
 to enforce customary tribal laws on such matters as divorce,
 child-custody, and property disputes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Citizens engaged in activity deemed objectionable by the
 Government are subject to interference with regard to private
 conduct, including monitoring of telephones and mail.- There is
 no recourse if a government agency wiretaps or interferes with
 private correspondence. In past years, forced entry into homes
 has been reported in connection with security investigations.
 In 1990 the PNDC began redefining the role of the local
 Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR's), which
 previously functioned as neighborhood watch committees and
 reported individual political behavior to the Government.
 Various PNDC officials have called on the CDR's and the Civil
 Defense Organizations (CDO's) to exercise restraint during the
 transition to constitutional rule. However, there continue to
 be credible reports of CDR interference in private and tribal
 matters.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press remain restricted by certain
 laws. However, the PNDC has allowed a considerable relaxation
 in the enforcement of these laws. Several newspapers have
 sprung up and these, plus some established independent papers,
 have been outspoken in their criticism of the PNDC. Also,
 organizations such as the Ghana Bar Association, the MFJ, the
 Trade Union Congress (TUC), the National Union of Ghanaian
 Students (NUGS), and others have been equally outspoken in
 their criticism of the Government. However, arrests late in
 the year of a newspaper editor-and two opposition figures
 showed that there are still limits on freedom of expression.
 The Government owns the radio and television stations and the
 two principal daily newspapers. Reporting in the official
 media accentuates the positive aspects of government policies
 but also covers selected instances of corruption and
 mismanagement in government agencies and state-owned
 enterprises. In general, the government-owned media do not
 carry criticism of government policies oK of Chairman Rawlings
 
 
 153
 GHANA
 and PNDC members. They also do not cover the opposition. In
 recent months, the official media have opened up somewhat, and
 -a wider range of opinion is now available. Journalists are
 occasionally subject to discipline or dismissal by the
 Government for publishing articles deemed unacceptable. As a
 result, self-censorship is a pattern in the official media, and
 writers, editors, and commentators rarely cross the boundary of
 acceptable reporting and commentary.
 Foreign periodicals such as West Africa, Time, and Newsweek are
 sold in Accra and other major cities; even issues containing
 articles critical of Ghana's Government circulate freely. Most
 Western journalists are routinely accorded visas and press
 credentials as opposed to the practices of a few years ago.
 Although in principle the university campuses are subject to
 many of the same prohibitions on political expression as apply
 to the society in general; the PNDC.has not suppressed academic
 freedom.. The NUGS, one of the more vocal critics of the PNDC,
 is tolerated and allowed to organize and hold meetings. There
 have been several student demonstrations critical of the PNDC,
 but the Government has not taken any action against the student
 groups.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association is restricted. People
 generally are free to join together formally or informally.to
 promote benevolent or nonpolitical causes, but permits are
 required for public meetings or demonstrations, and these are
 seldom granted for political purposes, particularly if the
 applicant's views are at odds with those of the Government.
 The MFJ and the CCDF have repeatedly been denied permits to
 hold rallies.
 Political parties and political meetings are prohibited. The
 Government barred persons with close ties to the old parties
 from running as candidates for election to the district
 assemblies in 1988-89. Chairman Rawlings has said that the ban
 on political parties cannot be lifted until the Consultative
 Assembly has determined what organization will oversee the
 electoral process, the procedures for registration of parties,
 and the regulations regarding their activities. The
 Consultative Assembly was unable to completeits work by the
 end of the year, as scheduled, and is now expected to finish by
 February or March 1992. In a speech opening the Consultative.
 Assembly in August, Chairman Rawlings indicated that
 legislation lifting the ban on political parties and activities
 will be adopted within 2 weeks after the constitutional
 referendum. In anticipation of open politics, a number of
 clubs and societies have sprung up that have close ties to the
 two former major parties and that freely discuss political
 issues and often criticize the PNDC.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state-favored religion. Ghanaians are
 predominantly Christian, and Christians of all sects as well as
 Muslims are well represented at all levels of government.
 There are no apparent advantages or disadvantages attached to
 membership in any particular sect or religion.
 PNDC efforts to urge the major religious communities to support
 its economic and social policies have created tensions.
 Chairman Rawlings publicly criticized the Roman Catholic Church
 
 
 154
 GHANA
 for prohibiting its priests from participating in the district
 assemblies. The PNDC has also been sensitive to criticism of
 Ghana's human rights record by leaders of various denominations.
 PNDC Law 221 of June 1989 required all religious organizations
 to register with the religious affairs committee of the
 National Commission on Culture. The Commission was granted
 authority to deny registration and the right to worship
 publicly to any religious group whose actions, it concluded,
 would lead to social disruption or offend the morals of the
 people. The Government received some 11,000 applications from
 various churches wishing to register. However, the Roman
 Catholic Church and the 14 mainline Protestant churches which
 belong to the Christian Council have refused to register on
 grounds that the law infringed on freedom of religion. The
 Government has made no effort to enforce that law, and those
 religious bodies that refused to register continue to worship
 freely. In 1991 the PNDC suspended this religious registration
 law while it conducted discussions with the Catholic
 Secretariat and the Protestant Christian Council.
 Also in June 1939, the Government "froze" the assets of four
 churches, two indigenous Christian churches plus the Jehovah's
 Witnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
 (Mormons), and expelled their foreign personnel. The
 indigenous churches had often been accused of promoting
 practices offensive to the general community; the Jehovah's
 Witness community was accused of not showing proper respect for
 the symbols of Ghana's Government, and the Mormons were accused
 of practicing racism. On November 30, 1990, the Government
 rescinded the prohibition on the Mormons. The Government met
 with the Jehovah's Witnesses in July 1991 and in November
 unfroze the church's assets and allowed it to resume public
 worship.
 Other foreign missionary groups have generally operated
 throughout the country with a minimum of formal restrictions.
 Some churches have had difficulty obtaining visas and residence
 permits for some of their expatriate missionaries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Ghanaians and foreigners are free to move throughout Ghana
 without special permission. Police checkpoints exist
 countrywide for the prevention of smuggling. Roadblocks and
 car searches are a normal part of nighttime travel in Accra.
 As members of the Economic Community of West African States,
 Ghanaians may travel without visas for up to 90 days in member
 states. Ghanaians are generally free to exercise this right,
 and nationals of other member states are free to travel to
 Ghana. Ghanaians are also free to emigrate or to be
 repatriated from other countries.
 In what appeared to be deliberate harassment, the deputy
 national secretary of the MFJ, upon his return from a trip.
 abroad, was interrogated for several hours, searched, and had
 some of his possessions confiscated. He was told to report to
 the Bureau of National Investigation, the equivalent of the U.
 S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, the next day. When he did
 so, his possessions were returned, and he received an apology.
 Since the last half of 1990, Ghana has been faced with a
 growing refugee population. Liberians fleeing civil war began
 
 
 GHANA"
 to arrive in August 1990. By November 1990, Ghana was hosting
 some 8,000"Liberian refugees. Most of the new refugee
 population, as well as many transiting third-country nationals
 who also fled Liberia, were housed in a United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and government-assisted camp
 20 kilometers outside of Accra. An undetermined number of
 refugees have spontaneously returned to Liberia since then. By
 August 1991, the estimated camp population was 3,000 to 4,000.
 In addition, over 15,000 Ghanaians who resided in Liberia
 returned to their home villages in Ghana, often imposing great
 strain on government social services. Prior to the influx of
 Liberians, Ghana was hosting approximately 150 refugees
 registered with the UNHCR.
 In December 1991, some 1,500 to 2,000 Togolese fled
 disturbances in Lome and entered Ghana. However, by the end of
 the year most had voluntarily returned to Togo.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have this right. Chairman Rawlings and the
 PNDC exercise total executive, legislative, and administrative
 power. However, in January ChairmanoRawlihgs announced that
 the PNDC had entered its last phase, and the country would have
 a new constitution by the end of the year. In August, at the
 inauguration of the Consultative Assembly, he announced that if
 the Assembly finished its work in debating and preparing a new
 constitution by December 31, the constitutional referendum
 would be held in February or March.
 The Consultative Assembly, composed of 260 members--117 elected
 by the district assemblies, 121 elected by organizations, and
 22 appointed by the PNDC-was not able to complete its work by
 year's end, in part due to administrative problems and the need
 for Assembly members to consult with constituents. As a
 result, the referendum was rescheduled for April to be followed
 2 weeks later by the lifting of the ban on political parties.
 According to the PNDC timetable, presidential, and parliamentary
 elections would still be held by the end of 1992, with
 international observers invited to attend.
 A key step in 1991 was the passage of a law establishing an
 independent electoral commission to replace the PNDC-controlled
 National Commission on Democracy. The law established the
 requisite de jure independence for the commission; however, it
 remains to be seen whether the PNDC will appoint commissioners
 of the necessary stature, integrity, and neutrality to provide
 de facto independence.
 There has been heavy criticism of the PNDC control over the
 transition process, including its method of selecting members
 for the Consultative Assembly, e.g., allegedly for favoring
 groups with PNDC sympathies. However, the Assembly seems to be
 operating as an independent body, and the PNDC has made no
 effort to influence its deliberations, even when the Assembly
 challenges established PNDC policy.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 An organization called the Ghana Committee on Human and
 People's Rights was formed in October. Several other
 organizations--most notably the Ghana Bar Association and the
 
 
 156
 GHANA
 MFJ-have attempted to address human rights issues from time to
 time. The Government's reactions to these efforts have ranged
 from indifference to active discouragement. In 1991 the PNDC
 invited Amnesty International (AI) to visit Ghana to discuss
 alleged inaccuracies in an AI report. The Government permits
 prison visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although ethnic differences are intentionally played down by
 the Government, opponents of the PNDC occasionally complain
 that the PNDC and the political leadership are dominated by the
 Ewe ethnic group from eastern Ghana. Chairman Rawlings and a
 number of his close advisors are Ewe, but many PNDC members and
 secretaries are from other ethnic groups.
 The Government has made concerted efforts to raise the status
 of women, but Ghanaian women remain subject to some forms of
 societal discrimination. In 1985 the PNDC promulgated four
 laws which overturned many of the customary, traditional, and
 colonial laws which discriminated against women. These
 concerned family accountability, intestate succession,
 customary divorce registrations, and the administration of
 estates. Women in urban centers and those who have entered the
 modern sector encounter little overt bias, but resistance to
 women in nontraditional roles persists. Women in the rural
 agricultural sector remain subject to traditional male
 dominance and heavy field labor. Statistics show a 50/50
 percent male/female ratio in enrollments in grade 1, dropping
 to 66/34 percent by grade 6, 80/20 percent at secondary level,
 and a 90/10 percent at university level.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs, but, as
 there are no statistics or studies available, the extent of the
 problem is unknown. Police do not normally intervene in
 domestic disputes, and such cases seldom come before the
 courts. The Government has not addressed the issue of violence
 against women, but it strongly discourages the practice of
 female circumcision, although it has not made it illegal.
 Female mutilation (e.g., clitoridectomy) is practiced only in
 the far northeastern and northwestern parts of the country.
 Section 6 Worker Rights'
 a. The Right of Association
 This right is restricted as the trade unions' ordinance confers
 broad powers on the Government to refuse to register a trade
 union. However, the PNDC has not interfered with the right of
 workers to associate in labor unions. Civil servants are
 prohibited by law from joining or organizing a trade union.
 Trade unions in Ghana and their activities are still governed
 by the Industrial Relations Act (IRA) of 1965. The Trade Union
 Congress (TUC), established in 1958, represents organized labor
 in Ghana. It has been the sole central organization since its
 creation, when it was closely linked to Nkrumah's Convention
 People's Party. The TUC has been reorganized on a number of
 occasions, including by a pro-PNDC faction following the
 military coup of 1981. In 1984 the progovernment slate was
 defeated in a free election by experienced union leaders who,
 aided by a revised union constitution and bylaws, have sought
 to define an autonomous role for the TUC within the PNDC regime.
 
 
 157
 GHANA
 The right to strike is recognized in law. Under the IRA, the
 Government has established a system of settling disputes, first
 through conciliation, then arbitration. There has been no
 progress, in implementing the Government's declared intention to
 replace this system with labor tribunals to arbitrate
 industrial disputes certified as deadlocked.
 The Committee of Experts (COE) of the International Labor.
 Organization (ILO) and other ILO bodies continue to criticize
 Ghanaian legislation that limits the right of workers to form
 unions of their own choosing.
 The TUC is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity (OATUU), which has its headquarters in Accra.
 Consistent with OATUU guidelines, the TUC maintains no other
 international affiliations, although it has friendly relations
 with a variety of international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The IRA provides a framework for collective bargaining and some
 protection against antiunion discrimination as well. Ghana's
 trade unions engage in collective bargaining for wages and
 benefits with both private and state-owned enterprises, though
 in the latter category the threat of detention (a common
 practice in the early 1980's) hangs over union leaders to force
 agreement on issues. No union leaders were detained in recent
 years for union, or other, activities. There are no
 functioning export processing zones in Ghana.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Ghanaian law prohibits forced labor, and it is not known to be
 practiced. The COE continues to urge the Government to revise
 various legal provisions that permit imprisonment with an
 obligation to perform labor for offenses that are not
 countenanced under ILO Convention 105, ratified by Ghana in
 1958.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Labor legislation in Ghana sets a minimum employment age of 15
 and prohibits night work and certain types of hazardous labor
 for those under 18. In practice, child labor is prevalent, and
 young children of school age can often be found during the day
 performing menial tasks in the market or collecting fares on
 local buses. Observance of minimum age laws is eroded by local
 custom and economic circumstances that encourage children to
 work to help their families. Violators of regulations
 prohibiting heavy labor and night work for children are
 occasionally punished. Inspectors from the Ministry of
 Mobilization and Social Welfare are responsible for enforcement
 of child labor regulations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum stand&rds for wages and working conditions are
 established through a tripartite committee composed of
 representatives of government, labor, and employees. It
 establishes a minimum wage rate, and other salaries are
 adjusted accordingly. In August the tripartite commission
 established a minimum wage combining wages with customary
 benefits, such as a transportation allowance, but the existing
 minimum wage is insufficient for a single wage earner to
 support a family. In most cases households are supporteb by
 
 
 158
 GHANA
 multiple wage earners, some family farming, and other family
 based commercial activities.
 The basic workweek in Ghana is 40 hours. Occupational safety
 and health regulations are in effect, and sanctions are
 occasionally applied through the Labor Department of the
 Ministry of Social Welfare. However, Ministry officials are
 few in number and poorly trained. They will take action if
 matters are called to their attention, but lack the resources
 to seek out violations.
