 SPAIN
 Spain is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional
 monarch, Juan Carlos I. In free and open parliamentary
 elections in October 1989, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was
 elected to a third term.
 The security forces are under the full control of the
 Government. This was last demonstrated in July, when a police
 officer was one of two suspects arrested for the November 1989
 assassination of a Spanish parliamentary deputy associated
 with Herri Batasuna, the political party considered the
 political arm of the violent Basque separatist group ETA
 (Basque Fatherland and Freedom). Another policeman was among
 four additional persons arrested as accomplices in the crime.
 The Spanish economy is mixed, with primary reliance on private
 initiative and market mechanisms. Since Spain joined the
 European Economic Community in 1986, its economy has been the
 fastest growing in Western Europe. Spain continues to
 experience high unemployment, although the jobless rate has
 steadily declined from 21.5 percent in 1985 to 15.3 percent as
 of September 1990. High unemployment is due in part to the
 entry of large numbers of new workers into the labor force and
 disproportionately affects women and youth. Actual
 unemployment is estimated to be considerably lower than the
 Government's figures indicate, due to the existence of
 extensive job opportunities in the underground economy.
 The fundamental rights of speech, assembly, press, religion,
 movement, and participation in the political process are
 provided for in the Constitution of 1978 and are respected in
 practice. The Government signed landmark agreements with the
 country's Jewish and Protestant communities granting the
 faiths the same constitutional status as that enjoyed by the
 Roman Catholic Church.
 In 1990 the principal source of human rights abuses continued
 to be the protracted campaign of terrorism waged by ETA and
 the resurgence of terrorist attacks by the First of October
 Anti-Fascist Group [GRAPO]. The Government continued its
 efforts to bring individual terrorists to justice while
 adhering to democratic standards of due process and civil
 rights. While suspected terrorists arrested and charged with
 crimes frequently asserted that they were abused by police,
 there were no confirmed cases. The Government and the public
 gave increasing attention to the problems of discrimination
 and violence against women and exploitation of the country's
 increasing numbers of illegal immigrants.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were approximately 64 terrorist-related incidents from
 January through September 1990 in which 18 people were killed
 and 89 injured. Of those killed, four were Spanish national
 police, four civil guards, two military personnel, three
 government officials and five civilians. Of the 64 incidents,
 35 were attributed to ETA, 12 to GRAPO, 6 to Terra Lliure, a
 Catalan separatist group, and 1 to a Galician nationalist
 group.

 SPAIN
 The Government held intermittent talks with ETA in Algeria
 during the past several years in an attempt to end the
 violence. These talks broke down in 1989, and ETA terrorism
 continues. Since 1987, there has been increasingly close and
 effective cooperation between the Spanish and French
 Governments in the fight against ETA. This was demonstrated
 in 1990 by the willingness of the French Government to
 extradite several suspected ETA terrorists to Spain, but so
 far no high-ranking ETA leaders have been extradited from
 France. Beginning in late 1989 and extending throughout 1990,
 the terrorist group GRAPO renewed its campaign of bombings and
 assassinations, particularly of military officers. Spanish
 security authorities dealt a serious blow to GRAPO in late
 October 1990 when they arrested 2 of the 6 most wanted members
 of the terrorist organization.
 Two ranking police officers remain in prison awaiting trial on
 charges that they organized a secret antiterrorist death
 squad, the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Group [GAL], which took
 credit for the killings of alleged Spanish Basque terrorists
 in southern France from 1983 to 1986. They were arrested in
 May 1988. The delay in bringing the two policemen to trial is
 not unusual for a criminal case [see Section l.e.]. The law
 provides for imprisonment of up to 2 years before trial. In
 July a judge extended this period of preventive detention for
 another 2 years, citing the gravity of the possible criminal
 sentences that could be imposed in the case.
 b. Disappearance
 Kidnapings for ransom are occasionally carried out by ETA. In
 February a Basque industrialist was released by his ETA
 kidnapers after being held for 84 days. Press reports alleged
 that the industrialist's family paid a ransom of $2.7 million
 for his release. There are no claims that police or
 government security f6rces carried out secret arrests or
 kidnapings.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although detainees charged with terrorism routinely assert
 that they are abused during detention, and similar charges are
 sometimes made by persons arrested for criminal offenses,
 there were no documented instances of police abuse during
 1990. Particularly through its ombudsman-like Office of the
 Defender of the People, the Government actively investigates-
 police officers charged with such abuses and prosecutes-when
 the evidence warrants. An improved police attitude with
 respect to human rights Qver the past several years may be
 attributed to this demonstrated willingness of the Government
 to punish improper police behavior,-as well as to enhanced
 police training and discipline, publicity in the press, and
 concern by the police unions themselves with denunciations of
 police misconduct.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution, a person is free from arbitrary arrest
 and detention, and normally a suspect may not be held more
 than 72 hours without a hearing. The penal code, as reformed
 in 1988, permits a suspected terrorist to be held an
 additional 2 days without a hearing. Exile is not practiced.
 
 
 1268
 SPAIN
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary and the
 right to a fair public trial. This right is observed in
 practice. Defendants have the right to be represented by an
 attorney, at state expense for the indigent. The right to be
 released on bail is guaranteed, unless the court has reason to
 believe a suspect may flee or constitute a serious threat to
 public safety. The law provides for an expeditious judicial
 hearing following arrest. Suspects may not be imprisoned for
 more than 2 years before being brought to trial, unless a
 further delay is authorized by a judge. The period of
 preventive detention may be extended up to 6 years, at the
 judge's discretion. In practice, the delay generally is less
 than 1 year. In cases of petty crime, suspects released on
 bail may face a wait of as long as 5 years before their trial
 comes up. Following conviction, defendants may appeal to the
 next highest court. The European Court of Human Rights is the
 final arbiter in cases concerning human rights.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution protects the privacy of the home and
 correspondence. Under the Criminal Code, government
 authorities must obtain court approval before searching
 private property, wiretapping, or interfering with private
 correspondence. The present antiterrorist law gives
 discretionary authority to the Minister of Interior to act
 prior to obtaining court approval "in cases of emergency."
 There have been no complaints that the Minister has abused
 this authority.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are provided for-in the
 Constitution, and the Government scrupulously observes these
 provisions. Opposition viewpoints, both from political
 parties and other organizations, are freely aired and widely
 reflected in the media. In 1990 three new private commercial
 television stations went on the air. Earlier, the only
 television stations were government owned. Six new dailies
 also have been established, including a major newspaper in
 Madrid.
 The Spanish Parliament has under consideration a change in the
 laws of calumny and offense to honor, which are generally
 applied against media organizations or individual journalists.
 The current law, which many believe to be antiquated or
 unnecessary, allows for fines 4nd jail sentences: The
 proposed law would limit penalties to fines. Few cases
 actually go through the Spanish judiciary; most disputes are
 settled out of court.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 As provided in the Constitution, all groups have the right of
 free assembly and association for political or other purposes.
 This right is fully respected and freely practiced. A permit
 is required of any group wanting to hold a public
 demonstration; permits are routinely granted.

 SPAIN
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Spain. Roman Catholicism is the
 predominant religion, but other religions are represented and
 function with full freedom. Adherence to a particular faith
 neither enhances nor diminishes a person's status.
 In February the Government concluded landmark accords with
 federations of Spanish Jews and Protestants. The accords for
 the first time established religious pluralism within the
 country's constitutional framework. They ended a state of
 official legal discrimination against the two religions, even
 though in practice legal discrimination ended in the 196G's.
 The accords place Protestants and Jews on an equal legal
 footing with Catholics except in the matter of financial
 support from the Government, which-both faiths have
 renounced. The accords spell out a number of concrete rights
 to be accorded to members of the two faiths. For example,
 Protestant and Jewish students now have the right to receive
 religious instruction in public schools, as Catholics do.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Spanish citizens have complete freedom to travel within and
 outside the country. The Government restricts neither
 emigration nor repatriation. The law on aliens permits
 detention of a person for up to 4G days prior to expulsion but
 specifies that the detention may not take place in a prison-
 like setting. Spain has a liberal refugee law. Generally, the
 Government grants refugee status on the recommendation of the
 United Nations High Commissioner- for Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which
 a7lL citizens 18 years of age and over have the right to vote.
 Spaniards elect representatives to. a two-chamber federal
 parriament as well as to- provinciaL and local bodies. At all
 levels of government, elections must be held every 4 years.
 Opposition parties and groups take an active part in the
 political process. Candidates are drawn from four major
 national parties, two major regional parties, and a number of
 minor parties.
 Spanish politics- contain an important regional element which
 is particularly strong in Catalonia and the Basque country.
 These two "autonomous communities" (similar to T-S. states)
 support several regional parties that reflect the desires of
 many Basques and Catalans to give political expression to
 their own linguistic and cultural identities-. These parties
 advocate a variety of views and provide a legitimate
 democratic alternative to separatist groups that advocate
 achieving independence through terrorist violence.
 Participation of women in. the political process continues to
 increase. In 1988 the ruling Spanish Socialist Worker's Party
 (PSOE) instituted a quota system requiring 25 percent of its
 candidates to be women. The number of sucessful women
 candidates increased substantially in Spain's national
 elections in October 1989. However, under Spain's electoral
 system, the percentage of votes won determines the number of
 candidates elected from the party list; hence a candidate's
 place on the list is crucial in determining election. Since
 
 
 1270"
 
 SPAIN
 many women candidates are placed in the lower half of the
 list, the number elected never reaches 25 percent. (Some 17
 percent of PSOE candidates are women).
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Human Rights Association of Spain in Madrid is the largest
 and most respected national human rights organization. The
 Association has a well-earned reputation for independence and
 objectivity. The Human Rights Institute of Catalonia in
 Barcelona offers seminars on resolving human rights issues
 through the country's legal system. The Foreign Ministry,
 through an Office of Human Rights Affairs, takes an active
 interest in human rights issues internationally.
 The Government cooperates readily with international
 organizations investigating allegations of human rights abuses
 (such as the European Commission for the Prevention of
 Torture), with international nongovernmental human rights
 groups, such as Amnesty International and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross, as well as with independent
 national groups.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens,
 and an independent ombudsman actively investigates complaints
 of human rights abuses by the authorities.
 During the past 15 years of democracy, Spanish women have
 achieved a greater degree of equality under the law, gained
 increased access to the educational system, and entered the
 work force in larger numbers. Nonetheless, traditional
 attitudes continue to result in de facto discrimination.
 There is considerable regional variation in the extent of such
 discrimination. Since assuming power in 1982, the PSOE has
 undertaken a number of significant initiatives for women,
 including the establishment of the Women's Institute in 1983,
 which actively attempts to promote social, political, and
 economic equality.   In 1988 Parliament adopted a Plan for
 Equality of Opportunities for Women which targets several
 areas of concern. Although one-third more women (mainly those
 younger than 29 years old) work outside the home than 10 years
 ago, the frequency of such employment in Spain still ranks
 among the lowest in Europe. Women have a relatively low, but
 increasing, rate ,of affiliation with the major labor unions.
 The Government has targeted sexual abuse, violence, and
 harassment of women in the workplace as areas of great
 concern. The majority of cases are probably not reported,
 owing in part to unsympathetic attitudes on the part of some
 police and judicial personnel. However, the number of
 reported cases has contihued to grow in recent years, possibly
 indicating an increased awareness among Spanish women of their
 right to seek legal redress. In 1989-Parliament passed a law
 prohibiting verbal and physical harassment in the workplace.
 Several levels of government provide a number of institutional
 remedies, such as shelters for battered women. The Government
 also is attempting through educational programs to change
 public attitudes that contribute to violence against women.
 The Women's Institute has charged that some judges are
 
 
 1271
 
 SPAIN
 reluctant to get involved in what they feel should remain a
 domestic problem. Similarly, in smaller towns some police
 officers have been reluctant to accept complaints from
 battered women. To deal with this problem, the Ministry of
 the Interior initiated a program in 1986 that created special
 sections within police departments to deal with violence
 against women, staffed by specially trained women officers.
 Gypsies are a minority group representing 3 percent of the
 Spanish population. Despite their constitutional rights, they
 continue to suffer de facto discrimination in housing,
 schools, and jobs. Legal mechanisms exist by which Gypsies
 can seek redress, and the Government has stated its commitment
 to securing equal rights and treatment for Gypsies. A
 representative of the Gypsy'community serves as special
 advisor to the Minister of Interior.
 In 1990 Spain's human rights groups and media gave increasing
 attention to the question of human rights for the country's
 growing numbers of illegal immigrants. A large portion of the
 illegal immigrants come from north and sub-Saharan Africa and
 are vulnerable to racial discrimination or economic
 exploitation by employers.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers, except those in the military services, judges,
 magistrates, and prosecutors, are entitled to form or join
 unions of their own choosing without previous authorization.
 The only requisites for organizing a union are the formation
 of a group of more than two workers and registration with the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Security, which is routinely
 granted. Spain has over 200 registered trade unions. The
 only union presently in existence that is not legally
 registered is the Unified Trade Union of the Guardia Civil
 (SUGC), which the Constitutional Court ruled' in 1986 could not
 be registered since it purports to- represent military
 personnel barred from unionization by the Constitution.
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to choose their
 own representatives, determine their own policies, represent
 their members' interests, and strike. They are not restricted
 or harassed by the Government. A strike in nonessential
 services is legal when it fulfills the requirement of .5 days'
 prior notice. Strikes affecting essential services require la
 days' prior notice and must respect legal minimum service
 requirements, which are negotiated between the Government and
 the unions. Strikes occur frequently in Spain, although most
 are of short duration. In a key court case in June, a
 magistrate declared a strike illegal for the first time since
 current legislation was enacted, and imposed a $500,000 fine.
 He ruled that the union was seeking a further wage increase
 for its members after one had already been granted by the
 company to all workers. This case-has been appealed to the
 Supreme Court.
 Spanish unions are free to form or join federations,
 confederations, and international bodies. Two major unions,
 the General Workers Union and the Basque Solidarity Union
 (ELA/STV) are members of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions and the European Trade Union Confederation.
 ELA/STV and the Workers' Tradb Union Confederation (USO) are
 also members of the World Confederation of Labor.
 
 
 1272
 SPAIN
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively was established
 by statute in 1980. Trade union and collective bargaining
 rights were extended to all workers in the public sector,
 except the military services, in 1986. Public sector
 collective bargaining in 1990 was broadened to include
 salaries and employment levels. Collective bargaining is
 widespread in both the private and public sectors. Sixty
 percent of the working population is covered by private sector
 collective bargaining agreements, although only a minority are
 actually union members. The Government has engaged the two
 major trade unions in a social dialogue since December 1989,
 which led to several agreements in early 1990 affecting public
 service salaries, pensions, control of work contracts, and the
 minimum wage.   Labor regulations and practices in free trade
 zones and export processing zones are the same as in the rest
 of the country. Union membership in these zones is reportedly
 higher than the average throughout the economy.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union
 members and organizers. Discrimination cases have priority in
 the labor courts. One practice which the unions consider
 discriminatory is the use by employers of temporary employment
 contracts. Around 30 percent of the work force is employed
 under this type of contract. The unions believe that
 employees engaging in union organizing under this type of
 contract are frequently not allowed to renew their contracts.
 In 1990 draft legislation was introduced in Parliament to
 provide trade union control over work contracts to prevent
 abuse of contract and termination actions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is outlawed in Spain and is not
 practiced. Legislation is effectively enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age for employment as established by statute
 is 16 years. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security is
 primarily responsible for enforcement. The minimum age is
 effectively enforced in major industries and in, the service
 sector. It is more difficult to control on small farms and in
 family-owned businesses. Legislation prohibiting child labor
 is effectively enforced in the special economic zones. The
 employment of persons under 18 years of age at night, for
 overtime work, or in sectors considered hazardous by the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the unions is also
 legally prohibited.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Workers in general have substantial, well-defined rights. A
 40-hour workweek is established by law. Spanish workers enjoy
 12 paid holidays a year and a month's paid vacation. All
 workers receive 12 monthly paychecks a year plus 2 bonus
 checks equivalent to an additional 2 months' base salary. The
 legal minimum wage for workers over age 18 is 14 "monthly"
 paychecks amounting to $6,751 a year, which is considered
 sufficient for a decent standard Qf living. Minimum wages for
 those aged 16 and 17 are less. The minimum wage rate is
 -;'--ed every year in accordance with the consumer price index.
 
 
 1273
 SPAIN
 Government mechanisms exist for enforcing working conditions
 and occupational health and safety conditions, but
 bureaucratic procedures are cumbersome and inefficient.
 Safety and health legislation is being revised to conform to
 European Community directives.
 The National Institute of Safety and Health within the
 Ministry of Labor has technical responsibility for developing
 safety standards, but the Inspectorate of Labor has
 responsibility for enforcing the legislation through judicial
 action when infractions are found. Workers have legal
 protection for filing complaints about hazardous conditions.
 Work-related accidents increased from 41,449 in 1986 to
 651,677 in 1989. The Government is preparing new legislation
 aimed at reducing accidents in the workplace.
