 BURKINA FASO
 Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world and
 a victim of frequent drought and political instability. In
 August 1983, Captain Thomas Sankara took power in the
 country's third military coup since 1980. Sankara is the
 President of Burkina Faso and of the National Council of the
 Revolution which appoints the Council of Ministers, Burkina's
 main forum for ongoing political decisions. In 1984, to
 emphasize its revolutionary break with the past, the
 Government changed the country's name from Upper Volta to
 Burkina Faso.
 Political parties have been permitted since 1980, and there
 are no indications that the country will return to
 constitutional rule. Instead, the Government is using a
 growing netw6rk of Committees for the Defense of the
 Revolution (CDR), organized at national, regional, ar)d local
 levels to mobilize the population and promote its
 revolutionary goals. The national leadership of these
 committees is appointed by the Government, and it conducts
 elections to select local committee leaders.
 Burkina Faso is overwhelmingly tied to subsistence agriculture
 with 90 percent of the population living in rural areas. The
 economy is highly vulnerable to fluctations in rainfall.
 Drought, lack of communications and other infrastructure, a
 low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy are all
 long-standing problems.
 There was little net change in the human rights situation in
 Burkina Faso in 1985 from 1984. There have been arbitrary
 arrests and brief detentions without trial or charges of labor
 leaders, potential political opponents, and others suspected
 of being hostile to the regime. The Government continued to
 conduct trials of former government and political leaders,
 almost exclusively on fraud and corruption charges, outside
 the traditional judicial system in Peoples Revolutionary
 Courts where defendants had no recourse to legal counsel.
 After explosions of two munitions dumps in May and June
 (allegedly sabotage), there were allegations of torture and
 there was one admitted death among those detained. The
 Government continued to dismiss or retire civil servants,
 military and police accused of lack of enthusiasm for the
 revolution and for reasons ranging from misconduct to
 laziness. Freedom of speech, assembly, and publication was
 effectively prevented by fear of loss of jobs by government
 workers, the largest work force in the country, and by the
 absence of an independent press. At the same time, government
 initiatives, such as the anticorruption drive being pursued
 through the People's Revolutionary Courts, responded to
 long-standing abuses and enjoyed popular support. The
 Government was increasingly sensitive to criticisms of human
 rights abuses in Burkina Faso by international human rights
 organizations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrityof the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political Killing
 Following explosions at munitions dumps near Ouagadougou and
 Bobo-Dioulasso in June 1985, the Government detained a number
 
 
 28
 BURKINA FASO
 of persons, at least one of whom subsequently died in a
 hospital immediately after the attack. The Government stated
 that the person had died from exhaustion and other health
 problems, but the death probably resulted from mistreatment by
 security agents. The Government has stated that there will be
 no executions of these detainees without public trial.
 Amnesty International, however, estimated that as many as 10
 persons (2 of whom later emerged alive) suspected of sabotage
 had been killed by government agencies, many by torture.
 Another Western Embassy claimed to have corroborative evidence
 indicating that several of the detainees were delivered to the
 hospital with indications of torture. In general, the
 Government appears in overall control of army, police, and
 security forces.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances during 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were reports of torture being inflicted on prisoners
 following the munitions dump explosions of June 1985. Amnesty
 International claimed that at least 100 persons had been
 arrested, at least 1 and as many as 10 tortured to death, and
 others subjected to electric shock, sexual abuse, and burning
 with blow torches. On August 6, the Government denied reports
 of torture and presented eight detainees to the press; all
 seemed in good health. Two of these persons were among the 10
 which Amnesty had listed as possibly tortured to death.
 These reports marked a departure from previous years when
 there had been no reports of torture or of cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading punishment. The material poverty of the country
 contributes to poor prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Reports of arbitrary arrest followed by detention for as much
 as four or five days without charges have continued. Several
 prominent intellectuals, military officers, and former
 government officials remain in self-imposed exile. Habeas
 corpus does not exist in Burkina Faso. Laws permitting
 preventive detention for a maximum of 72 hours, renewable one
 time in criminal cases, are followed in practice, but with a
 number of violations for both Burkinabe and foreign
 nationals. At least three leading trade union officials
 remained in custody throughout 1985, and other labor officials
 were detained for varying periods of time.
 On August 4, Burkina Faso's national day, President Sankara
 amnestied 54 prisoners, many of them common criminals, and
 reduced sentences of 41 others, several of them former senior
 officials, including a former president and a former president
 of the National Assembly. Former president Jean-Baptiste
 Ouedraogo, whose regime Sankara toppled, was released but
 remains under surveillance.
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the labor code.

 BURKINA FASO
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 During 1985, the People's Revolutionary Courts, created in
 late 1983 with jurisdiction over state security and political
 crimes, heard cases primarily involving public corruption.
 The Court president is a, magistrate appointed by the
 Government to head the tribunal which is composed of
 magistrates, military personnel, and members of the Committees
 for the Defense of the Revolution. The court president
 follows the practice of asking questions directly of the
 defendant. There is no role for a public prosecutor, and the
 accused has no right to consult counsel during the session.
 Witnesses can be called by the Court or they can present
 themselves to give testimony.
 President Sankara has said these. People's Courts should be
 viewed as a permanent part of the country's judicial system.
 During 1985, the Government began organizing a series of
 similar tribunals starting with conciliatory bodies at the
 village level and higher bodies at department and province
 levels to hear minor cases. The Government's oft-stated aim
 is to ensure that European-imposed judicial procedures do not
 deny fair access to justice for an overwhelmingly illiterate,
 impoverished population. Meanwhile, the traditionally
 independent judiciary has.continued to function for criminal
 and civil cases. The supreme court, abolished in March 1984,
 has been replaced by..two high appeals courts for public and
 private criminal and civil cases, in accordance with French
 judicial practice. The defendant traditionally receives a
 fair trial and is represented by counsel.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government authorities are not known to interfere in the
 privacy, family, home, or correspondence of ordinary
 citizens. Homes may be searched under a warrant issued by the
 attorney general, a procedure generally followed in practice.
 There is no regular monitoring of private correspondence or
 telephones. However, a special law permits surveillance,
 search, detention, and monitoring of telephones and
 correspondence without warrant in national security cases.
 This law has been used against individuals suspected of
 participation in coup plots.
 The Government encourages participation in the Committees for
 the Defense of the Revolution (CDR). There is little pressure
 on private citizens to join these committees or discrimination
 against those who choose not to participate. However,
 vigorous participation'in CDR activities helps in obtaining
 civil service appointments and promotions. The Government
 considers opposition to activities of the CDRS to be political
 opposition, which can lead in serious cases to such measures
 as discharge from the civil service.
 International radio broadcasts are not jammed. A government
 practice having great impact on family life is arbitrary
 dismissal of government personnel, military, civil servants,
 police, teachers, for primarily political reasons. These
 individuals must search in the underdeveloped private sector
 for further gainful employment or remain dependent on their
 families. The number of such dismissals in 1985 was
 significantly lower than in 1984.

 BURKINA FASO
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While there is no formal government mechanism for censorship,
 the high pitch of revolutionary rhetoric, with its frequent
 references to enemies of the state at home and abroad,
 inhibited both government-employed journalists and ordinary
 citizens from taking advantage of their theoretical right to
 express critical views. The same inhibition, further
 stimulated by the frequency of sudden dismissals from
 government service and by reports of arbitrary arrests,
 continued to dampen a lively tradition of debate on politic-al
 topics. In October 1985, the Government announced that those
 dismissed from government service could apply for
 reinstatement, provided they maintain an acceptable political
 attitude.
 The media in Burkina are now entirely government-owned,
 consisting of a daily newspaper, a weekly magazine, and a
 government-operated radio/television station. There has not
 been a single case of criticism of the Government in the
 media, which are charged with carrying official news to the
 people while defending the revolution. The Government
 maintains that the daily Sidwaya is free to print criticism
 and independent judgments. A mid-1985 reorganization of all
 government media placed the Minister of Information and
 Culture in direct control of the media, giving the Government
 a direct means to shape or control media output as desired.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines continue to enter the country
 freely. Foreign journalists and local representatives to
 foreign press organizations travel and file stories without
 censorship or hindrance and enjoy easy access to government
 officials up to and including the President. There are no
 formal limitations on academic freedom.  University
 professors and administrators, however, have been criticized
 for "elitism" and dismissed for alleged counterrevolutionary
 tendencies. University students are now subject to political
 education. The major student organization is dominated by a
 left-wing group, aligned with Albania, which regards the
 present regime as insufficiently revolutionary. In the arts,
 movies are subject to censorship by a review board which
 includes religious authorities as well as government officials.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are banned, and administrative permission is
 generally required for assemblies of any kind. During 1985,
 there was little effort by opposition groups to organize
 meetings.
 Organized labor, which continues to be an important feature of
 the political scene, has been under increasing government
 pressure and has jurisdictional conflicts with Committees for
 the Defense of the Revolution. Four labor federations and a
 number of autonomous unions exist. They range in orientation
 from two moderate federations, traditionally unrestricted in
 their adversarial relationship with the Government, to a much
 more radical federation of civil service local unions. To
 counter the latter, a new union of government employees was
 formed in 1985. One federation is affiliated with the
 Government, a second with the Christian-oriented World
 Confederation of Labor, a third with the democratic
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and a fourth
 with the World Federation of Trade Unions.
 
 
 31
 BURKINA FASO
 The right to strike was formally restored in early 1983, but
 in its only test thus far, the Government charged that the
 independent primary school teachers union strike of March 1984
 was illegally organized and politically motivated, and broke
 it by firing the strikers, nearly half the union's 6000
 members. An amnesty was extended to the fired teachers in
 August 1985, but the two teachers' union leaders still remain
 in detention. In January 1985, the Government imprisoned
 Marxist trade union leader Soumane Toure after he denounced
 government austerity measures and accused the Government of
 corruption. He remains in detention and has reportedly been
 ill. On January 28, 11 union leaders, primarily from the
 left-wing unions, signed a petition criticizing the
 Government. The Sankara Government immediately suspended them
 from their government jobs, and an unknown number were
 detained for a time. Despite the Government's tightening
 stance, there were no indications that existing labor
 organizations would be brought under government control or
 replaced by a state labor federation. President Sankara has
 stated he wishes to maintain a dialogue with all Burkinabe
 trade unions. In February, the President indicated
 willingness to work with moderate union leaders, and in May
 apparently reached an understanding with the more radical
 unions. In any event, attacks by gangs on six union central
 offices during a confused melee on May 1 have not been
 repeated. Unions have continued to exercise their rights to
 hold conferences, train workers, and attend international
 congresses.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burkina Faso is a secular state, and there is no
 discrimination on religious grounds. Islam and Christianity
 exist side by side, with about 25 percent of the population
 Muslim and 10 percent Christian. Both Muslim and Christian
 holidays are recognized as national holidays. Social mobility
 and access to modern sector jobs are neither linked to, nor
 restricted by, religious affiliations.
 The leader of the Jesuits in Burkina Faso, a Frenchman, was
 detained for four days in March, apparently for delivering a
 sermon which the Government found offensive. He was not
 formally charged.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government lifted a strictly enforced curfew in August
 1985. However, travelers within Burkina Faso are often
 stopped at police, Army, and internal customs checkpoints.
 Moreover, armed CDR units maintain numerous checkpoints
 between 1 am and 5 am. Foreign travel for business and
 tourism is not restricted. Exit permits, once required to
 limit movement of workers to the neighboring
 countries--particularly to the Ivory Coast, where one million
 or more Burkinabe continue to reside and work--are no longer
 required. Refugees are accepted freely in Burkina Faso and
 attempts are made to provide for their care in cooperation
 with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 President Thomas Sankara rules in the name of the National
 Council of the Revolution, the composition of which has never
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 been disclosed. There is neither a legislative body nor any
 recognized political opposition group. In consultation with
 the National Council of the Revolution, Sankara appoints his
 cabinet, which currently consists of 21 posts, 4 held by
 military personnel and the rest by civilians, including 3
 women. Cabinet ministers include individuals known to be
 affiliated with several apparently antagonistic groups, such
 as the Union of Communist Struggle and the Patriotic League
 for Development. The Government has not given any hint of
 plans for elections or a return to constitutional government.
 The Government is using Committees for the Defense of the
 Revolution to consolidate power and to allow for a limited
 measure of public participation. These committees are charged
 with various tasks, including the oversight of administrative
 affairs at the local level. In practice, the Government
 exercises tight control over the committees.
 Minority ethnic groups are as likely to be represented in the
 inner circles of the Government as are the dominant Mossi, who
 comprise 50 percent of the population. Government decisions
 do not favor one ethnic group over another. One announced
 reason for the increase in administrative regions from 11 to
 30 since the August 1983 coup was to improve access of
 minority groups to local administrative authorities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A government-supported organization lobbies against apartheid
 and other racial oppression. The Government was clearly upset
 by foreign criticism of its detentions following the June 1985
 munitions dump explosion. The Government has made no attempt
 to restrict or hinder the activities of international human
 rights organizations. In its 1985 Report (covering 1984),
 Amnesty International expressed concern over the imprisonment
 of three prisoners of conscience for trade union activities
 and the reported detention without trial of suspected
 opponents of the Government. Freedom House rated Burkina Faso
 as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Burkina Faso's population is 6.9 million and is growing at the
 rate of 2.7 percent annually. Gross national product per
 capita per annum was only $180 in 1983. Living standards are
 generally higher in the few urban centers than in the
 countryside. Population pressure is somewhat ameliorated by
 large-scale annual migrations to neighboring countries for
 seasonal agricultural work.
 The infant mortality rate is 176 deaths per 1,000 live
 births. Life expectancy at birth is 45 years. The primary
 causes of death are malaria, gastronintestinal infections, and
 parasitic diseases. Approximately 25 percent of the
 population has access to safe water, with a disproportionate
 number of those people being in urban areas. The literacy
 rate is estimated at 9 percent, with only 24 percent of
 primary school age children enrolled, 30 percent of the males
 and 16 percent of the females.
 The labor code sets the minimum age for employment at 14, the
 age of most students upon completion of basic secondary
 school. However, the Government lacks the means to enforce
 
 
 33
 BURKINA FASO
 adequately this provision, owing to a very low per capita
 income, large number of small family enterprises, and the
 traditional apprenticeship system. A minimum monthly wage of
 about $50 and a maximum work week of 48 hours are stipulated
 by the labor code, as are safety and health provisions within
 the capabilities of the country's relatively small
 nonagricultural sector. A system of government inspections
 and labor courts ensures that these provisions are applied in
 the industrial and commercial sectors, but they have been
 impossible to enforce in the dominant subsistence agriculture
 sector.
 The role of women in Burkina Faso is still limited by the
 cultural orientation of a rural society. The current
 Government has emphasized its strong commitment to expanding
 opportunities for women, including educational opportunities.
 The Ministry of Family Progress, for example, works to promote
 greater participation by women in the nation's economic,
 social, and political life. In addition to the three women
 ministers in the current cabinet, women have been appointed
 high commissioners in several provinces and magistrates in the
 judicial system.
