 ALGERIA
 Algeria's central historic experience was its long and
 bitter struggle for independence from 1954 to 1962. Its
 single political party and highly centralized-government
 are legacies of that struggle. While there is consider-
 able airing of popular aspirations and grievances within
 party organizations and elected assemblies, most important
 decisions are taken by the government and party leadership.
 There is little freedom to deviate from the path pre-
 scribed by the ruling authorities.
 Algeria's constitution guarantees basic human rights, and
 civil courts are generally independent of executive or
 military control. Torture, cruel and inhumane punishment,
 disappearances, arbitrary arrests and trials and inva-
 sion of the home are not general or significant problems.
 The military security forces, which deal with military
 offenses, internal security and national security,
 operate under fewer actual restrictions than the civilian
 system of justice, and occasionally allegations have been
 made of abuses of their power. Since the election of
 President Bendjedid in 1979, all known political pris-
 oners have been released.
 Civil and political liberties in Algeria are limited.
 The government controls or monitors all the media. Some
 criticism of policies is allowed and many economic and
 social problems are discussed frankly. Limited political
 opposition, e.g., student demonstrations, is tolerated.
 The current government has significantly facilitated
 travel abroad.
 Vital economic needs are being met. Health care is free
 and widely available. The government has given greater
 priority to consumer needs, e.g., housing and food pro-
 duction, in its recent planning, but progress is slow.
 The status of women is improving; 10 women have been
 elected to the national popular assembly, and a woman
 serves in the cabinet. However, traditional practice
 may prevent women from fully exercising their legal
 rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Articles 48 and 71 of the constitution prohibit torture.
 So far as is known, this legal prohibition is respected
 in practice, although there are allegations of abuse.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although punishment for crimes against security may be
 severe and include the death penalty or life imprison-
 ment, there are no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrad-
 ing treatment. In the past, death sentences usually have
 (9M9)
 
 
 930
 been commuted to life imprisonment. In several instances,
 those with commuted sentences have been released later.
 Prison conditions vary from primitive to modern. In the
 primary civil prison in Algiers (el-Harrach), prisoners
 are crowded into cells and sanitary conditions are poor.
 Better conditions are found in some smaller outlying
 prisons and jails. All prisons have medical facilities,
 and each prison has a contract with a local doctor who
 visits the prison regularly to treat ill prisoners.
 Prisoners who are seriously ill may be transferred to
 local hospitals. Prison diet is rarely adequate, and
 the prisoners' families often provide much of their food.
 Families are allowed to visit prisoners, and in some
 cases, conjugal visits are permitted at the discretion
 of local prison authorities. Although prisoners con-
 victed of civil crimes are quartered apart from those
 convicted for such crimes as terrorism, the treatment
 is generally similar.
 Attorneys are allowed regular access to their clients.
 Their meetings take place under the visual supervision
 of a guard. The International Committee of the Red
 Cross does not have access to detainees or prisoners.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no reports that persons have disappeared in
 recent years.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution of November 19, 1976, holds that no one
 can be prosecuted, arrested or held, except in cases
 provided for by law. It also provides that detention
 for questioning in criminal investigation cases cannot
 exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect must be charged
 or released. The urban police and the more rurally-
 oriented gendarmerie generally adhere to this constitu-
 tional requirement. Military security forces (SM),
 however, operate under fewer actual restrictions and
 have been known to hold suspects up to a month before
 releasing or charging them. SM is authorized to investi-
 gate not only military offenses but also cases involving
 internal security and foreign intelligence collection.
 It may also investigate civil crimes that ordinarily
 would be under police jurisdiction.
 Once charged, an individual can be held under preventive
 detention while his case is being investigated. Given
 the crowded court dockets and number of cases under in-,
 vestigation, this period of preventive detention can
 last many months.
 All political prisoners apparently have been released
 since President Bendjedid took office in February 1979.
 Pre-independence Algerian political leaders, such as
 Ferhat Abbas and Ben Youcef Benkhedda, who had been
 placed under house arrest in 1975 for criticizing the
 
 
 931
 regime, were released shortly after President Bendjedid
 came to power. Ahmed Ben Bella, a former president, was
 released from prison in July 1979, but remained re-
 stricted to the province of M'Sila until November 1, 1980,
 when all remaining restrictions were lifted.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants have free access to counsel, and there is no
 harassment of defense counsel by the government. As far
 as is known, defendants are made fully aware of the
 charges against them at the time they are bound over for
 trial. Trials are public, and defendants have the right
 of appeal. The judicial system is divided into three
 parts: civil courts, military courts, and state security
 courts. The civil courts are generally independent of
 executive or military control. Military courts deal
 directly with offenses committed by military personnel,
 such as absence without leave and theft, and also with
 espionage. The National Security Court at Medea meets
 for important cases of national security and generally
 provides due process similar to that of civilian courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed by the constitu-
 tion and generally is honored in practice. With the
 exception of the SM, police forces may not enter a house
 without a warrant from the local prosecutor or investi-
 gating magistrate. In addition, police and other
 security forces may not enter a residence during night
 hours. There have been occasions, however, when SM has
 made unauthorized searches and seizures. It is not
 known whether the SM personnel involved have been
 disciplined.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Although the constitution guarantees freedom of expres-
 sion and assembly, it states that they may not be used
 to undermine the foundation of the socialist revolution.
 All of the printed and electronic media, including
 foreign publications, are controlled or monitored by the
 government. Foreign newspapers and magazines are avail-
 able to a limited extent, but certain issues have been
 seized. The French language weekly "Jeune Afrique" is
 proscribed. Many economic and social problems are
 frankly discussed in the government-controlled media,
 and government policies are criticized without naming
 individuals.
 Although by law an Islamic country, Algeria protects the
 rights of the small Christian and Jewish minorities. On
 several occasions, the government has intervened to
 prevent desecration of Christian and Jewish cemeteries
 and places of worship.
 
 
 932
 An increasing problem for the authorities has been the
 willingness of certain Muslim fundamentalist groups to
 resort to violence to impose their views on other ele-
 ments of the population.
 The government has a continuing problem of reconciling
 its policy of developing the identity of Algeria as an
 Arab nation with the desires of the large Berber minority,
 15 percent of the populace, to preserve its own culture
 and language and to retain French as a language of edu-
 cation and work. This conflict has sometimes resulted in
 clashes between Berbers and security forces. The govern-
 ment has remained firm in its policy of making Arabic,
 instead of French, the language of education. In the
 spring of 1981 there were renewed demonstrations and a
 general strike in the Berber Kabyle region calling for
 official measures to promote Berber culture. Similar pro-
 tests planned for the fall did not materialize after the
 government announced that Berber could be studied as an
 academic subject in the major universities.
 While there generally are no legal impediments to freedom
 of assembly, there is only one legal political party and
 one umbrella labor union, the General Union of Algerian
 Workers (UGTA). These and other party- or government-
 sponsored *mass organizations" for youth, women, farmers
 and veterans are the primary recognized associations in
 Algeria. Security personnel watch public gatherings
 closely. Limited political opposition, such as student
 demonstrations, is tolerated and political tracts of
 opposition groups are circulated with almost certain knowl-
 edge of the government. In addition, workers have suc-
 cessfully used strikes, without the sanction of the
 national union, to win more pay and benefits.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate
 is guaranteed by law and generally is respected in prac-
 tice. One of the first acts of the Bendjedid government
 was to remove the exit visa requirement for Algerians
 travelling abroad. The amount of hard currency which
 Algerians may carry abroad has been doubled, but remains
 the primary limitation on foreign travel. These changes
 have resulted in significantly increased Algerian travel
 abroad. The Algerian and French governments have agreed
 on a series of measures, such as special benefits, to
 encourage some of the many Algerian workers in France
 voluntarily to return to Algeria. Except for foreign
 diplomats, who must apply for permission to travel
 farther than 50 kilometers from Algiers, travel within
 Algeria is generally unrestricted.
 A special problem are those Algerians (Harkis) who fought
 on the French side during the war for independence and
 have since resided in France. The Algerian government has
 begun to permit them to return to Algeria, but on condi-
 tion they not return to their towns of previous residence
 (where they could be in physical danger).
 
 
 933
 The constitution provides for the right of political asylum.
 According to estimates of international experts, there are
 up to 120,000 refugees in camps near Tindouf. However,
 since there has been no impartial census of this population,
 it is not known what proportion may have come from the
 Western Sahara and what proportion from the surrounding
 countries. There also are several thousand refugees around
 Tamanrasset in southern Algeria, mostly from Mali and
 Niger, who left those countries at the time of the Sahel
 drought. The government contributes to the support of all
 of these refugees, as does the United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Refugees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political process is largely confined
 to the single party, and there is little freedom to deviate
 significantly from the path prescribed by ruling authori-
 ties. While fundamental policy options are not questioned,
 there is considerable airing of popular aspirations and
 grievances within the party organization and within the
 elected assemblies which exist at national and local levels.
 The status of women in Algeria is improving. Women are
 legally equal to men, but traditional practice may prevent
 them from fully exercising their legal rights. Although
 the great majority of Algerian women remain in traditional
 roles, their participation in public life is growing. Ten
 women have been elected to the popular national assembly
 (which has a membership of 261), two are members of the
 central committee of the FLN party, several women have
 been elected to the council of the national committee of
 the party and a woman has recently been appointed to the
 cabinet. Women also serve in the armed forces.
 An effort has been made to close the gap separating women
 from men in equality of educational opportunity. Accord-
 ing to government statistics, 62 percent of all school-
 age girls were enrolled in 1980, compared with 39 percent
 in 1965. In 1979, about 40 percent of all students were
 female. Several university faculties, e.g. medicine and
 law, now enroll roughly equal numbers of men and women.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government has not allowed foreign or international
 organizations to visit Algeria to investigate alleged
 violations of human rights. With the release of former
 President Ben Bella and other political prisoners, the
 government has responded to a major criticism leveled
 against it by such organizations as Amnesty International.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Algerian economic life is shaped by adherence to the
 government's conception of Islamic socialism, the departure
 ot most skilled Europeans after independence in 1962,
 and large revenues from oil and gas sales.
 
 
 934
 The Algerian economy is largely socialist, with the main
 economic sectors in the hands of state-owned companies.
 However, in recent years there has been increasing recog-
 nition that the private sector has an important contribu-
 tion to make to economic development and prosperity. The
 tax system is highly progressive. An estimated 3.2
 percent annual population increase, a fertility rate of
 7 (1979), and a concentration of investment in industry
 have made it difficult to meet food and social needs and
 provide full employment. However, minimum vital needs
 are being met. The national popular assembly adopted a
 five-year plan (1980-1984) on November 10, 1980 which
 gives greater priority to fulfillment of social needs,
 such as housing and health care. Per capita gross na-
 tional product (GNP) was $1935 in 1980; about one-half of
 GNP is consumed and the other half is invested. This
 high rate of investment reflects a conscious government
 policy of maintaining a certain degree of austerity at the
 present time, in the interest of rapid development to pro-
 vide for future generations. The rate of real growth in
 1980 was 5 percent. According to recent estimates about
 13 percent of non-agricultural workers are unemployed and
 20 percent of the urban population is below the absolute
 poverty level.
 The government controls most food supplies. One-third of
 the nation's food must be imported because of insufficient
 agricultural production. While food supplies are adequate
 (the ratio of calorie supply available for consumption
 relative to nutritional requirements was 99 in 1977), the
 cost is high and distribution is irregular. A special
 program established in the spring of 1980 to alleviate
 this problem through increased imports has somewhat im-
 proved the situation. The five-year plan provides for
 revitalization of agriculture through greater investment
 and a degree of liberalization.
 Housing is in extremely short supply because of the high
 birth rate and an accelerated flight from the countryside
 to the cities. The situation has become much worse since
 1970, when an estimate put the average number of persons
 per room in urban areas at 2.8. Efforts to correct the
 shortage are under way. Legislation approved in 1981
 permits occupants to purchase French properties appropri-
 ated by the government at the time of independence,
 thereby increasing private ownership and stimulating a
 housing market. A total of 450,000 dwelling units are
 scheduled for construction in 1980-84. Implementation
 of the program is proceeding rapidly.
 Most health care is rudimentary, but free and widely
 available. Life expectancy was 57 years in 1980, com-
 pared with 47 in 1960. Life expectancy was 56 years for
 males and 58 for females in 1979. Infant mortality was
 110 per 1,000 live births that year. Seventy-seven
 percent of the population was considered to have access to
 safe water as of 1975. Water-borne diseases are a serious
 problem, especially for young children.
 Education is free through the university level and com-
 pulsory between the ages of six and thirteen. Educational
 facilities have been vastly expanded since independence,
 but are still generally inadequate in both rural and urban
 areas. The literarcy level in Arabic, French or both is
 approximately 40 percent among the population over nine
 years of age, but is steadily increasing as the large
 majority of children now attend school. The adjusted
 primary school enrollment ratio for 1976-79 was 99, with
 114 for males and 82 for females.
