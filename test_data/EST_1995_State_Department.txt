 ESTONIA
 Estonia is a parliamentary democracy. With its statehood widely recognized as
 continuous for more than 70 years, Estonia regained its independence in 1991 after
 50 years of Soviet occupation. The Constitution, adopted by referendum in 1992, es-
 tablished a 101-member unicameral legislature (State Assembly), a Prime Minister
 as Head of Government, and a President, elected by Parliament, as Head of State.
 Free and fair parliamentary elections were held in March.
 The official conversion of the Soviet militia into the Estonian police preceded the
 reestablishment of the country's independence by about 6 months. However, conver-
 sion of the police into a force committed to procedures and safeguards appropriate
 to a democratic society is proceeding slowly. The security service, called security po-
 lice, is subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The police, ethnically mixed
 and also subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, continued to commit human
 rights abuses, as did corrections personnel subordinate to the Ministry of Justice.
 Forces of the Russian Federation were withdrawn in 1994, pursuant to agreements
 reached between the two countries. Problems remain, however, over the status of
 hundreds of Russian soldiers demobilized in Estonia.
 Estonia has an open-market economy. Reflecting the extent of its post-1992 re-
 forms, Estonia signed a Europe Agreement with the European Union in June which
 granted associate member status without a transition period. Services are growing
 in importance compared to historically more prominent light industry and food pro-
 duction. Privatization of small and medium firms is virtually complete, and large-
 scale privatization is underway. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth sowed some-
 what to about 4 percent annually. Per capita GDP is approximately $1,600 per year.
 Two-thirds of Estonian exports-mainy textiles, food products and timber prod-
 ucts-now flow to Western markets     nemployment remained low overall (unoffi-
 cially about 8 percent) but was significantly higher in rural areas and in the pre-
 dominantly ethnic Russian northeast.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens and the
 large resident noncitizen community, but problems remained in some areas. The
 major human rights abuses continued to be mistreatment of prisoners and detainees
 and the use of excessive force by the police. Prison conditions are poor. Problems
 remain in clarifying the status of the 11 percent of noncitizens who have not to date
 registered for permanent residency and in the slow pace of processing the applica-
 tions for permanent residency of 15,000 retired Russian military pensioners. The
 Government extended from July 1995 to April 1996 the deadline for submission of
 residence permit applications for Soviet-era noncitizens and continued to issue tem-
 porary travel documents and aliens' passports to eligible noncitizens for departure
 r  and return to Estonia.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 aL Political and Other Extra judicial KIlling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 Such practices are prohibited by law. However, there continued to be credible re-
 ports of police using excessive force and verbal abuse during the arrest and ques-
 tioning of suspects. Punishment cells ("kartsers") continued to be utilized, in con-
 travention of international standards. Severe overcrowding was notable at the
 Tallinn pretrial detention prison built in 1765. Two cases ofhazing occurred in the
 military; the perpetrators were disciplined.
 During the year, the Government continued steps to address the poor prison con-
 ditions. In February the authorities fired the deputy director of the Talinn Central
 Prison after prison guards attacked a group of persons who had approached the re-
 stricted prison area and sentenced another prison official to 2 years' probation and
 a fine for mistreating prisoners. In Novembr the Government opened a new pre-
 trial detention facility which, with mre than 400 beds, should significantly reduce
 overcrowding among pretria detainees. Previously, in Septembr the authorities
 opened a new recreation and training center in the Harku Women's Prison. In 1995
 one prisoner killed another, in contrast to 1992 when there were 32 such killings.
 Tme Government has also drafted a multiyear plan to refurbish and restructure
 all the country's prisons and to close the Tallinn Central Prison. At the invitation
 of the Minister of Justice, representatives of the Council of Europe (COE) studied
 prison conditions and made recommendations on the steps required to bring them
 into accord with COE standards. Some of the COE recommendations had been ia-
 
 
 850
 plemented by year's end, but fulfillment of others is hampered by lack of resources
 and high turnover among prison staff.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and laws forbid arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government generally observes this prohi-
 bition. Under the Constitution, warrants issued by a court are required to make ar-
 rests. _Detainees must be informed promptly of the grounds for the arrest and given
 immediate access to legal counsel. If a person cannot afford counsel, the State will
 provide one. A person may be held for 48 hours without formally being charged; fur-
 ther detention requires a court order. A person may be held in pretrial detention
 for 2 months; this may be extended up to a total of 12 months by a court order.
 Police rarely violate these limits. By midyear, 1,425 of the 4,007 persons held in
 prisons were awaiting trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution establishes an independent judi-
 cial branch operating through a three-tier court system: rural and city courts, dis-
 trict courts, and the State Court (which functions as a supreme court). The district
 and state courts are also courts for "constitutional supervision." At the rural and
 city level, court decisions are made by a majority vote with a judge and two lay
 members sitting in judgment. All judges and lay judges must be citizens. The Presi-
 dent nominates and the State Assembly confirms the Chief Justice of the State
 Court. The Chief Justice nominates State Court judges who are subject to confirma-
 tion by the Parliament. He also nominates the district, city, and rural court judges
 who are then appointed by the President. All judges are appointed for life.
 The Constitution provides that court proceedings shall be public. Closed sessions
 may be held only for specific reasons, such as protection of state or business secrets
 and in cases concerning minors. The Constitution further provides that defendants
 may present witnesses and evidence as well as confront and cross-examine prosecu-
 tion witnesses. Defendants have access to prosecution evidence and enjoy a pre-
 sumption of innocence.
 Estonia continued to overhaul its criminal and civil procedural codes. An interim
 Criminal Code, which went into effect in 1992, revised the Soviet-era criminal code
 by eliminating, for example, political and economic crimes. The Code of Criminal
 Procedure was adopted in 1994. New codes in a variety of fields were being drafted
 at year's end.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires a search warrant for search and seizure of property. During the investiga-
 tive stage, warrants are issued by the prosecutor upon a showing of probable cause.
 Once a case has gone to court, warrants are issued by the court. The Constitution
 provides for secrecy of the mail, telegrams, telephones, and other means of commu-
 nication. Police must obtain a court order to intercept a person's communications.
 Illegally obtained evidence is not admissible in court. In October a political scandal
 erupted when then Minister of Internal Affairs Savisaar was implicated in the illicit
 recording of his conversations with other politicians. Parliament appointed a special
 committee to investigate the matter, including the contacts of police with private se-
 curity firms. Savisaar was dismissed, the cabinet resigned, and a new governing co-
 alition was formed. Security police and parliamentary investigations were continu-
 in at year's end.
 Tere have been no reports of forced political membership, coercive population
 control, or forced resettlement. In a wide  re  rted case during the summer, the
 police, without a warrant, destroyed a field of alleged opium poppies. An internal
 police disciplinary investigation of the incident continued at years end. At the same
 time a criminal case was led against the owner of the field for growing opium pop-
 pies; the owner asserted that he was growing oil poppies. The case had not come
 to trial as of late in the year.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government generally respects constitu-
 tional provisions providing for freedom of speech and press. Print journalism contin-
 ues to underscore its independence through more probing investigative reporting.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely available. Although the Government
 still provides most newsprint and printing and distribution facilities, the role of pri-
 vate companies is rapidly expandin  There are three major national Estonian-lan-
 guage and two Russian-language daies.
 State broadcast media, including one nationwide television channel, receive large
 subsidies, and the State has assured that these subsidies will continue. There are
 several major independent television and radio stations. The Government has
 stopped retransmission of television channels from Russia owing to nonpayment of
 fees, but several Russian-language programs, mostly Estonian produced, are broad-
 
 
 851
 cast over state and private television channels. Russian state television and
 Ostankino programs are widely available via cable.
 There is complete academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides fdr
 the right to assemble freely, but noncitizens are prohibited from joimg  litical
 parties, although they may form social groups. Permits for all public gaterings
 must be obtained 3 weeks prior to the date of the gathering. The authorities have
 wide discretion to prohibit such gatherings on public safety grounds but seldom ex-
 ercise it. There were no reports of Government interference in mass gatherings or
 political rallies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 The 1993 Law on Churches and Religious Organizations requires any group which
 wishes to be considered a religious organization to have at least 12 members and
 to register with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Board of Religion. Leaders
 of religious organizations must be citizens with at least 5 years' residence in Esto-
 nia.
 The majority of Estonians are nominally Lutheran, but following deep-seated tra-
 dition there is wide tolerance of other denominations and religions. People of vary-
 ing ethnic backgrounds profess Orthodoxy, including communities of Russian Old
 Beievers who found refuge.in Estonia in the 17th century. The Estonian Apostolic
 Orthodox Church (EAOC), independent since 1919, subordinate to Constantinople
 since 1923, and exiled under the Soviet occupation, reregistered under its 1935 stat-
 ute in August 1993. Since then, a group of ethnic Estonian and Russian parishes
 preferring to remain under the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church structure
 imposed during the Soviet occupation has insisted that it should have claim to the
 EAOC name. This group has refused to register under any other name, although
 its refusal to register violates Estonian law. While church authorities work to re-
 solve this question the Government has assured parishes aligned with the Russian
 Orthodox Church tat they may continue to worship unimpeded.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law permits free movement within the country, and it is honored
 in practice. It also provides for the right of foreign travel, emigration, and repatri-
 ation for Estonian citizens. There are no exit visas.
 In July 1993, Parliament enacted the Law on Aliens that defines an alien as a
 person who is not a citizen of Estonia, i.e., a citizen of another country or a stateless
 person. The majority of noncitizens are ethnic Russians. The law provided a 1-year
 period during which noncitizens who came to Estonia prior to July 1 1990, and
 were considered permanent residents of the former "Estonian Soviet Socialist Re-
 public," could apply for temporary residence permits. They could also apply for per-
 manent residence at the same time. Following delays and confusion in implementa-
 tion, as well as criticism by international human rights observers, the application
 deadline was extended by a year, until July 12. Even though by the July deadline
 the vast majority of aliens-327,737 of the estimated 370,000-had filed applica-
 tions, the Government extended the registration period through April 30, 1996.
 There were also complaints about the slow pace with which the Government was
 processing residence applications for some 15,000 Russian military pensioners. The
 process was complicated by the lack of Russian-provided passports in which to affix
 the permits.
 No restrictions are placed on the right of noncitizens to foreign travel, emigration,
 or repatriation, although some noncitizens complain of delays in obtaining travel
 documents. The Government began issuing temporary travel documents valid for a
 single departure and reentry into the country to resident aliens in 1994. To accom-
 modate entry visa requirements of other countries, the validity period of this docu-
 ment was extended from 6 months to 2 years. In the fall of 1994, the Government
 began issuing "alien's passports" to resident aliens not in possession of any other
 valid travel document. These included: (1) persons who are designated as stateless;
 (2) foreign citizens who lack the opportunity to obtain travel documents of their
 country of origin or of another state; (3) persons who file for Estonian citizenship
 and pass the language examination if required; and, (4) aliens who are permanently
 departing Estonia. The Government plans to expand the classes of noncitizens eli-
 ble for alien's passports; it has already approved their issuance to noncitizens in-
 tending to study abroad.
 The Government does not accord refugee status or asylum. The representative of
 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the Nordic and Baltic states
 continues to urge Estonia to develop and adopt legislation distinguishing between
 refugees, applicants for asylum, and illegal immigrants. The representative distrib-
 uted Estman language copies of the IfNCR handbook for determining refugee sta-
 
 
 852
 tus. Such legislation had not been drafted by year's end. A hijacker who diverted
 a plane from Russia to Estonia in 1994 applied for asylum. Russia requested his
 extradition. The case became moot when the hijacker committed suicide in January.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. In March free and fair
 multiparty elections were held for the second Parliament since reestablishment of
 independence. Among deputies are six ethnic Russians. The 101-member Parliament
 (Rii ..ogu or State Assembly) confirmed Tiit Vahi as Prime Minister. Vahi had his
 coalition Government confirmed in April. As a result of the illicit eavesdropping
 scandal in October, Vahi resigned and then put together a new coalition govern-
 ment. The Law on Local Elections adopted in 1993 permits resident noncitizens to
 vote but not run for office. Local elections are set for the fall of 1996.
 The citizenship law enacted in February 1992 readopted the 1938 citizenship law.
 According to the law, anyone born after 1940 to an Estonian citizen parent is an
 Estonian citizen by birth. The parent does not have to be an ethnic Estonian. The
 Government estimates that under this provision some 80,000 persons not ethnically
 Estonian have obtained citizenship. The law included requirements for naturaliza-
 tion, such as a 2-year residency requirement, to be followed by a 1-year waiting pe-
 riod, as well as knowledge of the Estonian language.
 On January 19, Parliament adopted a new citizenship law, which revised the 1992
 law and combined into one statute provisions regarding citizenship that were scat-
 tered among several pieces of legislation. The new law became effective on April 1.
 It extended the residency requirement for naturalization from 2 to 5 years and
 added a requirement for knowledge of the Constitution and the citizenship law. Per-
 sons who had taken up what was considered legal residence in the "Estonian Soviet
 Socialist Republic" prior to July 1, 1990 (a group which includes the overwhelming
 majority of the noncitizens currently in Estonia) are exempt from the 5-year legal
 residence and 1-year waiting period requirements. The law allows the Government
 to waive language but not civic knowledge requirements for applicants who have ob-
 tained Estonian-language education, or who have performed valuable service to Es-
 tonia.
 According to paragraph 21 of the new law, the following classes of persons are
 ineligible for naturalization: those filing on the basis of false data or documents;
 those not abiding by the Estonian constitutional system or not fulfilling Estonian
 laws; those who have acted against the Estonian State and its security; those who
 have committed crimes and been punished with a sentence of more than 1 year or
 who have been repeatedly brought to justice for felonies; those who work or have
 worked in the intelligence or security services of a foreign state; those who have
 served as career soldiers in the armed forces of a foreign state, including those dis-
 charged into the reserves or retired, as well as spouses who came to Estonia in con-
 nection with the soldier's assignment or retirement. A provision of the law allows
 for the granting of citizenship to a foreign military retiree who has been married
 to a native Estonian citizen for 5 years.
 Between 1992 and mid-December 1995, some 65,000 people had applied for and
 received Estonian citizenship. Almost 83,000 cases were pending, with naturaliza-
 tions averaging about 2,000 a month. Some observers attribute this growing but still
 relatively low number to indecision over whether to apply for Estonian citizenship
 or citizenship of another country, such as Russia. In December official Russian
 sources claimed that 82,000 persons had obtained Russian citizenship but refused
 to supply the Government with a list.
 The new citizenship law was criticized as discriminatory by the Russian Govern-
 ment and by some in the local ethnic-Russian communities. On the basis of a report
 submitted through a Danish nongovernmental organization working in Tallinn, the
 U.N. Human Rights Committee charged with studyig compliance of states that are
 party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights noted Estonia's
 genuine commitment ... to guarantee the basic human rights of all individuals
 under its jurisdiction" but also raised subjects of concern. The Committee criticized
 the law for establishing "too many criteria," for the "stringency" of the language re-
 quirement, and for the lack of a remedy against an administrative decision rejecting
 a request for naturalization. However, numerous international fact-finding organiza-
 tions, such as the Finnish Helsinki Committee and the Organization for Security
 and Cooperation in Europe, confirm that the citizenship law conforms to inter-
 national standards.
 Bureaucratic delays and the Estonian-language requirement are also cited as dis-
 incentives. The Government, with assistance from abroad, has established language
 training centers. Still, there is a lack of qualified teachers, financial resources, and
 
 
 training materials. Some allege that the examination process, with a 75-to-90 per-
 cent passage rate, is arbitrary.
 The Government has deported a small number of illegal aliens, usually those
 caught in criminal acts. By late September, some 20 illegal aliens were held as in-
 ternees, pending deportation or a court order granting them residence. In March the
 Government expelled Russian citizen and longtime resident of Estonia Pyotr Rozhok
 for repeated activities since 1989 against the Estnian State. Rozhok was the rep-
 resentative of Vladimir Zhirinvsky's Russian Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia.
 His appeal to nullify the expulsion order had not been adjudicated at year's end.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in Government or poli-
 tics. Eleven of the 101 Members of Parliament are women, as were 2 of the 14 gov-
 ernment ministers who took office in April; the Cabinet formed in October had no
 women ministers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not restrict the formation or functioning of human rights
 organizations. In response to allegations of bad treatment of ethnic minorities, the
 President established a Human Rights Institute which first convened in 1992. The
 Institute monitors human rights in Estonia and provides information to the inter-
 national community. It investigates reports of human rights violations, such as alle-
 gations of police abuse and inhuman treatment of detainees. In addition, because
 of tensions surrounding the adoption of the elections law and the aliens law in 1993,
 the President established a round table composed of representatives of Parliament,
 the Union of Estonian Nationalities, and the Representative Assembly of the Rus-
 sian Community.
 An analogous but independent round table meets in the county of East Virumaa
 in northeastern Estonia. In addition, with start-up funding from the Danish Govern-
 ment, a nongovernmental legal information center in Tallinn provides free legal as-
 sistance to individuals--citizen and noncitizen alike-seeking advice on human
 rights-related issues.
 In the context of repeated Russian allegations of violations of the human rights
 of the noncitizen population bth the OSCE mission in Estonia and the OSCE High
 Commissioner onNational Minorities have declared that they could find no pattern
 of human rights violations or abuses in Estonia. Although the Government pre-
 viously had expressed concern about what it termed biased reporting by the OSCE
 mission, government relations with the mission were cordial.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, social status, or for any other reason. The Government reports that no
 court cases charginq discrimination have been filed.
 Women.-Discussion of the role and situation of women was extensive during the
 year, especially around the time of the Fourth World Conference on Women in
 beijing. Violence against women, including spousal abuse, was the subject of in-
 creasing discussion and media coverage. According to women's groups and law en-
 forcement officials, family violence is not pervasive. However, studies show that
 some 40 percent of crime goes unreported, including domestic violence. Often, even
 when the police are called, the abused spouse declines to press charges.
 Women possess the same legal rights as men and are legally entitled to equal pay
 for equal work. Nevertheless, the Minister of Social Affairs pointed out at the
 Beijing Conference that although Estonian women's average educational level was
 ger than men's, their average pay was lower, and the trend did not seem to be
 improving. There continue to be female and male dominated professions. Most
 women carry major household responsibilities in addition to comprising slightly
 more than one-half of the work force.
 Children.-There is no pattern of societal child abuse, but a research project con-
 ducted by the nongovernmental Estonian Union for Child Welfare on children and
 violence at home and school found that a significant proportion of children had expe-
 rienced at least occasional violence at home, in schools or in youth gangs. The Gov-
 ernment's strong commitment to education is evident by its having given top prior-
 ity to building and refurbishing schoolhouses. The Government provides free medi-
 cal care for cldren and subsidizes school meals. In 1992 the Government adopted
 a Child Protection Law, patterned on the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
 Child.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution contains provisions to protect disabled
 persons against discrimination. There is no legal discrimination against the dis-
 
 
 854
 
 abled, and both the State and some nongovermental organizations provide them
 with financial assistance. However, little has been done to enable disabled people
 to participate normally in public life. There is no public access law, but some effort
 to accommodate the disabled is evident in the inclusion of ramps at curbs on new
 urban sidewalk construction.
 NationalIRacial /Ethnic Minorities.-The OSCE mission to Estonia, established
 in 1993, continued to promote stability, dialog, and understanding between the com-
 munities in Estonia. In addition, the President's round table, also established in
 1993, composed of Members of Parliament, representatives of the Union of Estonian
 Nationalities, and the Representative Assembly of the Russian Community, contin-
 ued to work toward finding practical solutions to problems of noncitizens, as did the
 analogous but independent round table which met in the northeastern part of the
 country (see Section 4).
 A Law on Cultural Autonomy for citizens belonging to minority groups was adopt-
 ed by Parliament and went into effect in 1993. There is a tradition of protection for
 cultural autonomy going back to a 1925 law. In its November report on Estonia, the
 U.N. Human Rights Committee alleged that permanent resident noncitizens are ex-
 cluded from "full participation in mnority groups" since the definition of minorities
 in the Estonian law only encompasses national minorities. The Government noted
 in turn that the law is an entitlement program to provide subsidies to cultural orga-
 nizations run by citizens belonging to national minorities; all residents of Estonia
 are free to participate in the relevant organizations.
 Ethnic Russians total approximately 29 percent, and nonethnic Estonians as a
 whole about 37 percent, of the population of 1.5 million. During the years of Esto-
 nia's forced annexation by the Soviet Union, large numbers of non-Estonians, pre-
 dominantly ethnic Russians, were encouraged to migrate to Estonia to work as la-
 borers and administrators. They and their descendants now make up approximately
 one-third of the total population; about 40 percent of them were born in Estonia.
 About 8 percent of the population of the pre-1940 Republic was ethnic Russian.
 Noncitizens, especially ethnic Russians, continued to allege job, salary, and hous-
 ing discrimination because of Estonian-language requirements. Reflecting these alle-
 gations, the U.N. Human Rights Committee asserted that the written oath of con-
 science for applicants for public service may place "an unreasonable restriction on
 the right of access to public service without discrimination." In response, the Gov-
 ernment noted that the oath must be signed by citizens and noncitizens alike, and
 that it focuses on denying public service appointments to people who have served
 the secret services of any foreign government. Concerning business or property own-
 ership, Estonian law makes no distinction on the basis of citizenship other than for
 land. Land ownership by noncitizens is decided by the Government; in practice,
 noncitizens may own the land underneath their real property. All legal residents of
 Estonia may participate equally in the privatization of state-owned housing.
 Estonian-language requirements for those employed in the civil service went into
 effect in 1993; the new law on public service as originally passed required state em-
 ployees to be proficient in Estonian by the end of 1995. In late December, Par-
 liament amended the law on public service to allow noncitizen local and national
 government employees and employees without adequate Estonian to continue work-
 ing until February 1, 1997. No noncitizens would be hired after January 1, 1996.
 This amendment reflected the Government's awareness that in some sectors, the
 number of employees with inadequate Estonian language skills remains high. There
 were no reports of people being dismissed for inadequate Estonian-language skills.
 The language office liberally grants extensions to persons who can explain their
 failure to meet their requisite competence level in 4 years. Estonian-language train-
 ing is available but, some claim, too costly. Representatives of ethnic Russian com-
 munities continued to ask for free language training; they also asserted that the
 language requirement for citizenship is too difficult. The examination fee for either
 language test-for employment or citizenship-is 15 percent of the monthly mini-
 mum wage, although it is waived for the unemployed.
 In districts where the language of more than one-half of the population is a lan-
 guage other than Estonian, the inhabitants are entitled to receive official informa-
 tion in that language, and the local government may conduct business in that lan-
 guage, in accordance with appropriate legislation and a Government decision. De-
 spite these provisions, the Government rejected requests by the city councils of
 Sillamae and Narva in the mainly ethnic Russian northeast to use Russian for in-
 ternal business. One council was unofficially told that it could use Russian within
 a department but had to use Estonian in interdepartmental communications and of-
 ficial documents. The other council was not officially notified of the reasons for rejec-
 tion.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to form and
 join a union or employee association. The Central Organization of Estonian Trade
 Unions (EAKL) came into being as a wholly voluntary and purely Estonian organi-
 zation in 1990 to replace the Estonian branch of the official Soviet labor confed-
 eration, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTU). Another trade
 union, the Organization of Employee Unions, split from the EAKL in 1993 and had
 55,000 members in 1995. About one-third of the country's labor force belongs to one
 of the two labor federations.
 The law provides for the right to strike, and unions are independent of the Gov-
 ernment and political parties. There were no strikes in 1995; some worker dem-
 onstrations occurred to protest low salaries or poor working conditions. The Con-
 stitution and statutes prohibit retribution against strikers. Unions may join federa-
 tions freely and affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colletiuely.-While Estonian workers now
 have the legally acquired right to bargain collectively, collective bargaining is still
 in its infancy. The Government remains by far the biggest employer. According to
 EAKL leaders, few collective bargaining agreements have been concluded between
 management and workers of a specific enterprise. The EAKL has, however, con-
 cluded framework agreements with producer associations, which provide the basis
 for specific labor agreements. The EAKL was also involved with developing Esto-
 nia's new Labor Code covering employment contracts, vacation, and occupational
 safety. The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employees have the
 right to go to court to enforce their rights. In 1993 a collective bargaining law, a
 collective dispute resolution law, and a shop steward law were adopted. In 1994
 EAKL officials reported that the courts reinstated a union official who alleged dis-
 missal because of union activity.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and the Labor Inspections Office effectively enforces this prohi-
 bition.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment is 16 years. Minors 13 through 15 years of age may work with written
 permission of a parent or guardian and the local labor inspector, if working is not
 angerous to the minor's health or considered immoral, does not interfere with stud-
 ies, and if the type of work is included on a government-prepared list. Government
 authorities effectively enforce minimum age laws through inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government, after consultations with the
 EAKL and the Central Producers Union, sets the minimum wage. In September the
 Labor Union Federation and the Producers Union agreed to ask the Government to
 raise the monthly minimum wage from $36 to $62 (450 to 680 Estonian crowns).
 The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide a worker and family a decent stand-
 ard of living. About 3 percent of the work force receive the minimum wage. The av-
 erage monthly wage is $200 (about 2,200 crowns).
 The standard workweek is 40 hours, and there is a mandatory 24-hour rest period
 in the workweek. According to EAKL sources, legal occupational health and safety
 standards are satisfactory, but they are extremely difficult to implement in practice.
 The National Labor Inspection Board is responsible for enforcement of these stand-
 ards, but it has not been very effective to date. In addition, the labor unions have
 occupational health and safety experts who assist workers in bringing employers
 into compliance with the legal standards. Workers have the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
