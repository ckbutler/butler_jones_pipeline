 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe is a parliamentary-style democracy. A single party,
 the Zimbabwe African National Union-Popular Front (ZANU),
 dominates the legislative and executive branches of
 government. The Prime Minister of the Government and
 President of ZANU, Robert Mugabe, has announced plans to
 create a one-party state through revision of the Constitution
 beginning in 1987. The strength and influence of opposition
 parties, particularly the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union
 (ZAPU), led by Joshua Nkomo, have declined since independence
 in 1980. Historical conflict between the two major tribal
 groupings, the Shona-speaking majority (supporting ZANU) and
 the Sindebele-speaking minority (loyal to ZAPU), continued,
 but negotiations were under way throughout 1986 to merge ZANU
 and ZAPU in a move designed to ease those deeply-rooted tribal
 and regional differences.
 The security forces have three branches. The Zimbabwe
 Republic Police is responsible for maintaining law and order.
 Three police units are active in dealing with internal
 security matters: the Criminal Investigation Division, the
 Police Intelligence and Security Inspectorate, and the Police
 Support Unit. All branches of the police report to the
 Minister for Home Affairs, Enos Nkala. The Central
 Intelligence Organization (CIO), attached to the Prime
 Minister's office, has both an intelligence and
 counterintelligence function. CIO operatives have police
 powers and can arrest and interrogate suspects in internal
 security cases. Finally, the armed forces are also involved
 in internal security, usually in antidissident operations.
 Most reports of human rights violations in 1986 have been
 traced to the police. A lesser number of problems have been
 attributed to the CIO. Unlike in previous years, few reports
 of human rights abuses have been ascribed to the armed forces.
 Zimbabwe has a wide range of resources, including both a
 strong agricultural and manufacturing base, but its important
 export-import capacity is heavily dependent on the rail links
 that pass through South Africa. To overcome this dependency,
 Zimbabwe has undertaken a major effort, with Western donor
 support, to revitalize the rail-port system through Mozambique
 to the town of Beira. In so doing, Zimbabwe has increasingly
 become involved in the Mozambican civil strife and has
 committed over 6,000 combat troops in support of the
 Mozambican Government.
 Repeated government efforts to deal with the dissident menace
 in Ndebele/ZAPU-controlled areas, especially in Matabeleland,
 form the background to most human rights problems in Zimbabwe
 and to the continuing state of emergency. In 1986 increasing
 fears of South African infiltration and possible
 destabilization in Zimbabwe led to new detentions and
 arrests. However, overall there was progress with respect to
 human rights in 1986. After more than 3 years of often severe
 repression of opposition political leaders and the civilian
 population in Matabeleland, reports of political killings and
 disappearances declined dramatically in 1986. Significant
 numbers of political detainees, including leading political
 and military figures associated with ZAPU, were released from
 jail. The Government also instituted orderly repatriation
 procedures for Sindebele speaking refugees who had fled to
 Botswana. These developments coincided with efforts by ZANU
 to preach reconciliation and unity with ZAPU.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In a notable change from previous years, there were no reports
 of political killings by government security forces. In
 Matabeleland, there was a marked relaxation of tensions in
 many rural areas attributable, in part, to more disciplined
 behavior by security forces in actions against armed Zimbabwe
 dissidents and suspected dissident sympathizers. The
 Government also sharply curtailed ZANU youth actions which in
 previous years had resulted in several deaths and considerable
 destruction of property and terrorizing of ZAPU supporters.
 In contrast, political killings by armed dissidents continued
 in 1986. According to official government figures for the 6
 months ending June 30, 1986, dissidents committed 57 murders,
 46 rapes, and 104 armed robberies. Dissident tactics are
 often brutal, include torture, and are aimed at members of
 ZANU, government officials, and civilians accused of "selling
 out" to the Government.
 b. Disappearance
 Human rights observers in both Harare and Bulawayo reported no
 new cases of disappearance in 1986. This contrasted sharply
 with the situation in 1985, when an estimated 300 to 400
 persons were reportedly abducted by government security
 forces. Little progress has been made in locating these
 missing persons, almost all of whom were from Sindebele-
 speaking regions. The families of several missing persons
 were reported to be preparing legal action against the
 Government for failure to investigate adequately the
 disappearances. There was particular international concern
 about the safety of one refugee, Makhatini Guduza, who was
 involuntarily repatriated from Botswana in February and turned
 over to Zimbabwean security officials. He is believed to be
 in detention, although no human rights monitoring
 organizations have been able to establish where he is being
 held.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 Reliable reports indicate that the authorities continued to
 apply torture in many security-related cases, notably against
 several persons detained after the May 1986 South African raid
 on Harare. An American citizen detained by police at that
 time reported seeing cellmates suffering from severe physical
 abuse.
 The most common form of torture appears to be physical
 beating, including beating the soles of the feet to conceal
 evidence of mistreatment. Electric shocks are reportedly
 another, though less common, form of torture. The most
 notorious technique of torture is reportedly simulated
 drowning whereby the victim's head is placed in a water-ft led
 canvas bag or lowered into a bucket of water.
 Senior government officials strongly deny that torture is
 condoned but have admitted that isolated, unauthorized
 instances may have occurred. In July Home Affairs Minister
 
 
 373
 ZIMBABWE
 Nkala warned an audience of police officials that torture
 would not be tolerated. This warning was preceded by the High
 Court's awarding of $17,400 in damages ($8,700 to come from
 Nkala and $8,700 from the officers specifically involved) to
 an opposition politician who had claimed that he was illegally
 arrested and tortured. However, despite official disclaimers,
 reports indicate that prisoner mistreatment continued in 1986.
 Available evidence shows that prison conditions in Zimbabwe
 are generally spartan but not harsh. In particular, there
 have been allegations of serious overcrowding, poor sanitary
 and medical facilities, and routine torture in the notorious
 Stops Camp detention facility in Bulawayo; however, foreign
 visitors in February found that the Stops Camp, while small
 and unsuitable for long-term detention, probably was equipped
 to handle short-term prisoners in a humane fashion. The
 Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, a nongovernmental group
 of American lawyers which has visited Zimbabwe, has noted that
 there have also been a substantial number of reports of abuses
 occurring at other detention facilities throughout
 Matabeleland.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 A state of emergency, renewed every 6 months by parliamentary
 vote, has been in continuous effect in Zimbabwe since 1965.
 Under the state of emergency, persons may be detained without
 an arrest warrant and held up to 7 days before being informed
 of the reasons for detention. Reasons for detention are often
 so vaguely worded as to make meaningful representations by the
 detainee on his own behalf impossible. After 30 days,
 detainees must appear before an independent review tribunal
 which can order the detainee's release if evidence is
 insufficient to warrant continued incarceration. If the
 tribunal recommends continued detention, however, the case
 need not be reviewed again for another 6 months.
 The Government has made extensive use of emergency powers in
 vaguely defined security cases, particularly in the absence of
 solid evidence of wrongdoing. Because the emergency powers
 regulations do not require any evidence of criminal activity
 before a suspect may be detained, the professionalism of
 police investigations has been eroded. The most common
 reasons for detention under the state of emergency are
 suspected dissident activity, support for dissidents, or
 spying for foreign powers, particularly South Africa.
 Emergency powers have also been used to detain political
 opponents of the ruling party on allegations of coup plotting.
 It is virtually impossible to specify the number of persons
 currently detained on politically related charges. Many will
 probably never be brought to trial. In July a group of
 approximately 60 political detainees (almost all from
 Matabeleland) were released from jail. At least some of these
 are believed to have been among the 90 to 100 persons an
 eyewitness reported finding in the so-called "political block"
 at a maximum security prison in Harare in June 1986. In
 August 10 leading opposition politicians and military figures
 who had been in detention without trial for a year (for
 alleged coup plotting) were released by order of the Prime
 Minister. In early December, the Government released another
 five detainees, including former ZAPU military commander
 Dumiso Dabengwa, who was acquitted of treason charges in 1983
 and redetained under the Emergency Powers Act, and Phillip
 
 
 374
 ZIMBABWE
 Hartlebury and Colin Evans, former CIO officers charged with
 spying for South Africa, who were arrested in 1981, acquitted
 in 1983, and then redetained under the same Act.
 Dabengwa's release was the culmination of a year-long
 government effort to improve atmospherics between ZANU and
 ZAPU. With it, all top ZAPU leaders are now out of detention,
 as are many lower level ZAPU-affiliated detainees. In
 announcing the release from detention of the 10 prominent
 ZAPU-affiliated political and military leaders, the Home
 Affairs Minister stated that the cases of another 200
 lower-level detainees would be reviewed with an eye towards
 possible release. This number roughly corresponded with
 independent estimates of the number of detainees held without
 charges on suspicion of antigovernment activity. In December,
 however, the Minister stated that only 31 detainees remained
 in jail. There undoubtably have been piecemeal releases since
 August in addition to the ones that have been publicized, but
 observers doubt that the number of political detainees, as
 defined by human rights groups, has dropped as low as 31.
 Zimbabwe law forbids the use of forced labor, and forced labor
 is not practiced in Zimbabwe.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The number of political prisoners, as distinct from political
 detainees who have never been brought to trial, is unknown.
 However, the existing state of emergency regulations that
 allow security authorities to hold detainees for long periods
 of time without formally charging them with any crime render
 distinctions between political prisoners and detainees almost
 superfluous.
 The Government displayed a new willingness in 1986 to
 prosecute officials suspected of involvement in political
 killings. In February courts sentenced a ZANU official to
 death for the murder in 1985 of five members of the opposition
 United African National Congress (UANC) party. In July courts
 also sentenced to death four soldiers found guilty of the
 abduction, torture, and murder in 1983 of an Ndebele army
 lieutenant, his wife, and two civilian companions. While
 these examples may help to discourage official violence, many
 political killings from the 1982-85 period have not been
 formally investigated and are unlikely to be.
 The existence of an independent judiciary in Zimbabwe remains
 a powerful deterrent to arbitrary arrest and detention, and
 persons brought to trial in regular criminal/civil cases can
 be assured of a fair public hearing comparable to that found
 in most Western democracies. The Government generally has
 abided by court decisions even when it strongly opposes the
 ruling. Well-publicized exceptions were the detentions
 following court acquittal of Dabengwa, Hartlebury, and Evans
 cited in section l.d. above. The Prime Minister and Home
 Affairs Minister also both indicated in 1986 that the
 executive branch did not consider itself bound to award
 damages to individuals even if so ordered by the courts.
 Emergency powers obviously limit the role of the courts, but
 the Supreme Court in acquitting a political detainee in July
 declared that the Government can no longer hold detainees by
 merely citing emergency regulations and prevent courts from
 examining the alleged reasonls for their detention. The judge
 also criticized the overall handling of the case by the police
 investigators and Justice Ministry officials.
 
 
 375
 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe's legal system is based on a mixture of Roman-Dutch
 and English common law practices and procedures and consists
 of magisterial courts, a High Court, and a Supreme Court. All
 trials are open to the public, except in very rare cases where
 the Government orders proceedings to be held in camera.
 Defendants must retain their own legal counsel as there is no
 provision for public defenders. Defense counsel can present
 evidence and confront witnesses. The right to appeal exists
 in all cases.
 With only 400 lawyers nationwide and a shortage of experienced
 magistrates, Zimbabwe's judicial system is hard pressed to
 cope with ordinary criminal case loads. Long pretrial delays
 are thus common. Bail is left to the discretion of the
 courts, although the Government can order the refusal of bail
 in any case. The Government has made extensive use of this
 prerogative in security-related cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence
 The Constitution formally protects citizens from arbitrary
 search or entry. Under emergency powers regulations, however,
 any police officer may stop and search any person or enter any
 area without a warrant where he has "reasonable grounds" for
 believing evidence of a crime may exist. Although no cases
 have been brought to the courts, it is widely believed that
 the Government also continues to monitor private
 correspondence and telephones. Several government employees
 privately complained in 1986 of obvious tampering with their
 correspondence.
 The right of citizens to refrain from associating with
 political parties and organizations is not always respected in
 Zimbabwe. Informal pressure has been brought to bear on
 persons who refuse to identify publicly with the ruling
 party. For example, there were numerous reports in 1986 of
 job seekers suffering discrimination for failure to produce a
 ZANU membership card. The Government does not officially
 approve such discrimination but has not moved decisively to
 curtail it. Similarly, reports from low-income suburbs around
 Harare indicate that ZANU activists and youth cadre have
 forced unwilling citizens to attend ZANU rallies, a practice
 which was particularly widespread in 1985 during the general
 election campaign. Perhaps because of vocal public resentment
 and the danger of a popular backlash against ZANU, a senior
 government minister publicly warned party activists in August
 to discontinue this activity.
 Zimbabwean law prohibits "kuzvarira," or pledging of young
 girls to marriage partners not of their own choosing.
 However, unless the girl is well educated and outspoken,
 marriages based on "kuzvarira" still occur within the
 traditional setting and without knowledge of the courts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Zimbabwe Constitution guarantees freedom of expression but
 allows for legislation limiting this freedom in certain cases
 as, for example, when the "interests of defense, public
 safety, public order, the economic interests of the State,
 public morality and public health" are involved.
 
 
 376
 ZIMBABWE
 The Government tends to interpret broadly its power to
 discourage free speech. For example, numerous persons were
 arrested in 1986 and charged with misdemeanors under the
 Miscellaneous Offenses Act for uttering remarks disrespectful
 of the Prime Minister and/or government policies. At public
 events, it is generally assumed that speakers are under
 surveillance and may be subject to follow-up police action if
 the remarks are judged too controversial. Even in private
 gatherings, Zimbabweans are often reluctant to voice political
 complaints openly, particularly if they do not know their
 interlocutors well.
 Zimbabwe's major print media (five English-language newspapers
 and one vernacular broadsheet) are government controlled.
 Television and radio are wholly government owned. Senior
 media officials follow the official government/ruling party
 line closely and practice a high degree of self-censorship.
 Press coverage which disputes the main lines of government
 policy, criticizes the ruling party, or questions the actions
 of senior government or party officials is rare.
 There were some examples of journalistic autonomy in 1986,
 however. The media uncovered several instances of official
 corruption and reported them. The government-controlled press
 provided at least partial coverage of stormy parliamentary
 debates involving personal attacks on governmment ministers.
 There were also a number of reports criticizing inefficiency
 or poor planning in selected social and economic areas.
 The independent weekly Financial Gazette focuses on business
 news but exhibits more investigative range (including
 political converage) and analytic depth than government-owned
 media. In October Information Minister Shamuyarira accused
 the Financial Gazette of serving as a "mouthpiece" for foreign
 powers after the paper published an editorial questioning
 Zimbabwe's ability to withstand possible South African counter
 sanctions. The Minister threatened unspecified action against
 the paper unless it modified its reporting and editorial
 procedures. The Financial Gazette hit back with a stinging
 editorial in defense of press freedom. Thus far, no official
 action has been taken against the paper. The same week, the
 Minister warned a small Jewish publication in Bulawayo against
 propagating Zionist ideas. The publication, essentially a
 religious newsletter which avoids political issues, was
 instructed to "tone down." In March the Minister summoned a
 Zimbabwean correspondent for a Western press service to his
 office and threatened to imprison the reporter if alleged
 "anti-Zimbabwean writings" continued.
 In 1986 at least three Zimbabwean journalists working for
 foreign press organizations were threatened with detention and
 as a result left the country. They were accused of writing
 articles for the foreign press which the Government considered
 objectionable.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution formally guarantees the right of assembly and
 association for political and nonpolitical organizations,
 including a broad spectrum of economic, professional, social,
 and recreational activities. In practice, there are serious
 obstacles to the full exercise of this right, particularly in
 the case of political associations.
 
 
 377
 ZIMBABWE
 Police permits are required for public meetings and political
 rallies. Few opposition political rallies took place in
 1986. The most notable one occurred in Bulawayo in March when
 ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo urged a crowd of 50,000 followers to
 cooperate with the Government in combating dissidents in
 Matabeleland. The low level of overt opposition activity in
 1986 reflects both the continuing decline of opposition
 parties and a presumption that even if permission to hold
 public meetings were requested it generally would be denied.
 Minority parties were also cautious as a result of the
 turbulence of 1985, when legal opposition rallies were broken
 up by thugs, and opposition party members were harassed by
 ZANU youth gangs. Although there was no repeat in 1986 of
 this open intimidation, a legacy of fear remains.
 In contrast to the closely circumscribed activities of
 minority parties, ZANU continued in 1986 to organize mass
 meetings throughout Zimbabwe. The implicit message was that
 membership in the ruling party is a sign of loyalty and
 patriotism (as well as an advantage in terms of professional
 and social advancement), whereas identification with minority
 parties is a form of political deviance.
 There are numerous nonpolitical business and employers'
 organizations, professional associations, and recreational and
 sports clubs, and they are generally free of governmental
 interference. One important exception occurred in late 1985
 when civic leaders and private citizens attempted to form a
 booster committee for the city of Bulawayo. Police pressure
 caused the committee to disband. The example illustrates the
 Government's sensitivity to any associative activity with even
 remote political connotations.
 Under the comprehensive labor legislation passed in 1985,
 labor has the right to organize and bargain collectively.
 However, the Government sets all wages and wage increases and
 issues regulations regarding hiring and firing, thus
 effectively preempting a major function of the collective
 bargaining process. In addition, Zimbabwe law permits only
 "collective job action" which does not impact on "essential
 services." Essential services are determined by the Minister
 of Labor after consultation with employers and publication in
 the Government Gazette. It is widely believed that any strike
 action would be met by government resistance and effectively
 negated by the Government's legal authority to declare any
 service "essential." The Government and the ruling party also
 exhort the unions, and the umbrella organization, the Zimbabwe
 Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), to work with them to achieve
 the reorganization of social and economic life in Zimbabwe.
 Despite these limitations, and the early stage of union
 development (union membership represents 17 percent of
 Zimbabwean workers), labor has begun to exert some influence
 through public debates with the Government and has even used
 the threat of strike action on wage issues. Although no
 strike action has been taken (and is unlikely), the ZCTU has
 become more vocal in its demands and incurred private
 reprimands from the Government.
 Unions have the right to affiliate with international
 organizations. The ZCTU belongs to the Organization of Africa
 Trade Union Unity and the Southern African Trade Union
 Coordination Council and has contacts with both Western and
 East bloc trade unions. Zimbabwe is also a member of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO).
 
 
 378
 ZIMBABWE
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Zimbabwe. There is no
 state religion, and various denominations are permitted to
 worship openly, pursue social and charitable activities, and
 maintain ties to affiliates and coreligionists abroad.
 Religious belief is neither a handicap nor an advantage in
 terms of professional or political advancement. A number of
 senior ZANU officials are, in fact, clergymen. Many
 government leaders received their education in mission
 schools. Elective courses in religious studies are part of
 the secondary school curriculum.
 Several well-publicized clashes involving the Government and
 individual churches occurred in 1986. These, however, appear
 to have resulted from local disputes rather than from any
 official effort to curtail religious freedom. For example, in
 March the Anglican cathedral in Mutare was taken over by a mob
 led by a local ZANU official. Services were disrupted,
 several persons injured, property was damaged, and the local
 Anglican bishop forced to flee. Police failed to intervene.
 The conflict stemmed from a church decision to replace a local
 mission headmaster, who mustered local political pressure on
 the church to reverse its decision. Other government disputes
 with churches have involved one denomination's resistance to
 mandatory inoculations for school children and temporary
 closure of another church due to fighting within the
 congregation. In both cases, the Government successfully
 negotiated a resumption of normal religious activity.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel at home and abroad is not subject to official
 restrictions, although travel restrictions have been
 occasionally applied when it was believed individuals might
 criticize the Government before foreign audiences. This
 practice does not appear to be widespread. A more serious
 practical obstacle to foreign travel is currency control,
 which limits the amount of money ($260) that nationals can
 carry out of the country each year on tourist travel.
 Immigration is not restricted, although persons who have left
 the country are not guaranteed the right to return if they
 were not born in Zimbabwe. With unexpected numbers of whites
 who had left Zimbabwe for South Africa now returning, the
 Government has initiated security-risk checks as part of the
 return process. Applicants must also demonstrate proof of
 livelihood. The new regulations do not apply to Zimbabweans
 who have been abroad as diplomats, students, or workers in
 branch offices of Zimbabwe-based firms.
 Repatriates from South Africa are viewed also as economic
 competition to black Zimbabweans. Many have taken lesser
 paying jobs upon their return to Zimbabwe. Another
 significant group of repatriates consists of political
 refugees who have returned primarily from Dukwe Camp in
 Botswana. Almost 700 of these repatriates have reentered
 Zimbabwe since December 1985. How they have fared is not
 known, since they dispersed after reentry. Zimbabwe has
 accepted at least 26,000 displaced persons from Mozambique,
 who are accommodated in camps near the Mozambican border.
 These persons, whom the Government intends to repatriate
 eventually to Mozambique, are for the most part fleeing civil
 
 
 379
 ZIMBABWE
 strife and economic deprivation. There are smaller numbers of
 South African, Angolan, and Namibian refugees in Zimbabwe.
 Political refugees from Kenya have also been given asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Zimbabwe is a multiparty, parliamentary-style democracy
 fashioned after the Westminster model. Members of Parliament
 represent electoral districts and are chosen by direct,
 universal suffrage, albeit with black and white voting rolls.
 The Prime Minister is Head of Government, is responsible to
 Parliament, and is also head of ZANU. He presides over the
 Cabinet, which is the executive decisionmaking body. While
 decisions in Cabinet are made by consensus, there are few
 known instances of cabinet ministers overruling the
 preferences of the Prime Minister.
 In general elections in 1985, ZANU consolidated its position
 as the preeminent political party in Zimbabwe. ZANU now
 controls 66 of 100 seats in the House of Assembly, while the
 main opposition party, ZAPU, holds 14 seats and another
 opposition party, ZANU-S, retains 1 seat. Of 20 House of
 Assembly seats reserved for whites, Ian Smith's Conservative
 Alliance holds 14, the Independent Zimbabwe Group counts 4
 seats, and there is 1 unaffiliated white member. One white
 conservative parliamentarian defected to ZANU in 1986.
 Although ZANU's clear parliamentary majority guarantees
 control over the legislative branch, the ruling party still
 lacks the requisite 70 votes to introduce fundamental changes
 in the Constitution. Beginning in 1987, portions of the
 Constitution can be revised by a 70 percent vote in the House
 of Assembly.
 Prime Minister Mugabe has announced his intention to proceed
 towards establishment of a one-party state. He has also
 indicated that the separate white electoral roll will be
 eliminated in 1987, as permitted in the Constitution.
 Creation of a one-party state in Zimbabwe is expected to
 significantly alter the current governing arrangement whereby
 opposition parties, although discriminated against and
 discouraged by the Government, still play an important role in
 preserving democratic processes.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged violations
 of Human Rights
 The Zimbabwean Government is highly sensitive to charges by
 international, nongovernmental organizations of human rights
 abuses in Zimbabwe. Amnesty International reports on Zimbabwe
 and its sustained efforts to get the Government to investigate
 human rights abuses were vehemently denounced in Parliament by
 the Prime Minister and other senior ministers as "lies." Home
 Affairs Minister Nkala publicly charged on several occasions
 in 1986 that Amnesty and several foreign governments
 interested in human rights problems, including the United
 States, were actively providing assistance to armed groups
 seeking to overthrow the Zimbabwe Government. The Government
 has attempted to frustrate the investigative activities of the
 Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, which published a major
 study in 1986 on the human rights situation in Zimbabwe.
 Nkala also publicly accused the group of being under the
 control of the Central Intelligence Agency.
 
 
 380
 ZIMBABWE
 In August the Home Affairs Minister convoked representatives
 from all nongovernmental and private voluntary organizations
 active in Zimbabwe and warned them of severe penalties for
 passing information on alleged human rights violations to
 foreign-based watchdog groups. Nkala said that a cabinet
 decision had been made to suppress the flow of "false"
 information to human rights monitoring groups and that a
 cabinet committee had been formed to pursue the matter.
 These actions appear to signal a government crackdown on human
 rights reporting in Zimbabwe. At the same time, senior
 government officials have continued to publicly deny that
 human rights abuses occur in Zimbabwe except in exceptional
 and unauthorized cases. In line with these denials, the
 Government has consistently refused to respond to an offer by
 the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide
 protection assistance (visits) to prisoners.
 Despite hardline public positions, there is evidence of
 private governmental concern about human rights practices in
 Zimbabwe and the negative image Zimbabwe has acquired abroad.
 Prominent foreigners for example, were allowed to inspect the
 Stops Camp detention facility in Bulawayo, where torture and
 prisoner mistreatment is alleged to have occurred. In June
 the Prime Minister intervened almost immediately following
 intercession by local and international human rights groups to
 order the release from detention of prominent human rights
 activists Michael Auret and Nicholas Ndebele, the top
 officials of the Zimbabwean Catholic Commission on Justice and
 Peace. Also, senior government ministers have on several
 occasions privately expressed a willingness to investigate
 cases involving alleged human rights abuses and to seek
 remedial action if necessary.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government services in Zimbabwe are provided on a
 nondiscriminatory basis, and the Government has been able to
 work with the previously "whites only" infrastructure in urban
 areas to provide health and other social services services to
 all. However, in many rural areas the neglect of the
 preindependence period still leaves the Government struggling
 to provide minimum care. Many blacks on commercial farms are
 still in a semifeudal status, dependent mainly on white
 farmers to provide basic care and schooling.
 The Minister of Labor mediated several cases in 1986 of
 charges of white employers discriminating against black
 employees. In some cases, companies have reinstated or
 promoted black employees following the Ministry's
 investigations. In social terms, Zimbabwe remains a racially
 stratified country, despite bans against official
 discrimination. While schools, churches, and clubs are all
 integrated, there is limited social interaction between racial
 groups. The "colored" (mixed race) community has complained
 of discrimination by Government in allocation of civil service
 jobs.
 Efforts to change ingrained cultural practices are under way,
 but women still bear a heavy burden of discrimination in
 Zimbabwean society. All women are still vulnerable to
 traditional law, particularly concerning inheritance
 practices. The proposed Intestate Succession Law, dealing
 
 
 381
 ZIMBABWE
 with inheritance when there is no valid will, aims to prevent
 any distribution of property before the court has been
 informed of a death and an officer is appointed to administer
 the estate. The court will not distribute the estate unless
 the surviving spouse and children are allowed to live in the
 family house. The contribution of wives to family property
 was recognized in the Matrimonial Causes Act passed in late
 1985, which requires that family assets be distributed
 equitably when couples divorce. Despite the Government's
 actions on women's rights, the tradition of "lobola"
 (bride-price) continues. Police attempts to crack down on
 prostitution in 1986, prior to the Non-Aligned Movement Summit
 meeting, led to the indiscriminate harassment and detention of
 numbers of innocent women and sparked public and parliamentary
 debate.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The 1985 Labor Relations Act calls for strict enforcement of
 acceptable standards of health and safety. Under Zimbabwe
 law, the working age for the formalized economy is 18, but it
 is possible to begin an apprenticeship at age 16. The
 workweek can be as high as 60 hours, but averages 44 hours.
 The law prescribes a 24-hour rest period each week. There
 were 14,000 work-related accidents and illnesses in 1985 among
 the 1 million workers covered by government labor statistics.
 Minimum wage levels in Zimbabwe are set by the Government
 along sectoral lines. The current level for agroindustrial
 workers is about $73 per month. The minimum for domestics is
 $57. The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions has called upon
 the Government to establish a minimum "living wage" for its
 members of $162 per month. The Government has responded by
 saying that future increases will be tied to increases in
 national productivity, which will not permit the substantial
 increases in the foreseeable future that would be required to
 meet the unions' demand.
