 BELARUS
 Belarus has a government in which nearly all power rests in the hands of the
 President. Since his election in July 1994 as the country's first President, Aleksandr
 Lukashenko has steadily amassed power. He held a November 1996 referendum to
 amend the 1994 Constitution, which broadened his powers and extended his term
 in office. The President ignored the then Constitutional Court's ruling that the Con-
 stitution could not be amended by referendum, and implemented the referendum's
 provisions. As a result of the President's actions, the Government and political sys-
 tem are based on the November 1996 version of the Constitution, which was adopt-
 ed in an unconstitutional manner. Most members of the international community
 criticized the results of the flawed referendum because it violated fundamental
 democratic principles, and they do not recognize the legitimacy of the 1996 Constitu-
 tion or the legislature. Although the 1996 Constitution provides for executive, legis-
 lative, and judicial branches it does not provide adequate checks and balances and,
 as a result, nearly all authority rests in the hands of the President. The President
 appoints the Cabinet of Ministers, the executive heads of the country's 6 provinces,
 and 6 of the 12 Constitutional Court Justices (including the Chair, as well as the
 Chairs of the Supreme and Supreme Economic Courts). Presidential decrees made
 when the legislature is out of session have the force of law, except-in theory-in
 those cases restricted by the 1996 Constitution. The 1996 Constitution also allows
 the President to issue decrees having the force of law in circumstances of "specific
 necessity and urgency, "a provision that President Lukashenko has broadly inter-
 preted. Citing the referendum results, which created a bicameral legislature, Presi-
 dent Lukashenko urged legislators to defect from the legitimate parliament, which
 he disbanded in November 1996. The acting legislature was not directly elected but
 was created out of the remnants of the former parliament through a combination
 of volunteers, presidential appointments, and regional council elections. The Con-
 stitution limits the legislature to meeting twice per year for no more than a total
 of 170 days. The judiciary is not independent.
 The Committee for State Security (KGB) and Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD),
 both answerable to the President, continued to be the chief law enforcement and po-
 lice organs. Under President Lukashenko's direction, the Presidential Guard-ini-
 tially created to protect senior officials--continued to act against the President's po-
 litical enemies, with no judicial or legislative oversight. Members of the security
 forces committed numerous human rights abuses.
 The economy grew in 1997, largely due to government credits to state enterprises.
 Economic experts do not consider this approach to growth sustainable over time.
 The Government continued limited, small-scale privatization, but did not take steps
 toward privatizing or restructuring large state enterprises. Most state enterprises
 and collective farms reportedly operate at a loss. The Government controls the
 prices of staple food products. The Government's exchange rate policy has resulted
 in a critical shortage of foreign currency reserves and stifled the export sector. Per
 capita gross national product was $1,308 in 1996. Leading exports are transport ve-
 hicles, mineral products, and machinery. The majority of workers are employed in
 the industrial and agricultural sectors. While standards of living continue to decline
 for many segments of society, people sustain themselves through unreported eco-
 nomic activity and kitchen gardens.
 The Government's human rights record again worsened significantly as the Presi-
 dent continued to lead Belarus back toward Soviet-era authoritarian practices. The
 Government severely limits the right of citizens to change their government. Secu-
 rity forces reportedly beat detainees and prisoners regularly. Severe hazing in mili-
 tary units abated, but was not eradicated. Prison conditions remained poor. Security
 forces arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens.
 Prolonged detention and delays in trials were common. The security services in-
 fringed on citizens' privacy rights and monitored the activities of opposition politi-
 cians and other segments of the population closely. Restrictions on freedoms of
 speech, the press, and peaceful assembly all increased and the Government did not
 
 
 978
 respect freedom of association. Formations of MVD troops used force to break up
 political demonstrations and again made mass arrests.
 International human rights monitors were closely monitored, and frequently har-
 assed. Discrimination and domestic violence against women remained significant
 problems. Authorities continued to restrict workers' rights to associate freely and to
 organize and bargain collectively. The Government continued to restrict worker
 rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Tortu.-e and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1996 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person and specifically
 prohibits torture, as well as cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment. However, po-
 lice and prison guards reportedly regularly beat detainees. Law enforcement and
 prison officials may use physical force against detainees and prisoners if the latter
 are violent, have refused to obey the instructions of the prison administration, or
 have "maliciously" violated the terms of their sentences. However, human rights
 monitors credibly report that investigators coerce confessions using physical and
 psychological pressure. Although such behavior is against the law, the Government
 seldom, if ever, punishes people who commit such abuses. Guards used force against
 the detainees to coerce confessions as well as during routine activities.
 In July and August, security forces detained seven employees of the Russian tele-
 vision station ORT, and charged them with attempting to illegally cross the
 Belarusian-Lithuanian border (see Section 1.d. and 2.a.) Two of the journalists, Rus-
 sian citizen Anatoliy Adamchuk and Belarusian citizen Dimitry Zavadsky, sent pur-
 ported confession letters to President Lukashenko, but after their respective re-
 leases, each claimed that the letters were written under duress and psychological
 pressure.
 The Ministry of Defense announced in 1996 that "dedovshchina," the practice of
 hazing new recruits, would no longer be tolerated. This practice of severe harass-
 ment and physical abuse of new draftees by senior soldiers to maintain strict dis-
 cipline has abated, but human rights groups continue to receive some reports that
 hazing continues and that the military does not consistently punish offenders.
 Prison conditions are poor, and are marked by severe overcrowding, shortages of
 food and medicine, and the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis.
 Conditions at prison hospitals are similarly poor, according to human rights mon-
 itors. Detainees in pretrial detention facilities also reported poor conditions and de-
 nial of medical treatment, which contributed to declining health while they awaited
 trial.
 Former National Bank Chairwoman Tamara Vinnikova's attorney reported that
 Vinnikova suffered from a serious kidney ailment and cancer. Vinnikova, who had
 been detained since January without formal charge (see Section 1.d. and Section 5),
 petitioned to seek treatment at a facility other than the KGB prison clinic, which
 is regarded as inferior to other hospitals (see Sections 1.d. and I.e.). She was re-
 leased from detention in November but remains under house arrest.
 Prison officials refused proper medical treatment to Albert Lavrenev, a Jewish
 doctor, detained between July 1996 and August 1997 on the charge of complicity in
 the murder of his elderly neighbor (see Section i.e. and Section 5). According to his
 family and local human rights observers, Lavrenev's shoulder was broken by prison
 guards while he was in detention; he also had a kidney ailment. With Lavrenev's
 health in serious jeopardy, a judge released Lavrenev in August pending a new trial.
 Human rights monitors were granted access to observe prison conditions, though
 the Government did not honor some requests to meet with individual prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Belarus has only slightly amended its So-
 viet-era law on detention. Security forces arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens,
 most often in connection with demonstrations, some of which were not authorized.
 The Criminal Procedure Code provides that police may detain a person suspected
 of a crime for 24 hours without a warrant, within which time the procurator is noti-
 fied. The procurator then has 48 hours to review the legality of the detention. If
 the procurator deems the detention legal, a suspect can be held for a maximum of
 10 days without formal charge. However, usually, once the decision is made to hold
 a suspect, a formal charge is made. Once a suspect is charged, a trial must be initi-
 ated within 2 months, although in some cases the Procurator General can extend
 pretrial detention to 18 months to allow for further investigation. Alternatively, a
 
 
 979
 suspect who has been charged can be released on a written pledge not to flee, in
 which case there is no time limit on the pretrial investigation. The law allows de-
 tainees the right to apply to the court (rather than the procurator) to determine the
 legality of their detentions. In practice, however, suspects' appeals to have their de-
 tentions reviewed by the courts frequently are suppressed because the detainees are
 at the mercy of investigators and detention officials are unwilling to forward the ap-
 peals. According to the Belarusian Helsinki Committee, there are 65,000 persons in
 detention; no statistics are available as to the number of persons who are in pretrial
 detention and the length of their detentions.
 By law detainees may be allowed unlimited access to legal counsel and, for those
 who cannot afford counsel, the court appoints a lawyer. However, investigators rou-
 tinely fail to inform detainees of their rights and conduct preliminary interrogations
 without giving detainees an opportunity to consult counsel. The information gained
 is then used against the defendant in court.
 Prisoners and lawyers both report restrictions on consultations. In August inves-
 tigators reportedly confiscated notes taken by an attorney during a private meeting
 with her client, Dimitry Zavadsky, a journalist for Russian television who was de-
 tained and charged with illegally working on crossing the Belarusian-Lithuanian
 border while doing a news story about the border. (See Section 2.a.)
 There were hundreds of political detainees during the year. Most were peaceful
 participants in antigovernment demonstrations who were held anyhere from sev-
 eral hours to several days. The police also detained journalists (see Section 2.a.).
 Throughout the spring, unidentified, nonuniformed officials working for the security
 services apprehended participants in antigovernment demonstrations (see section
 2.b.). There are credible reports that officers, who presumably worked for the secu-
 rity services, infiltrated the antigovernment demonstrations, and provoked incidents
 that leading to clashes with security forces. Security forces were then given signals
 indicating which demonstrators to follow in order to apprehend them at their
 homes.
 Security forces occasionally preemptively apprehended organizers and individuals
 considered to be potential participants prior to demonstrations, including those that
 had been sanctioned by the Government (see Section 2.b.). On February 13, militia
 officers detained Vitaly Umreiko, a member of the youth wing of the Belarusian
 Popular Front, and reportedly sentenced him to 5 days in prison for his alleged fail-
 ure to pay a fine for a past offense. The militia reportedly offered to release him
 if he promised to urge participants in the following day's antigovernment protest to
 Oni pril; 2, polie frcibly detained former chairman of the Supreme Soviet
 Stanislav Shushkevich while he was on his way to an art exhibit, apparently be-
 cause they mistakenly assumed that he would take part in a simultaneous
 antigovernment demonstration occurring elsewhere in the city.
 In May police detained two students from the Belarosian Humanitarian Lyceum
 who happened to be in a location where an unauthorized olitical meeting was
 scheduled to be held. Police reportedly attempted to coerce the students to sign a
 statement attesting to their participation in an unsanctioned demonstration.
 Following demonstrations, police held many detainees incommunicado. Police did
 not allow detainees who participated in demonstrations, including minor children,
 to inform their families of their whereabouts. Due to the large numbers of detainees
 after antigovernment rallies, police moved detainees outside of the district where al-
 leged offenses took place, in violation of the law. Noting this trend, the Belarusian
 Helsinki Committee began to send monitors to all of the Minsk area detention facili-
 ties after demonstrations to ascertain which persons had been picked up and inform
 their families.
 Following the March 15 demonstration marking the anniversary of the adoption
 of the superseded 1994 Constitution as a protest against the implementation of the
 1996 Constitution, police officers attempted to detain the organizers of the event.
 They went to opposition leader Gennadiy Karpenko's home, but Karpenko refused
 to allow the officers in, citing a provision of the law that allows citizens to deny po-
 lice entry after 10:00 p.m. The following day, police officers returned to Karpenko's
 home with dogs, but he was not there. On March 17, Karpenko telephoned for an
 ambulance because he was suffering from high blood pressure. The police, who ap-
 parently were monitoring Karpenko's telephone or home, used the opportunity to
 enter his apartment in another attempt to arrest him and demand that he sign a
 confession that he had organized an unauthorized demonstration. A doctor con-
 firmed that Karpenko required hospitalization, and he remained in the hospital
 with a police guard for over a week.
 According to the Belarus League for Human Rights, on May 1, police detained
 Vladimir Lysko for participating in an antigovernment rally on March 23 and for
 
 
 980
 allegedly resisting arrest, despite the fact that Lysko had already been fined for the
 same charge.
 In addition to the hundreds of antigovernment protesters who were held for sev-
 eral hours or days, there were severa prominent political detainees who were held
 for as long as 10 months. In June poet Slavomir Adamovich, who was detained in
 1996 and accused of inciting a terrorist act with the publication of his poem "To Kill
 A President," was sentenced to 10 months in prison (see Section 2.a.). The court
 ruled that the poem was not intended to incite a terrorist act, but determined that
 it was insulting to a government figure. The court determined that the 10 months
 Adamovich spent in pretrial detention counted against his sentence and he was re-
 leased.
 Former National Bank Chairwoman Tamara Vinnikova was arrested in January
 on allegations of malfeasance during her previous tenure as head of a state bank.
 The timing of her arrest, coinciding with her increasing public challenges to
 Lukashenko's economic policies, suggested a political motivation, It is also widely
 believed that the presidential administration was already aware of the alleged ille-
 gal acts at the time of her appointment as national bank chairwoman. Moreover,
 during the course of her 10-month detention her health seriously declined, but until
 November the court repeatedly denied her appeals for release to seek proper medi-
 cal treatment on a pledge not to flee.
 In August police in the town of Stolptsy detained students Alexei Shidlovskiy (22
 years old) and Vadim Labkovich (16 years old), both members of the youth branch
 of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front (BNF), for "malicious hooliganism." The
 pair are accused of spray painting "Long Live Belarus" and antipresidential slogans
 on walls in the town. They are also accused of replacing the state flag with the
 white-red-white banner of independent Belarus on several buildings. Despite the
 nonviolent nature of the alleged crime (and despite the fact that Labkovich is a
 minor), both were denied release pending trial. According to credible human rights
 monitors, Shidlovsky's wife, Ina Pemenava, was threatened by the KGB and coerced
 into accusing a prominent BNF leader of raping her; otherwise, the KGB reportedly
 warned, she never would see her husband alive. After the retraction, she was
 threatened with expulsion from her university (see Section 2.b.). Shidlovsky and
 Labkovich remained in pretrial detention at year's end.
 On December 20, 1996, the Government granted amnesty to five of the seven
 Ukrainian nationalists who were detained in conjunction with an April 26, 1996,
 antigovernment rally, and released the other two in January 1997 after a court re-
 duced their sentences to time already served.
 Police also detained and coerced a number of journalists. Pavel Sheremet and
 Dimitry Zavadsky, both Belarusian citizens working for the Russian television net-
 work ORT, whose reporting was critical of the Government, were apparently de-
 tained for political reasons. In July security forces detained the pair, along with two
 of their colleagues and charged them with illegally attempting to cross the
 Belarusian-Lithuanian border. They had been working on a news story about the
 border (also see Sections 1.c. and 2.a.). In August a second ORT crew was detained
 on the same charge.
 Exile is not expressly forbidden in the 1996 Constitution, but it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but in practice the judiciary is not independent and is largely unable to act
 as a check on the executive branch and its agents. The Supreme Council passed leg-
 islation to support the independence of the judiciary in 1995, but these reforms were
 not implemented. Without major structural reforms, the independence of the judici-
 ary cannot be realized. The November 1996 constitutional referendum further sub-
 ordinated the judiciary to the executive branch by giving the President the power
 to appoint 6 of the 12 members of the Constitutional Court, including the Chairman.
 The remaining six are appointed by the Council of the Republic, which itself is com-
 posed of individuals appointed by the President or elected by individuals influenced
 bY the President. The President also appoints the Chairmen of the Constitutional
 Court, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Economic Court. The President also
 has authority under the Constitution to appoint and dismiss all district and military
 judges.
 TWe criminal justice system, following the former Soviet model, has three tiers:
 district courts, regional courts, and the Supreme Court. Several modifications have
 been made, brought about by the passage of the new Constitution, including direct
 presidential appointments. A Constitutional Court was established in 1994 to adju-
 dicate serious constitutional issues but, dependent on the executive branch, it does
 not challenge presidential initiatives. In addition, the Constitutional Court has no
 means to enforce its decisions.
 
 
 981
 Judges adjudicate trials; only in capital offense trials in which the defendant
 p leads not guilty and demands a jury trial do juries determine innocence or guilt.
 Judges are dependent on the Ministry of Justice for sustaining the court infrastruc-
 ture and on local executive branch officials for providing their personal housing. In
 addition, judges owe their positions to the President. Although the procurator's of-
 fice categorically denies it, "telephone justice" (the practice of executive and local au-
 thorities dictating to the courts the outcome of trials) is widely reported to continue.
 Prosecutors, like the courts, are organized into offices at the district, regional, and
 republic levels. They are ultimately responsible to, and serve at the pleasure of, the
 Procurator General who, according to the Constitution, is appointed by the Council
 of the Republic.
 Partly in ostensible response to allegedly exorbitant defense attorneys' fees, Presi-
 dent Lukashenko issued a decree (number 12) in May which, according to inter-
 national legal experts and human rights monitors, seriously compromises the inde-
 pendence of lawyers from the Government. The decree subordinates all lawyers to
 the Ministry of Justice, which now controls the licensing of lawyers. As a result of
 this decree, several lawyers, including President Lukashenko's political opponents
 (such as former Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Mecheslav Gryb) were stripped of
 their licenses.
 The Constitution provides for public trials, although exceptions can be made in
 cases established by law (for example, in cases of rape or on grounds of national
 security). Defendants have the legal right to attend proceedings, confront witnesses,
 and present evidence on their own behalf. However, these rights are not always re-
 spected in practice. Defendants' legal right to be represented by counsel is also not
 always respected in practice. While the 1996 Constitution establishes a presumption
 of innocence, in practice defendants frequently must prove their innocence.
 Trials for those detained on misdemeanor charges following antigovernment pro-
 tests throughout the spring (see Section 1.d.) were subjected to assembly-line style
 trials, without the right to counsel or the opportunity to present evidence or call wit-
 nesses. In criminal cases, the prosecution has the right to appeal a not-guilty verdict
 to a higher court. In at least one case, the pressure to appeal appeared to be applied
 by external forces in what appears to be a vendetta against a defendant (see Sec-
 tions 1.c, 1.e, and 5.).
 Both defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal, and most criminal
 cases are appealed, according to legal sources. In appeals, neither defendants nor
 witnesses appear before the court; the court merely reviews the protocol and other
 documents from the lower court's trial. Appeals rarely result in reversals of verdicts.
 The law allows persons who have been acquitted of a crime to be retried by a higher
 court for the same charge.
 Despite a lack of credible evidence, police detained Albert Lavrenev, in July 1996
 and charged him with arranging the mortal beating of his elderly neighbor (see Sec-
 tions 1.c. and Section 5). A lower court convicted Lavrenev in September 1996. Upon
 Lavrenev's appeal, the Supreme court ruled that the trial had many procedural vio-
 lations and ordered a new trial. The lower court repeatedly delayed the new trial,
 allegedly in order to allow further investigation. In the meantime, Lavrenev's health
 seriously declined due to beatings by prison guards while in detention. His petitions
 to be released with a pledge not to leave Minsk were denied. The State based its
 case almost entirely on the testimony of the victim's son, who recounted what he
 alleged that his mother had told him following the beating. At the new trial in July,
 however, medical experts testified that the victim could not have communicated an
 identification of her attacker due to the severity of her injuries. The judge ruled that
 another panel of medical experts should review the case, but he released Lavrenev
 pending the next trial. Lavrenev was acquitted in November but under obvious pres-
 sure from the deceased's family, at year's end the case was being appealed to the
 Supreme Court.
 There were no reports of political prisoners at year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Intererence With Priacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Govern-
 ment monitoring of residences and telephones continued unabated. The KGB is
 widely believed to enter homes without warrants, conduct unauthorized searches,
 and also to read mail. Political, human rights, and other nongovernmental organiza-
 tions believe that their conversations and correspondence are routinely monitored
 by the security services. Opposition figures have reported a reluctance to visit some
 foreign embassies for fear of reprisal.
 The KGB, the MVD, and certain border guard detachments have the right to re-
 quest permission to install wiretaps, but legally must obtain a prosecutor's pernis-
 sion before installation. The Presidential Guard formed in 1995 reportedly con-
 ducted surveillance activities of the President's political opponents. There is no judi-
 
 
 982
 cial or legislative oversight of the Presidential Guard's budget or activities, and the
 executive branch has repeatedly thwarted attempts to exercise such oversight.
 The Government makes no secret of the security service's activities or capabilities
 and conducts active sureillaice of opponents of the Lukashenko Government. Mili-
 tia assigned to stand pst outside diplomatic missions are known to keep records
 of visits by political opposition leaders.
 In September a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official told an NGO representative of
 the Belarusian Sors Foundation, that the Ministry knew of a decision made at a
 private meeting in Minsk between the OSI and BSF representatives to close the
 Soros Foundation, even before the OSI or the BSF told the Ministry or made the
 news public.
 Nearly all opposition political figures assume that the Government monitors their
 activities and conversations. The Lukashenko Government did nothing to refute
 these assumptions. Indeed, government officials do not appear to be exempt from
 monitoring.
 In March the Ministry of Communications renegotiated contracts for supplying
 telephone service. The new contracts forbid subscribers from using telephone com-
 munications for purposes that run counter to state interests and public order. The
 Ministry has the right to terminate telephone service to those who breach this provi-
 sion. There are no known instances of the Ministry invoking this provision.
 In March a new government decree prohibited the import of printed, audio, and
 video news material (see Section 2.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 as well as the freedom to receive, retain, and disseminate information, but the Gov-
 ernment restricts these rights in practice. The executive branch continued its sup-
 pression of freedom of speech through a decree limiting citizens' right to express
 their opinions. Although the Constitution prohibits monopoly of mass media, the
 Government also continued to severely restrict the right to a free press through
 near-monopolies on the means of production and on national level broadcast media,
 and by denying accreditation to journalists critical of the regime. The Government
 also kept up economic pressure on the independent media by pressuring advertisers
 to withdraw advertisements and evicting newspapers from their offices. Employees
 at state-run enterprises are discouraedi from subscribing to independent journals.
 In December 1995, on instructions from President Lukashenko, the state publish-
 ing house refused to renew printing contracts with the four leading independent
 newspapers, which prompted them to publish in Lithuania. Although the state pub-
 lishing house has since offered to publish these independent newspapers, they con-
 tinue to use firms in Lithuania.
 In January 1996 the President signed a decree ordering that all editors-in-chief
 of state-supported newspapers would henceforth be official state employees and
 would become members of the appropriate level Government council. Another decree
 granted the Ministry of Press authority to assign graduates of state-supported jour-
 nalism schools to work in state-owned media organizations as a means of payment
 for their schooling. These decrees remain in effect.
 A presidential decree (number 5), issued in March prohibits a range of broadly
 defined activities and limits freedom of expression. For example, the decree pro-
 hibits individuals from carrying placards or flags bearing emblems that are not offi-
 cially registered with the State, as well as "emblems, symbols, and posters whose
 content is intended to harm the State and public order, rights, and legal interests
 of the citizens." The decree also bans activities that are "humiliating to the dignity
 and honor of the executive persons of State bodies."
 Following the spring demonstrations, there were credible reports that individuals
 were detained and fined for violations of the decree's provisions against displaying
 unrestered symbols. The decree effectively bans the dis play of the white-red-white
 flag that was the first independence-era national flag. Police detained several soccer
 fans carrying the white-red-white flag after a June match. In addition, at least one
 man was arrested for carrying a European Union flag at an antigovernment rally.
 In March the State Committee for the Press suspended the issuance of licenses,
 pending amendments to the laws governing the issuance of permits both for publish-
 ng and for purchasing printing equipment. Since the promulgation of the new law
 in July, there were no reports t at i censes were denied.
 In  March the Council of Ministers issued a decree (number 218)that prohibited
 and restricted the movement of goods across the customs border. The decree specifi-
 cally prohibits the import and export of printed, audio, and video materials or other
 news media containing information that could damage the economic and political in-
 terests of the country. Although it has not been widely enforced, the decree targets,
 
 
 among others, those independent newspapers that publish in Lithuania. Even prior
 to the decree's entry into force, members of the State Security Committee con-
 fiscated the independent newspaper Belarusian Business News at the Lithuanian
 border, following an inspection, the authorities allowed the newspaper to be deliv-
 ered to Minsk. On March 25 border guards detained for several hours the editor of
 the independent newspaper Narodnaya Volya, who was returning to Belarus from
 Lithuania with the day's edition of the newspaper.
 In March security personnel at the Belarusian-Lithuanian border prevented a
 crew from the Russian television network NTV from taking a videotape into Lithua-
 nia for transmission to Moscow (earlier the state broadcasting facility banned the
 crew from transmitting the video material from Minsk).
 Independent newspapers are widely available in Minsk, but outside of the capital
 most towns carry only the local newspapers (some of which are independent). The
 publisher of a leading independent newspaper received a grant from a foreign orga-
 nization to establish an alternative, private distribution system so that independent
 publications do not have to rely on the state.
 Russian television stations rely on the Belarsian Television and Radio (B-TR)
 broadcasting facility to transmit material to Moscow. On several occasions, B-TR re-
 fused to transmit video material for Russian television stations. According to NTV,
 in March a representative of the presidential administration instructed crews from
 Russian television networks in Mink not to transmit footage of opposition marches
 and rallies. Subsequently, the day after a demonstration, security guards denied the
 Russian television crews access to the B-TR facility. NTV also claims that a B-TR
 internal instruction requires B-TR officials to preview material before it is transmit-
 ted abroad. It is unclear if this is done in practice.
 A July Council of Ministers decree nullified the accreditation of all correspondents
 and required all foreign media correspondents to apply for reaccreditation with the
 Ministry of Foreign   airs;   e application form for accreditation requests bio-
 graphic information, as well as a record of the applicant's journalistic activity. Jour-
 nalists who are residents of Belarus are also required to register with the state tax
 authorities. The results of the decree are still unclear, although at year's end it does
 not appear that the Government has used the decree as a tool to exclude certain
 journaiists.
 The Defamation La w      sis    tincion between private and public persons for
 the purposes of lawsuits for defamation of character. A public figure who has been
 criticized for poor performance in office may ask the public prosecutor to sue the
 newspaper that printed the criticism.
 The nationalist poet Slavomir Adamovich was detained in April 1996 for publish-
 ing a poem titled i'o Kill a President," and was originally charged with inciting a
 terrorist act. In June the court convicted him of insulting a state official, although
 nowhere in the poem does Adamovich name any specific president. In addition, the
 court also convicted him for attempting to cross a state border (he attempted to flee
 the country when released pending trial). The court ruled that the time Adamovich
 served in pretrial detention constituted fulfillment of his sentence.
 In September the State initiated an investation against Central Election Com-
 mission Chairman Victor Gonchar, charging that Gonchar defamed the President in
 his report on Lukashenko's (and the Government's) violations of the 1994 Constitu-
 tion during the 1996 referendum.
 In February the upper house of the acting legislature denied reporters for Radio
 Liberty, Reuters, the Latvian newspapers Belaursian Business News and Free News
 Plus access to a press conference, despite the fact that the journalists were properly
 accredited.
 Grodno municipal authorities, who work directly for the President under his
 "vertikal" (from the top down) power structure, canceled a lease agreement with the
 independent newspaper "Paonya" in April, evicting the newspaper from its office.
 As compensation the municipal authorities offered to move the newspaper to a di-
 lapidated space with no plumbing or communications connections.
 On several occasions in the spring, police beat and detained journalists covering
 antigovernment demonstrations (see Sections 1.c. and 1.d.). At an April 2 unauthor-
 ized demonstration to protest the signing of a union treaty with Russia, riot police
 beat several journalists, three of them severely, according to a report by the human
 rights  up Article 19. Journalists also reported on several occasio" ns that police de-
 stroyed or onfiscated their p hotographa and video material. In some cases, police
 charged journalists covering demonstrations with violating pubic order.
 In Otober two unidentified men abduted Oleg Babemtn, a correspondent for the
 independent newspaper Imya, and took him outside Minsk, where they beat him.
 They warned Babenin to cease his critical articles about the authorities. In Novem-
 ber the editor of Imya received a warning that satirical collages appearing in several

 issues of the newspaper defamed the president, and the newspaper could be stripped
 of its license. At year's end, Imya's attorney continued to appeal the charges, but
 the newspaper ceased printing the collages due to fear of further reprisals.
 Also in November, the state Press Committee issued two warnings to the largest
 independent newspaper, Svaboda, alleging that several articles violated the law by
 aiming to incite social unrest. After 15 minutes of deliberation, the Supreme Eco-
 nomic Court in December ruled to close Svaboda. At year's end, an appeal was pend-
 in   December unknown assailants attacked film director Yuriv Khashchevatskv in
 his studio. The attack is credibly believed to be in response to Khasbchevatsky ilm,
 An Ordinary President, a critical, satirical portrait of President Lukashenko. The
 Government has banned the film; in January human rights monitors reported that
 militia broke into a private cable company studio in Grodno and detained the cam-
 eraman after the film was aired.
 In December customs officers at the Belarusian-Polish border confiscated mate-
 rials documenting human rights violations from Viktor Ivashkevich, the editor of
 the Free Trade Union newspaper, Rabochy. Ivashkevich intended to present the ma-
 terials at a press conference in Warsaw.
 Belarusian Television and Radio maintained its monopoly as the only nationwide
 television station. Its news programs regularly featured reporting biased in favor of
 the Government, and refused to provide an outlet for opposing viewpoints. Local,
 independent television stations operated in some areas, and were relatively
 unimpeded in reporting on local news. However, some of these stations reported
 that they were under pressure not to report on national level issues, or were subject
 to censorship.
 The Government did not reopen Radio 101.2, the sole Belarusian language inde-
 pendent station that authorities shut down in 1996. President Lukashenko offered
 to transfer Radio 101.2 to a government-subsidized presidential youth organization,
 the Belarusian Patriotic Union of Youth (BPUY), but the group had not taken over
 the freqency at year's end.
 In Marchthe Miistry of Foreign Affairs followed through on earlier threats by
 stripping Russian Television Network NTV correspondent Alexandr Stupnikov of his
 accreditation. An outspoken critic of the President, Stupnikov was accused by the
 Government of "tendentious" reporting and expelled 4 days after losing his accredi-
 tation. (see Section 5.).
 In July the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revoked the accreditation of Pavel
 Sheremet, a Belarusian citizen and bureau chief for the Russian public television
 network (ORT) in Minsk, following his critical commentary on the Government's ex-
 penditures for the July 3-5 National Day and M insk's 930th anniversary celebra-
 tions. The Government also accused Sheremet of having a history of tendentious re-
 porting. On July 22, the authoritie  detained Sheremet and three other ORT em-
 ployees who were attempting to film an unguarded section of the Belarusian-Lithua-
 nian border. After paying a fine, the four were released. On July 26, they were
 again detained, this time charged with illegally attempting to cross the border. The
 Government accused ORT managers of engineering a provocation. In August the au-
 thorities detained four other ORT employees for attempting to film in the same area
 as Sheremet. Following confessions by two of the men (which beth later said were
 coerced) and Russian Government intervention, all but Sheremet were released by
 September 5. The authorities released Sheremet in October, after Russian President
 Yeltsin exerted pressure on Lukashenko. Sheremet and Zavadsky went on trial in
 December and were still on trial at year's end.
 In March the Government expelled a foreign diplomat who had been monitoring
 a public protest for allegedly taking part in an antigovernment rally.
 The observance of academic freedom is mixed. University students and academics
 are free to pursue virtually any course of study or research. However, once a course
 of study is chosen, state university students must follow a prescribed curriculum.
 Throughout the    year, the   Government harassed    students  engaged  in
 antigovernment activities, such as demonstrations. There were reports that state
 universities expelled students for their political activities. The pro-presidential, gov-
 ernment-funded youth organization, the Belarusian Patriotic Union of Youth, served
 as the regime's watchdogagainst antigovernment activities. Moreover, there are re-
 ports that members of the BPUY received preferential treatment at state schools.
 In April the Council of Ministers issued a decree effective as of the 1997-98 aca-
 demic year requiring students who receive free university education from the State
 to accept jobs assigned by the Government upon graduation.
 The Government continued to close schools that teach in the Belarusian language.
 According to the Belarusian League for Human Rights, there are now less than half
 the number of schools teaching in the Belarusian language than in 1991. In August
 
 
 985
 a Grodno court ruled that although Belarusian and Russian languages are granted
 equal status as state languages by the Constitution, the school system is not obli-
 gated to provide education in the Belarusian language.
 In August the Government agreed to allow the Belarusian Humanities Lyceum
 (the only Belarusian language high school in Minsk) to continue occupying its cur-
 rent premise for another year, following protests by parents angry at a plan by the
 presidential administration to take over the building.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly; however, the Government restricts this right in prac-
 tice. Organizers must apply at least 15 days in advance to local officials for permis-
 sion to conduct a demonstration, rally, or meeting. The local government must re-
 spond with a decision not later than 5 days prior to the scheduled event.
 In March President Lukashenko issued a decree (number 5) to regulate what he
 termed the "orgy' of street protests taking place. The decree further limits citizens'
 ability to assemble peacefully by restricting the locations where rallies may take
 place and allowing local autbomties to put strict limits on the number of partici-
 pants. The decree also prohibits the display of unregistered flags and symbols, as
 well as placards bearing messages deemed threatening to the State or public order
 (see Section 2.a.). The decree, along with subsequent amendments adopted by the
 acting legislature, imposes severe penalties on those who violate the law, particu-
 larly the organizers of events. The courts punished organizers of rallies with fines
 of $800 to$1,000, wbich are exeptionally high in a ountry where the average
 monthly wage is under *100. Although the decree allows for either monetary fines
 or up to 15 days' detention, the courts frequently imposed the fines knowing that
 those convicted could not pay. When individuals failed to pay fines, authorities
 threatened to confiscate their property. Although assessments were made, there are
 no known instances of property actually being confiscated as of year's end.
 Public demonstrations occurred frequently but always under strict government
 control; some demonstrations and marches, usually unsanctioned, ended with police
 beatings, mass detentions, and assembly-line trials. When force was used against
 demonstrators, it is unclear to what degree the demonstrators themselves may have
 provoked such a response. However, there were credible reports that the security
 services placed plainclothes provocateurs in the crowds (see Section 1.d.).
 Throughout the spring police used force to disperse demonstrators. On Februa
 14, riot police used truncheons and tear gas against students attempting to m=
 through Minsk to deliver statements to fbreign missions in support of Belarusian
 integration into Europe. Minsk city authorities permitted a rally on March 10 to op-
 pose integration with Russia, but limited participation to 40 people. Nearly 1,000
 people turned out, prompting police to forcibly disperse the crowd.
 On March 14, riot poice deployed and prevented students from marching to for-
 eign missions in Minsk to express support for a democratic Belarus integrated into
 Europe. Police used bullhorns to remind the assembled marchers that the Minsk
 city authorities had denied permission for the gathering. Security forces randomly
 detained nonparticipants who were in the vicinity of the gathering, including foreign
 residents and journalists, as well as an elderly woman who was collecting bottles.
 On March 23, antigovernment protesters marched along one of Minsk's main thor-
 oughfares without permission. Riot police deployed to block the marchers' path, re-
 sulting in violence between the security troops and protesters that reportedly re-
 sulted in some injuries (although it is unclear who started the fighting). Following
 the 10-minute confrontation , police allowed marchers to assemble peacefully at an
 approved location for a sanctioned rally.
 On April 2, following a peaceful, though unsanctioned, demonstration against the
 signing of a union treaty with Russia, protesters marched without permission to-
 ward the Russian embassy, where they were met by riot police who used truncheons
 to disperse the crowd. Police beat journalists and at least one elderly woman. Presi-
 dent Lukashenko responded to the television footage of police beating the elderly
 woman by publicly claiming that the victim in fact was a young man (disguised as
 a woman) intent on throwing rocks a the police. In September a court fined Nikolai
 Statkevich over $1,000 (Belarusian rubles 27,663,000) for organizing an unauthor-
 ized rally on July 27, the anniversary of the declaration of Belarusian sovereignty.
 Statkevich argued that he had proceeded with the rally because he had petitioned
 the Minsk city authorities for permission in accordance with the law, but the city
 had not denied the petition within the time prescribed by law.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, the Government
 does not respect this right in practice. According to members of parties in opposition
 to the President, opposition groups frequently are denied permission to meet in pub-
 lic buildings. Employees at state-run enterprises are discouraged from joining inde-
 pendent trade unions, and the Ministry of Justice long denied registration to the
 
 
 Congress of Independent Trade Unions (see Section 6.a.). Only in late December did
 the Government, under &nsiderable international pressure, order the Ministry of
 Justice to register the Congress of Independent Trade Unions and lift the 1995 ban
 on the Free Trade Union (see Section 6.a.). The Government regularly used the na-
 tionalist Belarusian Popular Front as a scapegoat, raided its headquarters, and con-
 fiscated leaflets that would have publicized unsanctioned rallies. Government offi-
 cials warned alumni of foreign-sponsored education programs against continued af-
 filiation with their program's sponsoring agency or embassy.
 In September there were 36 registered political parties, 41 registered trade unions
 (9 of which label themselves as free, independent, and democratic), and 1,963 reg-
 istered social organizations. A 1995 decision by the Ministry of Justice required ex-
 isting public associations to reregister. During the reregistration process, the Min-
 istry sometimes found cause to deny reregistration to nongovernmental organiza-
 tions. According to the Belars League for Human Rights, some government officials
 admitted that the process was illegal and that they, therefore, had allowed some
 groups to continue operating under their original registration.
 The Government attempted to limit severely the activities of nongovernmental or-
 ganizations (NGO's), primarily through intrusive and questionable tax audits and
 intimidation of employees. In March following the expulsion of the U.S.-citizen di-
 rector of the Belarusian Soros Foundation for allegedly engaging in political activity,
 the Security Council announced audits against the Belarusian SOROS Foundation
 (BSF), the East-West Center for Strategic Initiatives, and the Children of
 Chornobyl. Under the Law on Public Associations, the Security Council is not au-
 thorized to initiate such audits. In April the Government announced a $3 million
 fine against the BSF for alleged tax and currency law violations. The Government
 also started criminal investigations against BSF employees. As a result of the Gov-
 ernment's campaign of harassment against the BSF, the Foundation closed in Sep-
 tember. The Government subsequently began investigating Belarsian NGO's asso-
 ciated with the BSF.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, how-
 ever, the Government restricts this right in practice. A 1995 Cabinet ofMinisters
 decree controlling religious workers as a means of attempting to protect orthodoxy
 and prevent the growth of evangelizing religions is enforced. Foreigners generally
 are prohibited from preaching or heading churches, at least with respect to what
 the government views as "nontraditional" religions, which include Protestant faiths.
 In September a Belarsian Baptist pastr was arrested for allowing an American
 to lead a prayer group under the p astor's auspices. The pastor was released, but
 a fre was pending at year's end. Bible study meetings involving foreigners were
 raided. An August Council of Ministers' directive prohibits teaching religion at
 youth camps. Citizens are not prohibited from proselytizing, but foreign mission-
 aries may not engage in religious activities outside the institutions that invited
 them. Only religious organizations already registered in Belarus may invite foreign
 cle'th Government and the President encourage a greater role for the Orthodox
 Church, largely as part of an overall strategy to strengthen Slavic unity in the re-
 gion. The effort, however, has not slowed the growth o Roman Catholic and Protes-
 tant churches. The President granted the Orthodox Church special tax and other fi-
 nancial advantages, which other denominations do not enjoy and has declared the
 preservation and development of Orthodox Christianity a "moral necessity." Bishops
 must receive permission from the State Committee on Religious Affairs before trans-
 ferring a foreign priest to another parish.
 Restitution of religious property remained limited in 1997. A key obstacle is the
 lack of a legal basis for restitution of property that was seized during the Soviet
 era and the Nazi occupation. The few returns of property to religious communities
 have been on an individual and inconsistent basis. Over the past several years, the
 Jewish community has successfully lobbied the Government to return three syna-
 gogues in Minsk and several buildings outside the capital. Following extensive ren-
 ovations, the Catholic community in October rededicated a cathedral in Minsk that
 had been returned in recent years. In an address to the Parliament, the Orthodox
 Patriarch urged the Government to move quickly to return religious property.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-According to the Constitution, citizens are free to travel within the
 country and to live and work where they wish. All adults are still issued internal
 passports, which serve as primary identity documents and are required for travel,
 permanent housing, and hotel registration.
 The right to choose one's place of residence, although provided by law, remains
 restricted in practice. Despite its formal abolition by the Soviet Government in Octo-
 ber 1991, the "propiska" (pass) system survives in Belarus. All citizens are required
 
 
 987
 to register their places of residence and may not change them without official per-
 mission. The authorities no longer explicitly limit the number of residence permits
 in Minsk and the five other regional centers, Brest, Grodno Mogilev, Vitebsk, and
 Gomel. However, in order to register, a citizen must already have employment in
 the city. To be employed in the city, however, one must already be registered. These
 conflicting requirements limit citizens' freedom of movement.
 Government regulations on entry and exit require citizens who wish to travel
 abroad to first receive an overseas passport and a "global" exit visa, which is valid
 for from 1 to 5 years. Once a traveler has these documents, the law does not restrict
 travel.
 Following the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet in 1996, the Government took
 measures aimed at limiting the travel of opposition politicians who refused to sub-
 mit to the legislature created by the November 1996 referendum. The Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs announced in December 1996 that those parliamentarians who did
 not join the new legislature could no Ionger travel on their diplomatic passports, de-
 spite the fact that these individuals ha~ been guaranteed that they would retain
 their status as deputies until their terms of office expired. Although the diplomatic
 passports were not confiscated, the border guards reportedly had ablacklist of oppo-
 sition members who were to be denied exit from the country if they used a dilo-
 maticpassprt. In January the border guards refused to grant permission to travel
 aboadon their diplomatic passports to former Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav
 Shushkevich and Anatoliy Lebedko, both members of the disbanded parliament. A
 number of members of the disbanded parliament have since acquired regular pass-
 ports and been allowed to travel abroad. According to official data, the State did not
 deny any citizen permission to emigrate. However, legislation restricting emigration
 by those with access to "state secrets" remained in effect, and any citizen involved
 in a criminal investigation was also ineligible to emigrate. Prospective emigrants
 who have been refused the right to emigrate, may appeal to the courts.
 The Constitution gives aliens and stateless persons the same rights as citizens,
 except in cases established by law, international agreement, or the Constitution.
 The Constitution also allows the State to grant refuge to persons being persecuted
 in other states for their political and religious convictions, or because of nationality.
 The Government does not have a law on first asylum, nor has it signed readmission
 agreements with any of its neighboring states.
 The Government cooperates with the United High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. In May the
 Government implemented for the first time its 1995 Law on Refugees, granting refu-
 gee status to a group of Afghans. By year's end, the Government had granted official
 refugee status to 30 people and had offered assistance in locating housing and jobs.
 The UNHCR estimates that there are 36,000 potential asylees and 200,000 illegal
 aliens in Belarus. Although the UNHOR reports that the delay in establishing a
 state migration service has made the life of these individuals "very difficult," there
 were no reports of forced expulsion of persons having a valid claim to refugee status,
 or of persons to countries where they feared persecution. In one case, an undocu-
 mented Afghan who had been illegally living in Belarus traveled to Uzbekistan,
 where he was detained by Uzbek authorities. Faced with his deportation to Afghani-
 stan, the Belarsian Government agreed to allow the man back into the country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government severely limits the right of citizens to change their government.
 From November 9-24, 1996, the executive branch conducted a controveirsial con-
 stitutional referendum that was neither free nor fair, according to credible inter-
 national observers, including representatives of the European Union and the Orga-
 nization for Security and Cperation in Europe (OSCE). Many members of Par-
 liament and of the Constitutional Court actively opposed President Lukashenko's
 prpsals for both substantive and procedural reasons. The justices asserted that
 the referendum gave Lukashenko control over the legislative and judicial branches
 of government and extended his term in office, criticized it on procedural grounds
 as an unconstitutional means to eliminate the Constitution's checks and balances
 and grant the President virtually unlimited powers.
 In the period leading up to the referendum, opponents of President Lukashenko's
 proposals were denied access to the media, election officials failed to record the
 names of early voters, and no texts of the proposed Constitution were made avail-
 able to voters until several days after people began voting. As a result of these irreg-
 ularities, the head of the Central Election Commission (CEC) announced prior to the
 event that he would not be able to certify the results of the referendum. President
 Lukashenko promptly fired him, although the Constitution in force at the time gave
 
 
 988
 the Parliament the exclusive authority to appoint and dismiss the CEC Chairman.
 Members of the security forces forcibly removed the head of the CEC from his office.
 Shortly thereafter, the Prime Minister resigned     in  protest of President
 Lukashenko's refusal to cancel the widely criticized referendum.
 Most members of the international community chose not to send election monitors
 to observe the referendum because of the illegitimacy of the entire process. Human
 rights organizations, including the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the Com-
 mittee to Protect Journalists, and Human Rights Watch, protested the conduct of
 the referendum.
 The Constitutional Court formally ruled that the issues posed in President
 Lukashenko's referendum could not be legally decided through a referendum, and
 that its results should be purely advisory, consistent with the Constitution. How-
 ever, after winning the referendum-according to the Government's results-Presi-
 dent Lukashenko began to implement it immediately. The new Constitution estab-
 lished a bicameral legislature. Its 110-member lower house was formed out of the
 membership of the existing Supreme Soviet; deputies volunteered or were lured by
 prmises of free housing and other benefits to serve in the new body. The 64-mem-
 ber upper house was created by a combination of presidential appointments and
 elections by the six oblast councils and the Minsk City Council. The transition left
 86 electoral districts unrepresented because the new Constitution reduced the num-
 ber of representatives, andaso because a full Supreme Soviet had never been seat-
 ed, largely due to the executive branch's intervention in the 1995 elections.
 There are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics and govern-
 ment. However, with the exception of the judiciary, social barriers to women in poli-
 tics are strong, and men hold virtually all leadership positions. In the acting legisla-
 ture, women hold 19 of 110 seats in the upper house and 5 of 64 in the lower house.
 The Deputy Chair of the upper house is a woman. The Minister of Social Security
 is the only female member of the Council of Ministers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Belarus's worsening human rights record drew the attention of many inter-
 national human rights organizations, and there are several local human rights
 groups active in the country. In general, human rights monitors noted the Govern-
 ment's willingness to discuss human rights, and international organizations were
 not hindered in visiting Belarus. However, human rights monitors reported that the
 Government presented obstacles when they tried to investigate alleged human
 rights violations. The Government monitored their correspondence and telehone
 conversations. Members of the Belarusian Helsinki committee were occasionally ar-
 rested while observing demonstrations. One human rights monitor was punched and
 threatened after trying to gather information on a trial. Another was arrested in
 October while on a human rights fact-finding mission, but was subsequently re-
 leased. Border guards confiscated video material from a foreign member of Human
 Rights Watch/Helsinki.
 The Ministry of Justice claimed that the Belarusian League for Human Rights
 (BLHR) was not properly registered for a period of almost 2 years. In September
 a group of former BLI-R employees, with the complicity of the militia, raided the
 BLIR office, which also served as home to the BLHR chairman Evgeny Novikov
 who is an outspoken critic of the Government and who has presented his findings
 internationally. Within days the BLHR was reregistered under this new group. The
 group accused Novikov of embezzling grant money from the European Union's Tech-
 nical Assistance to the CIS (TACIS) fund, while Novikov countercharged that this
 group tried to blackmail him. In November a police investigator beat Novikov in an
 attept to force a confession to charges of wrongdoing made against him by the new
 The European Union (EU), the Council of Europe (COE), the European Par-
 liament, and the OSCE sent delegations to Belarus to observe the human rights sit-
 uation and discuss the Government's failure to adhere to democratic principles. EU-
 mediated talks between the Government and political opposition broke down over
 what the EU termed the Government's obstructive attitude. In December the Gov-
 ernment agreed, after long resistance, to the establishment of a resident OSCE Ad-
 visory and Monitoring Group in Minsk.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law and have a right,
 without any discrimination, to equal protection of their rights and legitimate inter-
 ests, but it does not specifically prohibit discrimination based on factors such as
 
 
 989
 race, sex, or religion. The Law on Citizenship, passed by the Parliament, grants citi-
 zenship to any person living permanently on the territory of Belarus as of October
 19, 1991. Those who arrived in Belarus after that date and wish to become citizens
 are required to submit an application for citizenship, take an oath to support the
 Constitution, have a legal source of income, and have lived in the country for 7
 years. The 1995 Law on Immigration and Migration provided numerical limits on
 new citizens but the Parliament again failed to budget funds for its implementation.
 Women.-Although statistics are not available, domestic violence including spous-
 al abuse against women is a significant problem, according to women's groups.
 There are Faws against spousal atuse. Knowledgeable sources indicate that police
 generally are not hesitant to enforce the laws against domestic violence and that
 the courts are not reluctant to impose sentences. The main problem, according to
 women's groups, is a general reluctance among women to report incidents of domes-
 tic violence.
 The law requires equal wages for equal work; however, such is not always the
 case in practice. Women have significantly less opportunity for advancement to the
 upper ranks of management. Women report that managers frequently take into con-
 sideration whether a woman has children when considering potential job opportuni-
 ties.
 The level of education of women is higher than that of men. Women make up 58
 percent of workers with a higher education and 66 percent of workers with a spe-
 cialized secondary education. Despite the higher level of education, women are em-
 ployed in lower paying fields, such as health care and education. In these sectors,
 between two-thirds and three-fourths of the employees (mostly women) are living
 beneath the official poverty level. Women are equal to men before the law with re-
 gard to property ownership and inheritance.
 There are active women's groups, most of them focusing on issues such as child
 welfare, environmental concerns in the aftermath of Chernobyl), and preserving the
 family. A private university in Minsk established the country's first gender-studies
 faculty this year.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare and health, par-
 ticularly as related to the consequences of the nuclear accident at Chornobyl, and,
 with the help of foreign donors, gives them special attention. By law everyone is en-
 titled to health care, including children. Children begin school at the age of 6 and
 are required to complete 9 years, although the Government makes 11 years of edu-
 cation available at no cost. Higher education is also available at no cost on a com-
 petitive basis. Families with children receive token Government benefits. A World
 Bank study found that the majority of those living in poverty are families with mul-
 tiple children or single mothers.
 There does not appear to be a societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-A 1992 law mandated accessibility to transport, resi-
 dences, businesses, and offices for the disabled; however, facilities, including trans-
 port and office buildings, often are not accessible to them. The Government, facing
 a deteriorating economic situation, failed to budget sufficient funds to implement
 these laws. However, when the Government slashed subsidies for most sectors of so-
 ciety, most subsidies for the disabled remained in force.
 Religious Minorities.-Societal anti-Semitism exists, but it is not usually mani-
 fested openly. Senior Government officials, including the President, and the State
 media used coded anti-Semitism in their attacks on perceived opponents. At the
 time of former National Bank Chairwoman Tamara Vinnikova's arrest in January
 for alleged malfeasance (see Sections l.c. and I.d.), the state media made insinu-
 ations about a previous trip to Israel. In March the President and media highlighted
 journalist Aleksandr Stupnikov's Israeli citizenship when accusing him of tenden-
 tious reporting and expelling him from the country. President Lukashenko com-
 plained to the Russian Duma about Stupnikov's reporting, saying that the Russian
 television network NTV for which Stupnikov worked "did not find anything better
 than sending an Israeli citizen as its correspondent in Belarus." In addition, author-
 itative government officials and media cited "certain forces" (a term usually under-
 stood to be a reference to Jews) as being behind what the Government regarded as
 a provocation by Russian television network (ORT) managers. The largest share-
 holder of ORT is Jewish.
 On January 1, the weekend home of the editor of a Jewish newspaper was burned
 down and the following day unknown persons painted swastikas and other Nazi em-
 blems on the door of his apartment. It is unclear whether the house burning was
 an anti-Semitic act, an accident, or an act of revenge against the editor's son, who
 allegedly has ties to the Mafia.
 Albert Lavrenev (see Sections 1.c., and I.e.) was the victim of an unfair legal proc-
 ess. Based on all available evidence presented at his trials and gathered by human
 
 
 990
 rights monitors, it appears that Lavrenev's case was initiated as a result of his
 neighbors' anti-Semitism. The neighbors previously had harassed Lavrenev and his
 family with anti-Semitic remarks and, in searching for someone to blame for the
 murder of their mother, chose Lavrenev without credible evidence to support their
 accusation.
 A report by the Belarus League for Human Rights noted that individuals associ-
 ated with the deceased woman threatened the Lavrenevs, using anti-Semitic epi-
 thets. As a result of this harassment, the Lavrenevs sent their daughter to live with
 a relative out of fear that the neighbor would harm her. According to Lavrenev,
 local investigating officers used anti-Semitic epithets during his interrogation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution upholds the right of workers, ex-
 cept state security and military personnel, to form and join independent unions on
 a voluntary basis and to carry out actions in defense of worker rights, including the
 right to strike. However, these rights are not recognized in practice. The independ-
 ent trade union movement is stillin its infancy. The Belarusian Free Trade Union
 was established in 1991 and registered in 1992. Following the 1995 Minsk Metro
 workers strike, the President issued a decree suspending its activities. In 1996 the
 Free Trade Union leaders formed a new umnbrella organization, the Congress of
 Democratic Trade Unions (encompassing four leading independent unions), with
 over 20,000 members. The government has taken measures to suppress independent
 trade unions. For example, members of independent trade unions have leen ar-
 rested for distributing union literature, had material confiscated at the borders (see
 Section 2.a.), and have been pressured by their managers and state security services
 to resign from their jobs because of their trade union activities.
 For most of the year, the Government continued its illegal ban on the Free Trade
 Union (suspended in 1995 after the Minsk Metro Workers' strike) and refused to
 register the Congress of Democratic Trade Unions. In December, largely in response
 to mounting international attention to worker rights violations, the Government or-
 dered the Ministry of Justice to reregister the Free Trade Union and register the
 Congress of Democratic Trade Unions, whose August appeal to the Supreme Court
 to be registered had been denied. The Government also announced it was taking ac-
 tion to resond to the International Labor Organization's questions about the com-
 plaint made to the ILO in 1996 in which the Belarusian independent trade unions
 and the Interanal Confederation of Free Trade Unions accused the Government
 of arresting labor leaders, preventing strikes, and restricting freedom of association.
 Employees at state-run enterprises are discouraged from joining independent
 trade unions (see Section 2.b.). The Belarusian branch of the former Soviet Union's
 All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions--currently the Federation of Trade
 Unions of Belarus (FTUB)-is by far the largest trade union organization. This fed-
 eration of 5 million members has continued to disagree with the Government about
 some policies, but has not been willing to seriously challenge the regime. Workers
 are often automatically inducted into the FTUB, and their union dues are deducted
 from their wages. Independent labor leaders believe that the official trade unions'
 control over social functions usually performed by the State (such as pension funds)
 is an obstacle to the growth of true, independent trade unions.
 Unions may freely affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation dating from the
 Soviet era provides for the right to organize and bargain collectively. Since the econ-
 omy is still largely in the hands of the State, unions usually seek redress at the
 political level. Workers and independent unions have recourse to the court system.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1994 constitution prohibits
 forced labor, except in cases when the work or service to be performed is fixed by
 a court's decision or in accordance with the law on the state of emergency or martial
 law. The constitutional provision prohibiting forced or bonded labor applies to all
 citizens, although its application to children is not specified. With the possible ex-
 ception of juvenile prisoners, forced labor does not occur. (See Section 6.d.)
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 establishes 16 as the minimum age for employment of children. With the written
 consent of one parent (or legal guardian), a child of 14 years may conclude a labor
 contract. The Prosecutor General's Office reportedly enforces this law effectively.
 The constitutional provision prohibiting forced or bonded labor applies to all citi-
 zens, although its application to children is not specified (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The President's administration sets a mini-
 mum wage, which was raised once in response to inflation. As of October 1, the
 monthly minimum wage was less than $10 (200,000 Belarusian rubles). The mini-
 mum wage does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.

 The Constitution and Labor Code set a limit of 40 hours of work per week and pro-
 vide for at least one 24-hour rest period per week. Because of the difficult economic
 situation, an increasing number of workers find themselves working considerably
 less than 40 hours per week. Factories often require workers to take unpaid fur-
 loughs due to shortages of raw materials and energy, and to lack of demand for fac-
 tor output.
 The law establishes minimum conditions for workplace safety and worker health;
 however, these standards are often ignored. Workers at many heavy machinery
 plants do not wear even minimal safety gear, such as gloves, hard hats, or welding
 glasses. A State Labor Inspectorate exists but does not have the authority to enforce
 compliance, and violations are often ignored. There is no provision in the law that
 allows workers to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without risk-
 ing their jobs.
