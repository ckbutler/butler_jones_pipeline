 URUGUAY
 Uruguay is a constitutional republic with an elected president and a bicameral
 legislature. In 1994 former President. Julio Maria Sanguinetti won a narrow election
 victory. His 5-year term ends in March 2000. The judiciary is independent.
 The Interior Ministry administers the country's police departments and the prison
 system and is responsible for domestic security and public safety. The military is
 responsible for external security within the prison system. The- police at times com-
 mitted human rights abuses.
 The economy is a mixture of private and state enterprises and is heavily depend-
 ent on agricultural exports and agroindustry. The leading exports are meat, leather,
 and rice. The Government respects private property rights. The economy grew by
 5.1 percent in 1997, with estimated growth of 3 percent for 1998. Annual per capita
 income was about-$6,100 in 1997.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary generally provide effective means of dealing with individual instances
 of abuse. However, there were problems in some areas, principally instances of po-
 lice abuse and mistreatment of detainees, poor prison conditions, and delays in the
 justice system. Court cases sometimes last many years, resulting in lengthy
 *preverdict detention. Other problems include violence against women and societal
 discrimination against women and the black minority.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect- for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were-no-reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 In March the court of criminal appeals affirmed the 18-year-prison sentence of
 a police officer convicted of detaining and killing a woman in 1994. In May the court
 of appeals affirmed sentences of 8 and 6 years in prison for two police officers who
 shot and killed two suspects without provocation and then attempted to cover up
 their actions.
 In November the trial judge closed as unsolved the investigation into the death
 of Eugenio Berrios, whose body was discovered in 1995, after he was last seen alive
 in military custody in 1992. Berrios, a Chilean called to testify in Chile concerning
 the assassination of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier, reportedly
 entered Uruguay under protective military custody.
 The 1985 Amnesty Law applied to perpetrators of extrajudicial killings, torture,
 and other abuses during the 12 years of military rule from 1973 to 1985. However,
 some victims and relatives of victims had success using the civilian courts to seek
 redress. In October a trial judge ordered the Government to pay a total of $1.3 mil-
 lion in compensation to the families of three torture victims who died in custody and
 to nine others who were tortured while in custody. In November the same judge or-
 dered the Government to pay $100,0Q0 in damages to a woman whose father was
 tortured and killed by the Government. The Government appealed both court deci-
 sions.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Calls for investigations into past disappearances continued. In May, as in prior
 years, thousands of persons marched in memory of the 159 Uruguayans who dis-
 appeared during the rule of the dictatorship (115 in Argentina, 36 in Uruguay, 6
 in Chile, and 2 in Paraguay). Using powers granted by the 1985 Amnesty Law, the
 executive branch appealed and won reversal of a judicial action brought by a Sen-
 ator (whose father was killed in Argentina in 1976) requesting an investigation of
 
 
 785
 the alleged removal of bodies from a military site, on the grounds that the law,
 which was confirmed by a 1989 plebiscite, prohibits such an inquiry.
 The Government also continued to disregard a 1992 ruling of the Inter-American
 Commission on Human Rights, reaffirmed in October 1997, which concluded that
 the 1985 Amnesty Law was incompatible with the American Convention on Human
 Rights and which recommended that the Government investigate the disappear-
 ances and compensate the families of the victims. Although the Amnesty Law
 obliges the executive branch to investigate the cases of citizens who were detained
 and then disappeared under the military regime, all three administrations since the
 return to democracy have consistently refused to open official investigations into
 their fate. The only exception was a cursory, nonpublic inquiry conducted by a mili-
 tary prosecutor that revealed nothing.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits brutal treatment of prisoners, but the police continued
 at times to commit abuses. On occasion, such abuse resulted in forced confessions
 (see Section 1.d.).
 .. The judicial and parliamentary branches of government are responsible for inves-
 tigating specific allegations of abuse. An internal police investigative unit receives
 complaints from any person concerning possible noncriminal police abuse of power,
 but it is understaffed and can issue only recommendations for disciplinary action.
 While the courts seldom convicted and punished law enforcement officials for such
 abuse in the past, such prosecutions are occurring more frequently. During the year,
 courts affirmed the sentences of three police officers convicted of extrajudicial
 killings (see Section l.a.).
 Police officers charged with less serious crimes may continue on active duty; those
 charged with more serious crimes are separated from active service until a court re-
 solves their cases. A Ministry of Interior study reported that 179 police officers had
 been investigated or convicted by a court, and that 117 of these cases were directly
 linked to the exercise of their jobs. The 1995 Public Security Law requires a propor-
 tional use of force by the police and the use of weapons only as a last resort, in
 accordance with United Nations codes regarding the use of force.
 Some torture victims and relatives of victims had success using the civilian courts
 to seek redress. In October a trial judge ordered the Government to pay compensa-
 tion to the families of three torture victims who died in custody and to nine others
 who were tortured while in custody. The same judge awarded compensation to an-
 other relative of a torture victim in November (see Section l.a.).
 Conditions in prisons and juvenile detention facilities for the roughly 3,000 pris-
 oners remain poor but not life threatening. In 1997 a legislative human rights com-
 mission presented a report that criticized the "excessive use of force and abuse of
 authority" by prison guards and officials, and stated that sanitation and health
 standards in the prison system were "unacceptable." This report reflects the work
 of a previous commission that in 1996 published a report to the government citing
 overcrowding, lack of staff training, corruption, and physical violence as problems.
 A new facility with a capacity of 400 prisoners opened in December 1997, and pris-
 oners were transferred to it.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors, although a re-
 quirement to route all such requests through the Ministry of Interior causes delays.
 d.  rbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exle.-The Constitution requires the police to
 have a written warrant issued by a judge before making an arrest. The only excep-
 tion is when the police apprehend the accused during commission of a crime. The
 Constitution also provides the accused with the right to a judicial determination of
 the legality of detention and requires that the detaining authority explain the legal
 grounds for the detention. Police may hold a detainee incommunicado for 24 hours
 before presenting the case to a judge, at which time the detainee has the right to
 counsel. It is during this 24-hour period that police sometimes abuse prisoners, occa-
 sionally resulting in forced confessions.
 A 1980 law stipulates that police confessions obtained before a prisoner appears
 before a judge and attorney (without the police present) have no validity. Further,
 should a prisoner claim that he has been mistreated, by law the judge must inves-
 tigate the charge.
 If the detainee cannot afford a lawyer, the courts appoint a public defender. If the
 crime carries a penalty of at least 2 years in prison, the accused person is confined
 during the judge's investigation of the charges unless the authorities agree to re-
 lease the person on bail. This seldom happens. As a result, approximately 90 per-
 cent of all persons incarcerated are awaiting a final decision in their case. Because
 of the slowness of the judicial process, the length of time prisoners spend in jail be-
 fore the judge issues a verdict may exceed the maximum sentence for their crime.

 The uncertainty as to how long one will be imprisoned is a factor creating tension
 within the country's prisons.   -     _
 In December 1997, the legislature approved a bill to reform and modernize the
 Criminal Code. Among its provisions, the new law provides for more oral argument
 by prosecution and defense attorneys, and less investigative responsibility for
 judges, which is expected to accelerate the pace-of criminal trials. The law was to
 take effect in June, but was delayed until at least February 1999, due to a lack of
 resources to implement the new system.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The Supreme Court heads the judiciary system and supervises the work of the
 lower courts. A parallel military court system operates under a Military Justice
 Code. Two military justices sit on the Supreme Court but participate only in cases
 involving the military. Military justice applies to civilians only during a state of war
 or insurrection.
 Trial prceedings usually are based on written arguments to the judge, which are
 not made public routinely. Only the prosecutor and defense attorney have access to
 all documents that form part of the written record. The courts introduced oral argu-
 ment in 1990, but individual judges use it at their option. Most judges choose to
 retain the written method, a major factor slowing the judicial process. There is no-
 legal provision against self-incrimination, and judges may compel defendants to an-
 swer any question they pose. The defense attorney or prosecutor may appeal convic-
 tions to a higher court, which may acquit the person of the crime, confnm the con-
 viction, or reduce or increase the sentence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but the authorities may abridge these rights if persons are deemed
 to be inciting violence or "insulting the nation."
 All elements of the political spec   freely express their viewpoints in both print
 and broadcast media. Montevideo alone has 8 daily newspapers and 6 important
 weeklies; there are also approximately 100 other weekly and a few daily newspapers
 throughout the country. Montevideo has one government-affiliated and three com-
 mercial television stations. Ther  e about 110 radio stations and 20 television sta-
 tions in the country.
 A 1989 law stipulates that expression and communication of thoughts and opin-
 ions are free, within the limits contained in the Constitution, and it outlines meth-
 ods of responding to "inexact or aggravating information." The law calls for 3
 months' to 2 years' imprisonment for "knowingly divulging false news that causes
 a grave disturbance to the public peace or a grave prejudice to economic interests
 of the State" or for "insulting the nation, the State, or their powers." The authorities
 use this law intermittently to set and enforce certain limits on freedom of the press.
 In May an administrative court struck down a 1996 decree that required the Gov-
 erhnent's prior authorization for the duty free import- of newsprint--characterized
 by the Inter-American Press Association as a "serious threat to the preservation of
 freedom of the press"-after being challenged by a group of newspapers.
 The national univesity is autonomous, and the authorities generally respect aca-
 demic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for fe ree   o eligion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The Government grants refugee status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Conven-
 tion Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1961 Protocol. The Government
 grants asylum ony for political crimes as set forth in the 1928 Treaty of Havana,
 the 1889 Treaty of Montevideo, and the 1954 Caracas Convention. The Government
 cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 andother humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The question of the pro-
 vision of first asylum arose in October when a Cuban tourist requested asylum. At
 year's end, the Government was considering his request.
 
 
 There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared
 persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens wi* h the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Uruguay is a multiparty democracy
 with mandatory voting for those 18 years of age or older, and there are no restric-
 tions regarding race, sex, religion, or economic status. The Colorado party, the Na-
 tional (Blanco) party, the Broad Front coalition, and the New Space party are the
 four major political groupings.
 Women and blacks face impediments to high-level participation in politics and
 employment in government. Only 1 of 12 cabinet ministers is a woman. In the legis-
 lature, 2 of 30 Senators and 9 of 99 Deputies are women. There are no minority
 representatives or cabinet officials.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of domestic and international human rights groups operate without
 government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights
 cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and the law prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 or disability. Despite these provisions, discrimination against some groups exists.
 Women.-Violence against women continues to be a serious problem. In a Novem-
 ber 1997 poll of 545 urban and suburban households, 47 percent of respondents re-
 ported physical or psychological abuse from their partners, with 23 percent report-
 ing severe abuse. There were more than 1,185 formal complaints of violent acts
 against women, reflecting both an increased public awareness of the problem as well
 as a changing attitude among women. The law provides for sentences of 6 months
 to 2 years in prison for a person found guilty of committing an act of violence or
 of making continuing threats to cause bodily inj  to persons related emotionally
 or legally to the perpetrator. The Montevideo cityh  has a hot line for victims of
 violence.
 The Government has established an office of assistance for victims of domestic vi-
 olence that trains police how to receive complaints of violence against women. A new
 directorate within the Ministry of Interior instituted a public awareness campaign
 about domestic violence and founded community assistance centers where abuse vic-
 tims receive information and referrals to government and private organizations in
 their area that aid abused women. Both the Ministry of Interior and nongovern-
 mental organizations operate shelters in which abused women and their families
 can seek temporary refuge.
 Women enjoy equality under the law but face discrimination stemming from tradi-
 tional attitudes and practices. The work force exhibits segregation by gender.
 Women, who make up almost one-half the work force, tend to be concentrated in
 lower paying jobs. Women's salaries average two-thirds those of men; 10 years ear-
 lier, this figure was 57 percent. Two-thirds of the students who entered the univer-
 sity system in 1997 were women. Women often pursue professional careers but are
 underrepresented in traditionally male-dominated professions. In February 1997,
 the Government approved officiaregulations to implement a 1989 law for equality
 in the workplace that had previously gone unenforced. In 1997 the Air Force Acad-
 emy became the first armed services academy to admit women and has seven female
 students. The Army Military Academy began admitting women in February and has
 five women enrolled. The Liceo Militar, a military-run secondary school that pre-
 p ares officer-candidates for all the services, admitted 50 women in 1998, for a total
 female enrollment of 130.
 A small institute in the Ministry of Education coordinates government programs
 for women. There are a number of active women's rights groups, and many of their
 activities remained centered on followup to the platform of action of the 1995 U.N.
 Conference on Women.
 In October Uruguay hosted the hemispheric women's conference "Vital Voices of
 the Americas: Women in Democracy."
 Children.-The Government generally is committed to protecting children's rights
 and welfare. An institute in the Ministry of Interior oversees implementation of the
 Governmenfs programs for children but receives only limited funding for programs.
 The Government regards the education and health of children as a top priority and
 
 
 believes it should do more to ensure free. education and proper health care for all
 children. An estimated 40 percent of children-under the age of 5 live in the poorest
 20 percent of homes. The Government is attempting to extend proper health care
 and education to them with the help of the United Nations Children's Fund. The
 Government provides free, compulsory primary education, and 95 percent of chil-
 dren complete this program. Girls and boys are treated similarly.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children. Minors under the age of 18 are
 not subject to criminal trial, but receive special treatment with special judges and,
 when sentenced, stay in institutions run by the National Institute for Minors
 (INAME) for the period determined by the judge. The Government currently houses
 all its problem minors in INAME-run institutions. The most controversial aspect of
 the 1995 Public Security Law would allow the Government to put minors with a
 record of violent crimes in adult prisons if INAME has no room in its own institu-
 tions. Even though the law stipulates that minors would occupy separate facilities
 within the prisons, human rights groups adamantly oppose this provision. As a re-
 sult, INAME has decided that it will not send minors to adult prisons.
 People With Disabilities.-The legislature passed a law covering the rights of the
 disabled in 1989. A national disabilities commission oversees implementation of the
 law. -Although the law mandates accessibility only to new buildings or public serv-
 ices for people with disabilities, the Government is providing access to a number of
 existing buildings. The law reserves 4 percent of public sector jobs for the disabled.
 There is no governmental dscrimination against disabled persons in employment,
 education, or in the provision of other' state services. The country has a generally
 excellent mental health system and an interest in the rights of people with mental
 disabilities.
 NationalRacialEthnic Minorities.-The country's black minority, 5.9 percent of
 the population, continues to face societal discrimination. A government study con-
 ducted in 1996-97 and published in March found that the unemployment rate for
 blacks was 1.5 times the rate for whites, and that blacks earn on average only 60
 percent of what whites earn. An earlier report (1993) put the number of black uni-
 versity graduates at 65, and black professionals at fewer than 50. Blacks are prac-
 tically unrepresented in the bureaucratic, political, and academic sectors of society.
 They lack the social and political connections necessary for entry into these groups.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution states that laws should promote
 the organization of trade unions and the creation of arbitration bodies. In spite of
 this provision, there is almost no legislation concerning union activities. Unions  tra-
 ditionally organize and operate free of government regulation. Civil servants, em-
 ployees of state-run entieserprise wokers may join unions. An
 estimated 12 percent of the work force is unionized. Labor unions are independent
 of political party control but traditionally have associated more closely with the
 Broad Front, the leftist political coalition.
 The Constitution provides workers with the right to strike, and there were numer-
 ous strikes during the year. The Government may legally compel workers to work
 during a strike if they perform an essential service which, if interrupted, "could
 cause argave pu        or risk, provoking suffering to part or all of the socity."
 There are mechanisms for resolving workers' complaints against employers, but
 unions complain that these mechanisms are sometimes applied arbitrarily. The law
 generally prohibits discriminatory acts by employers, including arbitrary dismissals
 or union activity. Unions maintain that organizers are dismissed for fabricated rea-
 sons, thus avoiding penalty under the law.
 There are no restrictions on the right of unions to form confederations or to afli-
 ate with international trade union groups; however, the one national confederation
 has chosen not to affiliate officially with any of the world federations. Some individ-
 ual unions are affiliated with international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colkctively.-Collective bargaining between
 companies andhtheir unions determines a number of private sector salaries. The ex-
 ecutive branch, acting independently, determines public sector salaries. There are
 no laws prohibiting antiunion discrimination, but a 1993 executive decree estab-
 lished fines for employers engaging in antiunion activities. The law does not require
 employers to reinstate workers fired for union activities. However, in cases of legal
 challenges by union activists, courts tend to impose indemnization levels that are
 higher than those normally paid to dismissed workers.
 Union members continued to fie claims of discrimination with the Ministry of
 Labor, which has a labor commission that investigatesall claims. In some of the
 cases, employers agreed to reinstate workers, but other cases remained unresolved
 at year's end .
 
 
 All labor legislation fully covers workers employed in special export zones. There
 are no unions in any of these zones, but the few workers in these zones are not in
 traditionally organizable occupations. Because of the protected status given many of
 the companies in the free zones and the lack of union presence, occasionally compa-
 nies will implement labor practices in violation of the law.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and it is not known to occur. The law prohibits forced or bond-
 ed labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Child
 Labor Code protects children; the Ministry of Labor and Social Security is respon-
 sible for enforcing the laws. Illegal child labor is not a major problem. The law pro-
 hibits forced or bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibi-
 tion effectively (see Section 6.c.). A total of 95 percent of children complete primary
 school education, which is compulsory and free of charge. By law children under 15
 years of age are not allowed to work unless granted a special permit; this is en-
 forced in practice. Children under the age of 18 may not perform dangerous,
 fatiguing, or night work. Controls over salaries and hours for children are more
 strict than those for adults. Children over the age of 16 may sue in court for pay-
 ment of wages, and children have the legal right to dispose of their own income.
 However, some children work as street vendors in the expanding informal sector or
 in the agrarian sector, which generally are regulated less strictly and where pay is
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor effectively enforces a
 legislated minimum monthy wage which is in effect in both the public and private
 sectors. The Ministry adjusts the minimum wage whenever it adjusts public sector
 wages. The minimum wage, which was about $94 (990 pesos) per month in October,
 functions more as an index for calculating wage rates than as a true measure of
 minimum subsistence levels, and it would not provide a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family.
 The standard workweek is 48 hours in industry and 44 hours in commerce, with
 a 36-hour break each week. The law stipulates that industrial workers receive over-
 time compensation for work in excess of 48 hours and that workers are entitled to
 20 days of paid vacation after a year of employment.
 The law protects foreign workers and does not discriminate against them. How-
 ever, in order to receive official protection, the companies that employ foreign work-
 ers must report them as employees. Many workers---both Iiative and foreign-work
 off the books and thus forfeit certain legal protection.
 The Ministry of Labor and Social Security enforces legislation regulating health
 and safety conditions in a generally effective manner. However, some of the regula-
 tions cover urban industrial workers more adequately than rural and agricultural
 workers. Workers have the right to remove themselves from what they consider has-
 ardous or dangerous conditions.
